The research centers on the theme of symbolic powers, an active topic of research with connections to virtually all aspects of commutative algebra. This project aims to resolve two questions, on comparing the geometric notion of symbolic powers with the algebraic notion of natural powers, and on the application of the differential algebraic notion of p-derivations to commutative algebra. The investigator will direct undergraduate research experiences and organize a graduate workshop in commutative algebra.<br/><br/>The unifying theme of this project is the study of symbolic powers of ideals. The research focuses primarily on two questions: the containment problem and applications of p-derivations to commutative algebra. While ideals in a polynomial ring correspond to the polynomials that vanish on a certain variety in affine space, their symbolic powers consist of the polynomials that vanish to a certain order on the given variety. This natural geometric notion has an algebraic description coming from the theory of primary decomposition, an ideal-theoretic version of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This is an old, rich, and ubiquitous topic, yet there is an abundance of questions about symbolic powers that are both easy to phrase and very difficult to solve. The containment problem attempts to compare symbolic powers, a natural geometric notion, with ordinary powers, a natural algebraic notion. This relates to other interesting questions, such as determining the minimal degrees of polynomials vanishing on a given variety. Another part of the project is to discover new connections between p-derivations and commutative algebra, with an eye towards a new singularity theory in mixed characteristic that combines p-derivations with differential operators in the spirit of the theory of F-singularities and its connections to D-modules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the heart of a wide array of scientific endeavors is the ubiquitous need to solve polynomial equations. A complementary goal is to find polynomial equations, for example, an equation whose graph passes through a given set of data points. This procedure, termed polynomial interpolation, is a fundamental challenge at the interface of data science, numerical analysis, and algebraic geometry. The investigator will bring methods from commutative and computational algebra to bear on aspects of a higher order version of polynomial interpolation. For example, the situation when the data points exhibit intrinsic symmetry will be elucidated. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the interactions between this topic and emerging techniques in homological algebra will be pursued. The broader impact of this fundamental research lies in the engagement and training of graduate students, software development, and the recruitment, retention, and professional development of junior mathematicians. <br/><br/>The research project focuses on two topics which generate current excitement: polynomial interpolation and the algebraic Lefschetz properties. The former theme will be analyzed through the lens of symbolic power ideals, which can be thought of as sets of polynomials that vanish to a certain order on a given algebraic variety. The latter theme constitutes an algebraic abstraction of the Hard Lefschetz Theorem with spectacular applications to several areas of mathematics. The interrelations between these two topics will be thoroughly explored and exploited. One particular direction of investigation is on applications of the algebraic Lefschetz properties to homological algebra, specifically to graded free resolutions. Other directions include applications to the containment problem relating the ordinary and symbolic topologies defined by an ideal. Aspects of this work exhibit relationships to the theory of reflection groups, hyperplane arrangements, convex geometry, and differential graded algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, it has many applications to chemistry and physics. Representations are mappings of complicated algebraic objects (such as groups, rings, Lie algebras, and Lie superalgebras) to an array of numbers (matrices). These realizations by matrices encode important data that can yield deep insights into these complicated algebraic objects. In recent years, a useful approach has been to understand the entire collection of representations of an object. Representations for a certain algebraic object often form a tensor triangulated category. Techniques from homological algebra can be used to build bridges  between tensor triangulated categories and geometric objects. Uncovering this hidden geometry often leads to new insights about the algebraic object and its representations. This project includes research and training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in algebra and representation theory. <br/><br/>In this project the PI will develop new methods to understand tensor structures in monoidal tensor categories. This will entail the development of monoidal triangular geometry and explicit computations of Balmer spectra. The PI will also introduce new geometric and topological methods to provide concrete calculations of cohomology for algebraic/finite groups, Lie superalgebras, quantum groups, and Frobenius kernels. The development of the cohomology theory was an important tool to resolving 30 year old problems that deal with tilting modules in connection with filtrations of representations of algebraic groups. The PI will study representations of Lie superalgebras via the application of super geometry to construct representations and to compute higher sheaf cohomology. The PI will develop a new Lie theory that entails the use of detecting and parabolic subalgebras, in addition to, a nilpotent cone to formulate a geometric setting in order to compute characters for irreducible representations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, starting with quantum mechanics, a great number of models emerged that led to mathematical problems involving variables that no longer commute. Noncommutative Algebra is one of the areas of mathematics that studies those structures. The research projects that are funded by this award investigate the interrelations between the commutative and noncommutative settings, using a branch of geometry called Poisson geometry. Three other approaches are used to study the noncommutative setting:  a combinatorial approach based on intricate internal transformations of the objects, called cluster mutations;  an algebraic approach that investigates intrinsically defined structures called Calabi-Yau categories; and  a noncommutative geometric approach using quantum versions of symmetric spaces. The four approaches are simultaneously used to carry out a detailed study of the properties and symmetries of noncommutative objects. Further, the noncommutative objects are shown to exhibit various forms of rigidity. This is used to settle problems in algebra, geometry, combinators, and dynamical systems that were previously posed without any reference to the noncommutative setting. These research activities will be used as the foundation for the training of graduate and undergraduate students and for mentoring mathematics postdocs.<br/><br/>The research projects funded under this awaard investigate problems in noncommutative algebra, quantum symmetric spaces, and noncommutative projective algebraic geometry and the relations of these problems to Poisson geometry, combinatorics, triangulated categories, and integrable systems. On the one hand, the program aims at using methods from the latter areas to describe the structure and representations of quantum cluster algebras at roots of unity, the Drinfeld doubles of Nichols algebras, the algebras that appear in the theory of quantum symmetric pairs, and the algebras that describe noncommutative projective spaces. In the opposite direction, previously posed problems in the latter areas are converted to problems for noncommutative algebras and their representation categories, and are then resolved within that setting. One of the directions of this program is the construction of universal K-matrices on the symmetric subalgebras of the Drinfeld doubles of Nichols algebras, and using this to study the ring theoretic properties of Nichols algebras. Another direction aims at the classification of irreducible representations of Nichols algebras of diagonal type using Poisson orders and noncommutative discriminants. A third direction develops a general setting for the study of finite dimensional representations of quantum cluster algebras at root of unity using Poisson geometry and Cayley-Hamilton algebras. Three additional directions investigate the geometry of noncommutative projective spaces modeled by higher dimensional elliptic algebras, the structure of 2-Calabi-Yau categories via categorical C-vectors and dynamical systems, and the construction of integral quantum cluster algebra structures on the canonical forms of quantized coordinate rings of varieties in theory of Lie groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main foci of this project are some of the most fundamental and universal examples of groups: symmetric groups, which arise as symmetries of finite sets, and general linear groups, which arise as symmetries of finite-dimensional vector spaces. Representation theory studies groups via their actions on other mathematical objects, such as vector spaces. Very informally, representations of a group are snap-shots of the group taken from different directions. In the past few years, the idea of categorification has become very important and has led to the development of higher representation theory. This involves actions of groups on higher mathematical structures called categories, utilizing not only the relations between these structures (functors) but also relations between the relations (natural transformations). In particular, Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier (KLR) algebras encode higher symmetries underlying a large part of representation theory, including classical objects like symmetric and general linear groups. The goal of this project is to further build the theory of these and other algebras and apply it to improve our understanding of the classical objects of group theory. The research in this project has potential future broader impacts in computer science and theoretical physics. More directly this award will have important educational impact through the training of graduate students and mentoring young researchers in this area. <br/> <br/>In more detail, this project is concerned with several diverse projects in representation theory of Lie algebras, finite groups, and related objects such as Hecke algebras, quantum groups, Schur algebras and KLR algebras. Our perspective draws on recent advances in higher representation theory, namely categorification, with various diagrammatically defined monoidal categories and 2-categories playing a prominent role. On the other hand, many applications are to classical problems in representation theory such as block theory of finite groups and Schur algebras as well as structure theory of finite groups. We will study local description of blocks of Schur algebras up to derived equivalence, cuspidal algebras for KLR algebras, thick Heisenberg categorification, super Kac-Moody 2-categories and applications to blocks of double covers of symmetric groups, homological properties of KLR algebras, decomposition numbers, and irreducible restrictions from quasi-simple groups to subgroups.

One focus in this project is Moduli theory, which studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often manifested as an algebraic variety in its own right, called a moduli space.

By looking for the common features shared by all such matrix realizations at once, mathematicians have discovered some higher structures that encode all possible symmetries between symmetries. These new structures, ""monoidal categories,"" can often be realized in purely graphical terms. In the last few years, this point of view has revealed some quite unexpected connections between very different parts of mathematics and physics. One example that plays a role in this project is the so-called Heisenberg category, which arose originally in algebra from thinking about symmetries between representations of the finite symmetric groups, but which is also connected to the infinite-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra, which has its origins in quantum mechanics. The funding of this project will lead to new understanding of classical problems in representation theory by taking advantage of this graphical approach, with potential applications both inside and outside of mathematics, including to finite group theory, combinatorics, Lie theory, knot theory, and theoretical physics. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, the project will study the representation theory of algebraic groups, quantum groups and Lie superalgebras by exploiting some remarkable new pivotal monoidal categories which are defined by generators and relations. These include various Heisenberg categories whose definition is of a graphical nature. These monoidal categories act on many of the classically important categories in representation theory, leading to a unified general framework which reveals unexpected connections between different theories. The project will focus on five specific projects: Okounkov-Vershik approach to representations of the partition category; quasi-hereditary coalgebras and blocks of Deligne categories; the rational web category and thickened Heisenberg categorification; odd Heisenberg and super Kac-Moody 2-categories; Modular shifted Yangians and flag algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups may be understood as collections of symmetries and the study of group theory was motivated by the desire to understand the symmetry of an object, whether it be in nature, art, communication networks, or any other place that symmetry might play a role. Group theory has applications in physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences. In recent years, research in group theory has had a significant impact on technological advances, such as in cryptography and coding theory. Representation theory is a tool used to better understand the structure of a group and the symmetries it represents. Representations provide a way to view an abstract group as a group of matrices, whose structure is often easier to understand. This project focuses on a number of problems which seek to relate the representation theory of a finite group to the structure and representations of certain so-called local subgroups, which reflect numerical information encoded by the group. Several problems to be studied in the project involve computations and other components that are well-suited for involving undergraduate students and introducing them to group theory and mathematical research. A key part of the investigator's activities under the project will be to recruit, encourage, and mentor students to pursue undergraduate research projects.<br/><br/>More specifically, the problems under consideration in this project require understanding the irreducible characters of finite groups of Lie type, and involve relating the character theory of a group to the characters of its local subgroups, through a collection of conjectures known as local-global conjectures. The local-global philosophy centers around the idea that critical information about the representation theory of a finite group can be deduced from knowledge of the representation theory of its local subgroups. One of the first of these local-global conjectures, and currently one of the main motivations for problems in the area, is known as the McKay conjecture. Although heavily studied, this conjecture is still somewhat of a mystery to group theorists. In pursuit of a better understanding of why local subgroups seem to provide so much information about the character theory of the group itself, several stronger forms of the McKay conjecture have been proposed, and this project considers those involving the role of Galois automorphisms (the McKay-Navarro conjecture), block theory (the Alperin-McKay conjecture), and the combination of the two (the Alperin-McKay-Navarro conjecture).  Hence, several of the questions in the project aim to further the study of the blocks of groups of Lie type and their local subgroups, as well as the action of Galois automorphisms on these objects. Since the effect of various group actions on parametrizations of these characters is an especially problematic component in a number of local-global conjectures and other important problems regarding representations of groups of Lie type, the research in this project will have applications to other problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The solutions to such systems give rise to algebraic varieties, which are fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry.  Algebraic topology is the study of systematically attaching algebraic invariants (e.g., numbers or abstract algebraic structures) to spaces; these invariants should not depend on the way a space is pulled or twisted without tearing it.  When algebraic varieties have a spatial structure, it is natural to try to analyze them using the tools of algebraic topology.  However, when algebraic varieties do not have an obvious spatial structure, e.g., if they arise in arithmetic settings, then a new approach is required.  The focus of this project is to analyze algebraic invariants of algebraic varieties using the framework of the Morel-Voevodsky A^1-homotopy theory.  This theory allows one to apply the full power of techniques of algebraic topology to objects of interest in algebraic geometry ? one may treat spaces having complicated arithmetic structure, but a priori limited geometric structure, in essentially the same way as more classical spaces.  The current project seeks to analyze certain classical algebraic and arithmetic questions using these new techniques and to provide a better understanding of specific systems of algebraic equations, which is fundamental to many areas of mathematics. <br/> <br/>More specifically, the PI will study problems in linear algebra over commutative unital rings, for example, the theory of projective modules and decompositions of matrices.  These structures lie in the domain of algebraic K-theory and are related to topological and arithmetic questions by means of Morel-Voeovdsky A^1-homotopy theory.  Among others, the PI will investigate the following concrete (and classical) question: given a complex algebraic variety, which topological vector bundles admit algebraic structures?  By their very nature, such problems draw together several branches of mathematics and thus illustrate the fundamental unity of the subject.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Arguably, in each area, the mathematical tools that capture symmetry have an underlying structure that is algebraic; structures that are known as a bialgebra, a Hopf algebra, or a Hopf-type algebra. Nowadays, connections between these settings are examined through the lens of category theory that allows for the use of special structures known as monoidal categories, which have numerous applications including quantum information, quantum field theory and string theory. The main goal of the project is to study symmetries of algebra objects within monoidal categories, especially co/representation categories of Hopf-type algebras. This project will fund undergraduate research and the PI will continue their advocacy work for members of underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/>Given an object X, a symmetry of X is a property-preserving transformation from X to itself, and the collection of invertible symmetries of X forms a group: the automorphism group of X. Since then, generalizations of groups have been introduced to capture the symmetries of not only objects, but also of function algebras of objects that cannot be observed (e.g., objects in quantum physics). This move from ?classical symmetry? to ?quantum symmetry? has its origins in quantum mechanics, and arises in active research areas such as conformal field theory, low-dimensional topology, and operator algebras. In examining the various settings of symmetry of algebras beyond the framework of ""classical symmetry"", comprised of groups actions on commutative algebras, the PI will continue their work in ""quantum symmetry"" involving co/actions of bialgebras, or of Hopf algebras, on noncommutative algebras with a trivial base.

Moreover, it has proved applicable in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory, and robotics. A central problem in algebraic geometry is the classification of all geometric objects. In turn, an important part of classification theory is the theory of moduli. The latter's core idea is that one not only wants to understand these objects, but also understand the way they can be deformed. Moduli spaces play an important role in theoretical physics: studying curves on moduli spaces provides information on how an object is moving in space-time.

Algebraic geometry studies the geometry of spaces defined by polynomial equations. In addition to being one of the most ancient subjects in mathematics, algebraic geometry is also at the forefront of research in modern mathematics. Its abstract foundations are vital in the study of modern number theory, algebraic topology, representation theory, and combinatorics. At the same time, it provides powerful tools in applied mathematics, with applications including cryptography, theory of computation, convex optimization, computer graphics, statistics, and machine learning. This project aims to study one of the most fundamental questions in algebraic geometry, namely classifying algebraic varieties. A moduli space is itself an algebraic variety whose points are in one-to-one correspondence with the algebraic varieties that are being classified. Moduli spaces provide us with rich information about the geometric objects being classified and moreover have deep applications in numerous other fields of mathematics, both pure and applied. The research objectives are twofold: to develop abstract foundational tools in moduli theory and then apply these tools to study specific moduli spaces. This project will also involve the training of graduate students in moduli theory research.<br/><br/>The investigator has developed a new approach to construct projective moduli spaces of objects with positive dimensional automorphism groups. While the moduli space of stable curves classifies objects with finite automorphism groups, there are many other moduli spaces of interest that do not share this feature. Examples include the moduli of vector bundles or sheaves, the moduli of Bridgeland semistable complexes, and the moduli of K-semistable varieties. Recent developments have provided necessary and sufficient conditions for an algebraic stack to admit a good moduli space in characteristic 0. This result has already been applied to construct new projective moduli spaces of Bridgeland semistable objects and K-semistable Fano varieties. This approach rests on local structure theorems for algebraic stacks which, at the moment, are limited to characteristic 0. This project aims to extend these results to positive and mixed characteristics.

In the last few decades, this conversation has led to a fruitful exchange centered on the role of higher algebra (such as category theory and homotopical algebra) in quantum field theory (QFT). It has transformed and enlarged our view of QFT, and thus it plays an active role not only in the farther reaches of particle theory, but also in the concrete discoveries of condensed matter physics, notably in topological states and phases of matter. A recent innovation from this exchange is factorization algebras, which appear naturally in physics as the observables of field theories (both classical and quantum) but originally appeared in mathematics. This project explores the power of this tool  in the setting of 4-dimensional gauge theories. To pursue goals of this research, the Principal Investigator will collaborate with both mathematicians and physicists. This kind of interdisciplinary effort is an inspiring and motivating aspect of this area of research,  but effective communication is often difficult because, despite the long-running relationship of mathematics and physics, each community has its own prerogatives and modes of discourse. A key component of this project is thus to offer chances for researchers at all levels to become fluent in speaking to both disciplines and, moreover, to build direct personal bridges. At the graduate and postdoctoral level, the project will run annual summer schools for both mathematicians and theoretical physicists, focused on topics of mutual interest. In addition, each academic year, it will produce high-quality, online masterclasses by experts about such topics, with lecture notes and exercises. Finally, the project will support summer research for undergraduates, tackling problems between mathematics and physics,  from the University of Massachusetts and nearby Five Colleges.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project orbits around two foci. The first is the study of holomorphic theories on complex surfaces, particularly those related to moduli of holomorphic G-bundles.  The PI will pursue analogs of relationships between affine Lie algebras, moduli of bundles, and chiral CFT, which involve holomorphic theories on Riemann surfaces.  The long-term target is a holomorphic version of Seiberg duality (arising from N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories), which bears natural analogies to mirror symmetry. This first project uses a toolkit, developed by the PI with collaborators, for constructing BV quantization of holomorphic field theories and then analyzing their factorization algebras of observables. The second focus involves topological theories on manifolds with boundaries and corners, where the long-term target is a rigorous demonstration of the Frenkel-Gaiotto conjecture about how vertex algebras and ribbon categories arise from the Kapustin-Witten gauge theories, which play a key role in the physical approach to the geometric Langlands correspondence. This second project will approach the conjecture using both global methods (by developing, via derived algebraic geometry, the AKSZ procedure with manifolds with boundaries and corners, and thence a higher categorical deformation quantization) and perturbative methods (building upon an extension of the BV/factorization package for field theories on manifolds with boundary, which yields stratified factorization algebras of observables).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The general principle of the research is that certain algebraic problems can be reinterpreted as geometric problems in a higher dimension: for example, paths on a certain curve determine certain ?products? of arithmetically interesting numbers. The research of the PI aims to uncover intricate but explicit relationships of this sort with the broad aim of providing a window through which well-known conjectures and statements of arithmetic may be seen in a new light. Graduate students supported by the award will receive training to contribute towards the research.<br/><br/>The research supported by this award concerns analogues of a partly conjectural relationship between modular symbols and Steinberg symbols of cyclotomic units.

The primary focus of the award is the extension of the framework and known results to higher-dimensional algebraic groups and other global fields. In particular, the PI plans to significantly generalize a motivic construction of the explicit map in the original conjecture and to analyze Galois representations that should give the inverse maps in cases of arithmetic interest.

A basic question is ""What do the frequencies of these waves tell us about their interference and vice versa?"". The interference of the waves has to do with the magnitude of their superposition, and the concentration of the interference can be made large by choosing the frequencies according to a strict pattern. One of the questions pursued by the PI is the converse: are these patterns necessary to achieve a very concentrated superposition. This is called the Inverse Littlewood Problem. The second question under investigation is an uncertainty principle. Suppose we have two families of waves that can be used to decompose a signal, and these two families are very incompatible. This incompatibility means we expect that a simple wave from one family looks much more complicated as a superposition from the second. A specific instance of this is whether a multiplicative character (a very simple wave in one family) can be decomposed as an additive convolution (a fairly simple superposition in another family). This is called Sarkozy's Problem.<br/><br/>There is a long history of comparing the distribution and arithmetic structure of sequences in number theory. Classically, the connection is observed by way of the Fourier transform. Towards a better understanding of this phenomenon, the PI plans to build upon recent results that relate the dimension of a finite subset of a lattice to estimates on the L^1-norm of its associated Fourier series. This area of investigation began with a conjecture of Littlewood on how small the L^1 -norm of the Fourier transform of a finite set of integers could be. The problem was resolved independently by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s. Recently, questions have turned to classifying the extremizers in this problem, and the PI has recently proved that they must be, in an appropriate sense, low-dimensional. In this project he will develop the method further, by weakening hypotheses and applying these results to problems in arithmetic reliant the L^1 norm. In the finite field setting, the PI and Petridis have made substantial progress on a problem of Sarkozy concerning sumsets and the quadratic residues. They have resolved the conjecture for almost all primes. The PI will develop the ideas further so as to resolve the conjecture in earnest.

Since ancient times, people have been interested in integer solutions to equations, called Diophantine equations; the Pythagorean equation, the Pell equation, and Fermat's Last Theorem are well-known problems of this type. In modern times, research has focused on general techniques for this sort of problem. A breakthrough result, proven by Faltings, shows that certain types of equations have only finitely many integer solutions. However, there is no known algorithm to find these solutions in general; algorithmic approaches to Diophantine equations are an active area of research. Surprisingly, this problem relates to many other areas in math, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, Galois theory, and more. In order to compute solutions to Diophantine problems, we need to develop methods to perform some calculations in these other fields.  This project involves studying several of these difficult computational problems.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate various computational and algorithmic topics related to finiteness theorems in number theory. For example, a theorem of Faltings guarantees a polynomial equation of a certain type can have only finitely many rational solutions. (In geometric language, a curve of genus at least two can have only finitely many rational points.) All known proofs of Faltings's theorem are ineffective: one knows that the solutions are finite in number, but the proof provides no way to tell whether one has found them all. Recent work, including a new proof of Faltings's theorem by the PI and Venkatesh, has opened up promising new avenues toward an algorithmic solution. The PI will study algorithmic and computational questions in algebraic geometry and number theory, motivated by Faltings's theorem and other problems in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. The PI hopes to study algorithmic approaches to the Shafarevich conjecture (determining abelian varieties over a fixed number field, with good reduction away from a fixed finite set of bad primes) and the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence (finding algebraic differential equations with given monodromy representations).  The Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, in turn, should be applicable to the problem of finding branched covers of curves, as well as the problem of studying variations of Hodge structure over a given base. Both these problems relate to Faltings's theorem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In number theory and the Langlands program, one is interested in functions on certain homogeneous spaces, where the ""waves"" are special eigenfunctions of Laplacians and Hecke operators, called automorphic forms. Some of the most mysterious and important invariants of the automorphic forms are the L-functions, a vast class of generalizations of the Riemann zeta function. A significant, but not well-understood, principle is that their superposition often represents a function that can be described independently, in terms of what are known as spherical varieties that give rise to a distribution called the period distribution.  The amplitudes of the spectral decomposition of this distribution turn out to be special values of L-functions. The project will investigate conjectural connections between period distributions and L-functions using ideas of quantization (whose roots lie in mathematical physics). The PI also plans yearly meetings to train students and postdocs on the topics related to this proposal. <br/><br/>According to the visionary program developed since the '60s by Abel Prize recipient Robert P. Langlands, L-functions should be understood as invariants of automorphic representations; those are the ""eigenfrequencies"" of ""arithmetic manifolds"", or else the representations of a (reductive) Lie group G, and of its algebra of Hecke operators, which appear as functions on a quotient L\G, where L is an arithmetic lattice. The precise incarnation of L-functions in this setting is by means of certain distributions called ""periods"", which the PI and others have studied and organized into a coherent theory in recent years. The present award aims to utilize ideas of symplectic geometry in the study of these periods.

The first comes from mathematical physics and discrete geometry, and is known as ?Wigner crystallization? after the physicist Eugene Wigner?s landmark 1934 paper.  Here one wishes to give a rigorous proof explaining why electrons (or, more generally, certain molecules) arrange themselves in a crystalline, honeycomb-shaped grid.  This is related to the sphere packing problem (which asks to find exactly how densely space can be filled by equal-sized, non-overlapping balls), and the PI and collaborators plan to use tools from number theory to attack the problem.  The second problem is an important case of the ?Unitary dual problem?, which more generally asks to determine all the possible incarnations of a symmetry group which preserve distances (known as ?unitary representations?).  Conjectures of James Arthur predict exotic, special types of unitary representations, which are of special interest because they appear to be related to number theory (and also to string theory, in many cases).  The bulk of the funding from the award will support graduate students working on aspects of these problems.<br/><br/>The proposed plan of attack for Wigner crystallization is to prove that the hexagonal lattice is universally optimal in the plane, in that it minimizes potential energy for any completely monotonic function of distance-squared.  Such a result was proven by the PI and collaborators in 8 and 24 dimensions, and is known (by work of Mircea Petrache and Sylvia Serfaty) to imply Wigner crystallization.  This will require developing more machinery from classical modular forms, which were the key ingredient in 8 and 24 dimensions, since the problem is quite different in two dimensions.  Arthur?s conjecture will also be attacked via automorphic forms, to construct realizations of Arthur representations (when possible) using Eisenstein series.  Other tools will be the unitarity algorithm which has now been implemented as part of the Atlas of Lie Groups software package, as well as important results of Adams-Barbasch-Vogan on the structure of Arthur packets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While problems in this area are often simple to state, they can be fiendishly difficult to solve. The subfield of function field number theory aims to obtain insight on these problems by considering a kind of model or parallel universe where numbers behave differently. We consider what happens when we add or multiply numbers as normal but, except, instead of carrying digits, we simply drop the excess. Certainly arithmetic is a little easier with this modified rule, but more surprisingly, some of the most important problems in number theory become easier as well, with even some of the most difficult ones becoming solvable. (Technically, we should work in binary, or any prime base, rather than our usual base 10, for this.) Alternately, we can describe this variant arithmetic as the addition or multiplication of polynomial functions in a single variable. In this setting, we can connect number-theoretic questions to geometry, by viewing the graph of the polynomial as a geometric object.

These works are all based on etale cohomology theory, where the foundational result, Deligne's Riemann Hypothesis, allows many different analytic problems (problems about proving some inequality) to be reduced to cohomology problems (problems about calculating some of the cohomology groups of a variety or sheaf). The relevant varieties are high-dimensional, and calculating the necessary cohomology groups requires techniques like vanishing cycles theory and the characteristic cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What may have begun as simple curiosity--for instance, the impulse to construct and classify the regular polyhedra nearly two and a half thousand years ago--has turned out time and again to be the most effective way to study some of the most fundamental objects of mathematics and physics, whether through the more concrete symmetries of geometrical objects or the more abstract (but essential to our digital world) symmetries of quantum mechanics. Perhaps the most surprising role of symmetry in the sciences is in the study of the prime numbers, the fundamental objects of arithmetic, where there are no manifest ""symmetries"" such as one encounters in geometry. Nevertheless, much of our deepest knowledge of prime numbers comes from their connections with the ""symmetries"" of polynomial equations, a subject known as Galois theory. This research project will study Galois representations, which are natural packages for algebraically encoding information about prime numbers. One of the central programs of modern number theory, proposes new ways to ""unpack"" Galois representations by relating them to remarkably different mathematical objects arising in geometry. The PI will continue his research in this direction to describe these mysterious but absolutely fundamental relationships. As part of the educational component of this CAREER project, the PI will undertake a series of educational projects serving a variety of audiences. He will continue to run an intensive summer number theory program for Utah high school students, introducing them to mathematics as an object of experimentation and discovery, and thereby encouraging them to develop the habits of mind essential to creative intellectual work. This program involves both graduate students and local high school teachers as co-teachers, who can then carry its distinctive pedagogical model with them to other educational settings. With a view toward exciting a broader mathematical public, the PI will also, in conjunction with teaching a history of mathematics course at The University of Utah, develop curricular materials, particularly videos, to be disseminated online, in the history of mathematics. Finally, he will continue his work  training PhD students.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the Langlands program is a series of conjectures that guide much contemporary work in number theory, and in particular provide the deepest conjectural answers to problems relating Galois theory and prime numbers. In doing so, they reach out from number theory to algebraic geometry, representation theory, and beyond. The PI complete two main projects within the very broad purview of the Langlands program. The first concerns the deformation theory of Galois representations, one of the two pillars on which the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was built, and ever since one of the central research areas within algebraic number theory. Here the PI will study the deformation theory of Galois representations valued in general reductive groups; broadly, this work aims at generalizations of Serre's famous modularity conjecture. The second main project concerns the relationship between Galois representations and motives, the latter being in some sense the best linear approximation to the category of algebraic varieties, of fundamental interest in its own right, but also conjecturally the algebro-geometric counterpart of Galois representations.

A powerful and time-tested approach to this classification problem is to begin with a measure of how ""stable"" an object is.  Since there are different measures of stability, it is important to understand how they are related.  Moreover, when there are inherent symmetries underlying the spaces in which algebraic objects arise, these symmetries induce even richer relations among different measures of stability and the corresponding stable objects.  This project aims to discover new relations among different types of stability that arise in the area of algebraic geometry and nearby areas such as representation theory, using symmetries as a main tool.  The project will also train undergraduate and graduate students in research through integrated student projects. <br/><br/>This project will incorporate stability conditions in algebraic geometry and representation theory under a single framework.  Different aspects of the project are tied together by the problem of solving the generalized Gepner equation in a variety of situations.  The generalized Gepner equation is a relation involving different group actions on stability conditions.  When specialized to different contexts, the generalized Gepner equation is connected to the birational geometry of moduli spaces, modularity of counting invariants, dynamical systems in algebraic geometry, and the existence of new kinds of stability conditions.  The main tools will be the notion of weak polynomial stability functions and their associated weight functions.  The actions of exact equivalences on these functions and relevant t-structures will be studied.  These results will then be refined to yield concrete equations involving stability conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objects of study are algebraic varieties: shapes defined by systems of polynomial equations. Polynomial constraints on variables are commonplace both in mathematics and in applications ranging from physics, where varieties are used to describe configuration spaces (and even the shape of the universe!), to computer science and statistics. The Principal Investigator's research focuses on describing algebraic varieties in a concise coordinate-free way that reveals hidden essential features of their geometry. The projects connect many different areas: birational geometry, derived categories, arithmetic geometry, mathematical physics, toric geometry, deformation theory, and transformation groups. The research program contributes to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through recruiting, training, and supervising of graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, and providing resources for their research, teaching, and professional development. In particular, the project includes two projects designed for summer REUs in Algebraic Geometry. The Principal Investigator will organize and lecture at conferences, professional development events, and summer schools for graduate students and junior researchers including AGNES (Algebraic Geometry Northeastern Series), and schools in Latin America attended by U.S. graduate students. The research will advance inter-university and international cooperation. This research program includes collaborations with high energy physicists as well as software development of interest to mathematical cryptography (arithmetic of elliptic curves). The Principal Investigator will continue to develop graduate and undergraduate courses, including courses designed to introduce the broader public to mathematics and science.<br/><br/>This project builds on the earlier work of the Principal Investigator (PI) on a broad range of foundational topics in algebraic geometry, including tropical compactifications, birational geometry of moduli spaces of curves and surfaces, compactifications of moduli spaces and derived categories of moduli spaces. The PI will advance modern algebraic geometry on several important frontiers: (1) Applications of derived categories to geometry, cohomology and K-theory of algebraic varieties, including moduli spaces of algebraic curves and vector bundles, toric varieties and Mori Dream Spaces. (2) A new interface between birational and arithmetic geometry exploring effective cones of algebraic surfaces via arithmetic geometry of curves. (3) A novel geometric interpretation and generalization of leading singularities of scattering amplitudes of elementary particles. (4) Development of kinematics, scattering equations and propagation of their solutions. (5) A new class of polyhedral approximations of geometric varieties via spherical tropicalization with the potential to develop new compactification techniques.

While the origins of algebraic geometry can be traced to the works of Euclid and Pythagoras, the focus of algebraic geometry today is often on singularities, which are points that are unusual when compared to their neighbors.  For example, in a figure-eight, the point of crossing is the only one of its kind on the curve ? a singularity. Singularities appear frequently in nature, as the tip of a funnel cloud, in a black hole, or in abrupt changes of physical states such as a ball bouncing off a wall.  They typically indicate states in which a given physical system becomes anomalous or unstable.  This project involves training of graduate and undergraduate students in research and educational activities, thus connecting research with the scientific advancement of the next generation.<br/><br/>There are three parts to this project on D-modules.  At the center of the first part are D-modules that arise from embeddings of singular varieties into manifolds. The larger goals here include studying Hodge theoretic filtrations on these modules and their interplay with intersection homology. With a view towards a conjecture of Hellus, the project will also aim at establishing a certain type of vanishing result.  The second piece begins with a particular type of D-module that arises in the presence of a group action on a variety. For the resulting equivariant D-modules, the PI developed in previous NSF-funded work a categorical paradigm to study them in the toric case. Adapting these tools to the more general case of tautological systems studied by Yau et al. in mirror symmetry is at the core of this aspect of the project. To investigate their functorial presentations, goals include finding a description of the moduli space and the period module.  A third type of invariant to be investigated is the Bernstein?Sato  polynomial of a singularity, which is closely related to solution  counts via the wide-open Monodromy Conjecture.  An unexpected  approach to this conjecture is introduced, based on a translation ? via Frobenius thresholds in finite characteristic ? to a new feature of hypergeometric D-modules.

This international conference will be held at Georgia Southern University's Armstrong Campus in Savannah, Georgia during May 13-15, 2022. The main goal of the meeting is to bring together a diverse group of researchers from a mixture of fields, and in different stages of their careers, in a forum where they will be able to exchange and build on their mathematical ideas and work.  In particular, the conference will highlight the recent results and developments in homological commutative algebra and will further connect with several fields of mathematics, including combinatorics, geometry, number theory, and others.  The event will include established and early-career mathematicians, as well as post-doctoral fellows and students, allowing collaborations, networking, and professional development between these different groups.  Special care will be taken to ensure participation from women and researchers in underrepresented groups to enhance and promote diversity and inclusion in the mathematical sciences. The  expected outcome is to support and promote these mathematical topics for students and researchers in the southeastern region and beyond. <br/><br/>Homological algebra originated from algebraic topology as a tool used in the commutative algebra localization conjecture of regular local rings.  Subsequently, homological algebra has become a major subdiscipline of commutative algebra.  The conference activities will address many connections between homological commutative algebra and other mathematical disciplines.  Specifically, the event includes discussions on fundamental problems in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, representation theory, combinatorics, deformation theory, category theory, rational homotopy theory, and other related areas.  It will follow a typical format with research talks in conjunction with collaboration opportunities, and it will feature a mix of 50-minute research talks given by established mathematicians and 25-minute presentations from early-career researchers.

All of these?rotations, braids, rearrangements?are examples of group actions, namely families of symmetries satisfying structural constraints that arise from the context of each application.  This project studies group actions using combinatorial tools, including graphs and Young tableaux, in order to characterize their underlying algebraic structures.  Applications include other areas of mathematics (like knot theory and algebraic geometry) and other fields (like mathematical biology). The broader impacts of the project include continued leadership of the Center for Women in Math at Smith College, mentoring of students at all levels through the PI's Math Research Lab as well as professional development for graduate students and continued career advice for alumni of the Center for Women in Math.<br/><br/>More technically, this project addresses a set of interconnected questions about two graph-theoretic actions of permutations: 1) a skein-type action of permutations on a family of graphs called webs (of which noncrossing matchings are the best-known example), and 2) a representation constructed from graph automorphisms for a family of subgraphs of the Cayley graph of the permutation group. Each action is the nexus between several mathematical fields, giving rise to a cycle of related questions. In the first case, these are: combinatorially analyzing the transition matrices between two important bases of irreducible symmetric-group representations; describing the geometry and topology of components of Springer fibers; and constructing a basis for a vector space arising from questions in knot- and representation-theory. In the second case, they are: attacking the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture in combinatorics using a newly-established geometric correspondence; computing the (equivariant) cohomology rings of Hessenberg varieties; and describing generalized splines for different edge-labeled graphs. Recent work of Brosnan and Chow, Rhoades, and others mean that the field is poised for new advances.  The project exploits a synergistic strategy by attacking these interrelated questions simultaneously, and uses computational aspects of the work to incorporate mentoring and practical training of students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry is the study of solution sets of polynomial equations called algebraic varieties. It has applications in many fields as diverse as high energy physics, coding, cryptography, and mathematical biology. Understanding how the shape of the solution set changes as the coefficients are varied is one of the oldest and central questions in the field. Such continuous deformations, which appear in all branches of algebraic geometry and its applications, are called algebraic families. An important example is the geometric Langlands program, which is concerned with understanding principal bundles on curves, a very special class of families. Bundles are also main players in gauge theory in high energy physics. Algebraic families are the central focus of this project. The research aims to introduce new methods to classify and compute with algebraic families. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Toric varieties are a large class of varieties whose geometry is intimately connected with combinatorics of convex lattice polytopes. They play a central role in contemporary algebraic geometry. Tropical geometry, a relatively recent area of research, concerns study of piecewise linear geometry and has roots in convex optimization. Tropical geometry translates numerous questions in algebra and geometry into combinatorial and convex geometric questions that are often more tractable. The theory of buildings is an area of combinatorial geometry that has deep connections with topology and differential geometry. It aims to unravel hidden combinatorial geometric structures in matrix groups and related spaces. The topics of this research revolve around the common theme of studying families of algebraic varieties over a toric variety, or a toric family for short. The main insight is that the combinatorics needed to understand toric families comes from both tropical geometry and the theory of buildings. The approach followed in this project will lead to the development of new techniques in algebraic geometry and related fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moduli spaces, geometric objects whose points parameterize other geometric objects,  are of fundamental importance both in algebraic geometry, and in connecting algebraic geometry to other areas of science. For example, the connection with physics arises from the fact that the evolution of strings in space-time may be interpreted as an appropriate measurement on a moduli space of stable maps to space-time. The geometry of moduli space is extremely sophisticated, but it often comes with a rich recursive structure: in simple terms, more complicated moduli spaces contain within themselves a skeleton built of simpler moduli spaces. Over the last few decades this phenomenon has led to the development of several combinatorial approaches to the study of intersection theory of moduli spaces. The main goal of this project is to develop a thorough understanding of the intersection theory of a particular class of moduli spaces, called admissible cover spaces. Admissible cover spaces provide a rich and interesting connection between algebraic geometry and representation theory of finite groups, and have significant applications to mathematical physics and mirror symmetry. The goal will be achieved through a combination of several techniques and perspectives, including methods coming from tropical geometry, logarithmic geometry and mathematical physics. The PI, together with collaborators, will work in parallel both to further develop and to apply these techniques to the study of the structure of moduli spaces of admissible covers. This project provides research training opportunities for students.<br/><br/>Specific projects contributing to achieving the main goal are organized in three groups. The first group of projects explores the structure  of classes of  hyperelliptic curves with marked Weierstrass points and pairs of conjugate points. The aim is to generalize the notion of Cohomological Field Theory, and to exploit this structure to obtain graph formulas for these classes. A better understanding of the structure of admissible cover loci is a tool to recover enumerative information hidden in Gromov-Witten invariants of curves. The second group of projects aims to give a solid combinatorial framework for the tautological intersection theory of  a directed system of birational models of the moduli space of curves, obtained by blowing up all boundary strata (and proper transforms thereof). Besides being of independent interest, we expect this calculus to be an important tool in understanding families of classes of admissible covers, whose intersection with the boundary is transversalized in these birational transforms. These techniques allow new perspectives on the computation of double Hurwitz numbers, and the generalization to similar enumerative geometric problems on moduli spaces of twisted log-canonical divisors. Tropical geometry plays a fundamental role in organizing the birational modifications of the moduli space of curves that we expect to use in the study of cycles of admissible covers. The last  group of projects builds on foundational work in tropical geometry that the PI conducted in collaboration with Gross and Markwig. Having defined a theory of tropical psi classes, the goal is now to establish a rigorous tropicalization statement relating algebraic and tropical classes, with the expectation that these will play a significant role in connecting algebraic and tropical intersection theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since ancient times, people have been interested in integer solutions to equations, called Diophantine equations; the Pythagorean equation, the Pell equation, and Fermat's Last Theorem are well-known problems of this type. In modern times, research has focused on general techniques for this sort of problem. A breakthrough result, proven by Faltings, shows that certain types of equations have only finitely many integer solutions. However, there is no known algorithm to find these solutions in general; algorithmic approaches to Diophantine equations are an active area of research. Surprisingly, this problem relates to many other areas in math, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, Galois theory, and more. In order to compute solutions to Diophantine problems, we need to develop methods to perform some calculations in these other fields.  This project involves studying several of these difficult computational problems.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate various computational and algorithmic topics related to finiteness theorems in number theory. For example, a theorem of Faltings guarantees a polynomial equation of a certain type can have only finitely many rational solutions. (In geometric language, a curve of genus at least two can have only finitely many rational points.) All known proofs of Faltings's theorem are ineffective: one knows that the solutions are finite in number, but the proof provides no way to tell whether one has found them all. Recent work, including a new proof of Faltings's theorem by the PI and Venkatesh, has opened up promising new avenues toward an algorithmic solution. The PI will study algorithmic and computational questions in algebraic geometry and number theory, motivated by Faltings's theorem and other problems in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. The PI hopes to study algorithmic approaches to the Shafarevich conjecture (determining abelian varieties over a fixed number field, with good reduction away from a fixed finite set of bad primes) and the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence (finding algebraic differential equations with given monodromy representations).  The Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, in turn, should be applicable to the problem of finding branched covers of curves, as well as the problem of studying variations of Hodge structure over a given base. Both these problems relate to Faltings's theorem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rational curves are the simplest algebraic varieties, and an important approach to study the geometry of algebraic varieties is to study parameter spaces of rational curves contained in them. These parameter spaces are themselves varieties with rich geometry, and their study has broad applications in higher dimensional algebraic geometry, enumerative geometry, arithmetic geometry, and questions inspired by mathematical physics. In this project, several open questions on various aspects of the geometry of spaces of rational curves on algebraic varieties are investigated. The project provides training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The focus of the first part of the project is the study of spaces of rational curves (as well as rational surfaces and linear subvarieties) contained in hypersurfaces. Hypersurfaces of low degree in projective space form an important testing ground for the study of rationally connected and Fano varieties as well as several other questions in birational geometry. Despite some progress over the past few years, some of the basic properties of these spaces are still unknown. A major guiding question for the study of rational curves on hypersurfaces is which Fano hypersurfaces are rational or unirational. The second part of the project is on the study of rational curves on varieties from the perspective of Geometric Maninís conjecture which predicts the growth rate of a counting function associated to the irreducible components of moduli spaces of rational curves on a variety. In this part, several questions on the geometry of spaces of rational curves on Fano threefolds in characteristic zero and on del Pezzo surfaces over fields of finite characteristic are investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, there is much interest in Heegaard Floer homology as a guiding light for understanding this web more broadly and pushing out toward the applications of most mathematical and practical significance. This project aims to exploit the locality inherent in Heegaard Floer homology to understand a long-sought-after algebraic operation based on principles of higher symmetry, and to use this new structure to advance adjacent fields of research.

This project will expand our knowledge of the structure of Heegaard Floer homology using higher tensor products as an organizing principle, while also using insights from the extensive Heegaard Floer literature to understand more about higher tensor products in general and to develop new links with areas ranging from geometric representation theory to amplituhedra in physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
