Abramovich in the field of algebraic geometry. Abramovich will continue his study of the Gieseker-Morrison compactification of the moduli space of vector bundles of rank 2 on semistable curves, with the goals of identifying the vector bundles corresponding to points on the boundary, extending the construction to higher ranks and comparing with other compactifications. He will also continue his work on Lang's conjecture in characteristic p, and will study integral and torsion points on elliptic curves and integral points on algebraic stacks.    Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics. In the past ten years, it has blossomed to the point where it has solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures in the plane defined by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field utilizes methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology; conversely, it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics."

Such problems include finding a polynomial time algorithm to decide if an element of a finitely presented lattice has a lower cover, if a finitely presented lattice is finite, if it is weakly atomic, and if it has finite width.  A proof of the conjecture that a finitely presented lattice of infinite width must contain a free lattice will be sought.  Furthermore, faster algorithms for the recognition and construction of finite lattices will be investigated.  Using theorems on free lattices, finitely presented lattices, and projective lattices, efficient methods for solving systems of equations in free lattices will be sought.  These methods should lead to efficient algorithms for determining the unification type of such a system.  Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with a structure reflecting to some extent the structure of set theory or logic.  This very weak structure means that lattices can be found in many mathematical environments.  It also means that problems are easy to state, hard to solve and of a very general nature.

The principal investigator intends to  construct the representations of these quantum affine algebras  and determine which admit perfect crystals, study their tensor  category structure, and investigate the relations with the  highest weight category.  The second theme of this project is to  define and study elliptic quantum groups.

Ramsey Theory is the branch of discrete mathematics which deals with the question of what sort of homogeneous structures one can expect to find in some one cell of a finite partition of specified sets (or sometimes in any suitably large subset). It began as an applied subject and has continued to find applications to fields as diverse as logic, game theory and analysis."

Bushnell, the principal investigator has singled out certain pairs, called types, consisting of a compact, open subgroup and an irreducible representation of this subgroup. The existence of such a type leads to the possibility of analyzing representations via Hecke algebra methods; the existence of a complete set of such types in the case of the groups GL(N) has already paid substantial dividends. This project extends the theory of types to others p-adic groups. The local Langlands correspondence is also considered in light of the theory of types, as is the possibility of using types to compute local factors.     This research falls into the broad category of p-adic algebraic groups. Historically, algebraic groups arose in an effort to describe all the transformations or symmetries of an n-dimensional space.

He uses methods from the mathematical fields of combinatorics, dynamical systems, and interacting particle systems in order to prove results that quantify the way boundary conditions temper randomness.  His main objects of study are currently dimer models, which can also be interpreted as random tiling models.    Crystals are ordinarily thought of as the ultimate in orderly arrangement, but at an atomic scale there is often structural disorder with measurable consequences for the bulk properties of matter.  Statistical physicists have made much progress towards modeling these sorts of structure, usually by making some simplifying assumptions.  One of these is the supposition that the structure is two-dimensional (an appropriate assumption if one is studying surfaces of crystals); another is the supposition that the structure has no boundary.  The investigator is relaxing this second assumption and studying what happens in certain standard models of crystalline matter in which there is a boundary of a specified shape having specified structure, and in which all the randomness is confined to the interior."

A major focus is the application of the techniques  developed to specific polytopes of interest in optimization  theory and in the theory of multivariate discriminants. These  polytopes arise in the solution of problems in manufacturing and  distribution, and the results obtained in this project will be of  interest in these areas.     This research is in the general area of Combinatorics.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how  discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of  discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For example, the design of large networks, such as those  occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this  makes use of combinatorial research.

This research is concerned with an algebraic object called a Hopf algebra. While the area is quite technical, Hopf algebras are becoming of increasing interest, even to non mathematicians. Hopf algebras are useful in the type of knot theory that is of interest to molecular chemists. Certain types of Hopf algebras are now referred to as quantum groups in recognition of their applications in physics.

The principal investigator will also explore contravariant finiteness of subcategories of categories of finitely generated modules and, in particular, will develop concrete criteria for the presence of this finiteness property. She will also examine contravariantly finite closures of a given modules category obtained by passing through a sequence of one-point extensions of the underlying algebra. This research is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a multiplication defined on it. Although the additive operation satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required to do so. An example of a ring for which multiplication in not commutative is the collection of nxn matrices over the integers. The study of noncommutative rings has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing significance to other branches of mathematics and physics."

The conference will focus on two major topics: (1) Andrew Wiles' recent proof of the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture for semistable elliptic curves; and (2) the earlier works of Frey, Serre and Ribet showing that Wiles' Theorem would complete the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. The conference is aimed primarily at advanced graduate students and recent PhD recipients, but it will also be valuable to more experienced mathematicians seeking to master the powerful tools used in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. In addition, about 80 high school students and undergraduates from Boston University's PROMYS program will join the more general conference activities, thereby enhancing these young people's experience in PROMYS and reinforcing that mathematics is a flourishing modern research activity. The themes of the conference belong to the general mathematical area of Arithmetic Geometry. This ultramodern research area combines two of the oldest branches of mathematics: number theory and geometry. The new insights arising out of this combination are producing increasingly powerful tools to solve longstanding problems like Fermat's Last Theorem, which have resisted the strongest efforts of over three centuries of mathematicians. In addition, though Arithmetic Geometry is sometimes regarded as among the purest of pure mathematics, it has also been developing insightful new techniques leading to dramatic progress in such applied areas as error-correcting codes and cryptography."
