This question has been a source of inspiration in modern mathematics, as the techniques used to study this question have helped shape the foundation of several areas such as number theory, algebra, and analysis. This work will bring new perspectives to the field by studying various families of polynomial equations and by finding innovative applications in the rich area of number theory. The project will also enhance the training of graduate students and support mentoring activities and research opportunities for undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The principal investigator aims to utilize tools from classical Diophantine analysis and modern applications of analytic number theory and arithmetic geometry to study basic arithmetic structures. This work  will combine ideas from the geometry of numbers with both algebraic and analytic tools to study problems such as  representation of integers by binary forms and orders in number fields, as well as various problems about heights in number fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will further develop and combine two facets of arithmetic dynamics: one is geometric in nature, using geometric objects (moduli spaces) to classify dynamical systems with specified dynamical behaviors, and the other is algebraic, understanding algebraic symmetries (Galois theory) associated to dynamical systems. The fields of number theory and, to some extent, arithmetic dynamics have found uses in cryptography and related areas. The PI will continue outreach activities with the aim of using cryptography as a means of introducing a more general audience to interesting mathematics. This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/><br/>The field of arithmetic dynamics is heavily motivated by analogies between arithmetic geometry and dynamical systems. One important such connection is that preperiodic points for endomorphisms of projective space play a role similar to torsion points on elliptic curves (or, more generally, abelian varieties). The focus of this project is to further investigate this analogy from the moduli-theoretic and Galois-theoretic perspectives. The PI has been involved with the development of the theory of moduli spaces that parametrize endomorphisms with marked preperiodic points -- analogous to classical modular curves, which parametrize elliptic curves with marked torsion points. Such moduli spaces have already played a fundamental role in progress toward the dynamical uniform boundedness conjecture of Morton and Silverman, a dynamical analogue of the Mazur-Merel strong uniform boundedness theorem for torsion points on elliptic curves. In order to make further progress on this difficult uniform boundedness problem, the PI proposes to study the geometry of dynamical moduli spaces attached to certain dynamically interesting families of functions (e.g., quadratic rational maps with a critical point of a given period). The analogy between preperiodic points and torsion points also lends itself to a dynamical analogue of Serre's open image theorem, a finite-index result for the adelic Galois representation associated to torsion points on elliptic curves. The PI proposes studying the appropriate Galois representation attached to (pre)periodic points for rational maps -- especially in the function field setting, where results will provide new insights into the geometry of dynamical moduli spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the twentieth century, mathematicians realized that this question can be reformulated using geometric objects called algebraic cycles. This realization gave rise to a vast and beautiful conjectural framework, which now includes some of the most important unresolved conjectures in mathematics. On the other hand, the discovery of the law of quadratic reciprocity (due to Gauss) and its generalizations lead ultimately to the formulation of the Langlands program, which is a separate web of conjectures relating the symmetries of numbers to analysis and group theory. The questions to be studied in this project lie at the interface of these two different webs of conjectures, and thus involve objects of enormous arithmetic richness. The specific goal of the project is to use the study of certain highly symmetric functions to reveal information about the geometry and arithmetic of polynomial equations. While the final goal is to reveal sophisticated information about polynomials, many of the objects to be studied have immediate practical applications. For example, elliptic curves, which are cubic equations in two variables, play a prominent role in this research and also an important role in contemporary applications such as cryptography and digital signatures, which have extensive use in commerce. One of the broader impacts of the project will be the development of a course on the mathematics of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, popularizing mathematics through an exciting application of broad current popular interest. The project will also provide research training activities for graduate students<br/><br/>In technical terms, the main thrust of the research is to use the fine structure of automorphic representations, including the theory of local and global Arthur packets, to study problems on algebraic cycles. Specific problems to be studied include: (i) constructing Hodge cycles that represent instances of Langlands functoriality, especially for unitary groups; (ii) Oda's conjecture on the factorization of Hodge structures of Hilbert modular forms; (iii) relations between Abel-Jacobi images of cohomologically trivial cycles and p-adic L-functions; (iv) integral period relations for quaternionic modular forms, and (v) applications of the theory of non-tempered A-packets to generalizations of Kudla-Millson theory on locally symmetric spaces.

One novel feature of this work is an approach to these problems that takes advantage of our understanding of the ""anatomy of integers"" describing the typical way a number breaks down into component parts (prime factors).<br/><br/>Three main topics of investigation will be pursued: (1) A detailed study of the value-distribution of arithmetic functions, one particular problem being to pin down precise conditions under which a number has many factorizations.

While the former three branches originate from quantum physics, the last one deals with applications of purely algebraic concepts to geometry. Representation theory concerns the study of symmetries of a vector space such as three-dimensional Euclidean space (more generally, an infinite dimensional space) with additional structures. These symmetries can be often thought of as algebraic structures such as groups, Lie algebras, or associative algebras. Two cases are of particular interest: (1) the case of sufficiently many pair-wise commuting symmetries, which is a primary subject of study in integrable systems, and (2) the case when the underlying vector spaces arise via generalized cohomology theories associated with geometric moduli spaces. This project aims at resolving several open questions pertaining to those cases through the study of shifted quantum groups; the first surprising connections of those novel algebras to Toda-like quantum (difference) integrable systems and quantized Coulomb branches were discovered in the recent work of the PI.<br/> <br/>The major theme of the proposed research is the study of shifted quantum affine algebras and the corresponding new structures on the quantized Coulomb branches. The project is broken down into five parts, as follows. The first part will investigate integral forms of shifted quantum affine algebras. One objective is to show that they map surjectively onto quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches and to describe explicitly the kernel of these maps using the shuffle approach. Another important structure to be constructed on such integral forms are coproduct homomorphisms: these will descend to the truncated counterparts, thus quantizing multiplications of the corresponding classical K-theoretic Coulomb branches. The second and the third parts of the project are aimed at the construction and study of monoidal categorification of the quantum cluster algebra structure on quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches via shifted quantum affine algebras, and a construction of new vertex operator algebras via shifted affine Yangians of gl(n). The fourth part deals with a novel approach to Lax matrices via antidominantly shifted quantum groups. This will bring new insights into now relatively old subject of the inverse scattering method. At the same time, it will also emphasize an overlooked importance of antidominant shifts, leading to a new study of Bethe subalgebras of the quantized Coulomb branches. This work will also provide a systematic construction of Baxter Q-operators, implying functional and TQ-relations for them. The fifth part of the project aims to obtain Kazhdan-Lusztig type character formulas for finite-dimensional representations of DeConcini-Kac truncated shifted quantum affine algebras at roots of unity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A classical way of studying singularities it to restrict to a small neighborhood and analyze its boundary. In an influential paper written in the sixties, John Nash proposed an alternative approach which relies on the analysis of the space of germs of curves through the singular locus. Twenty years later, Vladimir Berkovich developed a general theory of non-Archimedean geometry which provides, among other things, a yet new approach to study singularities. These three very different points of view are in fact closely related to each other. The goals set in this project address different open problems in each of these areas, seeking new connections and applications. The project also provides research training activities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The space of arcs of an algebraic variety provides the underlying space in motivic integration and has been used to study invariants of singularities in the minimal model program. The first part of the project sets two distinct objectives regarding arc spaces. The first pertains a theorem of Drinfeld, Grinberg, and Kazhdan of the formal neighborhood of the arc space at non-degenerate arcs and addresses the question whether the stated decomposition globalizes along a suitable stratification of the arc space. The second objective concerns the Nash problem on families of arcs through the singularities of a variety: the Nash problem has recently been settled for surfaces in characteristic zero and there are several results in higher dimensions, but little is known in positive characteristic, even in dimension two, and the proposal addresses this case. A third objective sees the continuation of ongoing work devoted to the development of a theory of motivic integration on the Berkovich analytification of an algebraic variety and aims to understand its connections with other existing theories of integration such as Kontsevich's motivic integration, p-adic integration, and Hrushovski-Kazhdan?s integration. The fourth and last objective is motivated by the Lipman?Zariski conjecture, and aims to use ideas from prior works on links of isolated singularities and the complex Plateau problem to set up a new approach toward the conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In algebraic geometry, mathematicians are interested in the classification of algebraic varieties, that is, sets of solutions to polynomial equations. This classification is carried out by determining and computing certain invariants of the variety. Such invariants can be numerical, or more often, sets that have a specific algebraic or geometric structure. The more geometric approach focuses on algebraic varieties over the complex numbers, which themselves have a rich geometry. In number theory, on the other hand, mathematicians are interested in finding integer or rational solutions to polynomial equations; a famous example in this area is Fermat's last theorem. The set of rational numbers is very scarce within the set of complex numbers, which is what makes such solutions so hard to detect. This project aims to study a geometric invariant, called the Chow group of zero-cycles, that relates both to the classification problem and to the arithmetic of rational solutions. The main goal of the project is to investigate conjectures that deal with the structure of this group when we work over the rational numbers or over the arithmetic analog of the real numbers, namely the p-adic numbers. <br/><br/>The methods in this project will involve techniques from arithmetic and algebraic geometry as well as K-theory. The project focuses on the study of abelian varieties, a class of varieties that has some extra structure. The project involves ""local questions"" for varieties over the p-adic numbers, where the use of p-adic Hodge theory will be the key. Among the main goals of the local program is to establish a conjecture of Colliot-Thélène. Second, the project involves also ""global questions"" for varieties over the rational numbers. The goal of the global program will be to prove a conjecture of Beilinson. Lastly, the project will investigate a ""local-to-global"" program related to obstruction questions. The goal is to prove a conjecture of Kato and Saito, which could potentially lead to the construction of a new type of Euler system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole or rational number solutions of some equation of interest.  (For example, the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem. While it is straightforward to find all right triangles whose side lengths are rational numbers, it perhaps surprisingly remains an unsolved problem to determine which whole numbers can be the area of a right triangle with rational sides.) The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. One approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, p-adic methods have begun to be unified with Langlands's ideas into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, primarily of a geometric nature, and to use them to establish new instances of Langlands's conjectures. The award will support the training of students in this area of research that is considered of high interest.<br/><br/><br/>This project addresses the following fundamental question: what are the underlying geometric structures relating p-adic Galois representations to the mod p representation theory of p-adic groups? The project builds on several recent developments in which the various PIs have played key roles, including the construction of moduli stacks parametrizing p-adic representations of the Galois groups of p-adic local fields and of local models for these stacks, and recent extensions of the Taylor-Wiles patching method which relate it to the study of coherent sheaves on the local models, and to derived algebraic geometry. Some specific questions that the PIs will study are the problem of potentially crystalline lifts, the construction of a general p-adic local Langlands correspondence, and the possible local nature of the (a priori global) patching constuction.  More generally, the PIs intend to introduce algebro-geometric, categorical, and derived perspectives into the p-adic Langlands program, with the intention of gaining new insights into and making new progress on some of the key open problems in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first set of projects center on the investigator's recent higher-dimensional generalization of results on greatest common divisors of polynomials evaluated at S-units. The project will study generalizations and extensions related to Vojta's conjecture, analogues in function fields, including applications, and a novel approach to analogous problems for abelian varieties. A second set of projects will focus on integral points on varieties. First, the project will continue work on aspects of Siegel?s theorem for integral points of bounded degree on curves. Second, the investigator will study an approach to effectively proving Siegel?s theorem for genus two curves. Fundamental tools for studying these problems come from the subject of Diophantine approximation, where Schmidt's subspace theorem is a central result.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite numerous foundational advances, there are many classically studied problems that still do not have a satisfactory resolution. The conference will highlight the transformative developments undergone by this area of research in recent years and formulate new directions for future research. Towards this end, we will bring together experts in the field and carefully select participants to ensure involvement of students and junior investigators and of individuals from groups under-represented in the mathematical sciences.

The overall objective of this conference is to bring together experts in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry to confer on three topics of common interest: symbolic powers of ideals, asymptotic invariants of linear systems, and unexpected varieties. Despite the diverse contexts in which these notions arise and the many areas they exhibit connections to, each of these topics is closely related to the others.

The research centers on the theme of symbolic powers, an active topic of research with connections to virtually all aspects of commutative algebra. This project aims to resolve two questions, on comparing the geometric notion of symbolic powers with the algebraic notion of natural powers, and on the application of the differential algebraic notion of p-derivations to commutative algebra. The investigator will direct undergraduate research experiences and organize a graduate workshop in commutative algebra.<br/><br/>The unifying theme of this project is the study of symbolic powers of ideals. The research focuses primarily on two questions: the containment problem and applications of p-derivations to commutative algebra. While ideals in a polynomial ring correspond to the polynomials that vanish on a certain variety in affine space, their symbolic powers consist of the polynomials that vanish to a certain order on the given variety. This natural geometric notion has an algebraic description coming from the theory of primary decomposition, an ideal-theoretic version of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This is an old, rich, and ubiquitous topic, yet there is an abundance of questions about symbolic powers that are both easy to phrase and very difficult to solve. The containment problem attempts to compare symbolic powers, a natural geometric notion, with ordinary powers, a natural algebraic notion. This relates to other interesting questions, such as determining the minimal degrees of polynomials vanishing on a given variety. Another part of the project is to discover new connections between p-derivations and commutative algebra, with an eye towards a new singularity theory in mixed characteristic that combines p-derivations with differential operators in the spirit of the theory of F-singularities and its connections to D-modules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, lines are solution sets of linear polynomial equations, while circles and hyperbolas are solution sets to quadratic polynomial equations, and their study goes back to the ancient Greeks. The solution sets of systems of many polynomial equations in many variables often have beautiful and complicated geometry. The PI will apply new and modern techniques to answer questions of classical interest in the field of algebraic geometry, and to address long standing open problems about the geometry of curves defined by polynomial equations. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Over a nonarchimedean field, one can split the problem of understanding such solution sets into two parts. What are the possible valuations of solutions?  And what are the solutions with a given valuation?  The set of valuations of solutions has a rich combinatorial and polyhedral structure, and is the primary object of study in tropical geometry; the solutions with a given valuation can be studied via nonarchimedean analytic geometry.  Recent developments in these fields make it possible to resolve subtle questions about the geometry of the actual solution set using new and innovative tools and techniques. This project will refine, abstract, and generalize these new methods and explore deeper applications to open problems in algebraic geometry.The PI will use tropical and nonarchimedean methods to continue his work on refined curve counting, and on unstable cohomology of moduli spaces of curves, proceeding beyond the top graded piece of the weight filtration to examine the full weight-graded cohomology ring. He will also initiate an analogous study of the weight graded cohomology of the moduli space of abelian varieties, using the topology of moduli spaces of tropical abelian varieties and the combinatorial algebra of complexes built out of unimodular matroids and perfect quadratic forms. Additional projects will attack the motivic, p-adic, and topological monodromy conjectures for Newton nondegenerate singularities, using the combinatorics of relative local h-polynomials and Stapledon?s formulas for monodromy, and attempt to resolve outstanding (and mutually contradictory) conjectures of Kontsevich and Morita in the homology of commutative graph complexes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They also appear in many areas of mathematics outside number theory, most notably in mathematical physics. The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include Maass wave forms, mock modular forms, quadratic forms and theta functions, elliptic curves, special values of L-functions, Siegel, Jacobi, and Hilbert modular forms, Langlands functoriality, p-adic modular forms and p-adic L-functions, arithmetic statistics, Galois representations, and Kloosterman sums.

A basic question is ""What do the frequencies of these waves tell us about their interference and vice versa?"". The interference of the waves has to do with the magnitude of their superposition, and the concentration of the interference can be made large by choosing the frequencies according to a strict pattern. One of the questions pursued by the PI is the converse: are these patterns necessary to achieve a very concentrated superposition. This is called the Inverse Littlewood Problem. The second question under investigation is an uncertainty principle. Suppose we have two families of waves that can be used to decompose a signal, and these two families are very incompatible. This incompatibility means we expect that a simple wave from one family looks much more complicated as a superposition from the second. A specific instance of this is whether a multiplicative character (a very simple wave in one family) can be decomposed as an additive convolution (a fairly simple superposition in another family). This is called Sarkozy's Problem.<br/><br/>There is a long history of comparing the distribution and arithmetic structure of sequences in number theory. Classically, the connection is observed by way of the Fourier transform. Towards a better understanding of this phenomenon, the PI plans to build upon recent results that relate the dimension of a finite subset of a lattice to estimates on the L^1-norm of its associated Fourier series. This area of investigation began with a conjecture of Littlewood on how small the L^1 -norm of the Fourier transform of a finite set of integers could be. The problem was resolved independently by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s. Recently, questions have turned to classifying the extremizers in this problem, and the PI has recently proved that they must be, in an appropriate sense, low-dimensional. In this project he will develop the method further, by weakening hypotheses and applying these results to problems in arithmetic reliant the L^1 norm. In the finite field setting, the PI and Petridis have made substantial progress on a problem of Sarkozy concerning sumsets and the quadratic residues. They have resolved the conjecture for almost all primes. The PI will develop the ideas further so as to resolve the conjecture in earnest. Beyond this, he will adapt the method to other problems, which in turn will lead to progress on Vinogradov?s conjecture on the least non-residue.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often the equations that one encounters are algebraic in nature, like those describing lines, circles, parabolas and the like, in contrast with, say, equations involving the trigonometric functions, or logarithms, or derivatives. Typically, the equations have infinitely many solutions---think about the equation defining a circle---and it is usually not possible to write down a complete list of solutions. Rather, the objective is to find ways to study the structure of the collection of the solution set, which is called a variety. A fruitful approach has been to consider the (algebraic) functions on the variety. These functions form a mathematical structure called a commutative ring, and my research has been dedicated to understanding these structures; not in the abstract, but in their various manifestations, which are galore, they arise in quite diverse contexts across mathematics and physics. Mathematics has also been remarkably successful in describing and studying phenomenon related to symmetry. This leads to another mathematical structure called a group. Intriguingly, in certain contexts, there is a way to attach a commutative ring---and a variety---to a group and in the past few years various researchers, including the PI, have been able to solve problems related to groups using tools that had been developed to study varieties. A part of the current project deals with these aspects.<br/><br/>Two major themes weave through this project. One is the study of invariants of finite free complexes over commutative noetherian local rings; the second is the modular representation theory of finite groups and group schemes. The former too is connected to groups via certain conjectures in the theory of transformation groups. These conjectures---due to Adem, Avramov, Browder, Buchweitz, Carlsson, Swan, Halperin and others---postulated lower bounds on the length of the homology modules, and on the total rank, of such complexes, when the homology has nonzero finite length. Recently the PI and Mark Walker found counterexamples for many of these conjectures. One set of problems outlined in this project are aimed at discovering and establishing the ``correct"" bounds for these invariants. Another set of projects seek to probe the structure of the stable module category of representations of a finite group, or finite group scheme, over a field of positive characteristic. The focus is on ``local strata"" and various finiteness conditions for modules in this strata; in particular, on dualizability and cohomological finiteness. The multiplicative structure of Hochschild cohomology of commutative algebras is a third main topic of this proposal. The goal here is to characterize locally complete intersection algebras in terms of their Hochschild cohomology.

Later, this was extended to encompass strong and weak interactions, so that principal bundles became a basis for the so-called standard model - a physical theory describing three out of four fundamental interactions. In mathematics, principal bundles penetrate many areas: geometry, number theory, mathematical physics, and others. In 1950's Fields Medalist Jean-Pierre Serre recognized the importance of principal bundles in algebraic geometry. In his 1958 seminal paper he gave the first modern definition of a principal bundle and formulated a certain deep conjecture. This conjecture, as well as some remaining questions, are among the oldest unsolved foundational questions in mathematics. The first part of this project is aimed at proving some of these conjectures. The remaining parts of the projects are related to the so-called Higgs principal bundles, which can be thought of as mathematical incarnations of the Higgs boson -- a recently found elementary particle. These parts of the project belong to the famous Langlands program unifying number theory, algebraic geometry, harmonic analysis, and mathematical physics. This award will support continuing research in these areas. Advising students and giving talks at conferences are going to be part of the proposed activity.<br/><br/>In more detail, the first project originated from the Grothendieck-Serre conjecture on principal bundles, which was settled recently for rings containing fields by Ivan Panin and the PI. The PI plans to extend the proof to the mixed characteristic case as well as to work on the purity conjecture for principal bundles. The purity conjecture is, in a sense, the next logical step after the Grothendieck-Serre conjecture. In the second project, the PI intends to construct and prove the local Langlands duality for Hitchin systems and to derive some cases of the global Langlands duality for Hitchin systems from the local case. The third project is devoted to counting motivic volumes of moduli stacks of principal Higgs bundles. The goal is to generalize the previous results of the PI and other people from the GL(n) case to the case of arbitrary reductive groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, stringy invariants of manifolds such as quantum cohomology have led to spectacular advances in enumerative geometry. On the algebraic side, a fundamental new structure called a vertex operator algebra (VOA) emerged from quantum field theory in the 1980s, and was axiomatized by Borcherds in his work on the Moonshine Conjecture. VOAs are natural generalizations of commutative rings, and in the last thirty years, they have found applications in a diverse range of subjects including finite group theory, representation theory, combinatorics, number theory, and algebraic geometry. In this project, the PI will investigate the structure and representation theory of VOAs, as well as some connections between VOAs and algebraic geometry. These projects will advance the subject and provide educational and collaborative opportunities for the PI's current and former graduate students.<br/><br/>First, the PI's work on the coset realization of principal W-algebras of A, D, and E types resolved a 30-year-old conjecture which had been a key starting assumption in physics. It has many striking corollaries such as the unitarity of all discrete series representations of principal W-algebras, and the existence of modular tensor categories of modules for affine VOAs at admissible levels. The PI will construct coset realizations of principal W-algebras of other Lie types, as well as non-principal W-algebras and W-superalgebras. Second, the PI recently constructed a universal two-parameter VOA which interpolates between all the type A principal W-algebras, in the sense that they arise as one-parameter quotients of this structure. The PI will construct more general universal objects, which are VOAs defined over the ring of functions on some variety X. Typically, interesting VOAs are obtained by specializing the universal object along certain subvarieties of X, and unexpected isomorphisms of these VOAs correspond to intersection points on these subvarieties. Third, the PI will study two affine schemes that have been attached to a VOA by Arakawa: the associated scheme and the singular support. There is always a closed embedding of the singular support in the arc space of the associated scheme. The PI will investigate good criteria for this embedding to be an isomorphism. This has many applications in VOA theory and is connected to questions about the geometry of arc spaces that are of independent interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these noncommutative spaces are virtual and not made of points. Dg manifolds are one particular type of such a noncommutative spaces. The space of functions on a dg manifold is a differential graded algebra. Another important class of noncommutative spaces is obtained as deformations of commutative algebras. Deformation quantization aims at throwing a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics. The mathematical structures of the two theories are very different, making it a challenging problem to understand how the transition from classical to quantum works. Quantization, roughly speaking, is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. The PI proposes to continue the study of higher structures and homotopy algebras arising naturally in noncommutative geometry and their relation to representation theory using tools from deformation quantization and Lie algebroid theory. The problems include investigating the role of the Todd class in Tamarkin-Tsygan calculi associated with a  dg manifold, studying the formal geometry of dg manifolds and the concept of homotopy equivalence of dg Lie algebroids, establishing a Kontsevich-Duflo type theorem in a wide context, and exploring negatively graded dg manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, shuffling a deck of cards or rotating an atom around its nucleus.  Over the last 200 years, Group Theory has been spectacularly successful in using symmetry to study a wide variety of problems in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering.  More recently, starting in the 1980s, mathematicians and mathematical physicists have developed a theory of Quantum Groups and Quantum Symmetry which adapt ideas from Group Theory to more general settings appearing in quantum physics and related mathematics.  The first spectacular application of what we now call Group Theory was Galois' use of symmetries of number systems to explain why there's a generalization of the familiar quadratic formula to solve equations using third or fourth powers, but no such formula for solving equations with fifth powers.  Galois's number systems are parallel to von Neumann factors developed to study quantum mechanics, and several of the first spectacular applications of what we would know call Quantum Groups or Quantum Symmetries appeared in Jones's study of subfactors.  More recently Quantum Symmetry has become central to certain approaches to constructing quantum computers using so-called topological phases of matter.  The main techniques used in this project involve higher dimensional algebra.  Here the idea is that we typically write mathematical symbols on a line when doing calculations, but in many settings it is better to use the whole plane to draw pictures, or to do the calculation on ""paper"" in more interesting shapes like circles or spheres.  Sometimes the geometry allows for insight into the mathematics, for example you can ""rotate"" a calculation taking place in the plane.  The goal of this project is to use higher dimensional algebra to study questions in quantum symmetry. The project will also contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of Ph.D. and high school students.<br/><br/>In more technical language, we use planar algebras, topological quantum field theory, and higher categories to study questions coming from von Neumann subfactors and tensor categories.  These include very example-driven questions like constructing and studying exceptional small index subfactors, as well as more theoretical questions like understanding the structure of the 3-category of fusion categories (where subfactors appear as 1-morphisms).  More specifically, this project focuses on four closely related research programs.  First, we will develop a purely algebraic analogue of the author's previous work on the classification of small index subfactors. Second we will use module categories more systematically to approach analytic questions about reconstructing subfactors from their standard invariants.  Third, we will use skein theoretic approaches and Jones's planar algebras to study tensor categories, including non-semisimple tensor categories.  Finally, we study tensor categories and braided tensor categories using higher-categories and local topological quantum field theories building on the Lurie-Baez-Dolan cobordism hypothesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the central themes in number theory is the Langlands program, a profound link between arithmetic and geometry that counts among its successes the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. A surprisingly close analogy between these two themes has been developed in the last decade.

An L-function is a special kind of function that packages together information about an arithmetical object that arises from studying it modulo p for each prime p. For instance, the Riemann zeta function is the simplest example of an L-function and has proven to be indispensable in studying the distribution of the prime numbers.  Other types of L-functions are crucial for understanding if certain polynomial equations have solutions, or more generally, how many solutions there are. Often these questions are related to how large the L-function is at a special point.  Much of this project concerns the development of new tools for studying how L-functions may fit into families and using these tools to better understand individual L-functions. The investigator will continue to advise PhD students and to mentor and collaborate with undergraduate students, especially through the Texas A&M Research Experience for Undergraduates.  This type of mentorship is invaluable in preparing students for graduate studies, particularly for undergraduate students from non-PhD granting institutions as well as from population groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  <br/><br/>The project will study new families of L-functions and use them as tools for estimating L-functions on the critical line.  In particular, the work aims to develop new large sieve inequalities, which are flexible tools broadly useful in analytic problems on L-functions.  The investigator and his students will study moments of L-functions in smaller sub-families than have previously been considered. Another line of work concerns new variants on the quantum unique ergodicity problem, which connects families of L-functions to properties of automorphic forms. With his undergraduate students, the investigator will study properties of generalized Dedekind sums. The methods employed will be techniques from analytic number theory such as summation formulas, functional equations, exponential sums and integrals, and the spectral theory of automorphic forms, including the Arthur-Selberg trace formula and the relative trace formula.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ubiquitous in mathematics, algebraic varieties are critical objects of study in complex geometry, number theory, topology, and representation theory. It is often particularly important to understand their moduli, that is, how they vary as the coefficients of the polynomial equations defining them are varied. Hodge theory offers one perspective on this problem: the moduli of algebraic varieties can be understood in terms of how integrals of differential forms vary. This research project will use new methods stemming from model theory, representation theory, and complex geometry to understand this connection. The project especially aims to promote interactions with closely-related areas of mathematics and to encourage the participation of students and young researchers.   <br/><br/>The project will address two main types of research problems.

Secondly, the project will develop a more detailed understanding of the moduli of certain varieties which are particularly closely related to Hodge theory, including abelian varieties and hyperkahler varieties.

In this theory, symmetries are represented by linear transformations of this space, or, more explicitly, by matrices. Thus, a representation of a given symmetry structure is basically a collection of matrices which satisfy a certain natural system of nonlinear equations. The equations are determined by the exact type of symmetry structure we are representing - a group, a Lie algebra, or an associative algebra. Representations of a given structure themselves form a quite intricate and rich structure, which encodes relations (or mappings) between different representations. This higher-level structure is called the category of representations. For some type of structures (e.g. for groups, Lie algebras, quantum groups), representations can be multiplied; in this case the corresponding categories are tensor categories (as multiplication of representations is similar to multiplication of tensors). It turns out that the notion of a tensor category is very interesting in its own right, and that many tensor categories don't arise as categories of representations. The PI will investigate ordinary and tensor categories, some of which arise as representation categories and some of which don't, as well as the connections between them. In particular, complex rank generalizations of representation categories proposed by P. Deligne will be investigated. Roughly speaking, this is a generalization in which the number of elements of a set or rows of a matrix is allowed to be non-integer. This seemingly nonsensical setting becomes meaningful and useful when the invariants one is interested in turn out to be polynomials of the number of elements or rows, which is often true. The PI will also investigate quantizations of singular symplectic varieties, for instance symplectic resolutions. These are non-commutative algebras that appear in certain kinds of quantum field theories of recent interest as algebras of quantum observables. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>This project involves research on: tensor categories; quantum groups; representation theory in complex rank; cherednik algebras; short star-products on quantizations; analytic approach to Geometric Langlands program. The plan of PI's work is as follows. 1. Develop a theory of Frobenius functors for symmetric tensor categories in characteristic p and Frobenius exact <br/>categories; classify exact factorizations of fusion categories, in particular twisted Deligne products; classify fiber functors and module categories over the representation category of the small quantum group; compute the semisimplification of the category of tilting modules for a reductive group in small characteristic, and use it to compute the dimensions of tilting modules modulo p; prove quasi-motivicity of representations of braid groups arising from braided fusion categories; construct new symmetric tensor categories in characteristic p>2 similar to the Etingof-Benson categories in characteristic 2; compute cohomology of these categories; develop Lie theory in the Verlinde category; develop a theory of symplectic reflection fusion categories; continue to develop the theory of actions of finite dimensional Hopf algebras on division algebras (in particular, fields); classify unipotent tensor categories. Work on a discrete analog of the monodromy theorem of Toledano Laredo for the Casimir connection, using dynamical Weyl groups, Study signatures of representations of quantum groups for |q|=1. 2. Continue to develop the ideas of P. Deligne, and extend representation theories of various classical structures (containing the symmetric group S_n or classical Lie groups GL(n),O(n),Sp(2n)) to complex values of the rank parameter n. These structures will include degenerate affine Hecke algebras, rational and trigonometric Cherednik algebras, symplectic reflection algebras, real reductive Lie groups (i.e., symmetric pairs), Lie superalgebras, affine Lie algebras, (parabolic) category O for reductive Lie algebras, Yangians, and other structures.

This project will shed further light on these questions, focusing particularly on which hypersurfaces satisfy various types of hyperbolicity properties. Furthermore, this project will help train the next generation of scientists and mathematicians through a strong educational plan aimed to K-12 students, that sees the involvement of undergraduate students and faculty. The plan includes the expanding of a tutoring program that sends undergraduate students to a South Bend school, the piloting of a program to help South Bend students make projects for Notre Dame science fair, and the training graduate students to run math circles.

Pointwise bounds and mean values of such sums play a fundamental role throughout analytic number theory, and contribute the primary tool for testing equidistribution (apparent ``randomness'') of sequences underpinning many applications of number theory in theoretical computer science, cryptography, and so on. Until the last decade, despite almost a century of intense effort starting with the introduction by Hardy and Littlewood of their famous circle method, the main conjectures concerning mean values of exponential sums over polynomials remained unsolved in all but the very simplest cases involving linear and quadratic polynomials. A decade of dramatic progress has culminated in the last five years with the proof of the most ambitious conjectures concerning a central example of such mean value conjectures, that associated with Vinogradov's mean value theorem, on the one hand by Bourgain, Demeter and Guth via decoupling, and on the other by the proposer by means of nested efficient congruencing. In this project, the principal investigator will enhance, extend and exploit these very recent methods so as to obtain similarly decisive progress in an array of mean value conjectures having applications in quantitative arithmetic geometry and the wider theory of the Hardy-Littlewood method. This will contribute to the resolution of the main conjectures for translation-dilation invariant systems in many variables in full generality, including analogues of such conjectures involving mean values averaged over sets of small measure, beyond the reach of current technology. A graduate student will be trained in this important emerging area, and the proposer will work on a new text intended to provide an introduction to efficient congruencing for translation-dilation invariant systems as a vehicle for introducing modern developments in the circle method over the rational integers, number fields and function fields.<br/><br/><br/>Very recent advances in the understanding of mean values of exponential sums have delivered the Main Conjecture for Vinogradov's mean value. By orthogonality, this mean value is associated with a translation-dilation invariant Diophantine system. Despite this success, neither the decoupling method nor the nested efficient congruencing method currently address any but embryonic multivariable translation-dilation invariant systems. Moreover, they do not address corresponding mean values supported on subsets of the unit hypercube, and thus fail to provide useful estimates for either minor arcs or wide sets of major arcs of use in the Hardy-Littlewood method. This project will make decisive progress on this comprehensive theory, delivering the main conjectures concerning mean values of exponential sums associated not only with general translation-dilation invariant Diophantine systems, but also systems possessing only partial or approximate translation-dilation invariant structure. This will all be done in the quite general setting of number fields and function fields by adapting the proposer?s nested efficient congruencing methods. This flexible set of methods permits congruence information to be passed from one set of variables to another in multi-homogeneous settings, and this may be achieved even when working on restricted domains of integration. Amongst applications of these new estimates, the principal investigator will establish local-global principles for the existence of rational curves with rational coefficients on hypersurfaces possessing some measure of diagonal structure via the Hardy-Littlewood method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, commutative algebra is fundamental to cryptography, which many of us rely on daily, but also to genomics.  This project advances the field of commutative algebra, and also trains junior scientists to develop skills relevant to a variety of scientific careers. This project also includes three initiatives focused on education, outreach and scientific leadership.  These initiatives support research collaboration among women algebraists, implement an REU training program serving students from groups that are underrepresented in the STEM fields, and create new computer algebra software for research and education.<br/><br/>This project aims to further our understanding of commutative rings and algebraic varieties using prime characteristic methods, differential operators, and local cohomology. In prime characteristic, one goal is to use the Frobenius map to study hypersurfaces by providing a better understanding of test ideals and Frobenius jumping exponents.  The project also seeks effective algorithms for computing the Bernstein- Sato polynomial over the complex numbers.  Another goal of the project is to investigate differential operators, and modules over them, in non-regular settings, and then apply this new theory (for example, to study multiplier ideals).

The subject has developed for over 200 years, but there are many fresh problems and new directions. Commutative algebra is a subject that lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and number theory. Since the advent of powerful and easily available computing resources, the possibilities for experimentation within commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and their applications has multiplied. A byproduct of this project will be the further development of these computational tools. Cohen-Macaulay modules and sheaves play a role in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that is a natural analogue of the role of finite dimensional representations in the case of finite dimensional algebras. The Principal Investigator will work on projects in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and computational methods that center around the theory of Cohen-Macaulay modules over particularly interesting classes of varieties: Toric varieties, complete intersections, and residual intersections. The PI will also continue to train graduate students in related research fields and actively be involved in several highly recognized outreach activities.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator will work on Ulrich modules and Clifford Algebras. Cohen-Macaulay and Ulrich modules over quadratic hypersurfaces are well-understood from work of Knoerrer (over algebraically closed fields) and Buchweitz-Eisenbud-Schreyer over arbitrary fields.  The PI will investigate deeper questions about Ulrich modules and other maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules on complete intersections of two quadrics using Clifford algebra techniques, extending Miles Reid's thesis, and making explicit work of Bondal-Orlov and Kapranov, as well as the theory of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over complete intersections developed by the proposer with Irena Peeva.

In quantum physics, this classical notion of symmetry group is no longer enough to capture all symmetries and is replaced by a notion more suited to quantum phenomena, termed quantum symmetry groups, or by related more general mathematical structures. This project carries out basic research in quantum symmetry, which is important in current applications of mathematics such as quantum computing and quantum information science. The project aims to develop and apply techniques for breaking down instances of quantum symmetry into smaller components, facilitating understanding. This work will expand the techniques available for answering questions about quantum symmetry that arise in applications.

The investigator will study the cohomology of Hopf algebras and tensor categories, specifically to investigate a conjecture that cohomology of finite tensor categories is always finitely generated. The investigator aims to establish results on the structure of support varieties for finite tensor categories, harnessing homological techniques combined with geometry to obtain information such as a tensor product property and criteria for wild representation type. She plans to establish a direct connection between two different techniques that were developed recently, the homotopy lifting method and loops in exact categories, calling on techniques used in connection with A-infinity structures.

The project will reveal new symmetries possessed by L-functions, which in turn will be useful for understanding objects such as the prime numbers. Prime numbers are essential in cryptography, a method by which computer data is securely transferred. The project will also reveal how automorphic forms are distributed.

The Random Wave Conjecture can be formulated in terms of moments of automorphic forms, with the statement for the second moment corresponding to the familiar Quantum Unique Ergodicity problem. This project will go beyond QUE, by investigating higher moments of automorphic forms, and yielding a finer understanding of the distribution of automorphic forms. The reciprocity formulae are certain exact formulae for moments of L-functions, exhibiting some surprising symmetry. An early example is Motohashi's formula, which relates the fourth moment of the Riemann Zeta function to the third moment of automorphic forms. This project will discover new examples of reciprocity formulae, which will shed light on the nature of such symmetries and yield new applications, such as subconvexity bounds for L-functions.

To draw an analogy with ecology, this change in perspective is akin to the realization that, in order to understand the movement of a single fish in the sea, it helps a great deal to understand how that fish interacts with the other members of their school. In mathematics, the notion of a moduli space loosely refers to an entire family of objects; for example, in the fish analogy, the moduli space could refer to the entire school of fish. Moduli spaces can, themselves, be treated as a single entity, comprised of many, and we can learn about the objects we are interested in by studying the shape of the moduli space that parametrizes them. It can be especially enlightening to understand the shape of moduli spaces near their boundary, and the research supported by this NSF award is driven by the goal of understanding the shape of the boundary of a number of moduli spaces that parametrize different types of families of algebraic curves. This project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The research aspects in this project fall into three interrelated categories, all with the common theme of investigating various compact moduli spaces of curves and what geometric and enumerative information can be gleaned from the structure of their boundary. In the first line of problems, the PI will study new classes of moduli spaces that can be realized as wonderful compactifications associated to certain complex reflection groups. These new moduli spaces provide a fertile testing ground for investigating the extent to which polyhedral methods can be generalized beyond toric varieties. In the second line of problems, the PI will introduce moduli spaces into the study of factorization problems in complex reflection groups. In particular, the primary objective is to study the polynomial structure of factorizations by constructing a suitable compactification of the associated moduli spaces of admissible covers. In the final line of problems, the PI will initiate a study of the tautological rings of the moduli spaces of pseudo-stable curves. These spaces provide alternative compactifications of the moduli spaces of curves that allow for curves with cuspidal singularities, instead of the usual nodal singularities, and progress in this research would lead to advances concerning the enumerative geometry of curves with cuspidal singularities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A special effort will be made to include speakers from under-represented groups and to encourage participants from under-represented groups. Information about these meetings may be found at: http://www.math.uci.edu/~krubin/ntg/number_theory.html<br/><br/>The lectures are research talks at the cutting edge of the field, given by international experts. The collaborations that are formed should lead to new ideas and useful research results in important areas of mathematics. The conferences bring together a critical mass of number theorists, in a way that each Southern California institution individually cannot do with its own seminars. The conferences also serve as a way to disseminate the latest research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Various properties of the L-functions are believed and have been proved in many special cases to encode deep arithmetic information. This research project is mainly concerned with congruences between special values of L-functions, as well as congruences between automorphic forms, which are multi-variable functions with many symmetries. This project also aims at applying these congruences to study the connection between the special values of L-functions and the sizes of arithmetic cohomology groups in some special cases. <br/> <br/>In this project, one aspect is the study of the congruences modulo powers of p between automorphic forms related to theta correspondence. This includes studying the p-adic properties of certain theta lifts by using suitable integral representations of L-functions and L-values for automorphic representations, constructing certain p-adic L-functions and constructing Hida families of theta lifts. The Iwasawa--Greenberg Main Conjecture predicts a connection between the p-adic L-functions and the Selmer groups attached to p-adic deformations of Galois representations. Another aspect of this project is to exploit the results on the congruences to study this conjecture in the special case of the Rankin--Selberg product of a pair of modular forms whose weights are of the same parity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are what we use to describe, predict and explain how objects move under a force (gravity, magnetism, etc.). They form the basis of the cryptographic systems which secure online banking, e-commerce, and electronic communication. They are used to model mechanical, chemical, biological, social and financial systems. Given a polynomial, we want to find its solutions.  How these solutions depend on the coefficients is one of the oldest and most fundamental questions in math.  The purpose of this project?s research is to use the full power of modern mathematics to develop a new understanding of this question. The education component of this project will build on the PI?s ongoing collaboration with choreographer Reggie Wilson and his Fist & Heel Performance Group to develop innovative STEAM curricula for middle school students on the interactions between math and black/Africanist dance. <br/> <br/>Given a polynomial, we want to find the simplest formula for its solutions, and to prove no simpler formula exists. Since the 17th century, ?simplest? has meant a formula using functions of the least number of variables. While solutions in 1-variable functions exist for low degree polynomials (up to degree 5), no such formulas are known beyond this.  At the beginning of the 20th century, David Hilbert conjectured that for polynomials of degree more than 5, no 1-variable formulas exist (his specific conjecture for degree 7 is 13th on his famous list of mathematical problems). Call RD(n) the minimal number of variables needed to write a formula of the general degree n polynomial.  In joint work with Benson Farb and Mark Kisin, and also in solo work, the PI has been working to revive the study of RD(n), to produce simpler formulas for high degree polynomials, and to develop methods capable of showing that RD(n)>1 for some n. By broadening the focus of investigation to encompass analytic and continuous analogues, the PI and his collaborators aim to bring the full suite of modern methods to bear on this problem, and shed new light on solutions of polynomials. For the broader impacts, the PI will build on his long-running collaboration with Reggie Wilson and the Fist & Heel Performance group to develop innovative STEAM curricula for middle school students on the interactions between black/Africanist dance and the mathematics it deploys, including fractals, braids, recursion, and more.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In string theory, a branch of theoretical physics, algebraic varieties are used to describe fine pieces of our universe. In this theory, everything is made of tiny strings which travel through spacetime, and trace out algebraic curves in some algebraic varieties. Gromov-Witten invariants, originating from physics, are virtual counts of algebraic curves in algebraic varieties satisfying prescribed incidence constraints. They are used in physic to describe the structures of our universe. They also provide new approaches and insights to classical problems from algebraic geometry. Despite their importance, these invariants are very difficult to compute. The primary goal of this project is to develop a new method to calculate Gromov-Witten invariants by investigating the boundary of the gauged linear sigma model from physics using tools of logarithmic structures from algebraic geometry. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project focuses on studying the geometry of the gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) using stable log maps of Abramovich-Chen-Gross-Siebert. The GLSM proposed by Witten in the 1990s can be viewed as a deep generalization of the hyper-plane property of Gromov-Witten invariants in all genus. However, the moduli stacks in GLSM which carry the perfect obstruction theory for defining GLSM invariants are in general non-proper. This presents a major difficulty in calculating GLSM invariants. Recently, log compactifications of hybrid-type GLSM were constructed by Chen, Janda, and Ruan using stable log maps. These compactifications provide proper moduli stacks carrying a reduced perfect obstruction theory whose associated virtual cycles recover the GLSM virtual cycles. This project is an integrated study aiming at a new computational method for calculating Gromov-Witten invariants by investigating the structures of the virtual cycles of these log compactifications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The principal investigator plans to explore new, fascinating properties of differentials as well as their moduli spaces.  Moreover, he plans to discover hidden connections between initially unrelated subjects in which differentials appear from different aspects.  The proposed project also opens many gates for student and postdoctoral research.  The principal investigator will continue to integrate his research with undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training as well as conference organizations.  In particular, he plans to advise student research projects, design new courses, and organize a series of workshops, with a focus on increasing diversity and supporting underrepresented groups.  <br/><br/>The moduli space of differentials on Riemann surfaces can be stratified according to the types of zeros and poles.

Fields are systems of numbers which can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided; for instance, the usual real numbers form a field, but the rational numbers, which can be expressed as fractions, form a smaller field of particular interest to number theorists.  Varieties are systems of simultaneous equations in a number of variables.  The PI is trying to understand the deep connections between these three concepts.  For instance, simple groups, the building blocks for all finite groups, can almost always be expressed essentially as the points of a variety over a finite field.

Group theory and algebraic geometry can be applied together to analyze the Galois action on Mordell-Weil groups of abelian varieties over Galois extensions. In a different direction, the project involves using algebraic geometry, alone or in combination with character-theoretic methods, to solve problems about finite simple groups.

Various phenomena across science and engineering can be modeled by systems of polynomial equations, which leads to natural interactions with other fields such as applied mathematics, biology, computer science, and mathematical physics. For systems of polynomial equations, one studies its sets of solutions, called varieties, and the corresponding shapes they describe in high-dimensional spaces. As the number of equations and variables grow larger, one useful approach to understand these shapes is to study the algebraic functions defined on them. Using this approach, many properties such as smoothness and degrees of varieties can be translated into algebraic terms. One such strategy is to study properties of varieties by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of sequences of algebraic objects called ideals. This project contributes to this line of research with problems originating from two directions that involve the study of these properties of ideals. The PI will also be involved in mentoring students and in organizing academic events, focusing on benefiting graduate students and underrepresented groups in mathematics.<br/><br/>The symbolic powers of an ideal encode important algebraic and geometric information of the ideal and the variety it defines. The PI will investigate the asymptotic behavior of homological invariants of symbolic powers such as, the number of generators, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, and the projective dimension. For the sequence of numbers of generators, the PI intends to investigate if it always has polynomial complexity, building of previous results by the PI and his collaborators. A general result in this direction would have important consequences on the arithmetic rank, Frobenius complexity, and Kodaira dimension of divisors. For the other two sequences, regularities and projective dimensions, the PI will focus on regular rings of positive characteristic. In such rings, a new class of ideals is defined for which it has been previously shown the limit of these sequences exist; this class includes several types of determinantal ideals, as well as the square-free monomial ideals. The PI will investigate the existence of these limits for more general classes of ideals. The relation between multiplicities and convex bodies is an important research topic lying in the interaction of Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Combinatorics. In recent years, this line of research has gained much activity due to the introduction of Newton-Okounkov bodies and mixed multiplicities of filtrations of ideals. The PI and his collaborators intend to find conditions for the non-vanishing of mixed multiplicities of multigraded algebras.  The PI will also investigate a notion of mixed multiplicities for filtrations of not necessarily zero dimensional ideals and the relation of these new multiplicities with the mixed volumes of certain Newton-Okounkov bodies.<br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole or rational number solutions of some equation of interest.  (For example, the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem. While it is straightforward to find all right triangles whose side lengths are rational numbers, it perhaps surprisingly remains an unsolved problem to determine which whole numbers can be the area of a right triangle with rational sides.) The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. One approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, p-adic methods have begun to be unified with Langlands's ideas into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program.""

Over the past few years, the PI has been involved in the study of certain such invariants by making use of tools from from Hodge theory and the algebraic theory of differential operators. In the present project, the PI plans to extend this study in several directions. For example, he plans to generalize his previous work with Popa from the case of singularities of geometric objects defined by one equation to more general such singularities. In a different direction, he intends to investigate one interesting numerical invariant of singularities--the minimal exponent--and its connections  with other invariants and points of view on singularities.

These ideals  can be defined naturally in the context of Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules. It turns out that the triviality of the Hodge ideals is governed by a numerical invariant,the minimal exponent, which is closely related to an important invariant in birational geometry, the log canonical threshold. While the minimal exponent has been studied a lot for isolated singularities, methods related to Hodge ideals allow treating the general case. There are two main components of the present project. In one direction, the PI intends to further investigate, with Popa, an extension of the theory of Hodge ideals beyond the case of hypersurfaces, by making use of the canonical filtration on local cohomology. There are several interesting questions in this context, concerning connections with the multi-variable version of the V-filtration and with the Bernstein-Sato polynomial for ideals.

The main point of departure from classical (or non-quantum) mathematics is the fact that by the very small-scale nature of our ambient world, certain pairs of measurable physical quantities cannot be measured simultaneously (with the momentum and position of a particle serving as the preeminent example). Mathematically, this manifests as the non-commutativity of a pair of transformations on a physical system, justifying the name ""noncommutative"" for the relevant field of study. The formal objects that model the symmetries (that is, structure-preserving transformations) of a physical system modeled according to this paradigm are known as a ""quantum groups"", and they are the central theme of the present research proposal. The training of graduate students is an important part of this project.<br/><br/>A number of broader themes inform the problems under consideration. As one example, discrete quantum groups, like their classical counterparts, fall into a constellation of taxonomic classes based on the approximation properties enjoyed by their group algebras. The quantum versions of the classical results are typically more technically demanding, only partially settled, and good test beds for the strengths of the geometric-group-theoretic and operator-algebraic techniques that jointly make classical discrete groups such rich geometric and analytical objects. In another direction, much light can be shed on the structure and above-mentioned approximation properties of quantum groups (discrete or more generally, locally compact) by category and representation-theoretic means. For that reason, results to the effect that group-theoretic data (e.g. the center of a locally compact quantum group) can be reconstructed from categories of unitary representations with their underlying structure are of some interest in the field and the project. As a third example, randomness features heavily in the study of groups and other discrete objects (probabilistic methods are very important in graph theory, for instance); the general phenomenon whereby a ""generic"" object, constructed randomly (with the technical meaning of that phrase depending on the specifics of the problem) tends to be highly asymmetric appears to replicate in the quantum setting, with ""most"" finite graphs, finite metric spaces, etc. admitting no quantum symmetries. Such generic rigidity results always recover their classical counterparts (given that quantum symmetries always encompass ordinary ones), but usually require more involved and often more enlightening proof techniques. It is hoped the requisite eclectic mix of approaches to the problems (combinatorial, representation-theoretic, probabilistic, operator-algebraic, etc.) will offer insight not only into the nature of the quantum-mathematical objects ostensibly being studied, but also into the classical versions thereof.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Number theory is one of the oldest areas in pure mathematics, which includes the study of integers and objects built out of them, such as integer solutions to equations. Apart from its fundamental role inside mathematics, number theory manifests important influences on our everyday life, for example, through cryptography. Representation theory, on the other hand, is the study of abstract objects, such as the symmetries of a cube (reflections and rotations that preserve the cube), using matrices and linear algebra. By realizing abstract objects as matrices, one can reduce abstract problems to questions in linear algebra, which are often easier to study.

Representation theory of groups and Lie algebras is a mathematical language for studying symmetries of different problems in natural sciences. In this project, the PI will study a certain modification of Lie algebras called Lie superalgebras. The term ""super"" means that in addition to the usual (even or ""bosonic"") symmetries we allow another kind: ""odd symmetries"", which behave in a certain sense ""like fermions."" Superalgebras are mathematical tools encoding the concept of supersymmetry developed in physics in the second half of the 20th century. The theory of symmetric monoidal (tensor) categories is an advanced framework in representation theory. Recent developments have uncovered deep connections between superalgebras and tensor categories. The PI  will study applications of these results that will shed new light on the theory of Lie superalgebras, and provide new tools and techniques for investigating supersymmetries. This research area has many open questions that are accessible accessible for beginning researchers and this proposal includes research projects to be undertaken by undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This proposal was submitted in response to the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 17-120: Special Guidelines for Submitting Collaborative Proposals under National Science Foundation (NSF) and US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) Collaborative Research Opportunities, and the proposed research will be pursued in collaboration with an Israeli researcher. Three projects are proposed. In the first project, the PIs will describe the conditions under which a natural generalization of the Jacobson-Morozov lemma holds for supergroups (and Lie superalgebras). This will be done using the theory of semisimplifications of tensor categories, in the spirit of recent work of Etingof, Ostrik, Andre, and Kahn. The PIs will then investigate the case when the condition on the supergroup does not hold and develop an analogue of the notion of a reductive envelope for supergroups. The second project concerns symmetric monoidal functors between representations of different Lie superalgebras. The PIs will study compositions of such functors and endomorphisms of such compositions. The third project concerns the periplectic supergroup, which is an interesting superanalogue of the orthogonal group. The PIs will answer open questions about representations of the periplectic supergroups, such as computing dimensions and characters of irreducible representations, as well as use Duflo-Serganova functors to study stabilization patterns in periplectic representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since there are many symmetries in nature, and since linear methods are powerful and efficient, this subject has found numerous applications in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science. Classically, representations of finite or compact groups were studied. The current project concerns representations of infinite, non-compact, algebraic groups, and the PI and his collaborator will study more recent mathematical structures such as Lie supergroups, quantum groups, and double affine Hecke algebras. Each of these topics has been an active area of modern mathematical research for many years, yet many important questions remain open. The resolution of the questions answered in this project will lead to significant new applications in number theory, combinatorics, and physics.<br/><br/>The main part of the project is dedicated to the study of automorphic representations and will be pursued by the PI and an Israeli collaborator D. Gourevitch. This is a subject of central importance in the Langlands program in number theory, and recently of much interest in string theory. The PI and Gourevitch will employ the method of Whittaker functionals, which are a traditional tool for studying large automorphic representations. However the PI and collaborators have recently introduced a more refined class of functionals, which are well-adapted to studying small representations. This will have applications to quantum gravity, where small automorphic representations arise as certain quantum corrections to Einstein's theory of general relativity. The second part of the project will study higher dimensional analogs of Dirichlet series, which generalize the celebrated Riemann zeta function. The PI will study these series using double affine Hecke algebra, which are a traditional tool for understanding the symmetries of Macdonald polynomials -- themselves a central object of study in algebraic combinatorics. The PI and collaborators have recently discovered a new class of representations of these algebras, called metaplectic representations, that hold considerable promise for studying multiple Dirichlet series. The third part of the project will develop the theory of Capelli differential operators. These operators have their origin in classical invariant theory, which comprised a large part of 19th century mathematics. They also played a key role in Atiyah-Bott-Patodi approach to the index theorem, which is a highlight of 20th century mathematics.

Students whose research overlaps with the topics chosen for the summer school will be given priority for funding.  The summer school at BB5 will bring students at different stages in graduate school together to explore the material in the mini-courses. This mix has proven successful for both the more junior and more senior graduate students in helping them reach their full potential in learning the material.  In addition to the mix of level of the students, the participants come from a diverse list of countries. The organizers strive to achieve a diverse mix of genders, ethnicities, and nationalities.

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole or rational number solutions of some equation of interest.  (For example, the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem. While it is straightforward to find all right triangles whose side lengths are rational numbers, it perhaps surprisingly remains an unsolved problem to determine which whole numbers can be the area of a right triangle with rational sides.) The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. One approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, p-adic methods have begun to be unified with Langlands's ideas into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, primarily of a geometric nature, and to use them to establish new instances of Langlands's conjectures. The award will support the training of students in this area of research that is considered of high interest.<br/><br/><br/>This project addresses the following fundamental question: what are the underlying geometric structures relating p-adic Galois representations to the mod p representation theory of p-adic groups? The project builds on several recent developments in which the various PIs have played key roles, including the construction of moduli stacks parametrizing p-adic representations of the Galois groups of p-adic local fields and of local models for these stacks, and recent extensions of the Taylor-Wiles patching method which relate it to the study of coherent sheaves on the local models, and to derived algebraic geometry. Some specific questions that the PIs will study are the problem of potentially crystalline lifts, the construction of a general p-adic local Langlands correspondence, and the possible local nature of the (a priori global) patching constuction.  More generally, the PIs intend to introduce algebro-geometric, categorical, and derived perspectives into the p-adic Langlands program, with the intention of gaining new insights into and making new progress on some of the key open problems in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current project is a study of Langlands duality, a synthesis of number theory and the geometry of symmetry that has been one of the most familiar names for this science for nearly two generations.   For most of this period, the emblem of this synthesis has been the theory of L-functions, a computable system for encoding properties in number theory and geometry that matches the two aspects of this common science.  More recently, new and sophisticated geometric techniques promise to reframe the synthesis from above, as part of a larger synthesis that ultimately extends to the most speculative ideas in mathematical physics.  The PI plans to revisit Langlands duality from this new geometric standpoint, and to understand the place of L-functions in this broader picture.<br/><br/>The project is a contribution to the arithmetic theory of automorphic forms, in the setting of the Langlands program, motivated in part by the geometric Langlands program. The specific goals of the present project are the study of the local Langlands correspondence, using trace formula methods, L-functions, and Galois theory to reduce the local Langlands correspondence to a conjecture on ""incorrigible"" representations; the study of derived aspects of the Langlands program, inspired by both in specific cases arising from coherent cohomology and in the development of a unified geometric framework for both Langlands reciprocity for cohomology of locally symmetric spaces and Venkatesh's conjectures on the actions of derived deformation rings on cohomology; the construction of p-adic square root L-functions in families, using the higher Hida theory introduced by Pilloni and Boxer; the completion of the proof of an automorphic version of Deligne's conjecture on special values of tensor product L-functions; and the development of a character theory for mod p representations of p-adic groups.

This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/><br/>The field of arithmetic dynamics is heavily motivated by analogies between arithmetic geometry and dynamical systems. One important such connection is that preperiodic points for endomorphisms of projective space play a role similar to torsion points on elliptic curves (or, more generally, abelian varieties). The focus of this project is to further investigate this analogy from the moduli-theoretic and Galois-theoretic perspectives. The PI has been involved with the development of the theory of moduli spaces that parametrize endomorphisms with marked preperiodic points -- analogous to classical modular curves, which parametrize elliptic curves with marked torsion points. Such moduli spaces have already played a fundamental role in progress toward the dynamical uniform boundedness conjecture of Morton and Silverman, a dynamical analogue of the Mazur-Merel strong uniform boundedness theorem for torsion points on elliptic curves. In order to make further progress on this difficult uniform boundedness problem, the PI proposes to study the geometry of dynamical moduli spaces attached to certain dynamically interesting families of functions (e.g., quadratic rational maps with a critical point of a given period). The analogy between preperiodic points and torsion points also lends itself to a dynamical analogue of Serre's open image theorem, a finite-index result for the adelic Galois representation associated to torsion points on elliptic curves. The PI proposes studying the appropriate Galois representation attached to (pre)periodic points for rational maps -- especially in the function field setting, where results will provide new insights into the geometry of dynamical moduli spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern research involves more sophisticated algebraic structures associated with algebraic varieties, such as the category of coherent sheaves (the notion of a category is a generalization of that of an associative ring). One part of the project is to establish some cases of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture which identifies categories appearing in geometry in two seemingly unrelated contexts.

This project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the first part of the project is on homological mirror symmetry for symmetric powers of punctured spheres. The goal is to identify categorical resolutions of derived categories of coherent sheaves on certain algebraic varieties with partially wrapped Fukaya categories of the symmetric powers of punctured spheres.

The second part is to work out a generalization of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula to the categories of matrix factorizations over non-affine varieties and stacks.

While the former three branches originate from quantum physics, the last one deals with applications of purely algebraic concepts to geometry. Representation theory concerns the study of symmetries of a vector space such as three-dimensional Euclidean space (more generally, an infinite dimensional space) with additional structures. These symmetries can be often thought of as algebraic structures such as groups, Lie algebras, or associative algebras. Two cases are of particular interest: (1) the case of sufficiently many pair-wise commuting symmetries, which is a primary subject of study in integrable systems, and (2) the case when the underlying vector spaces arise via generalized cohomology theories associated with geometric moduli spaces. This project aims at resolving several open questions pertaining to those cases through the study of shifted quantum groups; the first surprising connections of those novel algebras to Toda-like quantum (difference) integrable systems and quantized Coulomb branches were discovered in the recent work of the PI.<br/> <br/>The major theme of the proposed research is the study of shifted quantum affine algebras and the corresponding new structures on the quantized Coulomb branches. The project is broken down into five parts, as follows. The first part will investigate integral forms of shifted quantum affine algebras. One objective is to show that they map surjectively onto quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches and to describe explicitly the kernel of these maps using the shuffle approach. Another important structure to be constructed on such integral forms are coproduct homomorphisms: these will descend to the truncated counterparts, thus quantizing multiplications of the corresponding classical K-theoretic Coulomb branches. The second and the third parts of the project are aimed at the construction and study of monoidal categorification of the quantum cluster algebra structure on quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches via shifted quantum affine algebras, and a construction of new vertex operator algebras via shifted affine Yangians of gl(n). The fourth part deals with a novel approach to Lax matrices via antidominantly shifted quantum groups. This will bring new insights into now relatively old subject of the inverse scattering method. At the same time, it will also emphasize an overlooked importance of antidominant shifts, leading to a new study of Bethe subalgebras of the quantized Coulomb branches. This work will also provide a systematic construction of Baxter Q-operators, implying functional and TQ-relations for them.

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole or rational number solutions of some equation of interest.  (For example, the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem. While it is straightforward to find all right triangles whose side lengths are rational numbers, it perhaps surprisingly remains an unsolved problem to determine which whole numbers can be the area of a right triangle with rational sides.) The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. One approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, p-adic methods have begun to be unified with Langlands's ideas into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, primarily of a geometric nature, and to use them to establish new instances of Langlands's conjectures. The award will support the training of students in this area of research that is considered of high interest.<br/><br/><br/>This project addresses the following fundamental question: what are the underlying geometric structures relating p-adic Galois representations to the mod p representation theory of p-adic groups? The project builds on several recent developments in which the various PIs have played key roles, including the construction of moduli stacks parametrizing p-adic representations of the Galois groups of p-adic local fields and of local models for these stacks, and recent extensions of the Taylor-Wiles patching method which relate it to the study of coherent sheaves on the local models, and to derived algebraic geometry. Some specific questions that the PIs will study are the problem of potentially crystalline lifts, the construction of a general p-adic local Langlands correspondence, and the possible local nature of the (a priori global) patching constuction.  More generally, the PIs intend to introduce algebro-geometric, categorical, and derived perspectives into the p-adic Langlands program, with the intention of gaining new insights into and making new progress on some of the key open problems in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research goals are to use tools from number theory, probability, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory, to prove new results about a number of long standing open problems with significance in the world of pure mathematics, which also have the potential for real world applications. The Principal Investigarot will mentor graduate students on topics related to this award.<br/><br/>Quasicrystals are physical materials with highly ordered molecular structures, causing them to produce pure point diffraction patterns, but which also possess rotational symmetries that are forbidden by the classical Crystallographic Restriction Theorem. The discovery of these materials in the 1980's by Dan Shechtman revolutionized the world of crystallography and later earned Shechtman a Nobel prize. In the mathematical world the study, and even the existence, of quasicrystals is intimately related to the theory of aperiodic tilings of Euclidean space. Quasicrystals are often modeled by cut and project sets, which give an abundance of examples of such tilings and which, generically, are good examples of systems which possess `aperiodic order'. In the last decade there has been an explosion of insight linking problems in number theory with problems about cut and project sets. A number of unsolved problems in Diophantine approximation have been reformulated, and some have been solved, using ideas from the theory of mathematical quasicrystals. Major problems about sets with aperiodic order have also been solved by understanding the reverse connections. The research in this project is centered around well-known open problems such as the Littlewood Conjecture and the Pisot Conjecture, which are sitting on the border of these subjects. It aims to develop the theory around them in order to create progress in both the realms of pure and applied mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is because the real numbers form a number system called a completion of the rational numbers, and the solutions in a completion can usually be found more easily. One may hope to find the hard rational number solutions by scrutinizing the easier solutions living in the completions, but there may be a discrepancy between these two types of solutions. One central object in number theory designed to measure such a discrepancy is the Tate-Shafarevich group, and this group is only understood in some special cases. Two central conjectures (the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the Bloch-Kato conjecture) relate sizes of Tate-Shafarevich groups to special values of an appropriate function. This project outlines some progress on these conjectures via a theory called Iwasawa theory. Another goal is to understand the interplay between the special values from the perspective of a modern form of analysis, called p-adic analysis, and use this interplay to give an easy explanation of complicated phenomena of certain crystalline representations.<br/><br/>The Iwasawa main conjecture for elliptic curves at supersingular primes was proved by Wan in the case in which the trace of Frobenius vanishes, and the PI in the general supersingular case. The plan is to extend this work to more general modular forms. One central idea in the supersingular case is the construction of two appropriate p-adic power series, which is known explicitly by work of Pollack when the Frobenius trace is zero. The PI will work with Otsuki to explicitly construct the appropriate pair of p-adic power series in more general cases by developing the analytic aspect of supersingular Iwasawa theory further. One goal of such an explicit construction is determining reductions of crystalline Galois representations, shedding light on some conjectures of Breuil which describe these reductions purely in terms of the Frobenius trace and its Hodge-Tate weight. Another goal is to establish asymptotic formulas for the size of the p-primary components of Tate-Shafarevich groups as defined by Bloch and Kato, generalizing work of Lei, Loeffler, and Zerbes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI will continue to promote interactions between enumerative geometry, algebra and the theory of quantization in the direction emphasized in this project.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project is aimed at understanding a new point of view utilizing edge contraction operations of ribbon graphs.

Harmonic analysis involves breaking up a mathematical object such as a function into pieces that are easier to understand.  The beauty of this area is that the pieces are oftentimes simple, yet represent the whole with accuracy.  Number theory involves deceptively simple statements about the integers, easy to test, yet often difficult to prove.  Though seemingly disparate, analysis and number theory share many interactions. For instance, one can use intricate analysis of complex functions to answer fundamental questions about prime numbers.  This project explores a variety of problems at the interface of these two areas.  In particular, the PI will consider discrete variants of operators in analysis, which enjoy applications in fields such as medical imaging and cosmology.  To analyze these operators, continuous techniques often fail, and one has to develop number theoretic techniques adapted to the underlying geometry of the analytic problem. The PI seeks to provide new bounds, new techniques, sharper analysis and broader connections.  The PI also plans to bring Fourier analysis, a fundamental decomposition of the time-frequency domain, such as that used to understand waves, into the emerging field of arithmetic statistics.  Here she seeks to provide sharp counts of a wide variety of objects of arithmetic interest, such as elliptic curves used in cryptography.  As a broader impact, the PI will spark new mathematical conversations between analysts and number theorists and also improve the educational and scientific climate for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project addresses several fundamental questions at the interface of analysis and number theory.  Firstly, the PI pursues bounds for discrete variants of continuous operators in harmonic analysis that involve integration over a curved subvariety.  These bounds provide quantitative distributional facts about the underlying Diophantine equations that define these varieties, which makes them different from their continuous counterparts.  In particular, since continuous techniques usually do not carry over in this setting, the PI will develop refined number theoretic techniques to bound several operators, including multilinear spherical variants, variants defined over the primes, and higher codimensional analogues.  In particular, the higher codimensional study should open new avenues of problems as very little is known in this setting. Solving these problems has connections to discrete geometry, lattice point counts of surfaces, and Falconer's distance conjecture.  In another series of problems, the PI will pursue ""sparse bounds"" for both continuous and discrete operators.  Sparse bounds are a refinement of Lebesgue space bounds that allow one to deduce weighted estimates.  Finally, the PI plans to pursue a far reaching program in arithmetic statistics.  This is an area greatly developed on the algebraic side recently. The PI plans to inject Fourier analytic techniques to obtain precise lattice point counts that are adaptable to take advantage of the power of the algebraic techniques and push those bounds even further.  In particular, the PI hopes to obtain counts on certain objects such as elliptic curves, with an eye to not only developing techniques, but also fostering interactions between number theorists and analysts in new ways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, as people have attempted for a very long time to use algebra in order to understand problems in geometry, and at the same time one that has seen some of the most outstanding modern developments and connections with areas of pure and applied science. The main aim of the project is to connect parts of algebraic and complex geometry that have previously been quite disjoint; in particular, it uses new tools (called Hodge modules), relying heavily on topology and analysis as well, in order to classify geometric shapes and singularities. This approach is generating numerous projects for Ph.D. students and the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will continue applying the theory of mixed Hodge modules to concrete problems in complex and birational geometry. He will also continue developing the theory of Hodge ideals, in collaboration with M. Mustata. This has been completed for Q-divisors, providing an extension of the theory of multiplier ideas in this setting, but new ideas need to be brought into play in order to obtain a similar picture for ideal sheaves, or for local cohomology. One hopes that this will lead to further interesting applications. In their work the PI and Mustata have already obtained applications regarding the singularities of theta divisors, hypersurfaces in projective space, or minimal exponents. In addition to further consequences along these lines, they will use the proposed extensions in order to study, for instance, effective bounds for linear series, or roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial. The PI has also been involved in applying the theory of Hodge modules towards the study of the variation of families smooth projective varieties of varieties, e.g. Brody hyperbolicity or Viehweg-type questions for parameter spaces.

Nevertheless, it still offers many difficult unsolved questions. The core part of this project is to tackle these questions with cutting-edge modern methods coming from the homological mirror symmetry program. Homological mirror symmetry is a deep geometric duality that originates in quantum field theory and has been used in studying novel phenomena and proving unexpected results in symplectic geometry suggested by algebraic geometry. This project aims to use homological mirror symmetry to introduce new applications of symplectic topology to algebraic geometry and to answer classical open questions in birational geometry. A postdoctoral fellow will be involved in various aspects of this research project.<br/><br/>This project will use an approach based on categorical Kähler geometry. The most notable application of this approach is toward proving the non-rationality of generic, four-dimensional cubics, which is arguably the central problem in algebraic geometry. More specifically, a detailed study of the singularities of quantum D-modules produces a completely new type of birational invariant. This new invariant is a canonical decomposition of the cohomology of a four-dimensional cubic based on simultaneous use of both (algebraic and symplectic) sides of homological mirror symmetry. The example of four-dimensional cubics is only the tip of the iceberg. There are many other potential applications of this approach, for example to uniformization problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference is aimed at early-career mathematicians (especially graduate students) and is to be held September 7-12, 2020, at the Centro Internacional de Encuentros Matematicos (CIEM) in Castro Urdiales, Spain. The summer school is primarily for the purpose of training young researchers and encouraging their mastery of the subject area.  It will begin with three days of introductory lectures, followed by three days of more advanced lectures introducing the students to some current hot topics in the mathematical area of representation theory. The conference has three organizers and five speakers, representing a total of six countries. Hence, by allowing U.S.-based students to attend the summer school, this grant will stimulate important international collaboration and networking in the area.   Women and members of other groups underrepresented in mathematics are especially encouraged to participate, as building a network of peers early in one's research career has been shown to be especially crucial for staying active and visible in the field.<br/> <br/>The summer school will encourage cross-pollination between the two related (but sometimes seemingly distant) fields of character theory and module theory.  Many of the recent advances and open conjectures in the area of representation theory have made it clear that there is a strong benefit to combining the techniques from both sides.  The introductory lectures are designed for graduate students and postdocs with a good background in algebra but no prior knowledge in representation theory. They will cover the general theory from two different points of view: one focusing on the more numerical, character-theoretic point of view, and the other on the homological, module-theoretic point of view.  These courses will have a strong focus on arriving at some of the key definitions and concepts in block theory. The second part of the summer school will be aimed at showing the students some of the current directions of representation theory and how both perspectives play a role in some of the fundamental conjectures in the area.  Throughout the summer school, lectures will be alternated with discussion and problem sessions led by the speakers and organizers.  By providing students with an intensive introductory series of courses and lectures on current hot topics in the area, the summer school aims to motivate young researchers to use their talents to advance the state of knowledge in the area and to inspire a new generation of well-rounded representation theorists.

When considered as parts of larger and more abstract number systems, for example those containing imaginary numbers, there are several ways primes may factor. The splitting behavior of prime numbers is a fascinating and mysterious part of nature, and number theory is concerned with studying it systematically, especially by connecting it with the arithmetic of polynomials and the geometry of their solution sets. Over the past several decades, the Langlands program has revealed striking connections between these solution sets of polynomials and sets of symmetries that naturally occur in infinite-dimensional spaces. It has been especially fruitful in the Langlands program to consider the way these symmetries deform within families, and this project approaches two outstanding problems in this area by using the framework of Whittaker models to make them more concrete, or to turn them into explicit computational problems.<br/><br/>Spaces of Whittaker functions of automorphic forms are called Whittaker models. Symmetries in Whittaker models capture what is needed to construct L-functions in the Langlands program, in many cases. This project will study the deformation theory of Whittaker models in order to understand the behavior of Langlands reciprocity with respect to congruences modulo prime numbers, and with respect to deformation in families. The first goal is to generalize Ihara?s lemma by controlling congruences between automorphic forms in terms of their local Whittaker models. The approach is to use a computer to test, in many examples, the congruences that can occur in the action of the local Iwahori-Hecke algebra on a non-Eisenstein integral eigenform. The second goal is to formulate, and prove in the banal case, a local Langlands conjecture in families for reductive groups other than the general linear group, especially quasi-split groups that split over a tame extension. The approach is to construct a moduli space of Langlands parameters, study its geometry, and use converse theorems to connect it to the integral Bernstein center.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mirror symmetry originated in physics as a duality between superconformal quantum field theories. This duality has been interpreted in a consistent, powerful mathematical framework called Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) that has led to dramatic developments in how the mathematical community approaches ideas from theoretical physics, and indeed our conception of space itself. <br/><br/>Today HMS is established as one of the most powerful frameworks for building bridges between seemingly unrelated parts of modern geometry.  Traditionally HMS has been incredibly successful in discovering novel phenomena and proving unexpected results in symplectic and contact topology informed by algebraic geometry. The goal of this conference is to highlight the flow of ideas in the opposite direction: from symplectic to complex geometry. The conference will summarize recently developed connections between Hodge Theory and HMS which have striking algebraic applications and give new insights into rationality problems. In particular, the conference will focus on new cutting-edge directions of investigation: (1) birational invariants and gluing of D-modules; (2) extending the scope of Homological Mirror Symmetry; (3) categorical Kaehler geometry; and (4) topological recursion.

Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, as people have attempted for a very long time to use algebra in order to understand problems in geometry, and at the same time one that has seen some of the most outstanding modern developments and connections with areas of pure and applied science. The main aim of the project is to connect parts of algebraic and complex geometry that have previously been quite disjoint; in particular, it uses new tools (called Hodge modules), relying heavily on topology and analysis as well, in order to classify geometric shapes and singularities. This approach is generating numerous projects for Ph.D. students and the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will continue applying the theory of mixed Hodge modules to concrete problems in complex and birational geometry. He will also continue developing the theory of Hodge ideals, in collaboration with M. Mustata. This has been completed for Q-divisors, providing an extension of the theory of multiplier ideas in this setting, but new ideas need to be brought into play in order to obtain a similar picture for ideal sheaves, or for local cohomology. One hopes that this will lead to further interesting applications. In their work the PI and Mustata have already obtained applications regarding the singularities of theta divisors, hypersurfaces in projective space, or minimal exponents. In addition to further consequences along these lines, they will use the proposed extensions in order to study, for instance, effective bounds for linear series, or roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial. The PI has also been involved in applying the theory of Hodge modules towards the study of the variation of families smooth projective varieties of varieties, e.g. Brody hyperbolicity or Viehweg-type questions for parameter spaces. He will extend this study to families of singular varieties, especially those that appear in the theory of moduli of higher dimensional varieties according to Kollár and others, perhaps using those Hodge modules that extend variations of mixed Hodge structure.

A fundamental example of this micro-to-macro phenomenon is seen in the ubiquity of the bell curve, which describes many distributions seen in nature, even when they come from different sources. The project will help uncover the analog of the bell curve for fundamental behaviors of numbers.<br/><br/>Specifically, the distribution of class groups of number fields and function fields will be studied using tools from probability, random groups, arithmetic geometry, algebraic geometry, topology, and number theory.  The project will develop models of random groups that are good approximations for class groups and their non-abelian analogs, and determine the basic probabilistic structure of these models.  Tools from algebraic geometry and topology will be used to prove that distributions of class groups of function fields have behavior that agrees with what is predicted by the models.  This will exhibit new structure in the class groups of number fields and their non-abelian analogs."

Historically it has played an important role in mathematics because analyzing a given mathematical object, for example a system of equations, is often dramatically simplified when the object is symmetric in a suitable abstract sense. Symplectic geometry, on the other hand, grew out of Hamiltonian mechanics and today occupies a prominent place in mathematics due to the wide range of contexts, for example in topology and algebraic geometry, where the underlying geometric structures of Hamiltonian mechanics appear. This research project aims to advance understanding of both subjects, as well as unearthing deep new connections between them, by leveraging new ideas from algebraic combinatorics, in particular the recently developed theory of cluster algebras. These connections are in turn all informed by recent advances in mathematical physics, specifically string theory and supersymmetric gauge theory.<br/><br/>On the side of representation theory, the main objects of study in this project include the affine Grassmannian and its relatives, in particular their derived categories of equivariant coherent sheaves. On the side of symplectic geometry, the main objects are categories of Lagrangian branes or microlocal sheaves in noncompact symplectic 4- and 6-manifolds. In the former context, cluster structures appear at the level of the equivariant K-rings of the geometric objects involved, and describe certain combinatorial structures inherited by these rings. In the latter, cluster structures appear on moduli spaces of Lagrangian branes in 4 dimensions, or through Hall algebra-type constructions based on Fukaya categories in 6 dimensions. Through its combinatorial nature the language of cluster algebras provides a means of isolating tractable aspects of otherwise very rich and complicated mathematical objects, as well as uncovering new relations between these objects."

The theory of endoscopy, a special but very important case of functoriality, attracted immense efforts in the past thirty years, leading to breakthroughs such as the proof of the Fundamental Lemma and the endoscopic classification of automorphic representations of classical groups. Going beyond these remarkable achievements requires new techniques and ideas. In recent years, exciting new ideas have emerged, which have the potential to renew our vision of the whole subject. The conference will focus on three main topics: (1) the relative Langlands program, (2) relations between special values of (higher) derivatives of L-functions, and (3) beyond endoscopy and possible new cases of functoriality.

Chip-firing games, which are based on redistributing items throughout a network or graph, have appeared in a wide variety of mathematical and computational areas over the past three decades.  They originated in dynamical systems as part of the abelian sandpile model, the first known example of a system to display an important property known as self-organized criticality. A more recent perspective has treated chip-firing games on graphs as a discrete, combinatorial tool for studying algebraic curves. This has led to a deeper understanding of the connections between the mathematical fields of graph theory and algebraic geometry.  A key concept in this framework is the divisorial gonality of a network, which measures how difficult certain chip-firing games are to win on that network; this number has already been connected to key invariants from graph theory, such as treewidth. This project will deepen understanding of chip-firing games from a computational perspective, first designing and then implementing efficient algorithms for studying these games and their difficulty. Once implemented, these tools will be used for research in such disparate fields as algebraic geometry, graph theory, and dynamical systems, as well as in classrooms as pedagogical tools. In addition to these mathematical applications, the chip-firing problems that are known to be computationally difficult will serve as a good benchmark for computational methods and techniques. This project involves undergraduate students in the research, providing those students with key skills for future careers in both pure and applied areas of STEM.<br/><br/>The project will consider several versions of gonality, on both finite and metric graphs: divisorial gonality, the minimum degree of a positive rank divisor on a graph; geometric gonality, defined in terms of harmonic morphisms to a tree; stable divisorial gonality, which allows for refinements before computing the divisorial gonality; and higher gonalities, which ask for the minimum degree of a divisor with prescribed rank. Although purely combinatorial in nature, these topics connect deeply to such areas of algebraic geometry as tropical geometry, Berkovich theory, and Brill-Noether theory. There are three main components of the overarching project: (1) To study the theoretical aspects of computing graph gonality and related topics vis-a-vis computational complexity.  This includes studying the computational complexity of bounding the different versions of gonality, both in general and for special classes of graphs; designing algorithms for computing gonalities; and studying questions with important computational consequences, like finding upper and lower bounds on gonalities. Key tools here will be modifications of such existing algorithms as Dhar's burning algorithm. (2) To implement computational tools for studying chip-firing games on graphs. This will include tools for both combinatorial and metric graphs, which will also be made freely available to both researchers and teachers. (3) To apply these tools to study chip-firing games, graph theory, and algebraic geometry.  Such projects include studying gonality of random graphs, investigating long-standing conjectures on graph gonalities, performing computations relevant to algebraic curves, and investigating embedded aspects of tropical geometry.  In some cases, the computations themselves will be of paramount importance; in other cases, they will simply guide the direction of research in fruitful directions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Establishing such a connection will greatly advance our understanding of both subjects, and provide novel tools for studying two-dimensional CFTs. In implementing this project, new research opportunities will be created for undergraduates and early graduate students. These research opportunities will be supported by grant funding. The PI will also provide direct support for preexisting programs which seek to increase access to mathematics among women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>In more detail, one component of the project is to find an equivalence of (ribbon tensor) categories between the representation category of the so-called triplet vertex algebra, and the representation category of small quantum SL(2). Such an equivalence was conjectured by mathematical physicists in the mid-2000?s, and some explicit progress has been made towards its resolution in recent works of the PI and others. A positive resolution to this conjecture will provide the first direct link between logarithmic CFTs and quantum groups, a phenomenon which should be endemic among the most fundamental classes of logarithmic CFTs. A second component of the project is the computation of the Balmer spectrum for small quantum groups associated to arbitrary simple algebraic groups. This computation will employ and establish new links between support theory and geometric representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum groups are a large class of such objects that encapsulate the structure of certain highly symmetric models in statistical mechanics. Though the origins of quantum groups are in statistical physics, their underlying structures appear also in probability theory, string theory, and combinatorics. This project will apply the theory of quantum groups to study solutions of differential equations that appear in certain physical models known as quantum integrable systems and probabilistic models of random matrices.<br/><br/>In more detail, the project focuses on quantum affine algebras and q-KZB systems, Macdonald theory and its affine generalizations, and integrable random matrix models.  In previous work, the investigator related traces of intertwiners of quantum affine algebras to certain theta hypergeometric integrals and proposed so-called affine Macdonald conjectures.  The first part of the project will use a representation-theoretic approach to prove these and related conjectures.  The second part of the project studies Whittaker and Macdonald-Koornwinder functions from the perspective of finite-type quantum groups.  The third part of the project applies methods motivated by quantum integrable systems to the asymptotic study of eigenvalues of certain sample covariance matrices arising in statistics."

Moduli spaces are of great significance in algebraic geometry and number theory, and a great number of perspectives have developed in order to study them. This conference aims to bring together a diverse group of mathematicians, ranging from early career graduate students to experts in this field, to discuss the big questions and techniques surrounding the study of moduli spaces. The conference will consist of five plenary lectures as well as multiple short talks by early career mathematicians. More details can be found at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/madisonmoduliweekend/home.<br/><br/>Moduli spaces parametrize families of objects of interest, up to a notion of isomorphism. Their study has motivated the development of many areas in arithmetic and algebraic geometry, in addition to having a significant impact on them. These include, but are not limited to the study of modular curves, Shimura varieties, Hurwitz spaces and the theory of stacks. The goal of this conference is to talk about both the arithmetic and the geometry of moduli spaces. The plenary speakers of this conference study moduli spaces in various contexts, including rational points, vector bundles, the theory of stacks, Brauer groups, K-theory and Hodge theory. Four of the five plenary talks will be preceded by preparatory talks aimed at graduate students and early postdoctoral researchers. The conference is aimed at an audience of mathematicians with a broad interest in algebraic geometry and number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reductive group is a special kind of topological groups with abundant symmetries. These symmetries are the guidelines to understanding the intrinsic structures of objects in our universe. The study of reductive groups dates back to the late 19th century. Two of the most important areas are the representation theory of reductive groups and automorphic forms (which is a special kind of functions with extra symmetry) on reductive groups. This project aims to understand the restriction of representations of reductive groups to a spherical subgroup, and to understand the period integrals of automorphic forms.<br/><br/>This project is to study the local multiplicities and global period integrals of spherical varieties, as well as their connections to L-functions and arithmetic geometry. Locally the goal is to prove the multiplicity formula and local trace formula for general spherical varieties. Another goal is to prove comparisons between orbital integrals of some relative trace formulas, as well as comparisons between the derivative of some orbital integrals and some height pairings. The main method used in the local theory is harmonic analysis on reductive groups. Globally the goal is to study various relations between period integrals and automorphic L-functions. Another goal is to understand the nontempered terms in the space of square-integrable automorphic forms for the general linear groups in terms of orbital integrals. The methods used in the global theory are the residue method, the relative trace formula, and some ideas from the theory of beyond endoscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

March 8, 2020. This conference will facilitate interactions between students and faculty from institutions in the Southwest who have interests in ring theory. The study of rings, in the broadest sense, is crucial to many branches of mathematics, including commutative and non-commutative geometry, group representations, number theory, coding theory, and cryptography. Algebraists in the Southwest region pursue research on a variety of topics under the umbrella of pure and applied ring theory. The meeting will bring together students and faculty from a variety of institutions for inspiring talks, with ample time for scientific interaction, providing opportunities for participants to begin new collaborations and catalyzing new research projects. About 70 participants are expected, including students and young and senior faculty from throughout the South and Southwestern USA. The participation of students from underrepresented minority groups, women, untenured faculty, and faculty at non-Ph.D. granting institutions is particularly encouraged. Six experts will deliver hour-long talks on topics within their areas of specialty. The lectures are intended to be accessible to graduate students. The meeting will also feature three hour-long poster sessions in which the participating students will present their research. <br/> <br/>Participants will discuss several key problems in commutative algebra, including progress on finding bounds for Betti numbers, a topic that has significant implications for classical problems in combinatorics and algebraic geometry, including Cayley-Bacharach theory. Several speakers work in combinatorial or computational algebraic geometry and will also shed light on connections between these fields and commutative algebra. Finally, the research expertise of one speaker is in Representation Theory, providing an opportunity to introduce ring theorists to problems in a different field close to their areas of work.
