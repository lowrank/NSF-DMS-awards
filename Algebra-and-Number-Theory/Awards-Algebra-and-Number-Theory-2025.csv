The primary objective of these conferences is to discuss significant recent advances in Quantum Symmetry and explore the interplay between various research areas, while providing an environment that supports wide participation and career development. These conferences will bring together graduate students working on their masters or Ph.D.s, postdoctoral researchers, early-career researchers, and established experts in Quantum Symmetries to catalyze research progress by disseminating recent discoveries in the field, sharing open problems, hosting new and ongoing collaborations, and mentoring early-career participants. By creating a network of researchers amongst the participants, the conference series will strengthen ties between regional institutions and support the breadth of subtopics being investigated in the region as well as the range of personnel performing these investigations. The topic of these conferences is Quantum Symmetry broadly viewed, but anchored in the mathematics modeling quantum behavior with the goal of advancing knowledge in Quantum Symmetry.<br/><br/>Quantum Symmetry is a fundamental concept that permeates mathematics and physics, providing deep connections between topological, conformal, and more general quantum field theories and algebraic structures such as vertex operator algebras, Hopf algebras, tensor categories, and higher categories. These areas of mathematics study the structures which give rise to precise models for quantum behavior and are crucial for progress in applications such as quantum computing and error correction, enhanced encryption, and resolving the physical models of quantum mechanics with Einstein?s theory of relativity. The interconnectedness of these many subfields within the field of Quantum Symmetry makes the interdisciplinary collaborations and cross-fertilization of ideas facilitated by these conferences all the more important.

The set of points with complex coordinates which satisfies a fixed system of equations gives a geometric object is called an algebraic variety. The classification of algebraic varieties is the main motivation of the PI's field of birational geometry. On the other hand, arithmetic geometry is the study of polynomial equations whose coefficients are integers. This allows more tools from number theory to be used to study the corresponding varieties. The field of arithmetic geometry has recently seen an explosion of new techniques leading to spectacular progress. The PI's research on this project will apply these new techniques to problems in birational geometry which were previously out of reach. The educational component of the project involves several initiatives designed to increase access to a career in mathematics. This includes creating a summer school introducing high school students to mathematical proofs using the Lean proof assistant. <br/><br/>The project centers on interactions between birational and arithmetic geometry. New techniques from arithmetic geometry involving perfectoids and prisms have made it possible to overcome significant difficulties in mixed characteristic birational geometry, mainly related to the failure of cohomology vanishing theorems. These vanishing theorems are the primary method used in inductive arguments throughout birational geometry over the complex numbers, and their replacement in mixed characteristic promises significant advances. The main overarching objective of the projects will be to develop more powerful ways to replace vanishing theorems in mixed characteristic. The first application will be to study the singularities of integral models of Shimura varieties, which are an important class of varieties in arithmetic geometry. The PI will also investigate generalizing the theory of log canonical centers to mixed characteristic, which will enable him to investigate other problems in birational geometry such as boundedness and moduli of Fano varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups may be understood as collections of symmetries, whose study was motivated by the desire to understand the symmetry of an object, whether it be in nature, art, communication networks, or any other place that symmetry might play a role. Group theory has applications in physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences. In recent years, research in group theory has had a significant impact on technological advances, such as in cryptography and coding theory. Representation theory is a tool used to better understand the structure of a group and the symmetries it represents by providing a way to view an abstract group as a group of matrices, whose structure is often easier to understand. This project focuses on a number of problems which seek to relate the representation theory of a finite group to the structure and representations of certain so-called local subgroups, which reflect numerical information encoded by the group. The award will also support educational activities centering graduate student mentorship and undergraduate research. These activities include local workshops for Colorado-area graduate students and postdocs and a Directed Reading Program. The latter provides a ""research-like"" experience for undergraduates, in which undergraduate mentees and graduate mentors work under the guidance of the PI to study a topic outside of the students? normal coursework. The activities in the grant also include supervising undergraduate researchers, Ph.D. students, and postdocs, who will work with the PI on problems within the scope of the project.<br/><br/>The problems of primary interest in this project are related to variations and consequences of the McKay?Navarro (MN) and Brauer?s Height Zero (BHZ) Conjectures. The PI and collaborators have recently proved the case of the prime 2 of the MN Conjecture, and many of the goals in this proposal are also aimed at establishing strategies for attacking the case of odd primes. In the case of BHZ, which was one of the longest-standing local-global conjectures, the PI and coauthors completed the proof of the conjecture in its entirety, and have been working toward stronger forms of the conjecture. The problems will involve the study of blocks of groups of Lie type, the action of Galois automorphisms on characters of groups of Lie type, and the interaction between the two. Since the effect of various group actions on parameterizations of characters is an especially problematic component in a number of local-global conjectures and other main problems regarding the representations of groups of Lie type, this is of interest to many other problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representation theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with the study of symmetry using techniques from linear algebra, such as vectors and matrices. Classical examples of symmetry include rotations of a circle and reflections of a square. Modern research in mathematics naturally encounters more abstract notions of symmetry and requires the development of more advanced techniques for their study. The PI will identify and study concrete instances of these abstract symmetries and apply the results to advance the mathematical understanding of quantum field theory in dimensions two and three. The research will also develop new connections between algebra, representation theory, and low dimensional topology. This project integrates education, research, and career training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Examples include creating a series of videos which will improve the algebra education of Utah's high school mathematics teachers-in-training, and organizing the graduate student focused Moab Topology Conference.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will engage in three related research projects. Each project is motivated by and has direct implications for the long-standing conjecture that Rozansky-Witten theory, a three dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theory, defines a non-semisimple topological field theory. In the first project the PI will further develop and extend the theory of relative modular categories and their associated non-semisimple topological field theories to find new connections with homological blocks of 3-manifolds. In the second project the PI will develop the representation theory of affine L-infinity algebras and unrolled quantum groups and use the results to construct abelian approximations of Rozansky-Witten theory. In the third project the PI will extend his work on twisted equivariant matrix factorizations to construct non-semisimple, possibly unoriented, topological field theories for Landau-Ginzburg theory and explore their interpretation as Rozansky-Witten defects. The physical origins of the representation theories considered suggest many non-trivial interrelations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI will continue to push these directions, as well as new ones stemming from the attendant technological developments. Furthermore, the project will integrate these pursuits with significant outreach, training, and mentorship efforts encompassing students across all tiers of education from primary to undergraduate to graduate. For example, PI will continue to organize outreach to local schools, research experiences for undergraduates, and graduate training workshops and mentorship opportunities. <br/><br/>Some of the specific research problems are as follows. The PI will further develop his new approach with Le Hung to the Breuil?Mezard Conjecture, which is based on an analogy with mirror symmetry, in order to cover general groups and fields. The PI will also extend the higher Siegel?Weil formula, proved for non-singular terms in joint work with Yun?Zhang, to more general terms, with the eventual goal of completing a higher version of the Kudla program over function fields. In another direction, the PI will geometrize the classical theory of the Weil representation, and the local theta correspondence, for p-adic groups. These have applications to the categorical Local Langlands correspondence, especially towards Langlands functoriality and the explicit construction of eigensheaves. The PI will supervise and mentor several Ph.D. students and postdocs on projects within these themes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, a problem formulated by Diophantus in the third century, when translated into the language of a polynomial equation, amounts to determining the rational solutions (x, y) to the equation y^2 = x^6 + x^2 + 1. This problem remained unsolved until the work of Wetherell in 1997.  Studying this algebraic equation from the point of view of geometry yields a curve, and more precisely, a curve of genus 2.  While curves of genus 2 or more are known to have finitely many rational points by the work of Faltings in 1983, as of yet there is no algorithm to determine these finite sets in general. In particular, when the curve?s Jacobian rank is equal to or larger than the genus, there are many challenges that remain. In this project, the PI will study methods for explicitly determining the finite set of rational points on curves of genus 2 or more.  The PI will also organize educational activities to build the mathematical pipeline and mentor students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>One promising approach for determining the finite set of rational points on curves of genus 2 or more, regardless of Jacobian rank, is through Kim's nonabelian Chabauty program and the computation of Selmer sets.  Kim has conjectured that Selmer sets in depth n are finite for n sufficiently large, and that moreover, that these Selmer sets eventually precisely cut out the set of rational points.  Several components of the first nonabelian part of this program (i.e., in depth 2) have been made algorithmic by the PI and her collaborators. In this project, the PI proposes a careful study of Selmer sets in depth 2 and 3 for new classes of curves. She will do this by carrying out explicit computations that are motivated by Kim?s conjecture. Additionally, she will compute rational points on a new database of curves in the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), using all available Diophantine tools at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More precisely, the shapes are complex projective manifolds and the linear invariants are Hodge structures. The famous ?Hodge conjecture?, first presented in 1950 at the International Congress of Mathematicians, states that the essential geometry of a complex projective manifold is recovered by its Hodge structure. As one of the Millennium Prize Problems, this conjecture has attached to it a one million dollar prize for a solution. While complex projective manifolds involve a bit of abstraction to define, they are fundamental objects in mathematics and physics; for example, the ?Calabi-Yau varieties? are a certain class of complex projective manifolds which can appear as the small dimensions of the universe in string theory. The main research goal of this project is to study the Hodge structures of Calabi-Yau varieties?to both gain insight into Hodge theory more generally for all complex projective manifolds, and to increase the depth of our understanding of Calabi-Yau varieties. Beyond pure research goals, the educational impact will be to develop an active community of young researchers and PhD students focusing on this circle of ideas.<br/><br/>The project will continue lines of research of the PI on toroidal compactifications of Calabi-Yau moduli. Recent joint work of the PI with V. Alexeev constructs a modular toroidal compactification of the moduli space of degree 2d polarized K3 surfaces. One research goal is to extend this work to hyperkahler and Calabi-Yau varieties, with an eye towards understanding the combinatorial structure of degenerations. Additionally, the project aims to study and prove general results concerning variations of Hodge structure (VHS). Joint work of the PI with S. Tayou is advancing our understanding of finiteness properties of Z-polarized VHS, and it now seems within reach that conjectures of Deligne and Simpson on the algebraicity of the non-abelian Hodge locus can be resolved. The approach is novel, incorporating ideas from hyperbolic geometry. The PI will also pursue results about period mappings for Calabi-Yau variations of Hodge structure, such as questions of boundedness of moduli of Calabi-Yau varieties of various classes, and under what circumstances Torelli theorems hold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These shapes arise naturally in physics, robotics, computer vision, statistics, and many other areas of science. Homotopy theory is the study of shapes up to deformation. Deformations provide a degree of flexibility to the study of varieties, which makes some difficult problems more tractable. A measurement that is not affected by deformations is called an invariant. Such measurements provide crucial information about varieties. This project will develop new invariants for varieties and offer novel reformulations of known, important invariants. A key feature of the invariants that will be developed is their validity in any number system, rather than just in the real or complex numbers. This will establish new connections between algebraic geometry, number theory, and low-dimensional topology. This project includes mathematical training opportunities for students across the country.<br/><br/>There are three primary goals to the project. The first is to understand the motivic Euler characteristic, which is a quadratic form whose rank is the compactly supported Euler characteristic, of Hilbert schemes of K3 surfaces. This will involve a characterization of the Hasse--Witt invariants of the motivic Euler characteristic in terms of the bad reduction of the scheme. Other arithmetic aspects of these motivic Euler characteristics will also be studied. The second goal is explain the behavior of unstable local degrees in motivic homotopy theory under field extensions. In contrast to the stable case, the transfer map of the unstable local degree fails to be a homomorphism. The PI will construct an obstruction in Milnor--Witt K-theory to the homomorphicity of the transfer map. The payoff of the second goal is a toolkit for certain problems in enumerative geometry. The third goal of the project is to relate Levine's quadratic Donaldson--Thomas invariants, which are algebraically defined, to the Casson invariant in low-dimensional topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As an illustration, one can draw a circle through most configurations of three points in the plane --- but the circle ""disappears"" when the three points specialize onto a line. The goal here is a systematic understanding of what happens, in higher dimensions as the points specialize onto a hyperplane (a higher-dimensional analog of a line in the plane), or as the points collide in various ways. The PI will complement this, and other research projects described below, by educational activities for students at several educational stages, including teaching problem-solving skills to middle and high school students through math competitions, supervising undergraduate research projects, and running a summer school in algebraic geometry for graduate students.<br/> <br/>In addition to interpolation problems for curves passing through special configurations of points, the PI will also pursue several research projects concerning the geometry of moduli spaces of curves, which are geometric objects whose points classify algebraic curves.

Second, the PI will use quadratic equations satisfied by realizations of curves in projective space to more deeply understand the birational geometry of these moduli spaces.

Mathematicians Don Zagier and Alexander Goncharov proposed that these properties might be explained through deep connections with a highly abstract subject: algebraic K-theory of fields. Clarifying this connection is a central goal of the proposed project. The research aims to uncover new links between algebraic K-theory and multiple polylogarithms, with potential applications in number theory, topology, and mathematical physics. The project also provides training opportunities for graduate students and contributes to the development of an online database of 19th-century mathematical problems, a resource intended to support mathematical education at multiple levels.<br/><br/>This project investigates the relationship between algebraic K-groups of fields, multiple polylogarithms, and cluster structures. These K-groups are believed to encode deep arithmetic and geometric information, as evidenced by their connections to the special values of zeta functions (Borel), mixed motives (Bloch), and hyperbolic geometry (Goncharov). Recent advances in homotopy theory have enabled the PI and collaborators to conceptualize how multiple polylogarithms can emerge from the topology of the K-theory spectrum. This framework offers new tools to address longstanding conjectures in the Goncharov program. Key objectives include proving the Goncharov conjecture in weight three, advancing a weak form of the Zagier conjecture, and proving a conjecture of Beilinson?MacPherson?Schechtman. The project also explores potential compatibilities between Goncharov?s and Rognes? conjectures. In a parallel direction, it investigates new polylogarithmic equations derived from topological data, especially those linked to cluster algebras via homotopy-theoretic methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Hardy-Littlewood (circle) method applies Fourier series to count solutions of Diophantine equations. Studied since ancient times, these are equations to be solved in integers, whose properties remain a central focus of modern research. In general, the circle method uses subtle aspects of Fourier series in the guise of exponential sums, tools that contribute to tests for equidistribution (apparent ""randomness"") of number theoretic sequences used in computer science and cryptography. Despite the recent renaissance in the Hardy-Littlewood method, the current understanding of its nuances remains plagued by basic mysteries that stand in the way of ambitious applications in analytic number theory that would be transformative in nature. The Principal Investigator will explore these frontiers of the subject, delivering progress on model problems that should enhance our understanding of the most difficult regions of the Fourier space in applications. Informed by these advances, novel approaches, some only recently established and others speculative in nature, will be employed to address fundamental problems concerning Diophantine equations, congruences and equidistribution, opening new avenues for future research. This project will also involve training graduate students in this promising new technology, and work will continue on a text making this research available to the wider mathematical community.<br/> <br/>Two great mysteries of the Hardy-Littlewood method concern the nature of contributions in circle method integrals of points with large height, and the relation of special subvarieties of solutions to the associated Fourier analysis. In mean values of exponential sums over polynomials of larger degree, the provenance of points on low degree subvarieties contained in the associated hypersurfaces remains speculative. Three goals will be addressed in this project that address these mysteries. First, height-scaling techniques will be applied in the circle and related methods to obtain new conclusions concerning the representation of arithmetic sequences by higher degree forms. This will provide novel approaches to understanding the representation of integers in such sequences as the squarefree numbers by polynomials of large degree. Second, novel generalizations of the delta-function technique will be investigated, offering access to Diophantine problems of higher degree.

To elaborate, algebraic geometry is the study of systems of polynomial equations.  Hodge theory seeks to understand the shape of the algebraic spaces defined by their solution sets.  In so doing, it produces powerful connections between algebraic geometry and other parts of mathematics and physics, such as number theory, differential equations, and string theory.  Normal functions are solutions to differential equations arising from algebraic cycles (or subspaces) on an algebraic space.  By recognizing a solution as a normal function, which is a nontrivial task, one gets access to its behavior at numerous ""special"" points.  In the scenarios to be considered in this project, these ""special values"" have important applications to identities and conjectures in number theory, the classification of algebraic spaces such as Fano varieties and algebraic curves, and the spectra of operators in topological string theory.  This project will also help to train the next generation of researchers in pure mathematics, by integrating the PI's graduate students in work on specific problems in Hodge theory and bringing outside consultants to Washington University.  Results will be disseminated through conferences, summer schools, journal articles, and websites.<br/><br/>Normal functions originated in the work of Poincare and Lefschetz in the early 20th century.  They are to families of algebraic cycles what period maps are to families of algebraic varieties:  the basic Hodge-theoretic invariant.  Informally, they are given by integrals of differential forms on non-closed chains instead of topological cycles, and satisfy inhomogeneous differential equations instead of homogeneous ones.  The PI will study the properties, invariants, classification, and geometric realization of normal functions.  The settings and applications range from arithmetic geometry and number theory to mirror symmetry, moduli, and mathematical physics.  The specific goals of this project are to:  (I) produce new evidence for the Beilinson and Bloch-Kato conjectures on special values of L-functions, and provide motivic realizations of biextensions; (II) describe an A-model variation of mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology of a Fano variety, and a B-model Lefschetz principle governing normal functions on LG-models; and (III) classify and realize normal functions with values in Hermitian and hypergeometric variations of Hodge structure, with applications to moduli of curves, hypergeometric identities, and quantization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry is the field of mathematics that studies the geometric shape of objects defined by polynomial equations. Often, the shape of these objects, called algebraic varieties, reflects the complexity of the defining equations and vice-versa. For instance, from the defining equations, we can understand if the algebraic variety has singularities, i.e., whether the geometric object has sharp points at which the curvature changes abruptly. These points are known as algebraic singularities. This project aims to develop new tools to understand algebraic singularities and apply these techniques to understand algebraic varieties of positive curvature.  As part of the broader impacts of this project, the PI will run online research seminars for graduate students related to the proposed research. The PI will initiate a summer reading program in algebraic geometry for undergraduates. The educational component of this project includes training in algebraic geometry for graduate students. Two summer research schools will be hosted at UCLA by the PI and experts in the field to train the new generation of mathematicians in birational geometry.<br/><br/>Fano varieties are considered one of the three building blocks of projective varieties. There has been a lot of progress towards understanding the geometry of Fano varieties in the last few decades. Nevertheless, the understanding of log terminal singularities (the local analog of Fano varieties) is far from being satisfactory. Complexity is an invariant that allows us to understand how far a Fano variety or a log terminal singularity is from being toric, i.e., defined by binomial equations. In this project, the PI will develop techniques to understand Fano varieties and log terminal singularities of small complexity, for instance, complexity zero, one, and two. There are two guiding principles: understanding the connection between the complexity and minimal log discrepancies (in the local setting) and understanding the connection between the complexity and anti-pluricanonical systems of Fano varieties (in the global setting). The PI aims to apply the former to study the termination of flips and the latter to understand the classification of cluster type Fano varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One is the study of Galois groups, which describe the hidden symmetries of solutions of equations. The other is the study of L-functions, which are powerful tools to count particular types of numbers, including prime numbers.

Probabilistic models allow mathematicians to develop models that predict the properties a mathematical object will likely have, even when it is not possible to know with certainty what properties it has. Another approach is by multiple Dirichlet series, which mathematicians create by modifying a number-theoretic problem until its solution is as symmetrical as possible, and then use these symmetries to find a solution to the original problem. The Principal Investigator will develop new probabilistic models and new multiple Dirichlet series, and use them to make progress on fundamental number-theoretic problems. Furthermore, the project also develops connections with other areas of mathematics - the Principal Investigator's work on probabilistic models will lead to new results in probability theory, while the work on multiple Dirichlet series will demonstrate connections between these series, topology, and quantum algebra, leading to new results in those areas. The Principal Investigator will also train future mathematicians. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigator and collaborators will work in several interrelated directions. One will construct new multiple Dirichlet series, with clear potential applications to moments of L-functions, by a novel unifying perspective on multiple Dirichlet series. The second will construct probabilistic models for the Galois group of the maximal unramified extension of a random number field, and then probabilistic models for the entire absolute Galois group. The third will give probabilistic models for statistics of L-functions that fit them more closely than the previously considered probabilistic models. The probabilistic perspective will also lead to new evaluations of moments of L-functions, by better understanding the main term in problems where separating the main term from the error term is difficult.

Humans have studied them for millennia. Number theory aims to understand patterns possessed by whole numbers. Fundamental questions revolve around multiplication: how often are numbers in some sequence even (i.e. divisible by two)? Divisible by three? Or five? Nineteenth century researchers introduced symmetry actions to reveal hidden patterns in numbers. And, in the 1970's, Robert Langlands made far-reaching conjectures on symmetry. These conjectures have occupied number theorists ever since. They predict patterns seen by symmetry actions will arise equally from the calculus of complex numbers (""modular forms""). A pattern appearing in two places is an example of a mathematical reciprocity. This project will refine Langlands' reciprocity prediction. The new tool is geometric spaces of symmetry actions, constructed by Emerton and Gee over the past fifteen years. These spaces are believed to convert reciprocity questions into geometrical ones. This project establishes instances of this belief. It will connect divisibility patterns from the world of modular forms to geometrical theorems on Emerton and Gee's spaces. The project has substantial broader impacts. Computational data will be included in the widely-used L-functions and Modular Forms Database. The project also develops computational tools for teaching. Open education resources (OERs) are learning materials placed in the public domain. Their primary benefit is providing learning experiences at low costs. They can be adapted to fit a diversity of learning environments. The project develops OERs for computer-based learning of number theory and abstract algebra. The project supports education and outreach in two more ways. First, Math Circles will be run in public schools. Second, research projects will be developed to support the Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists. Finally, the project plans two research workshops in number theory. Both aim to disseminate new advances in number theory and reciprocity. <br/><br/>The more detailed aim is a new study of p-adic slopes of modular forms and Galois representations. The p-adic slope of a modular form is how often its p-th Hecke eigenvalue is divisible by a fixed prime p. Predictions and theorems on slopes have been around since the 1980's. Seven years ago, Bergdall and Pollack proposed a way (""the ghost conjecture"") to unify almost all prior ideas. The ghost conjecture's input is a congruence class of modular forms. The output is an elementary recipe for slopes in the class. The main caveat is the ghost conjecture only applies to ""regular"" classes. But, assuming regularity, Liu, Truong, Xiao, and Zhao (LTXZ) recently established the conjecture. The current project removes the regular assumption in the ghost conjecture. The new tool is Emerton and Gee's (EG) moduli stack of Galois representations. In Galois terms, regularity is a generic property on the EG stack. The project's technical innovation is thus deforming slope questions over the stack. A geometrical reformulation will open the door to generalizing the LTXZ proof. It will also create space for novel studies of Hilbert modular forms or higher rank automorphic forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program is focused on several overlapping aspects of interest in representation theory: combinatorial, number-theoretic, and new developments using machine learning. The program will bring together experts in these subjects, visiting Sydney in overlapping intervals of one to three weeks, with the aim of bringing together and encouraging new collaborations amongst a diverse international cohort of mathematicians working in different aspects of representation theory. Two workshops will be held during the six-week program. Senior scientists in residence will explore relations between the aforementioned aspects of representation theory through their expertise in  the following topics: combinatorics of Coxeter groups, total positivity, and emerging geometric methods on the representation theory of p-adic groups. <br/><br/>In more detail: (1) Combinatorics of Coxeter groups is one of the central interfaces between Lie theory and combinatorics. Of particular interest is the recent suggestion that techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence can be applied to problems in Coxeter combinatorics. (2) Current interest in total positivity comes from multiple directions--the recent resolution of conjectures on the topology of Lusztig?s totally nonnegative flag varieties, the development of a theory of algebraic groups over a semifield, and the discovery of deep relations with scattering amplitudes in particle physics. (3) Progress in the theory of representation theory of p-adic groups has been fueled by geometric perspectives in representation theory. Of particular interest is the relationship between geometric and categorical approaches within the context of existing algebraic constructions of representations of p-adic groups.

With origins in the 19th century study of prime numbers by Riemann and Dirichlet, this rich family of functions often serve as a bridge connecting several areas of mathematics including Diophantine equations, geometry, representation theory, and analysis. Examples arise both in the study of solutions to polynomial equations and in the theory of highly symmetric functions known as automorphic forms. The paradigm of the Langlands program indicates that the rich symmetry properties of automorphic forms may be used to prove properties of arithmetic L-functions, which have a wide array of applications. In the modern relative Langlands program, we now have a conjectural framework to make this relationship precise in terms of a duality between L-functions and certain invariants of automorphic forms known as ""periods"". In this context, the relative trace formula (RTF) provides a powerful tool from harmonic analysis to decompose an automorphic period into its ""irreducible components or modes"" which are often directly related to special values of L-functions. While such a formula is often the only tool available to establish the relationship alluded to above, the theory of the relative trace formula is still incomplete. In this project, the PI will explore several problems in the relative Langlands program using recently developed tools. In addition to providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student projects in this rapidly developing field, this project also supports several educational goals including the organization of seminars and the founding of a graduate student workshop designed to foster interaction among the area's graduate students in automorphic forms and offer opportunities to develop skill in giving professional presentations.<br/><br/>This project will complete the PI's theory of endoscopy in the relative setting and establish the stabilization of a large family of RTFs by developing a theory of twisted relative endoscopy, transfer factors, and variants of Ngo's geometric stabilization in the context of symmetric varieties. Each step will be informed by the connection between relative endoscopy and the duality conjectures of Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh, with a secondary goal of better understanding these conjectures in the arithmetic setting via the geometric aspects of the relative trace formula. The PI will apply these tools to applications in arithmetic geometry and the relative Langlands conjectures. This includes the case of generalized unitary Friedberg-Jacquet periods, with applications to the arithmetic geometry of certain Shimura varieties. A novel component of this project is to combine these two branches and develop a novel ""arithmetic"" theory of endoscopy, and to prove new endoscopic arithmetic fundamental lemmas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This goals of this conference are: (1) to support research in  algebra and related topics in our region; (2) to promote excellence in research and scholarship among faculty from a diverse mathematical background related to commutative algebra at the institutions in the Southeast of the United States; (3) to encourage students to attend a world class conference in order to become acquainted with experts and build a successful career; (4) to bring together speakers from diverse mathematical fields that are connected through homological commutative algebra; and (5) to promote diversity and inclusion by working to ensure significant participation of researchers from underrepresented groups. The conference will consist of a series of talks given by senior faculty, junior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and students.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, number theory, and invariant theory are the primary fields of applications of commutative algebra. In its modern shape, commutative algebra originated in the works of several well-known mathematicians, especially Dedekind, Hilbert, Kronecker, Krull, Kummer, and Noether, during the nineteenth century and was vastly developed later in the outstanding work of Grothendieck on modern algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. In the 1950's, homological algebra (that originates from algebraic topology) made its way into the commutative algebra toolbox in the works of Auslander-Buchbaum and Serre to help with solving open problems in commutative algebra. Connections between commutative algebra, representation theory, combinatorics, and deformation theory appeared in the past century in numerous places as well. This conference focuses on topics in the above-mentioned fields that are tightly connected (and can be applied) to fundamental problems in homological commutative algebra such as problems related to the betti numbers and minimal free resolutions, relative homological algebra, properties of subcategories of the module category, and vanishing of homology and cohomology modules.

In recent years, there have been several major advances in the field of Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Cycles. Arithmetic Geometry is the study of spaces from the point of view of number theory and is largely concerned with the solutions of polynomial equations, especially over the integers. Algebraic K-Theory and Algebraic Cycles are certain special techniques that can understand the geometric nature of a problem, one that is again defined in terms of polynomial equations. In recent years there have been a number of important developments in this area and the purpose of the week-long workshop and conference is to bring together established experts in these areas along with early-career researchers with the goal of stimulating further progress.<br/><br/>In more detail, in recent years there have been major developments in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Cycles, leading up to the solution of the Milnor, Bloch-Kato and Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures, as well as the conjectures of Thomason and Morel concerned with equivariant phenomena for actions of linear algebraic groups. The powerful techniques introduced for the solution of the above conjectures have stimulated work on several outstanding remaining problems in the area, which are often arithmetic in nature, but use sophisticated tools from Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic cycles. The goal of the program is to focus on several of the outstanding problems in the area, surveying the progress made and planning strategies for further advancement.

Many leading researchers in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic Geometry, K-Theory, Topology and related topics will be speakers in this meeting and outline current research they and their collaborators are pursuing in these areas. The collective theme is that they were all worked on by John Tate and in some cases started by him. John Tate proved many fundamental theorems, but perhaps more importantly, he demonstrated new ways of thinking about mathematics that show no signs of slowing more than half a century after he introduced them. The majority of the funds will be used to assist with expenses for junior faculty and graduate students without other means of support, to attend and participate in the meeting. <br/><br/>John Tate founded or strongly influenced many of the primary areas of study within algebraic geometry and number theory: his thesis, which gave a different way of looking at zeta and L-functions of number fields, the cohomological reformulation of local and global class field theory, arithmetic duality, nonarchimedean analysis, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, algebraic K-theory of local and global fields, p-adic Hodge theory, and conjectures on algebraic cycles. All of these are active areas of study. The conference will explain in detail how Tate's ideas and results have shaped the field in a fundamental way and are still leading to major advances. This conference will help inspire the current and next generation of mathematicians to extend and go beyond what is presently known in these areas. <br/><br/>Conference website: https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/the-legacy-of-john-tate-and-beyond/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project deals with the recent resurgence of integrable systems in the context of algebraic geometry and representation theory, motivated by the study of quantum field theories. The results of the research are expected to elucidate the phenomenon of three-dimensional mirror symmetry originally discovered in theoretical physics. Broader impacts include establishing an interdisciplinary program for mathematics and physics students. The project contains undergraduate and graduate student research topics and aims for vertical integration of research and education. The PI will also co-organize several conferences designed for early-career researchers. The project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis program, the Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project deals with the geometric realization of several points of view on the Bethe ansatz approach to quantum integrable systems. One approach uses quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations emerging naturally in the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties. Another one relies on the study of QQ-systems, generalizing the relations satisfied by the Baxter operators. The geometric realization of QQ-systems is derived from the properties of the difference equation version of oper connections on the projective line, generalizing the correspondence between oper connections and Bethe equations for the Gaudin model. The PI plans to show how these geometric points of view on the Bethe ansatz are bonded together within the framework of the quantum q-Langlands correspondence.

This includes work in additive combinatorics concerning generalizations of Szemerédi's theorem on arithmetic progressions (sequences of numbers that are all equally spaced, like 4, 6, 8, and 10), which, informally, says that any sufficiently large collection of whole numbers contains a long arithmetic progression. It is a central problem in additive combinatorics to determine how large ""sufficiently large"" is. The investigator will study versions of this question involving more complicated patterns than arithmetic progressions, and then use the results and techniques developed to make progress on a related problem in ergodic theory. The investigator will also study the size and structure of integer distance sets, which are sets of points whose pairwise distances are all whole numbers. This award will support undergraduate summer research on representation theory and additive combinatorics, and also support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigator will build on her previous work on quantitative bounds for subsets of the integers lacking polynomial progressions of distinct degrees and for subsets of vector spaces over finite fields lacking a certain four-point configuration to tackle more general polynomial, multidimensional, and multidimensional polynomial configurations. The results for multidimensional polynomial configurations of distinct degree will then be used to make progress on the Furstenberg--Bergelson--Leibman conjecture in ergodic theory, which concerns the pointwise almost everywhere convergence of certain nonconventional ergodic averages. She will also investigate the size and structure of integer distance sets, in both the Euclidean plane and in higher dimensions, by encoding them as subsets of rational points on certain families of varieties and then studying these varieties. With her undergraduate students, the investigator will study the distribution of entries in the character tables of symmetric groups and some algorithmic problems in higher-order Fourier analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory of dynamical systems has its roots in celestial mechanics and has become an important tool in many other scientific fields. The proposed research deals with the question of whether a given dynamical system has rigidity properties, namely whether different trajectories must display a lot of common patterns. The principal investigator will conduct research on the topic, collaborate with other researchers, work with graduate and undergraduate students, and disseminate ideas developed in the project. The principal investigator will also organize seminars and conferences. In particular, the principal investigator will organize a series of research workshops for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will try to determine properties of certain classes of dynamical systems of group theoretical or number theoretical origins. One of such classes are actions on smooth manifolds by higher-rank commutative groups or by lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups. These actions are often expected to have rigidity, a phenomenon characterized by the scarcity of invariant structures under the action.  Another proposed line of research is the study of some special cases of the Mobius disjointness conjecture. These include certain distal topological systems and other systems whose trajectories have strict patterns in sufficiently long term.
