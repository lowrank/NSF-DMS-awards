This goals of this conference are: (1) to support research in  algebra and related topics in our region; (2) to promote excellence in research and scholarship among faculty from a diverse mathematical background related to commutative algebra at the institutions in the Southeast of the United States; (3) to encourage students to attend a world class conference in order to become acquainted with experts and build a successful career; (4) to bring together speakers from diverse mathematical fields that are connected through homological commutative algebra; and (5) to promote diversity and inclusion by working to ensure significant participation of researchers from underrepresented groups. The conference will consist of a series of talks given by senior faculty, junior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and students.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, number theory, and invariant theory are the primary fields of applications of commutative algebra. In its modern shape, commutative algebra originated in the works of several well-known mathematicians, especially Dedekind, Hilbert, Kronecker, Krull, Kummer, and Noether, during the nineteenth century and was vastly developed later in the outstanding work of Grothendieck on modern algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. In the 1950's, homological algebra (that originates from algebraic topology) made its way into the commutative algebra toolbox in the works of Auslander-Buchbaum and Serre to help with solving open problems in commutative algebra. Connections between commutative algebra, representation theory, combinatorics, and deformation theory appeared in the past century in numerous places as well. This conference focuses on topics in the above-mentioned fields that are tightly connected (and can be applied) to fundamental problems in homological commutative algebra such as problems related to the betti numbers and minimal free resolutions, relative homological algebra, properties of subcategories of the module category, and vanishing of homology and cohomology modules.

Recent breakthroughs surrounding Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem and three-term arithmetic progressions have led to significant progress in these areas. Moreover, the associated techniques are frequently intertwined and generate unexpected insights when applied to problems that may at first seem unrelated. A striking example is the relationship between decoupling in harmonic analysis and efficient congruencing in number theory. Connecting experts from these cognate fields in a workshop-style environment will foster cross-disciplinary collaborations and lead to seminal research papers.<br/><br/>  https://www.icms.org.uk/DiophantineEquations<br/><br/>  https://www.icms.org.uk/DiophantineEquationsEmergingResearchers<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The algebraic geometry research community has a tradition of running a Summer Research Institute every ten years. The institute convenes researchers from around the world to discuss the developments of the past decade and to chart out the most pressing and far-reaching problems for the next decade. The next Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry will take place immediately following the Bootcamp at Colorado State University from July 14 to August 1, 2025. The Bootcamp is aimed at advanced graduate students and early postdocs and has two main goals: first, to familiarize participants with a broad range of developments in algebraic geometry in an informal setting prior to the start of the Research Institute, and second to provide a venue for early-career researchers in algebraic geometry that will foster peer and near-peer collaborations. <br/><br/>The Bootcamp will focus on fifteen areas in algebraic geometry that have seen significant developments in the past decade. Topics include birational geometry and applications, advances on algebraic curves and their moduli, derived algebraic geometry and Bridgeland stability, perfectoid geometry with applications to positive and mixed characteristics, Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas theory, K-stability and moduli spaces of higher dimensional varieties, and combinatorial geometry.

This is a research conference in several areas of Mathematics. Many leading researchers in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic Geometry, K-Theory, Topology and related topics will be speakers in this meeting and outline current research they and their collaborators are pursuing in these areas. The collective theme is that they were all worked on by John Tate and in some cases started by him. John Tate proved many fundamental theorems, but perhaps more importantly, he demonstrated new ways of thinking about mathematics that show no signs of slowing more than half a century after he introduced them. The majority of the funds will be used to assist with expenses for junior faculty and graduate students without other means of support, to attend and participate in the meeting. <br/><br/>John Tate founded or strongly influenced many of the primary areas of study within algebraic geometry and number theory: his thesis, which gave a different way of looking at zeta and L-functions of number fields, the cohomological reformulation of local and global class field theory, arithmetic duality, nonarchimedean analysis, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, algebraic K-theory of local and global fields, p-adic Hodge theory, and conjectures on algebraic cycles. All of these are active areas of study. The conference will explain in detail how Tate's ideas and results have shaped the field in a fundamental way and are still leading to major advances. This conference will help inspire the current and next generation of mathematicians to extend and go beyond what is presently known in these areas. <br/><br/>Conference website: https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/the-legacy-of-john-tate-and-beyond/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes work in additive combinatorics concerning generalizations of Szemerédi's theorem on arithmetic progressions (sequences of numbers that are all equally spaced, like 4, 6, 8, and 10), which, informally, says that any sufficiently large collection of whole numbers contains a long arithmetic progression. It is a central problem in additive combinatorics to determine how large ""sufficiently large"" is. The investigator will study versions of this question involving more complicated patterns than arithmetic progressions, and then use the results and techniques developed to make progress on a related problem in ergodic theory. The investigator will also study the size and structure of integer distance sets, which are sets of points whose pairwise distances are all whole numbers. This award will support undergraduate summer research on representation theory and additive combinatorics, and also support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigator will build on her previous work on quantitative bounds for subsets of the integers lacking polynomial progressions of distinct degrees and for subsets of vector spaces over finite fields lacking a certain four-point configuration to tackle more general polynomial, multidimensional, and multidimensional polynomial configurations. The results for multidimensional polynomial configurations of distinct degree will then be used to make progress on the Furstenberg--Bergelson--Leibman conjecture in ergodic theory, which concerns the pointwise almost everywhere convergence of certain nonconventional ergodic averages. She will also investigate the size and structure of integer distance sets, in both the Euclidean plane and in higher dimensions, by encoding them as subsets of rational points on certain families of varieties and then studying these varieties. With her undergraduate students, the investigator will study the distribution of entries in the character tables of symmetric groups and some algorithmic problems in higher-order Fourier analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The CA+ conference series was held six times previously on the campuses of the host institutions: the University of Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin, and Iowa State University.  The format of the conference series allows for 50 minute talks by 7 experts in commutative algebra and related fields, but also structured professional development sessions and short talks by graduate students.  While many speakers and participants will come from the upper Midwest, the organizers will strive to gather a diverse audience, both mathematically and demographically.<br/><br/>The CA+ Conference series was conceived to build a community of researchers in commutative algebra and to forge connections with mathematicians in related fields, such as combinatorics, algebraic geometry, and topology.  This is partly achieved by inviting speakers from these fields and allowing time for them to interact with students and postdocs in the region.  The next two meetings will continue the practice of matching speakers with students during lunch to discuss career opportunities and research ideas.  A new aspect of these meetings will be a follow-up discussion in which the groups can share with all participants the best advice from the small group discussions.
