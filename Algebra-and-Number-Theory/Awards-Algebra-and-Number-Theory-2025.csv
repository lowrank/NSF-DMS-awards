High degree polynomials and their corresponding shapes can be used to model various real world phenomena, and therefore play an important role in fields such as mathematical physics, cryptography, computer vision, and optics. By varying the coefficients of the polynomials, one varies the corresponding shapes and this leads to the problem of moduli in algebraic geometry, which concerns the construction and study of parameter spaces for algebraic shapes. This research will use new techniques inspired by differential geometry to construct parameter spaces for such shapes in higher dimensions. Additionally, the project includes educational activities aimed at training the next generation of mathematicians.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project focuses on K-stability, which is an algebraic notion introduced by differential geometers to characterize the existence of certain canonical metrics on complex projective varieties. While the notion initially seemed difficult to understand algebraically, in the past decade algebraic geometers have made significant progress in understanding this notion in the case of Fano varieties. This progress has culminated in the development of a projective moduli theory for K-semistable Fano varieties over the complex numbers. This project aims to extend these ideas to develop new moduli theories for higher dimensional varieties. One direction involves extending the Fano K-moduli theory to work over the integers in low dimensions. Another direction focuses on using ideas from K-stability to construct moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau varieties. This direction will focus on both specific examples (e.g., K3 surfaces and abelian varieties) and general theory. The project also includes educational activities to train young mathematicians. These efforts include completing a book on K-stability, organizing an undergraduate summer mini-course on algebraic geometry, and hosting a weekend graduate student workshop on a topic in algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These phenomena are in the same general ballpark as topological insulators (states of matter with exotic electronic properties that are of modern interest in materials science) and the topological framework for quantum computing. The specific quantum theories in question connect directly to a classical object in the mathematical study of knotted loops of string, called the Alexander polynomial and first introduced in the 1920s. Quantum theories connected to the Alexander polynomial are expected to be easier to understand and to shed light on related quantum theories, e.g. the Chern-Simons theories that are used for topological quantum computing. Preliminary work leading up to this project has indicated that a well-known 1990s-era quantum theory for the Alexander polynomial should satisfy better structural properties than has previously been supposed. This project will elucidate these structural properties and use them to advance our understanding of related quantum theories. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>In more technical detail, the project will study the Frohman-Nicas topological quantum field theory (TQFT) for the Alexander polynomial from the point of view of decategorified Heegaard Floer homology. On the Heegaard Floer side, the most general formulations of the theory involve a topological construction called sutured 3-manifolds, but the connection between sutured 3-manifolds and the Frohman-Nicas TQFT, or related Chern-Simons TQFTs, has been largely unexplored up to this point. This project will generalize and reinterpret the Frohman-Nicas TQFT in the setting of sutured 3-manifolds, establishing better functoriality properties than the ones that hold in the non-sutured setting. It will also develop an elaboration of this sutured Frohman-Nicas TQFT that is sensitive to Spin-c structures on 3-manifolds, and work out how the result relates to the type of Spin-c decorated TQFT that plays a prominent role in modern work of Gukov, Putrov, Vafa, and others on nonsemisimple 3d TQFT in the Chern-Simons context. Going beyond the sutured setting, it will show how the sutured Frohman-Nicas TQFT arises from a more fundamental construction assigning a certain representation category to a point.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Commutative algebra provides the local algebraic framework for algebraic geometry?a central area of modern mathematics concerned with understanding the geometric structure of solution sets to systems of polynomial equations. These solution sets, known as algebraic varieties, appear throughout mathematics and are often challenging to study due to their intricate geometric and algebraic features. To address these challenges, the principal investigator will investigate the rich multigraded structures that naturally arise in many such varieties. This research will generate new insights at the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics while contributing to the training and development of the next generation of mathematical scientists. The project also includes mentoring and training of graduate students, as well as fostering a learning community at the principal investigator?s home institution for those interested in related research topics.<br/><br/>The research will center on four main directions, each guided by the unifying presence of graded or multigraded structures. The first project aims to develop new formulas in elimination theory, compute the defining equations of certain blowup algebras, and establish novel criteria for detecting integral dependence. These formulas and computations will have important tangible applications in singularity theory and applied areas like geometric modeling. The second project aims to study the multidegree and K-polynomials of multiprojective varieties?for example, by investigating the saturated Newton polytope and Lorentzian properties. This work will advance the understanding of combinatorially-defined polynomials, such as skew Schur, Schubert, and Grothendieck polynomials. The third project aims to investigate key structural properties of the Hilbert scheme of a multiprojective space. The guiding theme is to understand the closed subschemes of a multiprojective space and their possible deformations. The fourth project aims to describe nonreduced scheme structures using Noetherian differential operators. This approach will provide innovative applications of differential operators in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The set of points with complex coordinates which satisfies a fixed system of equations gives a geometric object is called an algebraic variety. The classification of algebraic varieties is the main motivation of the PI's field of birational geometry. On the other hand, arithmetic geometry is the study of polynomial equations whose coefficients are integers. This allows more tools from number theory to be used to study the corresponding varieties. The field of arithmetic geometry has recently seen an explosion of new techniques leading to spectacular progress. The PI's research on this project will apply these new techniques to problems in birational geometry which were previously out of reach. The educational component of the project involves several initiatives designed to increase access to a career in mathematics. This includes creating a summer school introducing high school students to mathematical proofs using the Lean proof assistant. <br/><br/>The project centers on interactions between birational and arithmetic geometry. New techniques from arithmetic geometry involving perfectoids and prisms have made it possible to overcome significant difficulties in mixed characteristic birational geometry, mainly related to the failure of cohomology vanishing theorems. These vanishing theorems are the primary method used in inductive arguments throughout birational geometry over the complex numbers, and their replacement in mixed characteristic promises significant advances. The main overarching objective of the projects will be to develop more powerful ways to replace vanishing theorems in mixed characteristic. The first application will be to study the singularities of integral models of Shimura varieties, which are an important class of varieties in arithmetic geometry. The PI will also investigate generalizing the theory of log canonical centers to mixed characteristic, which will enable him to investigate other problems in birational geometry such as boundedness and moduli of Fano varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups may be understood as collections of symmetries, whose study was motivated by the desire to understand the symmetry of an object, whether it be in nature, art, communication networks, or any other place that symmetry might play a role. Group theory has applications in physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences. In recent years, research in group theory has had a significant impact on technological advances, such as in cryptography and coding theory. Representation theory is a tool used to better understand the structure of a group and the symmetries it represents by providing a way to view an abstract group as a group of matrices, whose structure is often easier to understand. This project focuses on a number of problems which seek to relate the representation theory of a finite group to the structure and representations of certain so-called local subgroups, which reflect numerical information encoded by the group. The award will also support educational activities centering graduate student mentorship and undergraduate research. These activities include local workshops for Colorado-area graduate students and postdocs and a Directed Reading Program. The latter provides a ""research-like"" experience for undergraduates, in which undergraduate mentees and graduate mentors work under the guidance of the PI to study a topic outside of the students? normal coursework. The activities in the grant also include supervising undergraduate researchers, Ph.D. students, and postdocs, who will work with the PI on problems within the scope of the project.<br/><br/>The problems of primary interest in this project are related to variations and consequences of the McKay?Navarro (MN) and Brauer?s Height Zero (BHZ) Conjectures. The PI and collaborators have recently proved the case of the prime 2 of the MN Conjecture, and many of the goals in this proposal are also aimed at establishing strategies for attacking the case of odd primes. In the case of BHZ, which was one of the longest-standing local-global conjectures, the PI and coauthors completed the proof of the conjecture in its entirety, and have been working toward stronger forms of the conjecture. The problems will involve the study of blocks of groups of Lie type, the action of Galois automorphisms on characters of groups of Lie type, and the interaction between the two. Since the effect of various group actions on parameterizations of characters is an especially problematic component in a number of local-global conjectures and other main problems regarding the representations of groups of Lie type, this is of interest to many other problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representation theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with the study of symmetry using techniques from linear algebra, such as vectors and matrices. Classical examples of symmetry include rotations of a circle and reflections of a square. Modern research in mathematics naturally encounters more abstract notions of symmetry and requires the development of more advanced techniques for their study. The PI will identify and study concrete instances of these abstract symmetries and apply the results to advance the mathematical understanding of quantum field theory in dimensions two and three. The research will also develop new connections between algebra, representation theory, and low dimensional topology.

In the second project the PI will develop the representation theory of affine L-infinity algebras and unrolled quantum groups and use the results to construct abelian approximations of Rozansky-Witten theory. In the third project the PI will extend his work on twisted equivariant matrix factorizations to construct non-semisimple, possibly unoriented, topological field theories for Landau-Ginzburg theory and explore their interpretation as Rozansky-Witten defects.

For instance, a problem formulated by Diophantus in the third century, when translated into the language of a polynomial equation, amounts to determining the rational solutions (x, y) to the equation y^2 = x^6 + x^2 + 1. This problem remained unsolved until the work of Wetherell in 1997.  Studying this algebraic equation from the point of view of geometry yields a curve, and more precisely, a curve of genus 2.  While curves of genus 2 or more are known to have finitely many rational points by the work of Faltings in 1983, as of yet there is no algorithm to determine these finite sets in general. In particular, when the curve?s Jacobian rank is equal to or larger than the genus, there are many challenges that remain. In this project, the PI will study methods for explicitly determining the finite set of rational points on curves of genus 2 or more.  The PI will also organize educational activities to build the mathematical pipeline and mentor students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>One promising approach for determining the finite set of rational points on curves of genus 2 or more, regardless of Jacobian rank, is through Kim's nonabelian Chabauty program and the computation of Selmer sets.  Kim has conjectured that Selmer sets in depth n are finite for n sufficiently large, and that moreover, that these Selmer sets eventually precisely cut out the set of rational points.  Several components of the first nonabelian part of this program (i.e., in depth 2) have been made algorithmic by the PI and her collaborators. In this project, the PI proposes a careful study of Selmer sets in depth 2 and 3 for new classes of curves.

The study of arithmetic sequences over prime numbers and the value of L-functions have been foundational topics of research in number theory over the past two centuries. Large sieve inequalities, which estimate the number of integers which remain after removing a set of residue classes modulo certain primes, are an important tool used to tackle such problems. Often, the strength of the relevant large sieve inequality dictates the progress one can make. For instance, Kummer in the 19th century (refined later Patterson in the 20th century) predicted that an important exponential sum that arises naturally in arithmetic geometry exhibits a subtle statistical bias over the primes. This problem was studied on some of the first super computers in the 1950s and 60s. The PI and his collaborators recently explained this bias with surprising new insights on the relevant large sieve ensemble. In this project, the PI will seek to push the boundaries on large sieve inequalities for families of harmonics that are perceived right now to be ""stuck"", or right on the edge of current technology. The PI and collaborators will explore the potential consequences of their methods for moments and zeros of L-functions, non-vanishing of central values of L-functions, and bounds for exponential sums over primes. Broader impact of this project includes the training of students and postdocs and organizing seminars.<br/><br/>An influential conjecture of Chowla asserts that all primitive Dirichlet L-functions do not vanish at the central point. The PI plans to leverage the under utilised connection between metaplectic forms and fixed order characters over number fields to make progress toward Chowla's conjecture. The PI and his collaborators discovered that such a connection was a key ingredient in the resolution of Patterson's conjecture because it explained why a certain large sieve inequality was not optimal. The PI will extend these ideas to higher order characters, where much less is known, and will use techniques from analytic number theory to study the non-vanishing of central values of L-functions and moments of Hecke L-functions. The PI and collaborators will also use trace formulae to study large sieve inequalities for families that arise in moments of automorphic L-functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a prevailing belief that deep connections exist between the arithmetic properties of polynomials equations and the behavior of their associated L-functions.The Bloch-Kato conjecture predicts such connections in a broad and unifying framework, and the Iwasawa-Greenberg main conjecture offers an analogue in the setting of p-adic deformations.

More precisely, the mathematical theory of automorphic forms builds from the study of harmonics, or the fundamental tones of musical instruments, to a general theory of the vibrational modes of highly symmetric shapes in arbitrary dimensions. Because of a surprising connection between automorphic forms and prime numbers, it has also proven important to study these highly symmetric shapes with an alternative theory of geometry built up from an unusual notion of size and distance that detects divisibility by a fixed prime number. This is called p-adic geometry. The basic shapes in p-adic geometry look more like fractals such as the Cantor set than the shapes we encounter in our day-to-day life, thus much of our usual physical intuition about the real world cannot be applied in this setting. This project will improve our ability to reason intuitively in p-adic geometry by developing ideas from calculus and geometry, like derivatives and curvature, so that they can be applied also in p-adic geometry, and then use these tools to answer fundamental questions about automorphic forms and their connections to prime numbers. The mathematics of harmonics plays a fundamental role in signal processing, while questions about prime numbers are essential to the modern cryptography schemes that allow us to communicate and make purchases securely online, so that the mathematics to be developed in this project will have ties to areas of importance across the modern economy. The project also provides training opportunities for the next generation of researchers through research supervision and mentoring for undergraduate and doctoral students in mathematics. <br/><br/>At a more technical level, this project will develop new tools for studying p-adic geometry using the language of inscribed v-sheaves, which adds a differential layer on top of the theories of diamonds and perfectoid spaces that make up the modern foundations of p-adic geometry.

The symmetries that arise in quantum mechanics are called ""unitary representations."" One of the major unsolved problems in representation theory is to classify unitary representations. This problem has driven a considerable portion of all research in representation theory over the past eighty years; its solution would have far-reaching ramifications in several neighboring fields, including number theory, harmonic analysis, signal processing, and theoretical physics. The PI proposes to develop a new geometric approach to this problem. This approach will lead to substantial new insights into the structure of unitary representations and, hopefully, a solution to the problem of computing the unitary dual. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>There are two main existing approaches to the study of unitary representations: the orbit method philosophy of Kirillov and Kostant, and the Hodge theory approach of Schmid and Vilonen. The orbit method seeks to parameterize the unitary dual of a Lie group G in terms of (roughly speaking) orbits for G on the dual space of its Lie algebra. The Hodge theory approach seeks to understand unitary representations by localizing over the flag variety and applying tools from Hodge theory. These approaches work along two different axes. Whereas the orbit method provides mainly hints as to where one should look for unitary representations, Hodge theory provides a powerful apparatus for proving that representations are unitary. Neither approach seems sufficient, on its own, to solve the problem of computing the unitary dual. In this project the PI proposes to develop a unified geometric approach to unitary representation theory by combining the orbit method with techniques from Hodge theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The geometry of the Calabi--Yau manifold encodes the interactions of subatomic particles in a way that is compatible with the theory of gravity. There are millions of different types of Calabi--Yau manifolds known, but it is conjectured by Miles Reid that they are all related by simple ""surgery"" operations. The physical theory changes in a continuous way under these surgeries, so Reid's conjecture implies that the physical theories associated to different Calabi--Yau manifolds are all connected. The mirror symmetry phenomenon posits that Calabi--Yau manifolds come in pairs X and Y which determine equivalent physical theories. leading to an intricate but mysterious relation between the geometries of X and Y. In this project, the PI will study the mirror symmetry phenomenon and its relation to Reid's conjecture and the classification of Calabi--Yau manifolds. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The mirror symmetry phenomenon of string theory implies that Calabi--Yau manifolds come in pairs X and Y such that the complex geometry of X is related to the symplectic geometry of Y, and vice versa.

The related Strominger--Yau--Zaslow (SYZ) conjecture asserts that X and Y admit dual Lagrangian torus fibrations over a common base, and the HMS equivalence is obtained via an analogue of the Fourier transform. The PI and a collaborator will establish new cases of the HMS conjecture for Calabi--Yau manifolds of complex dimensions 2 and 3, guided by the SYZ heuristic.

They sought to ensure reliable communication and computation even in the presence of noisy channels and faulty machines. Over the years, the discipline, techniques, and challenges have evolved. Today, we are at an inflection point where we must control noise and errors along with several conditions for classical and quantum computers. In the classical setting, coding theory should satisfy other restrictions, like protecting data and ensuring tasks are performed quickly. In the quantum setting, coding theory is one of the needed pillars for the development of large-scale quantum computers that will revolutionize and benefit society. Specifically, quantum error-correcting codes are fundamental for the reliability of quantum computers and for applying and implementing quantum algorithms, like Shor?s, among others. In this proposal, we aim to develop more agile erasure recovery and repair for use in distributed storage, faster and secure frameworks for distributed computing, and fault-tolerant quantum error correction. Additional broader impacts include running online seminars in cyber-security, training of students and contributing to publicly available software.<br/><br/> To address the proposed coding theory problems and challenges, the investigators harness their expertise in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry and build on the results of their long-standing collaboration as well as new developments in the field.

This project builds on recent advances, suggesting that the full capabilities of evaluation codes have not yet been realized.

The field is thus at the heart of much of pure mathematics and is related to many other areas of study, such as number theory and algebraic geometry. Homological algebra is a branch of algebra related to the field of algebraic topology, which, in turn, is the study of topological spaces, i.e., ""shapes"".  In this project, the principal investigator will carry out research in commutative algebra, broadly defined, with a focus on topics related to so-called ""dg categories"" and modules of finite projective dimension.<br/><br/>More precisely, the principal investigator, in collaboration with Michael Brown, Srikanth Iyengar, Linquan Ma, Keller VandeBogert, and others, will pursue research on the following topics: (1) non-commutative analogues for dg categories of several classical conjectures for smooth varieties; (2) duality in the context of Hochschild homology of commutative rings and schemes; (3) homological properties of modules of finite projective dimension; (4) Ulrich modules and sheaves; and (5) matrix factorization. A central goal of (1) is to study non-commutative versions of the Hodge conjecture and the related Standard Conjectures of Grothendieck. The main goal of (2) is to establish and explore the consequences of what might be thought of as Poincare duality for the Hochschild homology (and the periodic cyclic homology) of commutative rings and schemes.  Project (3) will explore, among other things, the length conjecture, which predicts that a module of finite projective dimension must have length at least as large as the multiplicity of the ring.  Ulrich modules and sheaves, the topic of (4), have extremely special properties, and the mere existence of a single such module/sheaf for a ring/scheme has dramatic consequences.  Although it was recently proven by the investigator and his collaborators that certain local rings do not admit any Ulrich modules, the analogous question for Ulrich sheaves on projective varieties remains open; settling this is a goal of this research.  A matrix factorization, the topic of (5), is a pair of square matrices with entries in a commutative ring whose product (in either order) gives a scalar matrix. Under certain assumptions, there is a predicted lower bound on the smallest possible size of such a matrix factorization (known as the Buchweitz-Greuel-Schreyer Conjecture), and this project will aim to settle this conjecture at least in certain cases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often the equations that arise are algebraic in nature, like those describing lines, circles, parabolas, and the like, in contrast with, say, equations involving the trigonometric functions, or logarithms, or derivatives. Typically, the equations have infinitely many solutions--think about the equation defining a circle--and it is usually not possible to write down a complete list of solutions. Rather, the objective is to find ways to study the structure of the collection of the solution set. A fruitful approach has been to consider the (algebraic) functions on these solution sets. These functions form a mathematical structure called a commutative ring, and the principal investigator's research over the past two decades has been dedicated to understanding these structures; not in the abstract, but in their various manifestations, which are galore, for they arise in various contexts across mathematics--e.g., in the representation theory of groups, in topology, and in number theory.

Wiles? proof introduced many new techniques; central among them is the method of patching (in collaboration with Richard Taylor) and a numerical criterion for detecting when a map between certain types of commutative rings is an isomorphism. The Taylor-Wiles patching method has been developed extensively, leading to many new modularity results. However, the numerical criterion had resisted attempts of generalization to a broader context. A few years ago, the principal investigator, in collaboration with Chandrashekhar Khare and Jeff Manning, found a way to do just that. In combination with the patching method, they have used this to establish more refined modularity results than possible with pure patching alone. The principal investigator plans to develop new and more sophisticated commutative algebraic tools, driven by major open problems around modularity lifting, and algebraic number theory more generally. He and his PhD student will also implement some of these tools in the proof assistant Lean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic equations are both beautiful and ubiquitous, as they describe many natural phenomena, from the motion of planets or the shape of leaves and flowers, to the behavior of microscopic particles. The goal of this research project is to study the deeper properties of the solutions to more complicated algebraic equations, called algebraic maps. The investigator plans to continue the long-term investigation of the topology, Hodge theory, and cycle theory of algebraic maps. The close connection between the two main threads of the research, namely the discovery of new and deep aspects of the general theory and the study of fundamental examples, is the motivating principle behind the work. It is anticipated that the results will be of use to mathematicians in algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory, and to mathematical physicists in the study of string theory. This project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The investigator will explore, with various teams of collaborators, the fundamental aspects of the general theory, as well as important examples, through four projects: 1) To determine the exact form of the Decomposition Theorem for the Hitchin morphism for G-Higgs bundles with log-poles over a curve over the field of complex numbers for a reductive group G. 2) To formulate and prove the Topological Mirror Symmetry Conjecture for the intersection cohomology groups of the moduli of G-Higgs bundles for the pair of Langlands dual groups SLn and PGLn with and without poles in the case when rank and degree are not coprime --the coprime case is known--; this requires new ideas, such as generically defined gerbes and a new formalism of correspondences on singular spaces for mixed Hodge modules. 3) To prove a semistable log-pole version of the non-Abelian Hodge theorem in positive characteristic, with cohomological applications. Several new ideas need to be introduced, such as log-connections for affine group schemes and their residue spaces. 4) The PI has already generalized the Alper-Hall-Rydh local structure theorem for algebraic stacks to morphisms of stacks, with geometric applications to the (intersection) cohomology of members of families of good moduli spaces; the PI plans to prove analogous geometric results for the members of families of stacks and to then apply the resulting theory to important families of moduli stacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include x^2+y^2 = 0 and x-y=0. At a basic level, these equations involve only addition and multiplication. Despite their simplicity, they are ubiquitous across the sciences, appearing in fields ranging from computer science and physics to chemistry and biology. When one tries to solve these equations, one often finds not just one answer, but an infinite number of them. To make sense of this, mathematicians look at the shape formed by all the solutions together. These shapes are called an algebraic variety. Major conjectures in modern Algebraic Geometry suggest that all algebraic varieties can be built, at least roughly, from just three basic types: Fano varieties, Calabi-Yau varieties, and varieties of general type. This project will describe how these three building blocks fit together. The project also includes research training opportunities for students.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will (1) construct and investigate specific moduli spaces of fibered varieties, (2) explore the birational geometry of algebraic stacks, and (3) study both the local and global geometry of certain moduli spaces of varieties of general type and polarized Calabi-Yau varieties. Regarding (1), the PI will generalize existing frameworks for constructing moduli spaces of maps from families of curves to Deligne-Mumford stacks, and study specific examples of these moduli spaces. A key technique in this work involves the study of weighted blow-ups, a type of birational transformation for algebraic stacks that parallels classical blow-ups in the theory of projective varieties. Regarding (2), the PI plans to adapt and extend current methods in birational geometry to the more general setting of algebraic stacks.

The field of Commutative Algebra is foundational not only to pure mathematics but also to a wide range of applied disciplines, including computer science, physics, and engineering. It is closely intertwined with other areas of mathematics, such as Number Theory, Complex Analysis, Topology, Geometry, and Representation Theory.  The Principal Investigator specializes in singularity theory, a branch of Commutative Algebra concerned with the behavior of algebraic objects that fail to be smooth. Unlike smooth structures, where the tools of differential calculus apply directly, singularities require alternative methods.

These valuations correspond to ideal blowups, a geometric construction central to singularity theory.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on the role of Rees valuations in understanding singularities, especially in settings of positive characteristic, an arithmetic context where classical tools of differentials often break down.

The study of polynomial equations has been a central theme in mathematics since ancient times. A vast amount of knowledge has been developed in pursuit of the solutions to specific polynomial equations. For example, in 1637 Fermat famously asked which nth powers are the sum of two other nth powers . Fermat's problem was resolved in the 1990s; the solution advanced insight into elliptic curves, which played a key role in the proof. Elliptic curves are central objects in cryptography, number theory, and algebraic geometry, and are an active area of research. A major open question is whether there are infinitely many elliptic curves with special properties, or if elliptic curves exhibit uniform behavior. It turns out that these properties are governed by the solutions to families of polynomial equations. In this award, the PI will study the solutions to these polynomial equations to deepen understanding of these uniformity questions. The PI will approach this by leveraging information from the geometry of the elliptic curves. The PI will also organize educational initiatives aimed at developing future talent in mathematics, as well as work to enhance digital infrastructure for mathematical research by contributing to mathematical databases.<br/><br/>Quadratic Chabauty is a p-adic method for determining rational points on curves. It has proved to be a powerful tool in determining rational points on modular curves, which parametrize elliptic curves with a specified Galois image. A significant barrier to pushing the quadratic Chabauty method further is its reliance on a suitable plane model of the curve. The PI will determine rational points on certain families of modular curves by developing quadratic Chabauty algorithms that do not rely on explicit equations and instead leverage the modular nature of the curves. She will apply these approaches to determine rational points on interesting modular curves. This problem is motivated by conjectures such as Serre's uniformity question and Elkies' boundedness conjecture, which predict that, in certain families of modular curves, there are no rational points other than CM points or cusps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are some of the oldest fields that have been continuously studied in mathematics, and they have broad ranging applications such as in cryptography and in physical, social and biological sciences. At a fundamental level, these fields aim to understand the behavior of shapes that can be described using polynomial equations. The behavior of the shapes are, in turn, influenced by algebraic properties of the functions on them. The broad goal of this project is to establish results that exhibit unexpected uniform behavior among these algebraic objects. A particular focus is on using techniques that arise from modular, or ?clock?, arithmetic.  This project also includes outreach to the community, opportunities for students, and conference organization.<br/> <br/>The discovery of unexpected uniform behavior in Noetherian rings has been a central theme in commutative algebra over the past fifty years. Among all Noetherian rings, there is an important class consisting of those considered to be the most geometric, known as excellent rings. Several uniformity results such as uniform Artin-Rees and uniform Briançon-Skoda remain open for the class of excellent rings in general, and in the mixed characteristic setting even for finite type algebras over a discrete valuation ring. The principal investigator will use techniques from prime characteristic commutative algebra, non-Archimedean functional analysis and recent advances in mixed characteristic singularity theory to tackle these open problems for new classes of excellent rings, especially those arising in an arithmetic setting. With the recent prolific use of arithmetic techniques in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, the study of such rings is becoming increasingly important. In addition, these rings have also helped clarify how some fundamental notions of singularities defined via the Frobenius map behave outside the settings of finite type algebras over a field, and rings with finite Frobenius.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on one of the core questions in the field: the classification and structure of K-trivial varieties. These include elliptic curves, which underpin modern cryptography, and Calabi-Yau threefolds, which play a central role in string theory as geometric models of the universe. The questions explored in this research are fundamental to current developments in mathematics and connect with related disciplines such as physics and computer science, offering promising avenues for real-world applications. A key component of the project is the involvement of early-career researchers, especially doctoral students, who will contribute directly to the development of new techniques and their application to the problems under investigation.<br/><br/>This project will address two foundational questions in the study of K-trivial varieties: the structure of hyper-Kaehler manifolds and the compactification of moduli spaces of strict Calabi-Yau manifolds. First, the classification of hyper-Kaehler manifolds is one of the most elusive aspects of contemporary algebraic geometry; the most recent breakthrough in this direction was made by O'Grady over a quarter century ago. Recent methods and perspectives enable significant progress. A central aspect of the project is the investigation of deep connections between hyper-Kaehler manifolds and representation theory. In particular, the PI aims to classify Kummer-type hyper-Kaehler manifolds and, more broadly, to understand the symplectic correspondences between hyper-Kaehler manifolds and abelian varieties. Second, for strict Calabi-Yau varieties, the absence of compact moduli spaces is a significant challenge. The project seeks to develop a Hodge-theoretic approach to compactifying Calabi-Yau moduli spaces, building on the PI's earlier work with Griffiths, Friedman, and others. The primary tools for addressing these questions are Hodge theory, birational geometry, representation theory, and the recently developed theory of higher Du Bois and higher rational singularities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More precisely, the shapes are complex projective manifolds and the linear invariants are Hodge structures. The famous ?Hodge conjecture?, first presented in 1950 at the International Congress of Mathematicians, states that the essential geometry of a complex projective manifold is recovered by its Hodge structure. As one of the Millennium Prize Problems, this conjecture has attached to it a one million dollar prize for a solution. While complex projective manifolds involve a bit of abstraction to define, they are fundamental objects in mathematics and physics; for example, the ?Calabi-Yau varieties? are a certain class of complex projective manifolds which can appear as the small dimensions of the universe in string theory. The main research goal of this project is to study the Hodge structures of Calabi-Yau varieties?to both gain insight into Hodge theory more generally for all complex projective manifolds, and to increase the depth of our understanding of Calabi-Yau varieties. Beyond pure research goals, the educational impact will be to develop an active community of young researchers and PhD students focusing on this circle of ideas.<br/><br/>The project will continue lines of research of the PI on toroidal compactifications of Calabi-Yau moduli. Recent joint work of the PI with V. Alexeev constructs a modular toroidal compactification of the moduli space of degree 2d polarized K3 surfaces. One research goal is to extend this work to hyperkahler and Calabi-Yau varieties, with an eye towards understanding the combinatorial structure of degenerations. Additionally, the project aims to study and prove general results concerning variations of Hodge structure (VHS). Joint work of the PI with S. Tayou is advancing our understanding of finiteness properties of Z-polarized VHS, and it now seems within reach that conjectures of Deligne and Simpson on the algebraicity of the non-abelian Hodge locus can be resolved. The approach is novel, incorporating ideas from hyperbolic geometry.

These shapes arise naturally in physics, robotics, computer vision, statistics, and many other areas of science. Homotopy theory is the study of shapes up to deformation. Deformations provide a degree of flexibility to the study of varieties, which makes some difficult problems more tractable. A measurement that is not affected by deformations is called an invariant. Such measurements provide crucial information about varieties. This project will develop new invariants for varieties and offer novel reformulations of known, important invariants. A key feature of the invariants that will be developed is their validity in any number system, rather than just in the real or complex numbers. This will establish new connections between algebraic geometry, number theory, and low-dimensional topology. This project includes mathematical training opportunities for students across the country.<br/><br/>There are three primary goals to the project. The first is to understand the motivic Euler characteristic, which is a quadratic form whose rank is the compactly supported Euler characteristic, of Hilbert schemes of K3 surfaces. This will involve a characterization of the Hasse--Witt invariants of the motivic Euler characteristic in terms of the bad reduction of the scheme. Other arithmetic aspects of these motivic Euler characteristics will also be studied. The second goal is explain the behavior of unstable local degrees in motivic homotopy theory under field extensions. In contrast to the stable case, the transfer map of the unstable local degree fails to be a homomorphism. The PI will construct an obstruction in Milnor--Witt K-theory to the homomorphicity of the transfer map. The payoff of the second goal is a toolkit for certain problems in enumerative geometry.

Surprisingly, number theoretic phenomena are sometimes governed by functions arising from a different area of mathematics, known as harmonic analysis.  This is the field that studies waves and related periodic phenomena. It turns out that problems in number theory sometimes admit solutions controlled by functions known as automorphic forms, which are periodic functions, but whose group of periods is generally non-commutative. The study of this relationship between number theory and harmonic analysis is known as the ""Langlands program."" The Principal Investigator will study and further develop a particular aspect of the Langlands program, the so-called p-adic Langlands program. Here p stands for a prime number, and p-adic indicates that one focuses on divisibility properties with respect to this prime.

This project will also provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to investigate the p-adic aspects of the Langlands program from a range of different viewpoints.  A major focus is the construction of a categorical p-adic local Langlands correspondence in contexts where it is not currently known to exist, by combining methods from representation theory, the geometry of moduli stacks, and the theory of differential graded algebras. The p-adic local Langlands correspondence has proved to be one of the most powerful tools available for establishing relationships between questions in algebraic number theory and the theory of automorphic forms, and so extending its known range of validity is one of the fundamental problems in number theory. Other aspects of the project include the p-adic interpolation of the trace formula, the study of prismatic cohomology of Hilbert modular varieties, and the study of global-to-local restriction maps between moduli stacks of Langlands parameters.  A common element in all these investigations is the combining of algebraic, geometric, and representation-theoretic techniques, and the project also serves to develop new methods in, and syntheses of, these areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Hardy-Littlewood (circle) method applies Fourier series to count solutions of Diophantine equations. Studied since ancient times, these are equations to be solved in integers, whose properties remain a central focus of modern research. In general, the circle method uses subtle aspects of Fourier series in the guise of exponential sums, tools that contribute to tests for equidistribution (apparent ""randomness"") of number theoretic sequences used in computer science and cryptography. Despite the recent renaissance in the Hardy-Littlewood method, the current understanding of its nuances remains plagued by basic mysteries that stand in the way of ambitious applications in analytic number theory that would be transformative in nature. The Principal Investigator will explore these frontiers of the subject, delivering progress on model problems that should enhance our understanding of the most difficult regions of the Fourier space in applications. Informed by these advances, novel approaches, some only recently established and others speculative in nature, will be employed to address fundamental problems concerning Diophantine equations, congruences and equidistribution, opening new avenues for future research. This project will also involve training graduate students in this promising new technology, and work will continue on a text making this research available to the wider mathematical community.<br/> <br/>Two great mysteries of the Hardy-Littlewood method concern the nature of contributions in circle method integrals of points with large height, and the relation of special subvarieties of solutions to the associated Fourier analysis. In mean values of exponential sums over polynomials of larger degree, the provenance of points on low degree subvarieties contained in the associated hypersurfaces remains speculative. Three goals will be addressed in this project that address these mysteries. First, height-scaling techniques will be applied in the circle and related methods to obtain new conclusions concerning the representation of arithmetic sequences by higher degree forms. This will provide novel approaches to understanding the representation of integers in such sequences as the squarefree numbers by polynomials of large degree. Second, novel generalizations of the delta-function technique will be investigated, offering access to Diophantine problems of higher degree. This method offers a potential tool for the investigation of the contribution of points of medium circle method height in applications of the Hardy-Littlewood method. Subject to availability of time and resources, a third goal will be to apply congruences over p-adic function fields to derive mean value estimates for exponential sums applicable to conventional Diophantine problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To elaborate, algebraic geometry is the study of systems of polynomial equations.  Hodge theory seeks to understand the shape of the algebraic spaces defined by their solution sets.  In so doing, it produces powerful connections between algebraic geometry and other parts of mathematics and physics, such as number theory, differential equations, and string theory.  Normal functions are solutions to differential equations arising from algebraic cycles (or subspaces) on an algebraic space.  By recognizing a solution as a normal function, which is a nontrivial task, one gets access to its behavior at numerous ""special"" points.  In the scenarios to be considered in this project, these ""special values"" have important applications to identities and conjectures in number theory, the classification of algebraic spaces such as Fano varieties and algebraic curves, and the spectra of operators in topological string theory.  This project will also help to train the next generation of researchers in pure mathematics, by integrating the PI's graduate students in work on specific problems in Hodge theory and bringing outside consultants to Washington University.  Results will be disseminated through conferences, summer schools, journal articles, and websites.<br/><br/>Normal functions originated in the work of Poincare and Lefschetz in the early 20th century.  They are to families of algebraic cycles what period maps are to families of algebraic varieties:  the basic Hodge-theoretic invariant.  Informally, they are given by integrals of differential forms on non-closed chains instead of topological cycles, and satisfy inhomogeneous differential equations instead of homogeneous ones.  The PI will study the properties, invariants, classification, and geometric realization of normal functions.  The settings and applications range from arithmetic geometry and number theory to mirror symmetry, moduli, and mathematical physics.  The specific goals of this project are to:  (I) produce new evidence for the Beilinson and Bloch-Kato conjectures on special values of L-functions, and provide motivic realizations of biextensions; (II) describe an A-model variation of mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology of a Fano variety, and a B-model Lefschetz principle governing normal functions on LG-models; and (III) classify and realize normal functions with values in Hermitian and hypergeometric variations of Hodge structure, with applications to moduli of curves, hypergeometric identities, and quantization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry is the field of mathematics that studies the geometric shape of objects defined by polynomial equations. Often, the shape of these objects, called algebraic varieties, reflects the complexity of the defining equations and vice-versa. For instance, from the defining equations, we can understand if the algebraic variety has singularities, i.e., whether the geometric object has sharp points at which the curvature changes abruptly. These points are known as algebraic singularities. This project aims to develop new tools to understand algebraic singularities and apply these techniques to understand algebraic varieties of positive curvature.  As part of the broader impacts of this project, the PI will run online research seminars for graduate students related to the proposed research. The PI will initiate a summer reading program in algebraic geometry for undergraduates. The educational component of this project includes training in algebraic geometry for graduate students. Two summer research schools will be hosted at UCLA by the PI and experts in the field to train the new generation of mathematicians in birational geometry.<br/><br/>Fano varieties are considered one of the three building blocks of projective varieties. There has been a lot of progress towards understanding the geometry of Fano varieties in the last few decades. Nevertheless, the understanding of log terminal singularities (the local analog of Fano varieties) is far from being satisfactory. Complexity is an invariant that allows us to understand how far a Fano variety or a log terminal singularity is from being toric, i.e., defined by binomial equations. In this project, the PI will develop techniques to understand Fano varieties and log terminal singularities of small complexity, for instance, complexity zero, one, and two. There are two guiding principles: understanding the connection between the complexity and minimal log discrepancies (in the local setting) and understanding the connection between the complexity and anti-pluricanonical systems of Fano varieties (in the global setting). The PI aims to apply the former to study the termination of flips and the latter to understand the classification of cluster type Fano varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One is the study of Galois groups, which describe the hidden symmetries of solutions of equations. The other is the study of L-functions, which are powerful tools to count particular types of numbers, including prime numbers. The Principal Investigator will work on these with two different approaches. One approach is the construction of probabilistic models. Probabilistic models allow mathematicians to develop models that predict the properties a mathematical object will likely have, even when it is not possible to know with certainty what properties it has. Another approach is by multiple Dirichlet series, which mathematicians create by modifying a number-theoretic problem until its solution is as symmetrical as possible, and then use these symmetries to find a solution to the original problem. The Principal Investigator will develop new probabilistic models and new multiple Dirichlet series, and use them to make progress on fundamental number-theoretic problems. Furthermore, the project also develops connections with other areas of mathematics - the Principal Investigator's work on probabilistic models will lead to new results in probability theory, while the work on multiple Dirichlet series will demonstrate connections between these series, topology, and quantum algebra, leading to new results in those areas. The Principal Investigator will also train future mathematicians. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigator and collaborators will work in several interrelated directions. One will construct new multiple Dirichlet series, with clear potential applications to moments of L-functions, by a novel unifying perspective on multiple Dirichlet series. The second will construct probabilistic models for the Galois group of the maximal unramified extension of a random number field, and then probabilistic models for the entire absolute Galois group. The third will give probabilistic models for statistics of L-functions that fit them more closely than the previously considered probabilistic models. The probabilistic perspective will also lead to new evaluations of moments of L-functions, by better understanding the main term in problems where separating the main term from the error term is difficult. The fourth project will construct new multiple Dirichlet series relevant to L-functions of fields with nonabelian Galois groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program will bring together experts in these subjects, visiting Sydney in overlapping intervals of one to three weeks, with the aim of bringing together and encouraging new collaborations amongst a diverse international cohort of mathematicians working in different aspects of representation theory. Two workshops will be held during the six-week program. Senior scientists in residence will explore relations between the aforementioned aspects of representation theory through their expertise in  the following topics: combinatorics of Coxeter groups, total positivity, and emerging geometric methods on the representation theory of p-adic groups. <br/><br/>In more detail: (1) Combinatorics of Coxeter groups is one of the central interfaces between Lie theory and combinatorics. Of particular interest is the recent suggestion that techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence can be applied to problems in Coxeter combinatorics.

Humans have studied them for millennia. Number theory aims to understand patterns possessed by whole numbers. Fundamental questions revolve around multiplication: how often are numbers in some sequence even (i.e. divisible by two)? Divisible by three? Or five? Nineteenth century researchers introduced symmetry actions to reveal hidden patterns in numbers. And, in the 1970's, Robert Langlands made far-reaching conjectures on symmetry. These conjectures have occupied number theorists ever since. They predict patterns seen by symmetry actions will arise equally from the calculus of complex numbers (""modular forms""). A pattern appearing in two places is an example of a mathematical reciprocity. This project will refine Langlands' reciprocity prediction. The new tool is geometric spaces of symmetry actions, constructed by Emerton and Gee over the past fifteen years. These spaces are believed to convert reciprocity questions into geometrical ones. This project establishes instances of this belief. It will connect divisibility patterns from the world of modular forms to geometrical theorems on Emerton and Gee's spaces. The project has substantial broader impacts. Computational data will be included in the widely-used L-functions and Modular Forms Database. The project also develops computational tools for teaching. Open education resources (OERs) are learning materials placed in the public domain. Their primary benefit is providing learning experiences at low costs. They can be adapted to fit a diversity of learning environments. The project develops OERs for computer-based learning of number theory and abstract algebra. The project supports education and outreach in two more ways. First, Math Circles will be run in public schools. Second, research projects will be developed to support the Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists. Finally, the project plans two research workshops in number theory. Both aim to disseminate new advances in number theory and reciprocity. <br/><br/>The more detailed aim is a new study of p-adic slopes of modular forms and Galois representations. The p-adic slope of a modular form is how often its p-th Hecke eigenvalue is divisible by a fixed prime p. Predictions and theorems on slopes have been around since the 1980's. Seven years ago, Bergdall and Pollack proposed a way (""the ghost conjecture"") to unify almost all prior ideas. The ghost conjecture's input is a congruence class of modular forms. The output is an elementary recipe for slopes in the class. The main caveat is the ghost conjecture only applies to ""regular"" classes. But, assuming regularity, Liu, Truong, Xiao, and Zhao (LTXZ) recently established the conjecture. The current project removes the regular assumption in the ghost conjecture. The new tool is Emerton and Gee's (EG) moduli stack of Galois representations. In Galois terms, regularity is a generic property on the EG stack. The project's technical innovation is thus deforming slope questions over the stack. A geometrical reformulation will open the door to generalizing the LTXZ proof. It will also create space for novel studies of Hilbert modular forms or higher rank automorphic forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With origins in the 19th century study of prime numbers by Riemann and Dirichlet, this rich family of functions often serve as a bridge connecting several areas of mathematics including Diophantine equations, geometry, representation theory, and analysis. Examples arise both in the study of solutions to polynomial equations and in the theory of highly symmetric functions known as automorphic forms. The paradigm of the Langlands program indicates that the rich symmetry properties of automorphic forms may be used to prove properties of arithmetic L-functions, which have a wide array of applications. In the modern relative Langlands program, we now have a conjectural framework to make this relationship precise in terms of a duality between L-functions and certain invariants of automorphic forms known as ""periods"". In this context, the relative trace formula (RTF) provides a powerful tool from harmonic analysis to decompose an automorphic period into its ""irreducible components or modes"" which are often directly related to special values of L-functions. While such a formula is often the only tool available to establish the relationship alluded to above, the theory of the relative trace formula is still incomplete. In this project, the PI will explore several problems in the relative Langlands program using recently developed tools. In addition to providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student projects in this rapidly developing field, this project also supports several educational goals including the organization of seminars and the founding of a graduate student workshop designed to foster interaction among the area's graduate students in automorphic forms and offer opportunities to develop skill in giving professional presentations.<br/><br/>This project will complete the PI's theory of endoscopy in the relative setting and establish the stabilization of a large family of RTFs by developing a theory of twisted relative endoscopy, transfer factors, and variants of Ngo's geometric stabilization in the context of symmetric varieties. Each step will be informed by the connection between relative endoscopy and the duality conjectures of Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh, with a secondary goal of better understanding these conjectures in the arithmetic setting via the geometric aspects of the relative trace formula. The PI will apply these tools to applications in arithmetic geometry and the relative Langlands conjectures. This includes the case of generalized unitary Friedberg-Jacquet periods, with applications to the arithmetic geometry of certain Shimura varieties. A novel component of this project is to combine these two branches and develop a novel ""arithmetic"" theory of endoscopy, and to prove new endoscopic arithmetic fundamental lemmas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This goals of this conference are: (1) to support research in  algebra and related topics in our region; (2) to promote excellence in research and scholarship among faculty from a diverse mathematical background related to commutative algebra at the institutions in the Southeast of the United States; (3) to encourage students to attend a world class conference in order to become acquainted with experts and build a successful career; (4) to bring together speakers from diverse mathematical fields that are connected through homological commutative algebra; and (5) to promote diversity and inclusion by working to ensure significant participation of researchers from underrepresented groups. The conference will consist of a series of talks given by senior faculty, junior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and students.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, number theory, and invariant theory are the primary fields of applications of commutative algebra. In its modern shape, commutative algebra originated in the works of several well-known mathematicians, especially Dedekind, Hilbert, Kronecker, Krull, Kummer, and Noether, during the nineteenth century and was vastly developed later in the outstanding work of Grothendieck on modern algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. In the 1950's, homological algebra (that originates from algebraic topology) made its way into the commutative algebra toolbox in the works of Auslander-Buchbaum and Serre to help with solving open problems in commutative algebra. Connections between commutative algebra, representation theory, combinatorics, and deformation theory appeared in the past century in numerous places as well. This conference focuses on topics in the above-mentioned fields that are tightly connected (and can be applied) to fundamental problems in homological commutative algebra such as problems related to the betti numbers and minimal free resolutions, relative homological algebra, properties of subcategories of the module category, and vanishing of homology and cohomology modules.

In recent years, there have been several major advances in the field of Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Cycles. Arithmetic Geometry is the study of spaces from the point of view of number theory and is largely concerned with the solutions of polynomial equations, especially over the integers. Algebraic K-Theory and Algebraic Cycles are certain special techniques that can understand the geometric nature of a problem, one that is again defined in terms of polynomial equations. In recent years there have been a number of important developments in this area and the purpose of the week-long workshop and conference is to bring together established experts in these areas along with early-career researchers with the goal of stimulating further progress.<br/><br/>In more detail, in recent years there have been major developments in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Cycles, leading up to the solution of the Milnor, Bloch-Kato and Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures, as well as the conjectures of Thomason and Morel concerned with equivariant phenomena for actions of linear algebraic groups. The powerful techniques introduced for the solution of the above conjectures have stimulated work on several outstanding remaining problems in the area, which are often arithmetic in nature, but use sophisticated tools from Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic cycles. The goal of the program is to focus on several of the outstanding problems in the area, surveying the progress made and planning strategies for further advancement.

Many leading researchers in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic Geometry, K-Theory, Topology and related topics will be speakers in this meeting and outline current research they and their collaborators are pursuing in these areas. The collective theme is that they were all worked on by John Tate and in some cases started by him. John Tate proved many fundamental theorems, but perhaps more importantly, he demonstrated new ways of thinking about mathematics that show no signs of slowing more than half a century after he introduced them. The majority of the funds will be used to assist with expenses for junior faculty and graduate students without other means of support, to attend and participate in the meeting. <br/><br/>John Tate founded or strongly influenced many of the primary areas of study within algebraic geometry and number theory: his thesis, which gave a different way of looking at zeta and L-functions of number fields, the cohomological reformulation of local and global class field theory, arithmetic duality, nonarchimedean analysis, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, algebraic K-theory of local and global fields, p-adic Hodge theory, and conjectures on algebraic cycles. All of these are active areas of study. The conference will explain in detail how Tate's ideas and results have shaped the field in a fundamental way and are still leading to major advances. This conference will help inspire the current and next generation of mathematicians to extend and go beyond what is presently known in these areas. <br/><br/>Conference website: https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/the-legacy-of-john-tate-and-beyond/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project deals with the recent resurgence of integrable systems in the context of algebraic geometry and representation theory, motivated by the study of quantum field theories. The results of the research are expected to elucidate the phenomenon of three-dimensional mirror symmetry originally discovered in theoretical physics. Broader impacts include establishing an interdisciplinary program for mathematics and physics students. The project contains undergraduate and graduate student research topics and aims for vertical integration of research and education. The PI will also co-organize several conferences designed for early-career researchers. The project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis program, the Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project deals with the geometric realization of several points of view on the Bethe ansatz approach to quantum integrable systems. One approach uses quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations emerging naturally in the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties. Another one relies on the study of QQ-systems, generalizing the relations satisfied by the Baxter operators. The geometric realization of QQ-systems is derived from the properties of the difference equation version of oper connections on the projective line, generalizing the correspondence between oper connections and Bethe equations for the Gaudin model. The PI plans to show how these geometric points of view on the Bethe ansatz are bonded together within the framework of the quantum q-Langlands correspondence.

This includes work in additive combinatorics concerning generalizations of Szemerédi's theorem on arithmetic progressions (sequences of numbers that are all equally spaced, like 4, 6, 8, and 10), which, informally, says that any sufficiently large collection of whole numbers contains a long arithmetic progression. It is a central problem in additive combinatorics to determine how large ""sufficiently large"" is. The investigator will study versions of this question involving more complicated patterns than arithmetic progressions, and then use the results and techniques developed to make progress on a related problem in ergodic theory. The investigator will also study the size and structure of integer distance sets, which are sets of points whose pairwise distances are all whole numbers. This award will support undergraduate summer research on representation theory and additive combinatorics, and also support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigator will build on her previous work on quantitative bounds for subsets of the integers lacking polynomial progressions of distinct degrees and for subsets of vector spaces over finite fields lacking a certain four-point configuration to tackle more general polynomial, multidimensional, and multidimensional polynomial configurations. The results for multidimensional polynomial configurations of distinct degree will then be used to make progress on the Furstenberg--Bergelson--Leibman conjecture in ergodic theory, which concerns the pointwise almost everywhere convergence of certain nonconventional ergodic averages. She will also investigate the size and structure of integer distance sets, in both the Euclidean plane and in higher dimensions, by encoding them as subsets of rational points on certain families of varieties and then studying these varieties.

The theory of dynamical systems has its roots in celestial mechanics and has become an important tool in many other scientific fields. The proposed research deals with the question of whether a given dynamical system has rigidity properties, namely whether different trajectories must display a lot of common patterns. The principal investigator will conduct research on the topic, collaborate with other researchers, work with graduate and undergraduate students, and disseminate ideas developed in the project. The principal investigator will also organize seminars and conferences. In particular, the principal investigator will organize a series of research workshops for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will try to determine properties of certain classes of dynamical systems of group theoretical or number theoretical origins. One of such classes are actions on smooth manifolds by higher-rank commutative groups or by lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups. These actions are often expected to have rigidity, a phenomenon characterized by the scarcity of invariant structures under the action.  Another proposed line of research is the study of some special cases of the Mobius disjointness conjecture. These include certain distal topological systems and other systems whose trajectories have strict patterns in sufficiently long term.
