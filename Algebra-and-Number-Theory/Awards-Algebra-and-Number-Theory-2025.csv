The primary objective of these conferences is to discuss significant recent advances in Quantum Symmetry and explore the interplay between various research areas, while providing an environment that supports wide participation and career development. These conferences will bring together graduate students working on their masters or Ph.D.s, postdoctoral researchers, early-career researchers, and established experts in Quantum Symmetries to catalyze research progress by disseminating recent discoveries in the field, sharing open problems, hosting new and ongoing collaborations, and mentoring early-career participants. By creating a network of researchers amongst the participants, the conference series will strengthen ties between regional institutions and support the breadth of subtopics being investigated in the region as well as the range of personnel performing these investigations. The topic of these conferences is Quantum Symmetry broadly viewed, but anchored in the mathematics modeling quantum behavior with the goal of advancing knowledge in Quantum Symmetry.<br/><br/>Quantum Symmetry is a fundamental concept that permeates mathematics and physics, providing deep connections between topological, conformal, and more general quantum field theories and algebraic structures such as vertex operator algebras, Hopf algebras, tensor categories, and higher categories. These areas of mathematics study the structures which give rise to precise models for quantum behavior and are crucial for progress in applications such as quantum computing and error correction, enhanced encryption, and resolving the physical models of quantum mechanics with Einstein?s theory of relativity. The interconnectedness of these many subfields within the field of Quantum Symmetry makes the interdisciplinary collaborations and cross-fertilization of ideas facilitated by these conferences all the more important. More information about these conferences may be found at https://www3.nd.edu/~kbarron/QuaSy-Con.html .<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups may be understood as collections of symmetries, whose study was motivated by the desire to understand the symmetry of an object, whether it be in nature, art, communication networks, or any other place that symmetry might play a role. Group theory has applications in physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences. In recent years, research in group theory has had a significant impact on technological advances, such as in cryptography and coding theory. Representation theory is a tool used to better understand the structure of a group and the symmetries it represents by providing a way to view an abstract group as a group of matrices, whose structure is often easier to understand. This project focuses on a number of problems which seek to relate the representation theory of a finite group to the structure and representations of certain so-called local subgroups, which reflect numerical information encoded by the group. The award will also support educational activities centering graduate student mentorship and undergraduate research. These activities include local workshops for Colorado-area graduate students and postdocs and a Directed Reading Program. The latter provides a ""research-like"" experience for undergraduates, in which undergraduate mentees and graduate mentors work under the guidance of the PI to study a topic outside of the students? normal coursework. The activities in the grant also include supervising undergraduate researchers, Ph.D. students, and postdocs, who will work with the PI on problems within the scope of the project.<br/><br/>The problems of primary interest in this project are related to variations and consequences of the McKay?Navarro (MN) and Brauer?s Height Zero (BHZ) Conjectures. The PI and collaborators have recently proved the case of the prime 2 of the MN Conjecture, and many of the goals in this proposal are also aimed at establishing strategies for attacking the case of odd primes. In the case of BHZ, which was one of the longest-standing local-global conjectures, the PI and coauthors completed the proof of the conjecture in its entirety, and have been working toward stronger forms of the conjecture. The problems will involve the study of blocks of groups of Lie type, the action of Galois automorphisms on characters of groups of Lie type, and the interaction between the two. Since the effect of various group actions on parameterizations of characters is an especially problematic component in a number of local-global conjectures and other main problems regarding the representations of groups of Lie type, this is of interest to many other problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The set of points with complex coordinates which satisfies a fixed system of equations gives a geometric object is called an algebraic variety. The classification of algebraic varieties is the main motivation of the PI's field of birational geometry. On the other hand, arithmetic geometry is the study of polynomial equations whose coefficients are integers. This allows more tools from number theory to be used to study the corresponding varieties. The field of arithmetic geometry has recently seen an explosion of new techniques leading to spectacular progress. The PI's research on this project will apply these new techniques to problems in birational geometry which were previously out of reach. The educational component of the project involves several initiatives designed to increase access to a career in mathematics. This includes creating a summer school introducing high school students to mathematical proofs using the Lean proof assistant. <br/><br/>The project centers on interactions between birational and arithmetic geometry. New techniques from arithmetic geometry involving perfectoids and prisms have made it possible to overcome significant difficulties in mixed characteristic birational geometry, mainly related to the failure of cohomology vanishing theorems. These vanishing theorems are the primary method used in inductive arguments throughout birational geometry over the complex numbers, and their replacement in mixed characteristic promises significant advances. The main overarching objective of the projects will be to develop more powerful ways to replace vanishing theorems in mixed characteristic. The first application will be to study the singularities of integral models of Shimura varieties, which are an important class of varieties in arithmetic geometry. The PI will also investigate generalizing the theory of log canonical centers to mixed characteristic, which will enable him to investigate other problems in birational geometry such as boundedness and moduli of Fano varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI will continue to push these directions, as well as new ones stemming from the attendant technological developments. Furthermore, the project will integrate these pursuits with significant outreach, training, and mentorship efforts encompassing students across all tiers of education from primary to undergraduate to graduate. For example, PI will continue to organize outreach to local schools, research experiences for undergraduates, and graduate training workshops and mentorship opportunities. <br/><br/>Some of the specific research problems are as follows. The PI will further develop his new approach with Le Hung to the Breuil?Mezard Conjecture, which is based on an analogy with mirror symmetry, in order to cover general groups and fields. The PI will also extend the higher Siegel?Weil formula, proved for non-singular terms in joint work with Yun?Zhang, to more general terms, with the eventual goal of completing a higher version of the Kudla program over function fields. In another direction, the PI will geometrize the classical theory of the Weil representation, and the local theta correspondence, for p-adic groups. These have applications to the categorical Local Langlands correspondence, especially towards Langlands functoriality and the explicit construction of eigensheaves. The PI will supervise and mentor several Ph.D. students and postdocs on projects within these themes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More precisely, the shapes are complex projective manifolds and the linear invariants are Hodge structures. The famous ?Hodge conjecture?, first presented in 1950 at the International Congress of Mathematicians, states that the essential geometry of a complex projective manifold is recovered by its Hodge structure. As one of the Millennium Prize Problems, this conjecture has attached to it a one million dollar prize for a solution. While complex projective manifolds involve a bit of abstraction to define, they are fundamental objects in mathematics and physics; for example, the ?Calabi-Yau varieties? are a certain class of complex projective manifolds which can appear as the small dimensions of the universe in string theory. The main research goal of this project is to study the Hodge structures of Calabi-Yau varieties?to both gain insight into Hodge theory more generally for all complex projective manifolds, and to increase the depth of our understanding of Calabi-Yau varieties. Beyond pure research goals, the educational impact will be to develop an active community of young researchers and PhD students focusing on this circle of ideas.<br/><br/>The project will continue lines of research of the PI on toroidal compactifications of Calabi-Yau moduli. Recent joint work of the PI with V. Alexeev constructs a modular toroidal compactification of the moduli space of degree 2d polarized K3 surfaces. One research goal is to extend this work to hyperkahler and Calabi-Yau varieties, with an eye towards understanding the combinatorial structure of degenerations. Additionally, the project aims to study and prove general results concerning variations of Hodge structure (VHS). Joint work of the PI with S. Tayou is advancing our understanding of finiteness properties of Z-polarized VHS, and it now seems within reach that conjectures of Deligne and Simpson on the algebraicity of the non-abelian Hodge locus can be resolved. The approach is novel, incorporating ideas from hyperbolic geometry. The PI will also pursue results about period mappings for Calabi-Yau variations of Hodge structure, such as questions of boundedness of moduli of Calabi-Yau varieties of various classes, and under what circumstances Torelli theorems hold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry is the field of mathematics that studies the geometric shape of objects defined by polynomial equations. Often, the shape of these objects, called algebraic varieties, reflects the complexity of the defining equations and vice-versa. For instance, from the defining equations, we can understand if the algebraic variety has singularities, i.e., whether the geometric object has sharp points at which the curvature changes abruptly. These points are known as algebraic singularities. This project aims to develop new tools to understand algebraic singularities and apply these techniques to understand algebraic varieties of positive curvature.  As part of the broader impacts of this project, the PI will run online research seminars for graduate students related to the proposed research. The PI will initiate a summer reading program in algebraic geometry for undergraduates. The educational component of this project includes training in algebraic geometry for graduate students. Two summer research schools will be hosted at UCLA by the PI and experts in the field to train the new generation of mathematicians in birational geometry.<br/><br/>Fano varieties are considered one of the three building blocks of projective varieties. There has been a lot of progress towards understanding the geometry of Fano varieties in the last few decades. Nevertheless, the understanding of log terminal singularities (the local analog of Fano varieties) is far from being satisfactory. Complexity is an invariant that allows us to understand how far a Fano variety or a log terminal singularity is from being toric, i.e., defined by binomial equations. In this project, the PI will develop techniques to understand Fano varieties and log terminal singularities of small complexity, for instance, complexity zero, one, and two. There are two guiding principles: understanding the connection between the complexity and minimal log discrepancies (in the local setting) and understanding the connection between the complexity and anti-pluricanonical systems of Fano varieties (in the global setting). The PI aims to apply the former to study the termination of flips and the latter to understand the classification of cluster type Fano varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With origins in the 19th century study of prime numbers by Riemann and Dirichlet, this rich family of functions often serve as a bridge connecting several areas of mathematics including Diophantine equations, geometry, representation theory, and analysis. Examples arise both in the study of solutions to polynomial equations and in the theory of highly symmetric functions known as automorphic forms. The paradigm of the Langlands program indicates that the rich symmetry properties of automorphic forms may be used to prove properties of arithmetic L-functions, which have a wide array of applications. In the modern relative Langlands program, we now have a conjectural framework to make this relationship precise in terms of a duality between L-functions and certain invariants of automorphic forms known as ""periods"". In this context, the relative trace formula (RTF) provides a powerful tool from harmonic analysis to decompose an automorphic period into its ""irreducible components or modes"" which are often directly related to special values of L-functions. While such a formula is often the only tool available to establish the relationship alluded to above, the theory of the relative trace formula is still incomplete. In this project, the PI will explore several problems in the relative Langlands program using recently developed tools. In addition to providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student projects in this rapidly developing field, this project also supports several educational goals including the organization of seminars and the founding of a graduate student workshop designed to foster interaction among the area's graduate students in automorphic forms and offer opportunities to develop skill in giving professional presentations.<br/><br/>This project will complete the PI's theory of endoscopy in the relative setting and establish the stabilization of a large family of RTFs by developing a theory of twisted relative endoscopy, transfer factors, and variants of Ngo's geometric stabilization in the context of symmetric varieties. Each step will be informed by the connection between relative endoscopy and the duality conjectures of Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh, with a secondary goal of better understanding these conjectures in the arithmetic setting via the geometric aspects of the relative trace formula. The PI will apply these tools to applications in arithmetic geometry and the relative Langlands conjectures. This includes the case of generalized unitary Friedberg-Jacquet periods, with applications to the arithmetic geometry of certain Shimura varieties. A novel component of this project is to combine these two branches and develop a novel ""arithmetic"" theory of endoscopy, and to prove new endoscopic arithmetic fundamental lemmas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will consist of a series of talks given by senior faculty, junior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and students.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, number theory, and invariant theory are the primary fields of applications of commutative algebra. In its modern shape, commutative algebra originated in the works of several well-known mathematicians, especially Dedekind, Hilbert, Kronecker, Krull, Kummer, and Noether, during the nineteenth century and was vastly developed later in the outstanding work of Grothendieck on modern algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. In the 1950's, homological algebra (that originates from algebraic topology) made its way into the commutative algebra toolbox in the works of Auslander-Buchbaum and Serre to help with solving open problems in commutative algebra. Connections between commutative algebra, representation theory, combinatorics, and deformation theory appeared in the past century in numerous places as well. This conference focuses on topics in the above-mentioned fields that are tightly connected (and can be applied) to fundamental problems in homological commutative algebra such as problems related to the betti numbers and minimal free resolutions, relative homological algebra, properties of subcategories of the module category, and vanishing of homology and cohomology modules.

In recent years, there have been several major advances in the field of Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Cycles. Arithmetic Geometry is the study of spaces from the point of view of number theory and is largely concerned with the solutions of polynomial equations, especially over the integers. Algebraic K-Theory and Algebraic Cycles are certain special techniques that can understand the geometric nature of a problem, one that is again defined in terms of polynomial equations. In recent years there have been a number of important developments in this area and the purpose of the week-long workshop and conference is to bring together established experts in these areas along with early-career researchers with the goal of stimulating further progress.<br/><br/>In more detail, in recent years there have been major developments in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Cycles, leading up to the solution of the Milnor, Bloch-Kato and Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures, as well as the conjectures of Thomason and Morel concerned with equivariant phenomena for actions of linear algebraic groups. The powerful techniques introduced for the solution of the above conjectures have stimulated work on several outstanding remaining problems in the area, which are often arithmetic in nature, but use sophisticated tools from Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic cycles. The goal of the program is to focus on several of the outstanding problems in the area, surveying the progress made and planning strategies for further advancement.

This is a research conference in several areas of Mathematics. Many leading researchers in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic Geometry, K-Theory, Topology and related topics will be speakers in this meeting and outline current research they and their collaborators are pursuing in these areas. The collective theme is that they were all worked on by John Tate and in some cases started by him. John Tate proved many fundamental theorems, but perhaps more importantly, he demonstrated new ways of thinking about mathematics that show no signs of slowing more than half a century after he introduced them. The majority of the funds will be used to assist with expenses for junior faculty and graduate students without other means of support, to attend and participate in the meeting. <br/><br/>John Tate founded or strongly influenced many of the primary areas of study within algebraic geometry and number theory: his thesis, which gave a different way of looking at zeta and L-functions of number fields, the cohomological reformulation of local and global class field theory, arithmetic duality, nonarchimedean analysis, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, algebraic K-theory of local and global fields, p-adic Hodge theory, and conjectures on algebraic cycles. All of these are active areas of study. The conference will explain in detail how Tate's ideas and results have shaped the field in a fundamental way and are still leading to major advances. This conference will help inspire the current and next generation of mathematicians to extend and go beyond what is presently known in these areas. <br/><br/>Conference website: https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/the-legacy-of-john-tate-and-beyond/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project deals with the recent resurgence of integrable systems in the context of algebraic geometry and representation theory, motivated by the study of quantum field theories. The results of the research are expected to elucidate the phenomenon of three-dimensional mirror symmetry originally discovered in theoretical physics. Broader impacts include establishing an interdisciplinary program for mathematics and physics students. The project contains undergraduate and graduate student research topics and aims for vertical integration of research and education. The PI will also co-organize several conferences designed for early-career researchers. The project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis program, the Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project deals with the geometric realization of several points of view on the Bethe ansatz approach to quantum integrable systems. One approach uses quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations emerging naturally in the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties. Another one relies on the study of QQ-systems, generalizing the relations satisfied by the Baxter operators. The geometric realization of QQ-systems is derived from the properties of the difference equation version of oper connections on the projective line, generalizing the correspondence between oper connections and Bethe equations for the Gaudin model. The PI plans to show how these geometric points of view on the Bethe ansatz are bonded together within the framework of the quantum q-Langlands correspondence. This is expected to lead to new results in the study of the mathematical formulation of three-dimensional mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes work in additive combinatorics concerning generalizations of Szemerédi's theorem on arithmetic progressions (sequences of numbers that are all equally spaced, like 4, 6, 8, and 10), which, informally, says that any sufficiently large collection of whole numbers contains a long arithmetic progression. It is a central problem in additive combinatorics to determine how large ""sufficiently large"" is. The investigator will study versions of this question involving more complicated patterns than arithmetic progressions, and then use the results and techniques developed to make progress on a related problem in ergodic theory. The investigator will also study the size and structure of integer distance sets, which are sets of points whose pairwise distances are all whole numbers. This award will support undergraduate summer research on representation theory and additive combinatorics, and also support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigator will build on her previous work on quantitative bounds for subsets of the integers lacking polynomial progressions of distinct degrees and for subsets of vector spaces over finite fields lacking a certain four-point configuration to tackle more general polynomial, multidimensional, and multidimensional polynomial configurations. The results for multidimensional polynomial configurations of distinct degree will then be used to make progress on the Furstenberg--Bergelson--Leibman conjecture in ergodic theory, which concerns the pointwise almost everywhere convergence of certain nonconventional ergodic averages. She will also investigate the size and structure of integer distance sets, in both the Euclidean plane and in higher dimensions, by encoding them as subsets of rational points on certain families of varieties and then studying these varieties. With her undergraduate students, the investigator will study the distribution of entries in the character tables of symmetric groups and some algorithmic problems in higher-order Fourier analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
