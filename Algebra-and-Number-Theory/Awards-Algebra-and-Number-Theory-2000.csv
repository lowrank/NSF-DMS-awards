In moduli theory they study questions related to the moduli stacks of twisted stable maps into a tame Deligne-Mumford stack.  Questions addressed include constructions towards Gromov-Witten invariants of stacks, generalizations of twisted stable maps to higher dimensions and to wild stacks, and applications to the theory of admissible covers, level structures, spin structures and higher dimensional varieties.  The investigator and colleagues will also study problems in birational geometry: the strong factorization conjecture, which says that a birational map of smooth projective varieties should factor as a sequence of smooth blowings up followed by a sequence of smooth blowings down; and the toroidalization conjecture, which says that, given a surjective morphism of complex projective manifolds, there is a way to blow up both source and target along smooth centers so that the resulting map is a toroidal morphism.<br/><br/>The area of study of this project lies within algebraic geometry, the branch of mathematics devoted to geometric shapes called algebraic varieties, defined by polynomial equations. While algebraic geometry has contributed applications in coding, industrial control, and computation, the topics of this project are more closely related to applications in theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as components of the fine structure of our universe. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli theory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often manifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own right. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of ""organisms"" as itself being an ""organism"" is not a just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. Sometimes a collection of algebraic varieties manifests itself as a slightly more general object, called a stack, rather than a variety. Such stacks are a central object of study of this project. The other topic studied in this project is birational geometry, which is devoted to a certain abstract relationship, called birational equivalence, among algebraic varieties, which lies at the foundation of algebraic geometry. A goal of this project is to understand the connection between this abstract notion, and a much more concrete relationship given by an algebraic ""surgery"" procedure called ""blowing up""."

In recent years deep and unexpected connections have been found between algebraic enumeration and stochastic processes, in particular in the empirical process and in Brownian motion.  The primary objective of this research is to explore this connection.  The starting point is the probabilistic model of branching processes.  On one hand, branching processes encode various combinatorial structures such as rooted trees, parking functions, and multi-colored structures.  On the other hand, random graph evolution in the \double jump"" can be described by branching processes with the expected family size near one.  From the algebraic standpoint, the PI plans to address the combi- natorial applications in branching processes and probabilistic results in combinatorics.  She will investigate the behavior of branching processes with near critical offspring distributions by applying well-developed techniques in algebraic enumeration.  She will also study the asymptotic properties of certain random structures from the probability theory of branching processes.  From the stochastic standpoint, the PI plans to develop stochastic models for the theory of random graphs and random generated trees via branching processes, and to relate such models to the theory of Brownian motion.  The emphasis is a combinatorial under- standing of the techniques and results of stochastic processes and calculus.  The PI expects to apply the model to graph enumeration, and to investigate the distributive asymptotics of random graphs and other random structures.<br/><br/>In addition to the core research program outlined above, the PI intends to pursue three algebraic problems arising from the probabilistic method and extremal combinatorics.  The first is a recurrence associated with Turan problems; the second is on discrepancy theory, and the third is on balancing vectors.  The objective here is to extend our knowledge of algebraic structures on discrete systems and to develop new approaches in combinatorics.<br/>"

The intent is to establish an annual combinatorics conference to be held each spring at a university in the South-Central United States.  There are currently several regional combinatorics/graph theory conferences held annually, including the Southeastern Combinatorics Conference, the Midwest Graph Theory Conference, the Cumberland Conference in the Ohio River Valley, and the Smith Conference in Massachusetts.  No similar series of meetings are currently being held in Texas or any of the surrounding states.  At the same time, the number of combinatorialists in the region has been rising steadily in recent years, creating a need for a regular vehicle for communication. The conference series will strive to bring in speakers from diverse subfields of combinatorics, at varying career stages, and from different universities within the region, as well as a small number of distinguished speakers from outside the region. Speakers for the first talk include two international speakers (Guenter Ziegler of the Technische Universitaet Berlin and Dominic Welsh of Oxford University) as well as five speakers from the region (Margaret Bayer of the University of Kansas, Joseph Kung of the University of North Texas, James Oxley of Louisiana State University,William Trotter of Arizona State University, and Catherine Yan of Texas A&M University).  The funds provided by the NSF will enable the proposers to offer stipends to graduate students and postdocs from other institutions to allow them to attend the conference as well as to provide domestic travel expenses and modest honoraria for the seven primary speakers.<br/><br/>The growth of the combinatorics community in the region is reflective of the growth in the activity and importance of combinatorics in the last few decades.  The proliferation of computer technology has only accelerated this trend, since combinatorics and discrete mathematics provide the foundations on which the theories and practices of computation are based.  The speed of this growth and the breadth of the field's application increases the need for regular communication between researchers.  This is especially true in this part of the country, in which the geographical distances between researchers impedes more impromptu communication. The format of the conference addresses these needs, encouraging broad-based talks from diverse subfields and including a poster session and other occasions for informal discussions.<br/>"

Capacity is a measure of size for sets, which arises <br/>in potential theory and has applications in probability, complex analysis, <br/>and number theory.  The chief goal of this project is to prove a very strong <br/>version of the Fekete-Szego theorem on algebraic curves, which asserts that <br/>if an adelic set on a curve has large enough capacity, then there exist <br/>algebraic points with all their conjugates near it, in an adelic sense. <br/>The new theorem will be a basic existence theorem producing algebraic points <br/>which are subject to real and p-adic rationality conditions, as well as <br/>topological constraints. To fix ideas, for sets in the complex plane, the <br/>capacity of a circle turns out to equal its radius, and the capacity of a <br/>line segment is a quarter of its length.  In analysis, the primary distinction <br/>is between sets of capacity  0  and sets of positive capacity:  sets of <br/>capacity  0  are 'invisible' to holomorphic functions.  In number theory, <br/>the main distinction is between sets of capacity greater than  1,  and less <br/>than  1.  The classical theorem of Fekete and Szego says that for a set in <br/>the complex plane stable under complex conjugation, if the capacity of the <br/>set is greater than 1, then every neighborhood of the set contains infinitely <br/>many Galois orbits of algebraic integers.  David Cantor generalized the theorem <br/>to adelic sets on the projective line, and subsequently the investigator <br/>generalized it to adelic sets on algebraic curves.  As an application, <br/>the investigator proved an existence theorem for algebraic integer points on <br/>affine algebraic varieties, which has been the object of considerable work by <br/>Moret-Bailly and Szpiro and their students.  Earlier, Raphael Robinson had <br/>extended the Fekete-Szego theorem in another direction, showing that if a <br/>set of capacity greater than  1  were contained in the real line, then every <br/>real neighborhood contained infinitely many Galois orbits of totally real <br/>algebraic integers.   Recently the investigator proved an adelic version of <br/>Robinson's theorem, proving the existence of algebraic numbers which were <br/>totally real and totally p-adic at a finite number of places.  The goal of <br/>the project is to generalize this theorem to algebraic curves.  The methods <br/>used will involve p-adic analysis, potential theory, and approximation theory <br/>for algebraic functions. <br/><br/>The study of diophantine equations (looking for integer solutions to <br/>polynomial equations in several variables) is a very old and very difficult <br/>subject, going back to the Greeks.  It is only within the last half-century <br/>that much progress has been made, using methods of modern number theory.  Two <br/>famous results were a negative solution to ""Hilbert's Tenth problem"" <br/>(by Matiyasevich in 1970), which asks if there is an algorithm for determining <br/>whether or not a given equation has integer solutions;  and the negative <br/>resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Wiles in 1995), which asks if sums of <br/>n-th powers of integers can be n-th powers.   The investigator's work pursues <br/>a different direction, showing that for much larger arithmetic domains than <br/>the integers, under appropriate conditions there do exist solutions;  and <br/>moreover there exist algorithms for telling whether or not they exist.  <br/>The current work will considerably reduce the size of the domains where <br/>solutions are known to exist."

The Hilbert  correspondence generalizes De Rham theory, and establishes a deep connection between the topology of a given complex algebraic variety (as encoded in the category of perverse sheaves on the variety) and the behavior of systems of differential operators defined on the variety (which are encoded as D-modules on the variety;  that is, as sheaves of modules over the sheaf of rings of differential operators on the variety).  The  proposed p-adic analogue would perform a similar function for varieties over the p-adic numbers.  It would yield an equivalence between the (currently conjectural) category of ``crystalline perverse sheaves'' on such a variety, and the (again conjectural) category of weakly admissible filtered D-modules equipped with a Frobenius operator.  The category of crystalline perverse sheaves is believed to carry both geometric and also arithmetic information about the variety  to which it is attached, and would for example be a natural ingredient in a p-adic analogue of Beilinson's theory of regulators.  This gives some hint of the important role that such a category of sheaves can be expected to play in the local analysis at p of systems of Diophantine equations.<br/><br/>The problem of solving equations is one of the most basic in mathematics, going back at least to the mathematicians of ancient Greece, such as Diophantus.  He studied the problem of solving equations in whole numbers; such equations are now known as Diophantine equations. Since the work of Descartes and Fermat, it has been understood that geometry provides a powerful tool for analyzing systems of equations, even if one is at first more interested in the equations from an arithmetic point of view.  For this reason, the development of powerful geometric tools is important for progress in the theory of Diophantine equations.  In this project, the investigator and his collaborator intend to develop such tools, by extending known techniques in the usual so-called archimedean geometry to the context of non-archimedean, or p-adic, geometry. This geometry, which has a strong arithmetic  flavor, provides a crucial geometric setting for the analysis of Diophantine equations, and these techniques are expected to yield several new developments in that analysis.  Such developments are important not only because they enrich what continues to be one of the center pieces of the mathematical tradition, but because the theory of Diophantine equations has deep interconnections with the theory of discrete processes, and especially with the theory of codes, so that progress in theory of Diophantine equations can be expected to yield progress in these fields.<br/><br/><br/>"

Izadi's research is to better understand principally polarized abelian varieties and their moduli spaces, the moduli spaces of curves and their relation with the moduli spaces of principally polarized abelian varieties to which they map.  Her project has two main parts. In the first part she relates the Hodge conjectures for an abelian variety to those for its theta divisor. In particular, one of the steps involved in proving the Hodge conjectures for an abelian variety is to prove them for the primitive cohomology of its theta divisor.  For this, she needs to find appropriate curves in the theta divisor.  These also have applications to the theory of Prym-Tjurin varieties. In the second part she reduces the Hodge conjecture for abelian fourfolds to proving a specific result about a particular family of curves in the abelian variety: she also works on this.<br/><br/>This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, whose main objects of study are algebraic varieties.  These are classically defined as the sets of simultaneous zeros of polynomials. Curves and abelian varieties are special algebraic varieties which classically appear in the work of Abel, Jacobi and Riemann among others, who developed the theory of modular forms.  They have applications in many areas of mathematics including number theory; in particular, they were used in Faltings' proof of the Mordell Conjecture and in Wiles' proof of the Semistable Shimura Taniyama Weil Conjecture.  Abelian varieties make ideal testing grounds for important conjectures in algebraic geometry such as the Hodge Conjectures.  These are deep conjectures which concern the analytic structure of algebraic varieties.  They were originally formulated in the form of questions by Hodge, then reformulated and corrected by others including some of the greatest mathematicians of this century such as Grothendieck.  They are central to the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 20 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries.  Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.<br/><br/>"

In<br/>particular, the investigator studies the minimum squared Euclidean<br/>weight of these codes.  This quantity is closely related to an<br/>exponential sum, where the sum is over points on the curve (defined<br/>over the ring) used in the construction of the code.  Thus, the<br/>question of the error-correcting capability of these codes is reduced<br/>to a question in number theory.

Additionally, the PI is working towards the development of a<br/>decoding algorithm for these codes, with respect to the squared<br/>Euclidean weight.  The second main goal of the project involves the<br/>search for a structure theory of codes, a topic which has been around<br/>almost from the beginning of the study of codes.  This search was<br/>largely unsuccessful until the introduction of so-called critical<br/>indecomposable codes in a recent paper of Assmus. The PI is developing<br/>this theory further and demonstrating its power by revisiting the<br/>classification of self-dual codes.<br/><br/>Whenever data is transmitted across a channel, errors are bound to<br/>occur.  The goal of coding theory is to find efficient ways of adding<br/>redundancy so that errors can be detected, or even corrected.  Two<br/>basic questions must be asked about every code: ""What is the<br/>error-correcting capability of this code?"" and ""If an error occurs in<br/>transmission while using this code, is there an efficient way of<br/>recovering the original codeword?""  In the case that code is defined<br/>over the ring of integers modulo a power of a prime, the<br/>error-correcting capability of the code is measured in terms of the<br/>code's minimum squared Euclidean weight and the investigator studies<br/>this property in the case of algebraic geometric codes.  The problem<br/>of recovering the original codeword is equivalent to finding a<br/>decoding algorithm for the code, which has important connections to<br/>cryptography also.  Finally, a structure theory for codes allows the<br/>study of codes from a systematic point of view.

Quantum Chaos is concerned with how chaos in classical systems manifests itself in terms of quantum mechanics. For instance, can chaos, or lack thereof, be detected in the statistical behavior of the energy levels when a classical system is quantized?  Pursuing this question for the ``boxed harmonic oscillator'', a simple system whose energy levels show interesting spacing behavior, led the co-P.I. to consider spacings between squares modulo highly composite integers.  The first goal of this project is to generalize the results on spacings of squares to spacings between values of more general polynomials, both modulo highly composite integers, as well as modulo primes.  In this context it is also interesting to study the distribution of the cardinality of the images of these polynomial maps.  Another aspect of Quantum Chaos is the quantum mechanical analogue of classical ergodicity.  The ``cat map'' is a simple model of a chaotic system, and its quantization has strong arithmetical features.  Using these special features, it is possible to express Quantum Ergodicity for the cat map in terms of exponential sums.  A second goal of this proposal is to prove quantum unique ergodicity for the quantized cat map using equidistribution results for exponential sums.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to explore the connection between Quantum Chaos and Number Theory. Quantum Chaos tries to answer important questions in Physics regarding quantum mechanical analogues of classical chaos.  The subject has applications to microelectronics, and is hence of interest to the computer and communications industry. Number Theory is concerned with properties of whole numbers and is one of the oldest branches of mathematics.  For a long time it was studied mostly because of aesthetic reasons, but in the last few decades the field has been of fundamental importance to cryptography <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

One of the most successful technique in the study of such a set <br/>of solutions is to reduce the equations modulo a prime p and to study first the <br/>set of solutions of the latter system of equations. It turns out that in many <br/>situations, it is possible to describe a canonical way of reducing the <br/>equations modulo p. For instance, the canonical reduction of an abelian <br/>variety is called its Neron model, and is the object of study in Lorenzini's <br/>first research project. The canonical reduction of a curve is called its <br/>regular minimal model, and is the object of study in Lorenzini's second <br/>research project. For all but finitely many prime p, the canonical reduction <br/>is `good' and, as the name suggests, such a reduction type  can be better <br/>understood than the reduction at the finitely many remaining primes. Our <br/>present understanding of the information encoded in the canonical reductions <br/>that are not good (and not semistable) is far from complete. Some very <br/>difficult problems arise when studying reductions modulo small primes. One <br/>such difficulty can be stated as follows. A famous theorem due to Grothendieck <br/>and others states that there exists a finite field extension L/K such that <br/>the reduction of the initial equations viewed as equations over L is either <br/>good or semistable. In other words, it is possible to improve the reduction <br/>by extending the initial field. When p is large, the extension L/K is totally<br/>understood once its degree is known: it is the unique cyclic extension of that<br/>degree. When p is small and divides the degree of L/K, there are infinitely <br/>many extensions of that given degree, and almost nothing is known about the <br/>specific extension L/K needed to improve the reduction of the initial <br/>equations. Lorenzini's proposed research will shed more light on this <br/>and other special phenomena that arise when the reduction modulo a small <br/>prime p is not `good'.<br/><br/>For centuries, human beings have been fascinated with solving diophantine <br/>equations, named after the Greek mathematician Diophantus who lived in <br/>the third century AD. The field of diophantine equations has taken on<br/>added significance in the modern world as it finds applications in a<br/>variety of areas including, for example, encryption. A diophantine equation <br/>is a mathematical expression in several variables, say x and y.  The central <br/>problem in the field is to find all possible solutions where x and y <br/>are both whole numbers or both fractions. For instance, the equation xy-10=0 <br/>has many solutions (e.g., x = y = square root of 10) but the solutions in <br/>whole positive numbers are in this case the divisors of 10, namely <br/>(x,y) = (1,10), (2,5), (5,2), and (10,1). While such an  equation is very <br/>simple, a slight modification, such as replacing 10 by a very large number <br/>(for instance, one having 150 digits) renders the new equation extremely hard <br/>to solve in practice. It is this fact, that it is so hard to solve such <br/>equations, that is the key to many of the safest current military codes and <br/>data encryption systems. The complexity of the determination of all solutions <br/>in whole numbers or fractions of an equation increases with the power at which<br/>the variables appear in the equation. For instance, the equation `x to the <br/>power n plus y to the power n equals 1' was conjectured in the 17th century <br/>to have only two solutions when n is any odd number greater than 1. <br/>(Those two solutions are (x,y)=(1,0) and (x,y)= (0,1). This  conjecture <br/>is called Fermat's Last Theorem and was proved only in 1994. Since the time <br/>of the Greeks, mathematicians have developed sophisticated tools to aid in <br/>solving equations. This investigator has developed some such mathematical <br/>tools and is currently working on further contributions to this field."

This is intended to mean the representation theory of finite groups and related finite dimensional algebras, cohomology of finite groups, and computer calculations in these areas.  Over the last few years, the representation theory and cohomology of finite groups has seen some spectacular advances in a number of different directions.  On the computational side, the development of the computer algebra package MAGMA by John Cannon and his associates in Australia has enabled explicit calculations of projective resolutions and cohomology of groups on an impressive scale.  These computations have, in their turn, fed back into the design and development of the MAGMA package.  Theoretical input for these calculations comes from group actions on finite simplicial complexes and associated topological constructions at the level of the classifying space.  Methods originating in work of Peter Webb have been implemented by a number of people, including Adem, Carlson, Maginnis, Milgram and Smith.  These calculations seem to be intimately related to the homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces appearing in recent work of Dwyer, Jackowski, McClure, Oliver, etc.  A good example of the interaction between these techniques is given by the recent calculation of the cohomology of the Higman-Sims sporadic simple group by Adem, Carlson, Karagueuzian and Milgram.  One of the strongest reasons for studying the cohomology of finite groups is its connections with representation theory.  Recent developments in this direction have focused on structure of module categories, especially the associated stable categories and derived categories. Work of Benson, Carlson and Rickard on the stable category, and of Broue, Rickard, Rouquier and others on the derived category have been central to this development.  Computations with specific groups have been at the core of these developments, and many of the theorems and conjectures in the subject have arisen this way.<br/><br/>Representation theory, in the context of this conference, means the representations of abstract groups as groups of matrices.  Calculations in this area have implications in algebra, topology, geometry and number theory. Recent advances in high performance computing, combined with equally great theoretical advances over the last few years, have led to the development of powerful new techniques for calculating with representations and cohomology of groups, and this then feeds back into the theoretical development.  A symbiotic relationship exists between the researchers carrying out these calculations and the developers of software such as the MAGMA package for algebra and number theory.  The purpose of this conference is to bring together the people working in the theoretical and computational aspects of this and closely related subjects at this time of rapid development, in order to promote interaction and collaboration.  The three main speakers will give series of expository talks on computational algebra, cohomology of groups and representation theory, while other participants will give more technical talks.<br/>"

Second, parametrization of the local components of residual automorphic representations. It is a part of Arthur's conjecture on parametrizing the discrete spectrum in terms of representations of a certain profinite arithmetic group. The first problem is to establish the holomorphy of all completed automorphic L-functions attached to generic cuspidal representations which appear in the constant terms of Eisenstein series. The PI uses Langlands-Shahidi method and the observation that the local components of residual automorphic representations are unitary representations. This is possible because one has the holomorphy and non-vanishing of normalized local intertwining operators due to recent progress on local results, such as standard module conjecture and Shahidi's conjecture on the holomorphy of local L-functions. For example, the PI established, as a joint work with Shahidi, the holomorphy of the third symmetric power L-functions attached to non-monomial cuspidal representations of GL_2, which had been unsolved last 20 years. The PI continues to work on the existence of the symmetric cube lift of cuspidal representations of GL_2, using the converse theorem. The second problem is to parametrize the local components of residual automorphic representations. This amounts to parametrizing the image of normalized local intertwining operators. The PI wants to show that the local components of the residual automorphic representations coming from the trivial character of the torus, are parametrized by the distinguished unipotent orbits of the dual group and Springer correspondence.<br/><br/>This research area is in a part of number theory generally known as the Langlands program. Number theory is the study of the properties of whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning, <br/>problems in number theory have served as a driving force in creating new mathematics in other diverse parts of the discipline. The Langlands program is a general philosophy that connects number theory with calculus; it embodies the modern approach to the study of whole numbers. Modern number theory is very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer science and coding theory."

In previous studies of intersection theory this is the case that has been ignored, since in general these cycles do not meet (thus we call them non-intersectional cycles).  The space of cycles is a big puzzle to us, and this non-intersectional case is a piece that is still missing from the puzzle.  So in order to have a complete picture of space of cycles, one should also include non-intersectional cycles.  The first case studied by the investigator was the linking case where the dimensions of cycles add up to the number that is one less than the dimension of the ambient space.  The fundamental approach is that such an intersection theory should not only include the cycles that meet, but also those that do not meet.  To accomplish this the investigator borrows a tool-Archimedean height pairing from Arakelov geometry (or to be precise, the Arithmetic intersection theory developed by Gillet and Soule), which is only defined for pairs of linking cycles that do not meet.  In this direction the investigator has made significant progress:  (1) He obtained formulas for the leading term of the asymptotics of Archimedean height pairing.  (2) Investigating Mazur's incidence structure, he constructed an incidence divisor on the Chow variety.  (3) Based on above two results, he gave a proof of Clemens' conjecture: generic quintic three folds admit only finitely many smooth rational curves of each degree.  The plan is to further the understanding of this intersection theory that includes general non-intersectional cycles.  The project is concentrated in (1) the study of incidence divisors, (2) the relation between the incidence equivalence and the Abel-Jacobi equivalence, (3) the application to a study of the relation between the Chow group and the Chow variety, (4) the application to a construction of Beilinson-Bloch filtration on the Chow group. <br/><br/>One of the most fundamental problems in mathematics is the solving of algebraic equations.  Once people it was realized that one could not always explicitly write down the solutions of equations, the paradigm changed into the mode of examining different types of questions such as: does a solution exist, if so, how many solutions are there, do the solution sets have additional structure?  These are the fundamental questions in algebraic geometry.  In order to answer them, mathematicians have developed varied techniques, one of which-intersection theory--studies he intersection of solution sets of two or more systems of equations.  In this project, the investigator plans to develop a new method in intersection theory.  The significance of this project is to investigate material that is less studied or completely untouched by the current techniques of intersection theory.<br/><br/><br/>"

The various topics studied are in fact deeply connected with one another, and the solution of certain of these problems is expected to be useful in the analysis and solution of other problems.  The long-term goal of the investigators is to contribute to the deeper development of a mathematical theory that will enhance the conceptual understanding of many known and still-unknown connections among many branches of mathematics.<br/><br/>The theory of ""vertex operator algebras"" arose naturally in the study of both continuous symmetries and a very special large finite group of symmetries called the ""Monster.""  This theory is fundamental to a wide range of problems in many branches of mathematics and in theoretical physics.  Some years ago, it was very surprising to mathematicians that the Monster appeared to be deeply connected to number theory.  Equally remarkably, this purely mathematical connection, at first only speculative, was considerably clarified by the introduction of new mathematical ideas related to a completely different theory---a physical theory called ""string theory,"" which aims at unifying all the fundamental forces in nature, including gravity, electricity and magnetism, and nuclear forces.  One result of this mathematical progress has been a richly developed theory of vertex operator algebras, a theory that continues to find new and surprising applications at a rapid rate.  A very important theme is that vertex operator algebras are basic ingredients of the mathematical construction of physical theories called ""conformal quantum field theories,"" which arose both in the study of the properties of solids and fluids and in string theory.  Conformal field theory is in the process of being rapidly developed into a rich and beautiful mathematical theory.  This development is expected to continue to yield solutions to many mathematical problems, involving symmetry, geometry, topology, algebra and number theory, and to yield further applications to the deeper understanding of nature and, it is hoped, the development of technology involving solids and fluids.  The proposed project uses a variety of mathematical ideas to deepen the understanding of vertex operator algebra theory and of conformal field theory, and to develop a range of new applications.<br/><br/>"

Each such object possesses a group called its ``symmetry group'' which captures the symmetry properties of the object and which makes possible certain kinds of useful calculations based on symmetry.  For example, the recognition and exploitation of symmetry groups is decisive in many complex counting schemes, in many algorithms for coding and decoding, in X-ray crystallography and in quantum physics.  The most fundamental groups are the so-called ``simple'' groups; for example, all the finite groups (those corresponding to objects possessing a finite number of symmetries) are built out of finite ``simple'' groups. Indeed many finite groups which arise in important applications are simple or nearly simple.  For these reasons, the problem of determining all the finite simple groups is of paramount importance from both the theoretical and applied perspectives.  The intensive investigation of this problem began in the early 1950's, and is nearing fruition through the work of the investigator and his colleague, as well as other researchers.<br/><br/>"

The definition of Langlands lifting can be done the following way. First one  can define the local lifting.  For an archimedean place one can define Langlands lifting in the following way.  By Langlands theorem any irreducible admissible representation of a classical group one  can attach a homomorphism of the Weil group to the L-group of this classical group. After that, for any classical group there is  a natural embedding to the L-group of a general linear group.  In this way one can attach a representation of the Weil group over a archimedean field a representation of the general linear group over that field.  Similarly one can attach to any unramified representation of a classical group over a non-archimedean field we attach a semisimple conjugacy class of the L-group of the given classical group.  The image of this conjugacy class in the corresponding general linear group L-group determines an unramified representation of the general linear group over the non-archimedean field.  In this way to an automorphic representation of the classical group one can attach a collection of local representations of the general linear group defined at all archimedean places and at all unramified places. It is a well know statement that if a cuspidal  automorphic representation of the general linear group exists with this data then it is unique.  So the proposal is devoted to the study of Langlands lifting.<br/><br/>Langlands lifting is a part of Langlands philosophy.  I was asked by the program director for algebra and number theory to explain what the Langlands program is. I have thought about this a lot of time and I can say the following.  Langlands philosophy gives a connection between automorphic forms  and Dirichlet series.  The most  important example of a Dirichlet series is the famous Riemann zeta function.  The automorphic form is the classical theta function of Jacobi.  A second example the automorphic function is the so called Delta function which is a modular form of weight twelve.  The corresponding Dirichlet series was studied first by Mordell who showed it had an Euler product.  The coefficients of the Delta function are usually called the Ramanujan numbers.  The basic properties of these numbers is that they are multiplicative.  So the corresponding L-function has an Euler product and similar properties to the Riemann zeta function, namely holomorphic continuation the the whole complex plane and satisfies a functional equation.  This connection can be extended to any algebraic reductive group.  Let me explain it for the general linear group.  Let's consider the space of functions which consists on all functions on the group of adeles invariant on the left side with respect to the group of principal adeles.  Any smooth  function of this type will be called an automorphic form.  There is a way how one can attach to any automorphic form on the general linear group a Dirichlet series which has an Euler product and nice analytic properties, a nice functional equation, and holomorphic continuation to the whole complex plane.<br/><br/><br/>"

It has led to unprecedented synthesis of different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics that include integrable Hamiltonian systems, theory of Riemann surfaces and vector bundles, theory of knots and three dimensional manifolds, representations of the Monster group and other sporadic groups, Brownian motion on compact groups and more general path integration, theory of modular functions, commutative systems of differential and difference equations and theory of generalized hypergeometric functions, integrable models of statistical mechanics, string theory and others.  One part of the proposal contains further steps extending this relation.  The author proposes an approach to q-deformation of a class of vertex operator algebras and the related problem of elliptic deformation of certain braided tensor categories.  There is a strong evidence that the resulting algebraic structures will provide an algebraic foundation of 2-dimensional quantum field theory, which does not possess the conformal invariance. <br/><br/>    The main part of the proposal is dedicated to the first substantial representation theoretic approach to 4-dimensional quantum field theory.  The principal investigator plans to develop the theory of vertex representations, which played the key role in 2-dimensional conformal field theory, using representation theory of families of finite groups called wreath products and associated quadratic algebras.  In this algebraic approach, which has also a deep geometric counterpart, various structures of vertex representations studied by the proposer and other mathematicians in the last 20 years can be realized as Grothendieck rings and operations between them.  Since the Grothendieck rings are always ""tips of icebergs"" of the full representation categories underlying these rings, one of the main objectives is to extend this realization to a level of representation categories and functors between these categories.  This is the long range goal of the present proposal.  It is expected that in the same way as theory of vertex representations is an algebraic foundation of 2-dimensional conformal field theory, the new theory will provide an appropriate algebraic structure for the 4-dimensional generalization, which will lead in the next 20 years (or longer!) to a synthesis of practically all areas of pure mathematics and mathematical physics.<br/><br/>"

In this project he focuses attention on the low-dimensional homology groups of the general linear group over the coordinate ring of an elliptic curve over a number field with the goal of proving that the second K-group of such a curve has finite rank.  This extends Knudson's previous work on the homology of rank one groups over such rings.  In addition, a new homology theory based on algebraic cycles in the product of a scheme with the simplicial classifying scheme of an algebraic group is constructed and its properties investigated.  The hope is that this construction will lead to a proof of the Friedlander-Milnor conjecture concerning the homology of algebraic groups made discrete.  Also, the investigator's previous work on the structure of special linear groups over integral Laurent polynomial rings is used in the study of the Burau representation of the braid groups.  This representation is known to be faithful for three strings and unfaithful for five or more strings; the remaining case of four strings is singled out for study in this project.  Finally, Knudson studies the completion of a discrete group relative to a Zariski dense representation in a reductive group over a field of positive characteristic.  This generalizes the classical unipotent completion of a group and extends to positive characteristic R. Hain's work in characteristic zero.<br/><br/>A scheme is a geometric object constructed from solution sets of polynomial equations.

Such curves have remarkably rich structure and appear in various branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry and coding theory.  A seemingly unrelated part of this project concerns the so-called Burau representation of the braid groups which is intimately connected with knot theory.  These diverse topics are unified by studying the structure of groups of matrices with entries in various rings (the coordinate ring of the elliptic curve in the first case and the ring of integral Laurent polynomials in the second).

Let p be a prime.  Is the center, Cp, of the division ring of p x p generic matrices stably rational over the base field?  This is an old problem which has been studied extensively over several decades, in particular for its connections to important problems in other fields, such as geometric invariant theory and Brauer groups.  If G is a finite group, and M is a ZG-lattice, then F(M) denotes the quotient field of the group algebra of the abelian group M written multiplicatively.  Procesi and Formanek have shown that Cn is isomorphic to the fixed field under the action of Sn of F(M) for a specific ZSn-lattice M.  The findings of the investigator can be briefly described as two reduction steps. Let p be a prime.  First, the investigator has shown that under certain conditions induction-restriction from Sp to the normalizer N, of a p-sylow subgroup H of Sp, does not affect the stable type of the field..   Second, the investigator has proved that if we twist the Sp-action by a 1-cocycle a in Ext1SP(J(A), L*), then Cp is stably isomorphic to La(J(A))Sp, where A is the root lattice, L=F(ZG/H) and,  J represents induction-restriction from Sp to H. Note that now we are inducing from H which is a cyclic group of order p. The cocycle a corresponds to an element of the relative Brauer group of L over LH.  The importance of this result lies in the connection, described by Saltman., between fixed fields under twisted H-actions and corresponding fixed fields under twisted Sp-actions.  The above results naturally lead to the study of a-twisted actions on fields, and this is also an area the investigator will study; more precisely actions induced from subgroups.  The investigator will be also working on Noether's problem which is naturally related to the above question.  In particular the investigator will study its connections with monomial and a-twisted group actions and on fields.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to investigate the following problem. Let p be a prime number.  Is the center of the division ring of p x p generic matrices stably rational over the base field? Generic matrices over a field F are n x n matrices whose entries are independent variables. This problem has been studied extensively over several decades. Its importance lies in part, in its connections to problems in many other fields such as, geometric invariant theory, representation theory of algebras, and Brauer groups. Invariant theory and representation theory are classical mathematical fields whose results are also used in applied mathematics and physics. Brauer groups are a fundamental structure in the study of central simple algebras.  The importance of this problem also lies in the fact that matrices, which are rectangular arrays of elements, are an essential tool for storing data.  Little is known about this problem.  Positive results have been proved for the primes 2, 3,5 and 7, the first of which was found in 1883 by Sylvester. <br/>"

The study of local cohomology modules addresses finiteness issues of these modules over regular rings of mixed characteristic, and another question that is related to the theory of solid closure.  Research on Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities and on the rigidity of the Tor functor will be carried out in continued collaboration with Claudia Miller. <br/><br/>Commutative algebra is a field closely related to algebraic geometry:  while algebraic geometry focuses on the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, in commutative algebra the main objects of study are certain functions on these solution sets.  The connections between algebra and geometry are largely due to the revolutionary work of Grothendieck, Serre and Zariski.  An active area of research in commutative algebra today is the theory of tight closure developed by Hochster and Huneke.  This theory provides stronger formulations of existing theorems, and brings together many seemingly unrelated problems. It also has strong connections with the study of singularities of geometric objects.  The theory of local cohomology was developed by Grothendieck who used it to obtain several striking results.  Local cohomology has applications to basic, and yet deep, questions such as determining the minimal number of polynomial equations needed to define an algebraic set.  It continues to develop a fascinating interaction with several other branches of mathematics. <br/>"

The main height function considered by the principal investigator is the Mahler measure.  Traditionally, the Mahler measure of a monic polynomial with complex coefficients is the product of the absolute values of those roots of the polynomial which occur outside the closed unit disk.  In the present context, however, it is convenient to regard the Mahler measure as a distance function on a real or complex Euclidean space.  More precisely, a vector in Euclidean space is identified with the vector of coefficients of a polynomial and so the Mahler measure of the vector is simply the Mahler measure of the corresponding polynomial.  Viewed in this way the Mahler measure is a continuous function and homogeneous of degree 1.  That is, the Mahler measure is a distance function in the sense of the geometry of numbers.  Also, the Lebesgue measure of the set of points in Euclidean space where the Mahler measure is less than a real parameter, is a distribution function of the parameter.  This  distribution function is then subject to analysis by means of the Mellin (or Fourier) transform.  Although the Mahler measure is a very complicated function of the coordinates of a vector, the distribution function is shown to be surprisingly simple.  In particular, the principal investigator observes several unexpected arithmetical properties of natural geometric objects associated to the Mahler measure.  For example, the volume of the unit ball with respect to the Mahler measure is a rational number.  And the surface of the unit ball can be parameterized by polynomial maps with integer coefficients.  The principal investigator hopes to attack the well known conjecture of D.H. Lehmer concerning small values of Mahler's measure by a modification of the methods described here.  A further project is to discover analogous results for the elliptic Mahler measure.<br/><br/>The Mahler measure is a technical tool used in a variety of investigations in analytic and algebraic number theory.  And it has practical importance in certain computer algorithms for factoring large polynomials.  This is because the Mahler measure of a polynomial gives information about the number of irreducible factors of the polynomial, and so immediately provides a limit to the complexity of any factoring algorithm.  Polynomials form a very basic and important class of  mathematical objects which appear in a wide variety of applications.  The Mahler measure of a polynomial gives useful information about the polynomial, but its precise usefulness depends on the particular application.  For example, the Mahler measure can be used to determine the entropy (a rough measure of complicatedness) of certain dynamical systems.  The research of the principal investigator is motivated by a desire to better understand the Mahler measure and also to seek new applications in number theory and in applied mathematics.<br/><br/>"

The methods involve a detailed algebraic geometrical study of the Hilbert scheme of points in the plane and related algebraic varieties.  In earlier work Professor Haiman showed that certain hypotheses on the singularities and sheaf cohomology of these varieties would imply the desired algebraic results (and with Garsia, showed that the latter imply related combinatorial results).  The current work is to establish these geometric hypotheses.<br/><br/>Macdonald polynomials are a new family of symmetric functions.  Their discovery by Macdonald in 1988 was a surprising development in the theory of symmetric functions, which is a fundamental and classical part of mathematics with roots in the work of Euler, Jacobi, and Cauchy over a century ago.  Macdonald polynomials have since been found to have important applications in a wide range of areas including geometry, representation theory, and even theoretical physics.  At the time of their discovery, Macdonald conjectured that certain coefficients associated with his polynomials should be positive integers, the proof of which remains the most important unsolved problem in this area.  The successful completion of this project will solve this problem, proving the ""Macdonald positivity conjecture,"" along with a related representation-theoretic conjecture of Garsia and the investigator known as the ""n-factorial"" conjecture, some related combinatorial conjectures, and strong new geometric properties of Hilbert schemes, which are likely to have further applications in geometry and representation theory.<br/>"

Compact right topological semigroups are guaranteed to have some well known algebraic properties, principal among which is the existence of a smallest two sided ideal which is the union of (usually infinitely many) pairwise isomorphic groups. Given an infinite semigroup S, such as the set N of positive integers under addition, the largest possible compactification of S, its Stone-Cech compactification, has a natural semigroup operation extending that of S which makes it a compact right topological semigroup.  In most reasonable semigroups, including all of the (right or left) cancellative semigroups, the smallest ideal of the Stone-Cech compactification is contained in the Stone-Cech remainder.  Also, one usually finds most, or all, of the idempotents of the Stone-Cech compactification lying in this remainder.  The algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech remainder is the ""algebra at infinity"" of the title of this proposal. While much is known about the algebra at infinity of infinite semigroups, many fascinating and very natural questions remain open. Another reason for interest in the algebra at infinity of infinite semigroups is the significant consequences in Ramsey theory that are (usually quite easily) obtainable there.  Ramsey Theory is that part of combinatorics that deals with the question of what sort of homogeneous structures one can expect to find in some one cell of a finite partition of specified sets (or sometimes in any suitably ""large"" subset).<br/><br/>     Ramsey Theory may be thought of as a generalization of one of the simplest mathematical statements, the ""pigeonhole principle"".  This principle says that if letters are being distributed among pigeonholes and there are more letters than pigeonholes, then some pigeonhole will get more than one letter.  The simplest statement in Ramsey Theory says that, if six people are at a party, then either there will be some three, none of whom have met before, or there will be some three, each pair of which have met each other.  In spite of (or maybe because of) the simplicity of some of its basic statements, Ramsey Theory has had widespread applications throughout many areas of mathematics: number theory, logic, algebra, and Banach space theory to name a few.  The principal investigator and his students study ways to apply the ""algebra at infinity"" of semigroups to obtain new results in Ramsey Theory.  They investigate the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification of discrete semigroups, deriving new understandings of this structure itself, and obtaining new applications.<br/>"

This is shown by constructing an unsolvable surface covering of degree six in characteristic five. Taking a plane section of this unsolvable surface covering, leads to a conjecture about the structure of the algebraic fundamental group of an affine algebraic curve over an algebraically closed ground field of nonzero characteristic. This Affine Curve Conjecture was settled affirmatively by Harbater and Raynaud. Various Recognition Theorems of group theory, which played a crucial role in the initial explorations of this Conjecture, have lead to some progress in a refined version of this Conjecture over finite ground fields. These Recognition Theorems, have also lead to some progress in Conjectures about Local and Global algebraic fundamental groups above normal crossings of branch loci of higher dimensional algebraic varieties. Another fertile application area for the Recognition Theorems has been in the direction of Permutation Polynomials and Exceptional Polynomials. This area, together with Guralnick's very recent work on genus zero coverings, as well as the theory of Moore-Carlitz-Drinfeld Modules is a rich source for finding explicit equations with prescribed Galois groups.

Nowadays, both these fields make use of methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely they are finding applications in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science and robotics.

The first main question is the classical problem of whether or not the moduli space of curves is uniruled.  This is a very natural question for Mori theory, which was indeed invented to study uniruledness questions, but somewhat surprisingly no serious attempt from this direction has yet been made --perhaps because the main work in the area was done before the invention of Mori theory.  The applicant believes Mori theory gives important new insights, and supports this with many concrete examples.  The second proposed direction is on foundational work in birational geometry. The applicant, together with Yi Hu, has observed a foundational connection between Mori theory and geometric invariant theory.  They define Mori Dream Spaces abstractly as spaces with the best possible Mori theoretic properties.  There turn out to be many examples. They associate to any variety a natural ring, which they call the Cox ring, and show that Mori dream spaces are characterized by the finite generation of this ring, and moreover, are in a natural way a quotient of the associated affine variety in a way generalizing Cox's construction of toric varietie`s as quotients of affine space. There are two main proposed directions for further research.  One is to study the expected interplay between commutative algebraic properties of the Cox ring and the geometry of the variety.  The other is a foundational factorization problem for birational maps between smooth toric varieties, which would significantly strengthen Morelli's factorization theorem.  The final proposed direction is on Mori theory in positive characteristic.  The vast majority of work in Mori theory is based on vanishing theorems which restrict it to characteristic zero.  The theory would have myriad arithmetic applications (e.g. the construction of higher dimensional Neron models) if it could be extended to positive characteristic.  The applicant has a significant result in this direction (by methods entirely different from preceding work).  There is a natural way in which this result might vastly generalize, and the applicant has a partial result in this direction.<br/><br/>The main questions the investigator considers are among the oldest problems in algebraic geometry, each actively studied at least since the twenties.  As the investigator indicates, new ideas from Mori theory (named after its Field's medal winning inventor) suggest new and promising approaches to these problems.  This is particularly true of several foundational questions about the moduli space of curves, one of the most studied objects in mathematics and, more recently, theoretical physics. <br/><br/>"

The proposed research addresses five types of problems.  First, traversability problems for graphs embedded on surfaces, or with related conditions, are studied.  In particular, the existence of k-walks and k-trails, ways to traverse a graph visiting each vertex at least once and at most k times, are investigated.  Second, the investigators study the spectral radius (largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix) of graphs embedded on surfaces, particularly the plane; this is an important parameter with connections to the number of walks in the graph.  Third, the investigators examine the relationship between a surface and the connectivity of graphs that embed on that surface in particularly natural ways, as genus embeddings.  Fourth, the existence of graph embeddings with nice properties, such as every closed face being homeomorphic to a closed disk, and the relationship of such embeddings to decomposition problems such as the Cycle Double Cover Conjecture, are studied.  Fifth, the investigators are concerned with the problem of cutting a surface with an embedded graph into smaller nontrivial pieces along a noncontractible cycle in the graph, as results in this area would give a very promising tool for studying many problems in the area of graph embeddings.<br/><br/>    Graphs are abstract mathematical models of networks.  In the modern world, the study of communication and transportation networks is becoming ever more important.  In particular, many real-world networks are planar, meaning that they can be drawn on a piece of paper without any links crossing.  How close a network is to being planar is related to many of its useful properties, and mathematicians study this by looking at so called embeddings of graphs on surfaces.  The useful properties examined by this research include traversability (how can we travel around a network, visiting each node, in a more or less efficient way - this is the motivation for such problems as the Traveling Salesman Problem), how well a network works as a traffic network (this involves a number known as the spectral radius, which has been of interest to geographers), and connectivity (resistance to disruption by attack).  Besides studying the useful properties of networks, this research also develops new tools for studying such properties.  Networks drawn on a surface are easier to work with if none of the regions into which the drawing divides the surface touch themselves, and the investigators are interested in the question of whether networks can always be drawn in this nice way.  The investigators are also interested in the question of whether networks drawn on a surface can be cut apart in a natural way to give networks drawn on less complicated surfaces.  Both of these questions should lead to better understanding of networks drawn on surfaces, and hence to ways to examine useful properties of such networks.<br/>"

The area of research includes Dehn functions and relative Dehn functions of groups, the complexity of algorithmic problems of groups, Burnside problems for groups.  Many papers published during the last forty years showed deep connection between asymptotic invariants of groups and topology, geometry, amenability, dynamical systems, etc.  Quite<br/>recently, the proposers (jointly with Rips and Birget) discovered a close<br/>relationship between the asymptotics of isoperimetric functions, on the one<br/>hand, and the complexity of the word problem for groups, on the other hand.<br/>The investigators are developing their method, combining geometric and<br/>computational approaches. One of their goals is to obtain the solution<br/>of other algorithmic problems using geometric group theory. In particular<br/>the investigators believe they will be able to prove that every recursively presented<br/>finitely generated group can be embedded into a finitely presented group<br/>with the same degree of unsolvability of the conjugacy problem. This would<br/>solve a problem formulated by Collins in 1976.<br/>The computational-geometric methods of the investigators also show promise of being able to be fruitfully applied to the  Burnside-type  problems.<br/>The investigators are close to constructing non-amenable finitely presented<br/>groups having no non-cyclic free subgroups. This will solve the<br/>corresponding well-known problem which goes back to von Neumann's 1929<br/>paper. Since the group in question is a finitely presented extension of a<br/>torsion group of finite exponent by a cyclic group, this example will be<br/>a breakthrough in the search for a finitely presented torsion<br/>group (one of the main open problem in the theory of infinite groups).<br/><br/><br/>    It is a well known point of view after Klein, Hilbert, Einstein and Weil<br/>that fundamental laws describe symmetries occurring in the nature. The<br/>symmetry of an object can be measured by the group corresponding to the<br/>object. Groups can be defined as groups of symmetries or abstractly by an<br/>algorithmic description (generators and relations). In the second approach,<br/>the investigators choose some basic symmetries (generators) so that all other symmetries<br/>are compositions (words) of the basic symmetries, and describe certain<br/>relations between the basic symmetries such that all other relations follow<br/>from the chosen relations. One of the main problems about a group given by<br/>generators and relations and relations is the word problem: when are two<br/>compositions of generators the same?  In some exotic cases this problem can<br/>be undecidable, that is there are groups for which there are no automatic<br/>procedures to recognize if two words of generators are equal. but even<br/>in cases when this problem is decidable, the automatic procedure can be very<br/>complicated.  In recent years the investigators discovered a deep<br/>relationship between the word problem of a group and the global geometry of<br/>the group. The geometry of a group is described in terms of certain<br/>asymptotic invariants. The invariants have been known since the pioneering<br/>works of M. Dehn at the beginning of the 20th century but the investigators<br/>discovered deep relationship between these invariants and algorithmic<br/>problems. The investigators are developing their geometric method solving<br/>old mathematical problems of algorithmic nature and corresponding algebraic problems about groups."

The investigator works on two main topics - Hadwiger's conjecture, and extensions of the graph minors project.<br/><br/>(a) Hadwiger's conjecture (proposed in 1943) states that any graph not contractible to the n-node complete graph should be colourable with n-1 colours.  For small n it is true - eg for n = 5 and n = 6 it is equivalent to the 4-colour theorem. For all larger n it is open.<br/><br/>(b) The graph minors project, by Neil Robertson and the investigator, was a major piece of work, spanning 23 long papers, which used graph structure theory to settle several open questions. One of the most difficult steps of this was proving that all graphs with large tree-width have large grid minors, and recently Diestel et al have found a short, simple proof of this vital fact. As a consequence, several conjectured extensions of the graph minors project now appear feasible.<br/><br/>This work is in graph theory. A graph is a network of nodes, some pairs of which are joined by links - such as, for instance, a telephone network, or a network of plane connections. To design fast algorithms on graphs it is often important to make use of special properties of the graph - for instance, perhaps it can be drawn without crossings, or perhaps it can be built from very small graphs by piecing them together in a tree-structure. Having such a useful, global structure is closely related with with NOT containing certain substructures. The first problem above asks whether the graphs with ANY given substructure excluded are in some sense like those that can be drawn without crossings. The second studies the theorem that all graphs not containing a grid-like substructure can be expressed as a tree-structure of small graphs."

Schubert varieties are fascinating geometrical objects which lie at the intersection of several fields of mathematics; their study began with the classical works in projective geometry of the nineteen century.  Better understanding of these structures would have impact in algebraic geometry, combinatorics and representation theory. Outside of mathematics, these results may have applications in theoretical physics, computer graphics, and the study of Bucky balls (Carbon-60 molecules).  A further goal of this proposal is to explore the changing roll of computers in mathematics.  Computer verification and computer proofs play a central role in characterizing properties of Schubert varieties by pattern avoidance.<br/><br/>An important aspect of this proposal is its educational component. Mathematics education and research are intrinsically linked - research brings out the creativity and drive needed to learn new mathematical concepts.  In particular, undergraduate students enjoy the challenge of facing unsolved problems.  However, due to the nature of mathematics research, finding ""good"" undergraduate research problems is difficult.  Computer verified proofs and computer experimentation are particularly well suited to the skills and knowledge of undergraduates while also of interest to graduate students and more senior researchers.

Falting's theorem indicates that the number of such points is finite if the genus exceeds one, but, in general, one has little specific information available.  The investigator studies a variety of techniques, principally from Diophantine approximation, which may be applied to quantify Falting's theorem in special situations.  In particular, Bennett considers approaches based upon rational function approximation to systems of hypergeometric functions (the generalized hypergeometric method), lower bounds for linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers, local methods and computational Diophantine approximation.  These are applied to study families of quartic equations, Thue equations, polynomial-exponential equations and integral points on given models of elliptic curves.  The investigator also discusses two effective methods for finding such ``integral points'' on higher genus curves, where the aforementioned ones fail.  These involve, respectively, extensions of an old technique of Chabauty and arguments exploiting the modularity of certain Frey curves.<br/><br/>Number theory, one of the oldest branches of mathematics, has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years.

Boltje's NSF Proposal 0070630<br/><br/>1. The principal investigator is doing research in the field of representation theory of finite groups.  More precisely, he works on questions related to the conjectures of Alperin, Dade, and Broue.  These conjectures state that certain invariants of a finite group and a fixed prime number can be determined by the same invariants of subgroups which are again related to that prime.  The first conjectures are concerned with invariants that are integers, whereas the third conjecture predicts equivalences of categories.  The first two conjectures and consequences of the third have been verified for a convincing number of examples.  It is likely that these three conjectures are consequences of a single feature which is still hidden behind the scene.  Probably more important than solving these particular conjectures would be the discovery of this feature.  The principal investigator works on general ideas of how to approach these conjectures, partially in collaboration with B. K""ulshammer.  A graduate student is involved in this effort by writing computer programs which will either discard or give more evidence to the applicability of one of the suggested approaches.<br/><br/>2. The principal investigator studies mysterious coincidences in the representation theory of groups which have been discovered about fifteen years ago but could not be explained so far.  This research is not aimed at immediate applications outside mathematics.  However, in the history of the interplay between mathematics and other sciences, in particular physics, it is a repeated pattern that theories and results which were considered as important within the edifice of mathematics became precisely what was needed in the other sciences in order to describe our real world.  For example, group representations which have been studied a century ago became the right tool to describe particles in nuclear physics.<br/><br/>"

The meeting will establish focus and promote research on the main combinatorial problems in an area that has had an enormous impact on particle physics, the study of crystals in chemistry, and mathematical research ever since the early work of mathematician Issai Schur and physicist Hermann Weyl.  Its continuing vitality is evidenced by much current activity, and it is expected to play a prominent role in mathematics throughout the next decade.  Because leaders in this area rarely claim to be from the same mathematical discipline, research is being carried out by ""pure"" algebraists, combinatorialists, topologists, analysts, mathematical physicists, algebraic geometers, and  number theorists.   The goal of this conference is to bring these diverse experts together and to focus their discussions on the basic questions:  ""What is the combinatorics controlling fundamental structures related to symmetry, and what role does it play in algebra, topology, analysis, physics, geometry, and number theory?""   The plan is to have 20 to 22 one-hour talks on different aspects of these subjects, with sufficient free time between talks for informal discussion and collaboration. It is expected that between 100 and 125 participants will attend the meeting.  Special effort will be made to support the participation of graduate students and recent  Ph.D.'s.  These young mathematicians will be encouraged to bring their reprints and preprints for the ""buffet"" of preprints, which will permit browsers to sample their work.  Also, each of the young participants will be paired with a senior mathematician having closely related research interests, who will serve as a mentor during the conference.  The educational advantages of pairing young and experienced researchers will positively impact the careers of young mathematicians, just as the ""preprint buffet"" will help to publicize their work.  <br/>"

Today it is better known as enumerative and algebraic combinatorics.  One of the fastest-growing areas of modern mathematics, it touches upon many areas of mathematics and science, as well as forming one of the foundations of computer science.  This conference will emphasize the more classical aspects of enumerative combinatorics, like permutation statistics, tableaux, q-series, words, combinatorial special function theory, commutation monoids, and related subjects, as well as their relation to computer science, physics, and statistics.  Classical Combinatorics is applied in the theory of algorithms, where permutations and tableaux form the theoretical foundation for Sorting and Searching, in the theory of parallel programming, statistical physics, and many other places.  To cite just one very recent example, the Foata-Zeilberger extension of Bass's evaluation of the Ihara Zeta function of a graph was used in knot theory, by Lin and Wang, to great advantage.  The investigators and their colleagues study various aspects of Classical Combinatorics and use conferences as a key tool in the proliferation of new research in this area.<br/><br/>One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged.  The behavoir of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.  This conference will bring together leaders in the field and emerging researchers to discuss new ideas in the field of Combinatorics.<br/>"

In the second part of the <br/>proposal the case of suspension singularities is discussed in more details.<br/>The third part of the proposal deals with higher dimensional <br/>generalizations of the Artin-Laufer program. <br/><br/>Local analytic spaces are defined by locally defined analytic functions,<br/>in particular they carry a lot of analytic invariants. A very important<br/>question in their classification is the following: can these analytic  <br/>invariants be determined from the topological description of these spaces? <br/>In the case of complex  surface singularities, the topological structure<br/>is determined from the link of the singularity which is an<br/>oriented 3-manifold.

Most of the  work of the investigator involves the study of elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau varieties; the symmetry of the generic fiber is identified with a symmetry of a physical model.   Since many Calabi-Yau varieties are in fact elliptically fibered, this extra structure gives way to new approaches to understand Calabi-Yau varieties in general.  Certain relations in string theory, known as dualities, predict surprising connections among the mathematical properties of the Calabi-Yau varieties; vice-versa one can use mathematical comparisons between the Calabi-Yau varieties associated by the dualities to learn more about the dualities themselves.  The investigator studies  transformations of Calabi-Yau fourfolds and their ""dual counterpart"", Calabi-Yau threefolds with a gauge bundle, determined by the structure of the fourfold.  In another project the P.I. investigates the singularities naturally associated to the gauge groups, and their relations to representation theory.  This is also motivated by (and it has applications) to the physics of string theory.<br/><br/>String theory is expected to explain the apparent contradictions that arise when one tries to combine relativity with quantum mechanics. In the model proposed by string theory, 6 (real) dimensions of our ten dimensional world have a very special structure, in particular they are complex algebraic varieties, called ""Calabi-Yau"".  A general question is  understanding properties of these manifolds, in order to get a better description of the physical theory.  In practice, the interdisciplinary nature of this project has been mutually beneficial to physics and mathematics and has spurred much progress and activity in both fields.  For example, it was shown that although there seems to be many different Calabi-Yau varieties which could describe the 6 extra dimensions, there are in fact surprising relations among them.  This is also related to the presence of black holes and to special transformations in algebraic geometry.  The research of the investigator involves  studying these type of relations for ``elliptically fibered"" Calabi-Yau varieties.<br/><br/>"

Ellingham and Xiaoya Zha       The investigators study properties of graphs embedded on surfaces, together with some closely related problems.  The proposed research addresses five types of problems.  First, traversability problems for graphs embedded on surfaces, or with related conditions, are studied.  In particular, the existence of k-walks and k-trails, ways to traverse a graph visiting each vertex at least once and at most k times, are investigated. Second, the investigators study the spectral radius (largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix) of graphs embedded on surfaces, particularly the plane; this is an important parameter with connections to the number of walks in the graph.  Third, the investigators examine the relationship between a surface and the connectivity of graphs that embed on that surface in particularly natural ways, as genus embeddings.  Fourth, the existence of graph embeddings with nice properties, such as every closed face being homeomorphic to a closed disk, and the relationship of such embeddings to decomposition problems such as the Cycle Double Cover Conjecture, are studied.  Fifth, the investigators are concerned with the problem of cutting a surface with an embedded graph into smaller nontrivial pieces along a noncontractible cycle in the graph, as results in this area would give a very promising tool for studying many problems in the area of graph embeddings.       Graphs are abstract mathematical models of networks.   In the modern world, the study of communication and transportation networks is becoming ever more important.  In particular, many real-world networks are planar, meaning that they can be drawn on a piece of paper without any links crossing.  How close a network is to being planar is related to many of its useful properties, and mathematicians study this by looking at so called embeddings of graphs on surfaces.  The useful properties examined by this research include traversability (how can we travel around a network, visiting each node, in a more or less efficient way - this is the motivation for such problems as the Traveling Salesman Problem), how well a network works as a traffic network (this involves a number known as the spectral radius, which has been of interest to geographers), and connectivity (resistance to disruption by attack).  Besides studying the useful properties of networks, this research also develops new tools for studying such properties.  Networks drawn on a surface are easier to work with if none of the regions into which the drawing divides the surface touch themselves, and the investigators are interested in the question of whether networks can always be drawn in this nice way.  The investigators are also interested in the question of whether networks drawn on a surface can be cut apart in a natural way to give networks drawn on less complicated surfaces.  Both of these questions should lead to better understanding of networks drawn on surfaces, and hence to ways to examine useful properties of such networks."

There are many interesting theorems about Shnirel'man density or lower density in additive number theory and a few interesting theorems about upper density or upper Banach density in combinatorial number theory. However, dealing with upper density or upper Banach density in additive number theory is still an uncharted area. One of the major untouched problems in this area is finding the growth and structure of sums of sets of positive upper density or positive upper Banach density. The principal investigator has been investigating the problem using nonstandard analysis and has obtained many interesting new results. The first part of the proposal describes a topological approach to the problem. Using U-topologies on a hyperfinite Loeb space, the principal investigator proves a powerful theorem in nonstandard analysis, which implies several new theorems in some standard mathematical fields including additive number theory. These theorems reveal a general phenomenon, which says that if two sets A and B are large in terms of ``measure'', then A plus B is not small in terms of ``order-topology''. The second part of the proposal describes a measure-theoretical approach. This approach allows one to derive a parallel theorem about upper Banach density to an existing theorem about Shnirel'man density or lower density in a very efficient way.<br/><br/>Additive number theory is classical and studies the properties of addition of natural numbers like 1,2,3,4... which people use every day. Nonstandard analysis is relatively new and more abstract. It adds infinitely large numbers into our number system. A non-expert may be surprised that the study of the elusive infinitely large numbers has an interesting impact on the study of ordinary numbers. The principal investigator has already achieved some success in this direction. By furthering his efforts, the principal investigator will contribute more innovative ideas and results to additive number theory.<br/>"

Bernoulli in the 18th century.  He completed Leibniz's original attempt at a general partial fraction decomposition of the function.  The main difficulty associated with this procedure is to obtain a complete factorization of the denominator.  In the middle of the 19th century Hermite and Ostrogradsky developed algorithms to compute the rational part of the primitive for the function without factoring its denominator.  More recently Horowitz rediscovered this method and discussed its complexity.  The problem of computing the transcendental part of the primitive was finally solved by Lazard and Rioboo.  This algorithm has been implemented in the current versions of the most widely used symbolic integrators such as MATLAB, Maple V and Mathematica 4.0.  Modern developments in the theory of integration of rational functions have been concentrated in the development of algorithms that reduce the cost of operations, thereby extending the range of problems that can be solved using realistic amounts of machine time.  In spite of the fact that the problem of integration of rational functions appears to be solved both from a theoretical and symbolic point of view, the reality is that much more work remains to be done.  Among the difficulties encountered in the use of symbolic integration packages is that the performance is dependent upon the way the rational function is entered into the algorithm.  The immediate goal of this project is twofold: to develop and implement an efficient and robust symbolic algorithm for the evaluation of definite integrals of rational functions; and to investigate the dynamical and geometrical properties of the rational Landen transformations.  The long term goal of this project is to develop a complete solution to the problem of definite integration in finite terms.  This will complement the work done by Lazard-Rioboo, Rioboo, Risch, and Trager in the case of indefinite integration.  Implementation of this solution will have a profound impact on<br/>the current symbolic integrators.<br/><br/>     Many problems in physics and engineering require the exact evaluation of integrals in terms of the parameters appearing in those integrals.  These integrals come up in the study of particle physics and classical mechanics.  While it is not always possible to find such an expression, an efficient and robust symbolic software package should give the result in closed form, or decide whether such an expression is achievable.  The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that will expand upon the capabilities of existing software packages that are widely used in industry and universities.<br/>"

A gain graph has associated matroids, whose structure is more accessible than that of general matroids due to the relative simplicity of graphs.  For this reason gain graphs have been helpful in a variety of geometry problems, for instance several related to root systems (since the classical root systems are described by signed graphs), as well as in optimization on generalized networks (also called ""networks with gains"").  The investigator plans to study what can be achieved in deeper understanding and application of gain graphs by ""thickening"" the edges.  One way to do this is to replace each edge by its product with the boundary of a simplex of sufficiently high dimension to realize the action of the gain group, and then apply topology to the resulting thickened graph, for instance, calculating (co)homology and group actions on it.  It is hoped that this will reveal striking new phenomena, perhaps analogously to the way the complexification of a real arrangement of hyperplanes has revealed phenomena sometimes entirely new and sometimes refining what was previously known.<br/><br/>Think of a network, consisting of nodes connected by lines, in which each line has a ""twist"".  In previous investigations of networks with twist (technical name: ""gain graphs""), the lines were infinitely thin so the twists were purely theoretical.

Then a whole new range of mathematical methods will become applicable so one can hope for new discoveries.  The original reason for looking at twists was that they simplify some problems in geometry; they also turned out to be related to an economic optimization method.  A detailed understanding of twisted networks is needed to find good solutions to problems like these.  The hope for the thickening method is both to apply existing knowledge about twisted networks to simplify more mathematical problems and to find new techniques that reveal more about the twisted networks themselves.

We now start an attack in order to make these partially valid speculations into a methodology based on a solid foundation.  Project A describe a way to establish theory of p-adic families of automorphic forms defined on Shimura varieties, particularly those carrying a canonical fiber system of abelian varieties.  After establishing such control theory of p-adic automorphic forms, construction of p-adic L-functions associated to each family of automorphic forms is the goal of Project B.  There should be some applications of such p-adic L-functions and p-adic families to Iwasawa theoretic understanding of CM fields, to verification of automorphic functoriality (like base-change; Project C) and to modularity problems of abelian varieties (Project D).  There is a possibility of extending such theory to algebraic groups not associated to Shimura varieties.  In Project E, the case of general linear groups is discussed.  If successful, many rationality results of automorphic L-functions are expected even in this non-holomorphic case.<br/><br/>Number theoretic questions, though formulated often in an elementary way, could be astonishingly difficult to solve.  The Fermat's last theorem (which was actually a conjecture made by Fermat in the seventeenth century) has been solved finally by Wiles in 1995, surviving for 350 years of serious attacks by the strongests of mathematicians.  In its solution, arithmetic study of modular forms and automorphic forms played essential roles in many ways.  The programs described here are intended to broaden the applicability of some of the tools used in this endeavor to more general setting, encompassing more geometric objects: those spaces classifying algebraic equations whose solution-set (so called ""abelian varieties"") having a canonical algebra (group) structure.  Each abelian variety is somehow (conjecturally) related to a very specific function satisfying many symmetries (so it is called an ""automorphic form"").  The solution of such classification problems (so-called ""modularity problem"") in the simplest case of dimension one is a key ingredient of the above mentioned proof of Wiles.  One of the goals described in this award is to generalize this ""modularity"" result to higher dimensional abelian varieties.<br/>"

The investigator hopes to extend this technique as far as possible to understand higher symmetric power L-functions and the collective behavior of higher order twists of standard L-functions.

The theory of groups, which was created in 19-th century, is a mathematical theory which is designed to describe precisely the phenomenon of symmetry, and which is fundamental in modern particle physics. Symmetry is a basic property of nature. It also played a crucial role in all technological achievements of mankind, starting from the invention of a wheel: the ability of a wheel to roll comes from its symmetry with respect to rotations.   Quantum theory was the most important achievement of theoretical physics of the 20-th century, which lies at the foundation of this century's technological revolution.  It is a physical theory which allows to describe the behavior of very small objects, like atoms and electrons.   In the late eighties, it was realized that in certain systems described by quantum theory, there is a new kind of symmetry which the theory of groups fails to describe.  This new, very peculiar kind of symmetry, is called quantum symmetry.  In order to describe this symmetry mathematically, mathematicians introduced new mathematical objects called quantum groups, which are generalizations of ordinary groups. The present proposal seeks to further develop this theory and to explore its interactions with other areas of mathematics and physics."

In particular he will look for<br/>K-theory parallels of known results in cohomology.  A first target is the<br/>cohomology and Grothendieck rings of a partial flag variety.  Since any<br/>partial flag variety has a cell decomposition into Schubert cells, its<br/>cohomology ring has a basis consisting of the cohomology classes of<br/>Schubert varieties.  Likewise the Grothendieck ring of algebraic vector<br/>bundles has a basis of structure sheaves of Schubert varieties.  The<br/>investigator will study the structure constants for these rings with<br/>respect to their bases indexed by Schubert varieties.  The main goal is to<br/>find explicit formula for these constants, but also positivity questions<br/>are of interest.  In cohomology the structure constants are known to be<br/>positive for geometric reasons, but no combinatorial proof of this fact is<br/>known.  In K-theory the investigator has conjectured that the structure<br/>constants have alternating signs, i.e. they are non-negative in even<br/>degrees and non-positive in odd degrees.  Finding a proof of this would be<br/>very interesting.  An additional goal is to find efficient computer<br/>algorithms for calculating these structure constants.  The investigator<br/>will also try to find a formula for the K-theory class of the structure<br/>sheaf of a general quiver variety.  Such a formula will generalize a<br/>formula for the cohomology class of a quiver variety, which the<br/>investigator has proved earlier with Fulton.  The investigator hopes that<br/>proving such a formula will be of help for constructing an explicit<br/>resolution of the structure sheaf of a quiver variety.  This would<br/>generalize classical constructions such as the Koszul complex, which is of<br/>fundamental importance in homological algebra.<br/><br/>The development of cohomology theory was motivated in part by the problem<br/>of classifying topological spaces.  This is important for addressing<br/>questions such as ""what is the shape of our universe?"".  Cohomology theory<br/>is also an important tool for solving problems in enumerative geometry, in<br/>which one seeks to determine and count all the solutions to a geometric<br/>problem.  For example, if the geometric problem is to find lines which<br/>intersect or are tangent to a given collection of fixed geometric figures,<br/>then the number of such lines is desired.  A very powerful technique for<br/>solving this type of problems is to construct a space consisting of all<br/>objects which could potentially be a solution.  Counting the number of<br/>solutions to a problem is often equivalent to performing a calculation in<br/>the cohomology ring of this space of potential solutions.  The objects to<br/>be counted can in many situations be identified with flags of subspaces in<br/>a given vector space.  Flag varieties, whose points correspond to such<br/>flags of subspaces, are therefore typical candidates to act as the space of<br/>potential solutions.  This makes it important to be able to do efficient<br/>computations within the cohomology ring of a flag variety, and gives the<br/>reason why the structure constants for this ring has been wanted by<br/>geometers and combinatorialists for decades.  The K-theory or Grothendieck<br/>ring of a variety can be seen as a generalization of the cohomology ring.<br/>A good understanding of K-theory will therefore give a more complete<br/>picture of cohomology theory.  At the same time K-theory is important for<br/>the study of vector bundles on a variety and for homological algebra.

Jorgenson and Serge Lang will study spectral theory on finite volume quotients of symmetric spaces using generalizations of Eisenstein series defined using heat kernels, as opposed to classical Eisenstein series which are defined using automorphic forms.  Jorgenson and Lang plan to investigate questions involving analytic continuation, functional equations, and special values of their heat Eisenstein series.  Upon completion of this component of their work, Jorgenson and Lang then will investigate applications of heat Eisenstein series to Weyl's law as well as to constructions of zeta functions which will yield higher rank generalizations of Selberg zeta functions.  In collaboration with Jurg Kramer, Jorgenson will study analytic aspects of Arakelov theory.  In recent work, Jorgenson and Kramer study bounds on special values of Selberg's zeta function and asymptotic bounds through covers.  Jorgenson and Kramer propose to extend these results to study asymptotic behavior of Faltings's delta function through covers, thus extending results first obtained by Jorgenson in his 1989 Stanford Ph.D. thesis.  In collaboration with Jozek Dodziuk, Jorgenson plans to use Lang's definition of degenerating number fields (from Lang's 1971 Inventiones paper) to study spectral theory on the corresponding sequence of degenerating Hilbert modular varieties.  The proposed methods to employ involve generalizations of research previously obtained by Jorgenson with Dodziuk and with Huntley and Lundelius.  As time permits, Jorgenson plans to study proposed additional research problems with Carol Fan, Edward Jenvey and Peter Grabner.<br/><br/>Classically, the heat kernel is a function defined for positive values of time t and points x and y in a domain D, and the heat kernel measures the amount of heat at point x in D at time t when a unit burst of heat is introduced at point y in D at time zero.  Although the origin of the heat kernel lies in physics, the mathematics surrounding the function known as the heat kernel manifests itself in virtually every area of pure and applied mathematics. In addition, the heat kernel is present in the theoretical foundations of many fields of statistics as well as econometrics and, more specifically, financial mathematics.  Part of  the research undertaken by Jay Jorgenson and his collaborators involves understanding various ways in which the heat kernel appears in one area of mathematics and then translate the questions, theorems and techniques to other areas of mathematics, statistics, and economics.  Going beyond mathematical research, Jay Jorgenson proposes to extend his research endeavors to incluce applications of heat kernels to practical problems of financial mathematics and economics, which naturally includes developing ways in which one can program constructions of heat kernels in order to obtain precise, numerical evaluations.<br/><br/><br/>"

This conjecture, which was proposed by M.Kontsevich in 1994, is expected to explain the phenomenon of mirror symmetry discovered by  physicists about a decade ago.  This discovery (along with other similar dualities in string theory) is an example of recent developments in theoretical physics which still lack solid mathematical foundation.  The present work should be considered as a contribution to laying such a foundation.  The second part of this project is devoted to some problems arising from number theory.  It was known already in the 19-th century that some deep properties of numbers are encoded in certain functions of complex variable called zeta-functions.

One hopes to characterize distinguished generic representations as functorial transfers from a third group G' (which can be specified conjecturally in terms of the involution) by comparing RTF with the Kuznetzov trace formula on G'.  To this end, it is important to obtain a fine spectral expansion of the RTF and, in particular, to write the spectral expansion in terms of relative Bessel distributions. Progress towards this goal was made in prior joint work by the PI, Jacquet and Lapid for the case of the standard Galois involution on GL(n).  They developed a procedure for defining regularized periods of Eisenstein series, which turns out to be key ingredients in the fine spectral expansion. In some cases, it has been possible to express the regularized periods in terms of certain integrals analagous to intertwining operators which have been called intertwining periods.  The PI intends, in collaboration with E. Lapid, to extend this previous work to the general case.  This will involve analytic problems related to Eisenstein series and combinatorial problems related to the structure of the orbits of the Borel subgroup on G/H. It will also be necessary to develop a suitable truncation operator.  One would like to express the regularized periods of cuspidal Eisenstein series in terms of  L-functions.  In general, however,  the regularized period will be equal to an infinite sum of intertwining periods.  To deal with this problem, the PI and Lapid intend to develop a formalism for forming linear combinations of the intertwining periods, in analogy with the linear combinations of characters that occur in  the endoscopic theory of Langlands-Shelstad. Closely related is the problem of  establishing identities between relative Bessel distributions for the pair (G,H) and Bessel distributions on G'.  In a related project to be carried out with D. Ramakrishnan, the PI will investigate certain limit formulas connected with relative trace formulas. This will lead to a new method of proof and more precise versions of previously known results of W. Duke and others on the distribution of certain special values of GL(2) L-functions.  The distribution results will involve certain measures on the spherical dual. Higher rank cases will be investigated and a general context in which to place the results will be sought.<br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/><br/>The history of mathematics has shown that the simplest phenomena are sometimes the hardest to understand deeply.  The correct explanation may emerge only after the right theoretical framework has been found.  The reciprocity laws of number theory fall into this category of mathematical phenomena.  The simplest law of this type, the so-called law of quadratic reciprocity, is a beautiful and mysterious fact about ordinary whole numbers.  It can be explained to a curious high school student, but its true structural meaning can only be understood within the context of a sophisticated and advanced part of number theory called class field theory.  One of the great challenges of modern number theory is to fully explore the most general reciprocity laws.  A framework for formulating such laws was developed 30 years ago by R. Langlands, and as a result, we know that there must exist a vast web of interrelated reciprocity laws.  As a totality, these conjectural laws are called the functoriality principle.  The functoriality principle seeks to explain the reciprocity laws within the context of a theory that originated in theoretical physics, the so-called representation theory of semisimple groups.  In addition to ties with advanced theoretical physics, the theory of functoriality has found applications in diverse areas of combinatorics, coding theory, and cryptography.  Enormous progess in the theory of functoriality has been made during the last thirty years which in turn has motivated much outstanding research, including the solution of the famous Fermat's Last Theorem.  Despite this, our understanding of functoriality remains rudimentary in many respects.  When a fully developed theory of functoriality is eventually developed, we can expect it to have a profound influence on mathematics and some areas of its applications.  The goal of the project supported by this grant is to advance our understanding of the Relative Trace Formula, which is one of a handful of valuable tools that we have for studying functoriality.  The results of this study will make it possible to study the functoriality principle from the point of view of ""period integrals"".  Hopefully, this will play a role in advancing our knowledge of the general functoriality principle."

The main graph coloring project involves aspects  of the Hadwiger graph coloring conjecture, that any graph that needs k  colors to properly color its vertices can be contracted to the complete  graph on k vertices.  The main matroid theory project involves a plan to settle Rota's conjecture that matroids representable over a fixed finite  field have finite obstacle sets.  In contrast to these two well known open problems, there are many concrete questions on surface embeddings and other graph structures, and these are important to settle for the orderly development of the subject.  Two problems which provide a focus in these areas are the Seymour-Szekeres cycle-double-cover conjecture and Hajos' conjecture that graphs that need 5 colors must contain K_5 topologically.  The proposed research studies several problems, closely related to these, but perhaps more accessible.  The most promising part  f this project, and mathematically the most interesting, is the Rota  conjecture and the related conjecture that finite matroids representable  by matrices over a fixed finite field are well-quasi-ordered.  This is an  area with several very strong mathematicians currently active, as well as the investigators usual collaborators.  The investigator feels that  this topic should be strongly pursued on a wide front.<br/><br/>About 20 years ago the investigator and his colleague, Paul Seymour, began a project concerned with the structural properties of graphs which are preserved under the elementary operations of deleting or contracting the edges of the graph.  The outcome was to show that these properties are finitely based, in the sense that the list of graphs, which are minimal amongst those for which a given property fails, is always finite.  This shows there is always a finite list of graphs explaining why the property fails to hold.  Moreover, the dual problem was solved of characterizing the inherent structure of graphs which possess any such property (at least to a close and useful approximation).  Over the years since this was done the investigator, Seymour and an expanding group of colleagues and students, have been vigorously developing the consequences of this main theory, and striving to apply the techniques to their natural scope.  This has been important mathematically, and for the subject of graph  theory, but also has contributed extensively to computer science and combinatorial optimization through the algorithms arising naturally from  the finiteness conditions. There is real hope to extend the subject into its natural context in linear algebra known as matroid theory, where also there are finiteness conjectures when the matroids arise from matrices over a finite field.  There are also still many long standing problems, open to the graph theory techniques of this area, which provide a focus for the more general development of the theory, and which are an important part of this proposal.<br/>"

The main terms in many asymptotic formulas for primes result from summing these short divisor sums into a singular series. These singular series therefore also reflect the properties of primes, and it is often an interesting and non-trivial problem to evaluate formulas involving singular series. Starting in 1990, the principal investigator has been working on obtaining lower bounds for problems involving primes. Up to now all this work has been on the binary correlation of short divisor sum approximations for primes. The investigator and C. Yildirim intend to extend this earlier work to higher correlations, and apply the results to obtain unconditional lower bounds for higher moments of primes in short intervals. The method also has application to other problems in analytic number theory. In addition, some questions on power sums and other problems will be examined in collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students at San Jose State University.<br/><br/>The distribution of prime numbers was first studied by the Greeks over two thousand years ago. Many significant results have been proved, but many difficult problems remain to be solved. With computers one can verify many conjectures about the distribution of primes with startling precision, and yet proofs of these conjectures are beyond our current state of knowledge. The principal investigator has focused his research on the problem of proving that the gap between consecutive primes will frequently be much smaller than the average gap size, and will infinitely often be smaller than any fraction of this average gap size. The techniques used to study this problem come from many areas of mathematics, statistics, and physics. Because of the fundamental role primes play in mathematics, it is to be expected that progress in this area will have applications in other areas."

An <br/>investigation of the class of low density parity check convolutional codes <br/>which constitutes a natural generalization of the class of low density parity <br/>check codes.

It is the goal of the proposed research to <br/>construct new powerful convolutional codes which can be efficiently <br/>encoded and decoded. Having such new codes would have several <br/>benefits. First and for all it would allow the construction of smaller and <br/>more energy efficient transmission devices which are still capable of doing <br/>reliable data communication. The research project will necessitate a <br/>mathematical investigation into the algebraic structure of convolutional <br/>codes. As it was outlined in the proposal this mathematical research could <br/>also lead to a new cryptographic protocol."

Roughly, these classes can be grouped under the<br/>following headings: (1) Classes of modules having fixed sequence of<br/>radical layers and, more generally, classes of modules with fixed top<br/>and fixed vector space dimension. (2) Classes of modules forming<br/>contravariantly finite or covariantly finite subcategories within the<br/>full category of finitely generated modules. (3) Classes of infinite<br/>direct sums (mainly of generic and finitely generated modules)<br/>enjoying finiteness conditions over their endomorphism rings. A<br/>related investigation aims at the geometry of finite complexes of<br/>modules and derived categories as an alternate setting for the study<br/>of maps among representations. There are methodological<br/>interconnections among these lines, as well as strong links in terms<br/>of the overall strategy of gaining a better understanding of algebras<br/>that have wild representation type. <br/><br/>Under a wider angle, the project should be seen in the following<br/>framework: The majority of our physical models for the universe are<br/>placed within finite dimensional vector spaces. Frequently, such<br/>spaces carry additional structure, such as a Lie or associative<br/>algebra structure, for example. Associative finite dimensional<br/>algebras are the objects of the investigator's research. One approach<br/>towards understanding them is to explore their representations, which<br/>can be thought of as 'linearized photographs' within sets of square<br/>matrices, both coarse-grained and fine-grained pictures containing<br/>valuable information. The representation type of the considered<br/>algebra is called 'tame' if the representations of any fixed matrix<br/>size can be subdivided into finitely many 'manageable' series (these<br/>series themselves may be infinite), otherwise it is called 'wild'.<br/>The wild case being the one predominantly encountered in mathematical<br/>nature, this is the case which the investigator is presently<br/>tackling. Her idea is to thoroughly understand important subclasses<br/>of the full class of representations of algebras of wild type, and to<br/>thus establish an interlinked mosaic of analyzed territory. Attention<br/>is being paid to choosing lines that optimally connect with the needs<br/>of adjacent fields (such as the theory of algebraic or quantum groups)<br/>and with the body of insights already established."
