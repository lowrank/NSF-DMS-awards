Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometry of shapes cut out by systems of polynomial equations, while in number theory one is often interested in finding explicit solutions to such systems in rational numbers or integers. The problem of finding such solutions is a foundational question in mathematics, having been studied for more than two thousand years, and is a central theme of this proposal. This project will investigate higher dimensional versions of this question in specific contexts arising from modular and automorphic functions. Modular and automorphic functions encode deep arithmetic information and are increasingly playing important roles in other fields, including theoretical physics. This project aims to broaden and deepen knowledge in this fundamental area of mathematics.<br/><br/>More specifically, the award involves work on five distinct projects on algebraic cycles in the context of the Langlands program: (i) integral period relations for Hilbert modular forms and their analogs on quaternionic Shimura varieties; (ii) the Bloch-Beilinson conjecture for Rankin-Selberg L-functions and in particular constructing cycles corresponding to the vanishing of the central value; (iii) the construction of absolute Hodge classes corresponding to cases of Langlands functoriality; (iv) the study of the injectivity of the Abel-Jacobi map for zero cycles on surfaces over number fields; (v) the relation between motivic cohomology and the cohomology of automorphic forms. A theme in many of the projects is the construction of explicit algebraic cycles or more generally elements in motivic cohomology, whose existence is often predicted by deep general conjectures on algebraic cycles."

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest. The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. (Number theorists refer to the conjectured relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ""reciprocity law."") Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic methods to study the conjectures. These are methods that exploit the many symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics known as ""the Langlands program."" A more recent approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, the representation theoretic methods and p-adic methods have begun to be unified into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, and to use them to establish new reciprocity laws. <br/><br/>The goal of the research project is to investigate the p-adic aspects of the Langlands program. At the heart of the Langlands program is a conjectured reciprocity law relating automorphic representations to p-adic Galois representations arising from the etale cohomology of algebraic varieties over number fields. The description of this reciprocity is in terms of local laws, that is, reciprocity laws that relate the behavior of the automorphic representation at a prime k to the behavior of the Galois representation at that same prime. These local laws are most subtle when k is taken to be the same prime p that governs the coefficients of the Galois representation; indeed, in this case such a local reciprocity law would constitute a p-adic local Langlands correspondence, and its existence remains conjectural other than in the abelian case, and the case of GL_2(Q_p). With collaborators, the principal investigator aims to investigate this conjectural p-adic local Langlands correspondence in various ways. One part of the work aims to construct moduli stacks of p-adic Galois representations. This will allow for the introduction of new geometric methods into the study of the Galois-theoretic side of the correspondence. Another part of the project will attempt to construct the p-adic local Langlands correspondence in various new contexts. More precisely, previous work of the principal investigator and collaborators used global methods to construct a candidate for the p-adic local Langlands correspondence in some generality; this project aims to establish that the correspondence so constructed is truly local."

Commutative algebra has applications in a range of areas, from statistics to game theory, from robotics to string theory.  The main theme of this project is the study of configurations of linear subspaces, such as finite collections of lines in the plane. These problems are classically motivated by algebraic geometry and have received renewed interest in the last fifteen years. Despite a rapidly growing body of work, there is still much progress needed to understand the subtle behavior of these configurations. This research program aims to take advantage of the combinatorial structure inherently present in this context. The project will also study potential applications of this work to coding theory.<br/><br/>The common thread for the investigations in this project concerns the asymptotic properties of symbolic powers. One goal of the project is the determination of certain invariants that measure these asymptotic properties (resurgence, Waldschmidt constants). Another goal is to characterize families of ideals that display extremal behavior with respect to the containment between ordinary and symbolic powers. Among the tools to be employed are methods involving the study of Rees algebras, minimal free resolutions, and local cohomology for powers of ideals. Another line of inquiry will consider the symbolic powers for singular loci of line arrangements, or more generally hyperplane arrangements, with special emphasis on reflection arrangements because of their additional structure. Despite their undoubted theoretical significance, not much is known about the practical applications of symbolic powers. The investigator and collaborators plan to start an investigation on the implications of this recent progress on symbolic powers from the point of view of applied algebraic geometry. Some computational tools in the form of scripts for the computer algebra system Macaulay will be developed to aid with the inquiry."

The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent breakthroughs in mathematics.  Continuing a three-decade long tradition, the AFW will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one quarter to one third of participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging ideas, and beginning new collaborations. This is the first time in at least a dozen years that the workshop -- which attracts participants from across the US as well as internationally -- will meet on the east coast, home to many experts on automorphic forms and closely related topics.  Thus, in addition to attracting speakers who participate annually, the workshop is likely to draw a mix of new attendees who will contribute new perspectives and energy and benefit from the workshop.  In addition to the research talks, the AFW will - like in past years - have two professional development panels on topics such as starting a tenure track job, forming collaborations, and transitioning from one career stage to the next. The organizers of the workshop, which has an international reputation for providing a supportive atmosphere for junior researchers, are committed to continuing to facilitate a supportive, inclusive, vertically integrated environment.<br/><br/>Automorphic forms constitute a major area of study in number theory and related areas.  One of the goals of the AFW is to promote new interactions and collaborations between researchers working in different areas concerning automorphic forms.  Thus, the workshop will highlight a wide range of developments in areas including the analytic, algebraic, combinatorial, and p-adic theory of automorphic forms and related topics such as L-functions.  Automorphic forms have played a key role in many breakthroughs in mathematics, including the proofs of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal).  The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include elliptic, Siegel, Hilbert, and Bianchi modular forms, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular forms, quadratic forms, and additional related areas of research.<br/><br/>Website:http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/"

In algebraic geometry, families of curves are studied by the use of moduli spaces, which parametrize the different curves in the family. Besides providing deep insights about curves, moduli spaces exhibit important behaviors which help shape our understanding of how geometric objects may be parametrized, and therein serve as envoys of a larger mathematical world, giving valuable insights into the development of higher dimensional theory. Recent work has revealed that certain aspects of moduli spaces of curves reflect underlying geometric structures. This research project investigates open questions related to these discoveries. Graduate students are involved in the project, and the investigator co-organizes the Mathematics Department's MathCamp high-school program.<br/><br/>The projects are organized along four general themes. For smooth curves, conformal blocks are identified with global sections of certain ample line bundles on a projective variety.  Project One aims to study to what extent this description may or may not hold for non-smooth curves. Project Two proposes birational models of the moduli space as configurations of weighted points supported on curves embedded in homogeneous varieties, generalizing those given by pointed rational normal curves in projective space.  To answer open problems about the multiplicative eigenpolyhedra from representation theory, and cones spanned by certain sets of first Chern classes of vector bundles of conformal blocks, the goal of Project Three is to leverage information gathered from maps between subsets of the two. Project Four aims to understand positive cycles of higher codimension given by vector bundles of conformal blocks."

The Langlands program functions today as a bridge between central disciplines of mathematics, such as representation theory, algebraic geometry, and number theory, and central disciplines in physics, such as gauge theory and string theory. This project will use this connection in both directions by applying ideas from physics to mathematics, through a new use of locality, and applying mathematical constructions to physics, by constructing the ""theory X,"" the conjectural six-dimensional conformal field theory that should unify all important quantum field theories in lower dimensions.<br/><br/>The central theme of this project is to extend the geometric Langlands program from objects of dimension one (in algebraic geometry) to arbitrary dimensions. The goal of the project is to develop conceptual breakthroughs into a full mathematical machinery. These breakthroughs include an extension of the basic case of the geometric Langlands program (the so called geometric Class Field Theory) to arbitrary dimension. This development is expected to be influential in mathematics, in particular through the introduction of the relative motivic cohomology. The general geometric Langlands program will also be investigated, based on recent results in constructing and generalizing the loop Grassmannian from the point of view of statistical mechanics."

Two distinguished graduate students will give hour-long presentations and one invited faculty member, Dr. Abakuse Mbrika of the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, will give a one-hour keynote address.  Invited undergraduate researchers will participate in a poster session. USTARS promotes diversity within the mathematical community by providing a platform for collaboration and professional development.  Participants are exposed to a variety of current research, ideas, and results, and meet underrepresented professors and students who will become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Indeed, the conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and hence is well-positioned to encourage participation from a diverse group of students. The participants of the conference will continue to influence the next generation of students by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the symposium is to showcase the mathematical research being conducted by underrepresented graduate students. This is done by structuring the meeting so that speakers will give 30-minute parallel research talks focusing on research leading to their graduate theses. Graduate students will give at least 75% of these presentations. Topics of prior years' presentations include: combinatorics, braid groups, graph theory, knot theory, representation theory, number theory, and algebraic geometry. In addition to the parallel sessions, two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour lectures and a poster session featuring invited undergraduates is also planned. Given the high quality and diversity of talks and participants ""The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) Invited Volume"" was created in 2014. This is a new series aimed specifically at disseminating the research of USTARS participants. The intention of this Invited Volume is to provide graduate students with an opportunity to publish their results in order to further their development as mathematical researchers. In light of this, a yearly online volume will be published at the conclusion of each annual research symposium.<br/><br/>http://www.ustars.org"

These algebras were discovered in the 1980s in the process of solving problems in theoretical quantum physics. They are mathematical systems that model rings of functions on geometric structures as in algebraic geometry (the study of geometric spaces defined by polynomial equations) except that the multiplication is noncommutative. The internal structure of quantum algebras will be intensively investigated, particularly those substructures that correspond to points and geometric subspaces in the classical analogs, together with relations between quantum and classical algebras that are connected via a semiclassical limit (a process in which the noncommutativity tends to zero). These commutative semiclassical limit algebras carry a remnant of the noncommutativity of the associated quantum algebras, recorded in a bilinear form called a Poisson bracket. The work will also pursue the closely related questions about Poisson algebras, as well as the classical-quantum interplay between Poisson semiclassical limits and their quantum counterparts. The research aims both to advance, and to tighten the links among, several highly active mathematical areas -- quantum groups, Poisson algebra, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and cluster theory. In particular, the work will furnish tools to pass insights from one area to the others. <br/><br/>Specific projects include the exploitation of cluster algebra structures on large classes of quantum and Poisson algebras towards the ideal theory of these algebras. A related effort will go into the construction of more viable bridges over which to shift information back and forth between quantum algebras and their semiclassical limits. Along this line, the investigator conjectures that the prime and primitive spectra of a quantum algebra are homeomorphic to the Poisson-prime and Poisson-primitive spectra of a semiclassical limit, and he will devote major effort towards a confirmation. Other projects target the classical-quantum interplay. The goal is to develop noncommutative versions of properties enjoyed by commutative coordinate rings, prominent among them being catenarity of their prime spectra. The work will explore the conjecture that all quantized coordinate rings enjoy catenarity. These efforts are related to the goal of elucidating the global topological structures of the prime and primitive spectra of quantum algebras. This is aimed at gluing the (already secured) classical pieces of these spectra via auxiliary spaces and maps that are not required in the classical setting. Establishing a specific, detailed format for this gluing and auxiliary data, together with similar, matching formats for the spectra of quantum algebras and semiclassical limits, would yield explicit homeomorphisms between these spectra, and thus establish the conjectured quantum-Poisson interplay."

The KUMUNU conference is held during one weekend each fall and has taken place every year (but one) since its inception in 1999. The original idea was to bring together algebraists at three midwest universities: Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, but over time the conference has expanded in scope to its present status as a major regional conference. The conference will feature six talks by leading researchers in commutative algebra and a poster session. The award will be used to support travel and lodging for participants, particularly junior researchers and graduate students. Special efforts will be made to support participation by women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the topics presented at the conference fall under the umbrella of commutative algebra. Commutative algebra has its origins from multiple sources, including algebraic geometry and number theory. In its modern form, it often provides a common language for parts of several different fields, including algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, combinatorics and computational mathematics. A recent trend in the conference has been to include talks that represent applications of commutative algebra to different fields, such as geometric singularities and computational and/or combinatorial topics, rather than topics that might fall purely under the purview of commutative algebra. Continued inclusion of speakers beyond the original triad of universities reinforce this pattern and contribute to the goal of broadening and strengthening connections between algebraists throughout the midwest.

Representation theory is a branch of modern algebra studying symmetries in linear spaces. It interacts with many other areas in mathematics, mathematical physics, and theoretical computer science. Geometric methods have become more and more fundamental in all of these areas. One of the main objectives of these conferences is to introduce beginning researchers in representation theory to the power of geometric methods. The keynote speakers for these conferences will be Harm Derksen in 2016 and Julia Pevtsova in 2017. Each keynote speaker will give two one-hour lectures, emphasizing geometric methods; these talks will be accessible to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. There will also be several expository lectures given by other experts. The remainder of the lectures will be research talks given by both senior and junior mathematicians. These will include several talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers related to their Ph.D. theses. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere in which new collaborations can be formed and young researchers have the opportunity to learn about cutting-edge geometric methods in representation theory. Moreover, the conference will enable junior representation theorists to present their work and interact with the broader research community. <br/><br/>Over the last 40 years, the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras has enjoyed a great impact of methods from algebraic geometry, in particular from geometric invariant theory and transformation groups. At the same time, this influence has led to the feedback of ideas and techniques from representation theory to geometry. One of the goals of the conferences on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory is to help strengthen and advance this interaction between geometry and representation theory. The topics of these conferences will include: semi-invariants for bound quivers; representations of group schemes of constant Jordan type and vector bundles; geometric aspects of cluster algebras; degenerations of modules and the geometry of orbit closures in module varieties; moduli problems for finite dimensional algebras; and universal deformation rings and their connection to moduli spaces.

Each TORA conference will feature three plenary guest speakers consisting of two outstanding leading research mathematicians from outside the Oklahoma-Texas region as well as a recent Ph.D. or a graduate student nearing completion of a Ph.D. In addition, regional graduate students and researchers will present their work. These weekend conferences will provide ample opportunities for collaboration and interactions among the students and researchers in the region, specializing in number theory, automorphic forms and representation theory. <br/><br/>Automorphic forms are basic objects of study in modern number theory.  The interplay between automorphic forms and representation theory has seen a number of very exciting new developments recently which also fuel applications to several other fields. J. Arthur's work on endoscopic classification of representations of the orthogonal and symplectic groups is an example of such new developments.  Research faculty from over a half dozen universities in the Oklahoma and North Texas region work in automorphic forms and representation theory. The TORA conference series has been successful in bringing together researchers from the region and beyond, as well as their students, and propel innovation and exchange. TORA VII-IX will continue this success in collaborations and exchanges not only between institutions, but also among mathematical areas.

Many natural phenomena of interest in physics, biology, and computer science can be modeled by polynomials, making algebraic geometry a useful tool for the scientific community at large.  This research project aims to study the geometric properties of the simplest objects in algebraic geometry, known as algebraic curves.  While some curves may have exotic or pathological properties, it is expected that most curves do not.  This goal of this project is to show that ""typical"" curves are geometrically well-behaved, using techniques from the recently developed field of non-Archimedean analytic geometry.<br/><br/>Brill-Noether theory aims to study the geometry of a curve by examining all of its maps to projective space, or equivalently the existence and behavior of its linear series.  A major change in perspective occurred during the twentieth century, as the field shifted from studying fixed to general curves -- that is, general points in the moduli space of curves.  A standard approach to the study of general curves is via degeneration arguments.  One considers a family of smooth curves degenerating to a singular curve, and attempts to deduce geometric properties of the general fiber using information about the singular fiber.  Recently, it has been observed that this theory fits within a broader framework of non-Archimedean analytic techniques.  This project focuses on outstanding problems concerning the Brill-Noether theory of general curves, and how new techniques in non-Archimedean analytic geometry may shed light on these problems."

Far from being esoteric, such mathematical systems describe the procession of the days of the week (p = 7), the fundamentals of computer architecture (p = 2), and also the setting for important cryptosystems.  Algebraic geometry in characteristic p is the study of geometric objects (""varieties"") given by solutions to polynomial equations in this setting.  This project investigates the relationship between varieties in characteristic p and in characteristic zero (""standard"" algebraic geometry), with the goal of shedding light on both worlds.  Graduate students will take a major part in the research project.

In particular, the project aims to obtain a classification of the so-called ""local Oort groups"" and ""weak local Oort groups"".  The second part of the project involves analyzing integral models of Galois covers of curves over p-adic fields.  New tools involving deformation data shed light on stable models of Galois covers of curves with complicated Galois groups.  These tools will be exploited further in order to understand stable models of Galois covers as explicitly as possible."

In particular, the study of prime numbers and divisors is now influenced by the work of physicists in modeling high energy systems by understanding the statistics of random matrix theory. This project explores the relationship between these apparently independent areas of research. The work studies the analytic theory of L-functions, which are fundamental objects in number theory that encode arithmetic information. Examples include the Riemann zeta-function, which encodes information about prime numbers, Dirichlet L-functions, which encode information about the equidistribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, and the L-functions associated with modular forms, which encode the equidistribution of more complex sequences, including rational points on elliptic curves. The investigator aims to develop a theoretical framework to explain by number theoretic means the statistical behavior of the values and zeros of such L-functions.<br/><br/>The investigator and collaborators plan work in a variety of projects, each involved with some aspect of L-functions. One project begins with a novel approach to understanding moments of the Riemann zeta-function through a study of convolutions of correlations of shifted divisor functions. This research incorporates a multidimensional discrete analogue of the Hardy-Littlewood Circle method. Another project is to improve bounds on the proportion of zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. A third project involves work related to an approach to the Riemann Hypothesis as a mollification problem; it is to understand an exact formula for the second moment of the zeta-function multiplied by a specific long Dirichlet polynomial. A fourth project is to prove that at least 60% of the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions are on the critical line."

The Markoff Diophantine equation arose in Markoff's fundamental work (in 1879) characterizing those irrationals that are badly approximable. The equation arises in several fields of mathematics. Its integer solutions have a tree structure, and investigation of the arithmetic properties of these Markoff numbers (the first of which is associated with the golden ratio, in a sense the most badly approximable irrational number) leads to important questions in graph theory.  This research project investigates the connectivity of graphs related to the Markoff tree.  In addition to its importance for number theory, this investigation has deep connections and applications to, among other topics, the product replacement algorithm (the most prevalent but still poorly understood tool in computational group theory) and expander graphs in computer science.<br/><br/>Investigation of the arithmetic properties of Markoff numbers leads to the question of whether the graphs obtained by the modular reduction of the Markoff tree are connected (strong approximation). Superstrong approximation is the assertion that these graphs are in fact highly connected, that is to say form a family of expanders. The past decade saw a remarkable explosion of activity in the area of superstrong approximation for thin groups (Zariski dense subgroups of infinite index). Much of the research was driven by development of the affine sieve. In the case of thin groups with Levi factor of its Zariski closure semisimple, the strong and superstrong approximation and their applications in affine sieve are by now well-understood. On the other hand, the tori pose particularly difficult problems, both in terms of sparsity of elements in an orbit and their Diophantine properties as well as in terms of strong approximation, which in this case amounts to Artin's primitive root conjecture. This research project will investigate strong and superstrong approximation in a setting that is intermediate in level of difficulty between that of tori and that of thin linear groups, namely, that of nonlinear actions on a surface defined by the Markoff equation as well as in the context of other surfaces of Markoff type. Superstrong approximation results for thin linear groups will play an important role in this investigation, as will techniques and methods related to progress on Lang's conjecture and to the classification of algebraic Painlev VI equations."

The simplicity and intrinsic beauty of these problems, and the disproportionate depth and effort of their resolution, has inspired their study since ancient Greece. The central questions that arise naturally stratify as follows: Qualitative questions: Does there exist a solution?  Do there exist infinitely many solutions? Does the set of solutions have some extra structure (e.g. geometric)? Quantitative questions: How many solutions are there? How large is the smallest solution? How can we explicitly and with certainty find all solutions? Implicit questions: Why do equations have (or fail to have) solutions?  Why do some have many and some have none?  What underlying mathematical structures control this?

The observations and insights he shared then continue to fascinate the mathematical world, and his personal story has captured the public imagination. In recent years evidence has emerged that the work of Einstein and the work of Ramanujan are related.

Harmonic Maass forms generalize modular forms, and are now recognized as furnishing a theoretical framework for Ramanujan's mock theta functions. Freeman Dyson anticipated a role for the mock theta functions in string theory in 1987, and the currently-developing umbral moonshine theory is producing strong evidence in support of this vision. Building on their earlier work in these areas, the investigators aim to develop algebraic, analytic, and combinatorial tools for harmonic Maass forms that will shed light upon problems such as ranks of elliptic curves, the relationship between monstrous and umbral moonshine, and the consequences of this relationship for physics."

Focused primarily on solving polynomial equations, algebraic geometry is an ancient subject that plays a key role in numerous fields of mathematics, both pure and applied. It is a linchpin of modern number theory, a heavy hammer of contemporary cryptography, and a crucial input into the computer vision systems that are transforming geography, archaeology, medicine, the automotive industry, and consumer smartphones. While it continues to expand its abstract foundations in astounding new directions, algebraic geometry is also cutting new paths into data science, statistics, and machine learning. The questions under study in this project attack both ends of this spectrum. One part of the project will focus on problems related to so-called Torelli theorems, which seek to capture and quantify the essential linearity of algebro-geometric objects, and on the Brauer group, which is an object that tightly binds algebraic geometry to mathematical physics, non-commutative algebra, and number theory. A second part of the project aims to broaden the algebro-geometric foundations of computer vision, bringing new approaches to deep problems that lie at the heart of cutting-edge applications of computer vision.<br/><br/>The first part of this research project concerns Torelli theorems and focuses on Torelli-type statements for various mixtures of derived categories and Chow theory, building on the investigator's earlier work with collaborators. This is one way of trying to get Torelli theorems in a positive characteristic setting, and the underlying ideas have already paid dividends related to the Tate conjecture for surfaces over finite fields. Research on the Brauer group aims at new degeneration methods via semistable reduction of maximal orders and universality questions for rational Brauer groups of projective spaces. The goal is to gain structural insight into Brauer classes and attack several old problems, such as the cyclicity conjecture. The part of the project on computer vision will introduce functorial methods into the study of multiview reconstruction and resection, leading to new ways of compactifying the natural incidence correspondences that occur in these problems. The work aims to help lay new flexible foundations for algebraic geometry in computer vision that will advance the relationship between the subjects."

The typical mathematical framework in which geometric entities (such as the 4-dimensional space-time that underlies the general theory of relativity) can be studied algebraically needs to be enlarged and generalized if it is to be reconciled with quantum phenomena. In the resulting setup, the symmetries of a physical system (in the sense of structure-preserving transformations) sometimes need to be discarded and replaced with new and more exotic notions of symmetry. The mathematical embodiment of these exotic symmetries are known as ""quantum groups,"" and they are the main focus of this project. Much of what can be taken for granted in the context of ""plain"" geometry and actions of ordinary transformations on ordinary spaces becomes problematic in the noncommutative setting. This research project aims to shed light on a number of these problems, in a range of subfields within the larger realm of noncommutative geometry. <br/><br/>This project investigates several aspects of noncommutative geometry that revolve around the notion of quantum symmetry. This involves studying quantum groups, their representation theory, and their actions on algebraic and geometric structures, as well as attendant problems in non-commutative algebraic geometry. One goal is to further understand the phenomenon of quantum rigidity, whereby certain structures admit no truly quantum symmetries. What this means is that whenever a sufficiently well-behaved Hopf algebra (which is the algebraic embodiment of a quantum group) coacts in a structure-preserving manner, the coaction factors through one by the function algebra on an ordinary group. Many special cases of this are known (integral affine algebraic varieties, certain smooth non-commutative projective algebraic varieties, compact connected smooth manifolds, certain classes of metric spaces, etc.), but the general phenomenon is poorly understood. Another goal is to attempt to transport tools and concepts specific to discrete or reductive algebraic groups (such as Borel subgroups, maximal tori, weight systems, compactifications, residual finiteness, linearity) over to quantum groups in order to further elucidate their structure and representation theory. Finally, symmetry considerations allow for the construction of new examples of smooth noncommutative projective schemes that in some sense behave generically within the moduli spaces that classify such schemes. The representation theory of the corresponding algebras would then shed light into the nature of these moduli spaces that are at the moment not well understood."

In its simplest form it treats figures defined in the plane by polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory, and robotics. A central problem in algebraic geometry is the classification of all geometric objects. In turn, an important part of classification theory is the theory of moduli. The latter's core idea is that one does not only want to understand these objects, but also understand the way they can be deformed. Moduli spaces play a very important role in theoretical physics: studying curves on moduli spaces provides information on how an object is changing in space-time. One of the foci of this project is on compact moduli spaces, which give additional information about singular deformations, ones that are essentially different from others.  The investigator is also involved in promoting mathematics to high school students; he and fellow directors of the Summer Institute for Mathematics at the University of Washington make special efforts to involve women at all levels of the program, from students through teaching assistants to instructors, to reinforce their leadership roles in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project concerns several topics in higher dimensional algebraic geometry, especially moduli theory and singularities. The overarching theme of the research is centered on compact moduli spaces of stable log varieties, an important area that is still in the developmental stage. In particular, even the correct moduli functor needs to be identified, and most of the research is motivated by understanding the basic properties of these moduli spaces. This involves understanding the singularities that can occur on stable log varieties. Important classes of singularities in this regard are that of rational singularities and other singularities of the minimal model program. The investigator will work on advancing our currently very limited understanding of these singularities in arbitrary characteristic. The project also aims to develop cohomological methods to deal with rational pairs and thrifty resolutions in arbitrary characteristic. In particular, the investigator will study logarithmic versions of Hodge cohomology and of Grothendieck's fundamental class.

Mathematics has built a strong foundation for solving various problems in physics. In recent years, a number of exciting advances in high energy physics have been developed by using the newly discovered mathematical objects called cluster algebras.  This workshop will bring together both leading experts and young researchers working on applications of mathematical theory of quivers and bipartite graphs to problems in high energy physics. The NSF funds will be used to reimburse travel expenses for graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, young faculty members, members of under-represented groups, and researchers without federal support.<br/><br/>Cluster algebras have been uniquely suited for simplifying and carrying out massive calculations (e.g., related to scattering amplitudes), and formalizing and unifying key observations previously made by theoretical physicists. Since this new and dynamic inter-disciplinary area of research touches upon a wide range of topics including gauge theory, string theory, number theory, algebraic geometry, integrable systems, and representation theory, the funding will be used to help mathematicians from diverse research areas to learn, interact, and collaborate with world experts in mathematics and high energy physics. One hallmark of the workshop will be the increased cross-fertilization between the mathematical sciences and other areas of science, particularly physics.

For an arbitrary system of equations, it can be quite difficult to determine whether there exist any such rational solutions. This research project develops a new perspective on this problem using geometry and asymptotic behavior.

The first focuses on the change in behavior of rational points and obstructions as the base field varies. In this direction, the project pursues a direct connection between the existence of 0-cycles and rational points on geometrically rational surfaces and explores new asymptotic questions that will shed light on Colliot-Thlne's conjecture on 0-cycles.

For example, a mirror on a wall can help to visualize a reflection of 3-dimensional space, a symmetry which sends each point in our world to the corresponding point on the other side of the mirror. Coxeter groups are special kinds of groups of symmetries that consist of sequences of reflections through mirrors placed at precise angles to one another. The so-called ""crystallographic"" Coxeter groups occur frequently in physics and mathematics because they preserve lattice points, for example the locations of atoms in a crystal. Crystallographic Coxeter groups also arise when analyzing important geometric spaces; this imbues them with a great deal of interesting structure. Mysteriously, Coxeter groups which are not crystallographic still possess this beautiful structure, despite having no geometric explanation. For example, each Coxeter group has an associated Hecke algebra, and by multiplying elements in this algebra one can produce numbers called structure coefficients. For crystallographic Coxeter groups, these coefficients are always non-negative because they are counting something. However, the non-negativity result holds in general. An underlying goal of this project is to find combinatorial and algebraic descriptions of the structures apparent in Coxeter groups, to help explain these mysterious phenomena. The main objects of study are categorical representations of Hecke algebras, where usual reflections are replaced by ""reflection functors"" that act as symmetries not on some n-dimensional space, but on spaces attached to representations of other important algebras in mathematics.<br/><br/>In this research project the categorical representation theory of Hecke algebras will be investigated along three lines of attack. The first approach is to lift the notion of diagonalization from linear algebra to categorical representation theory. For example, the full twist in the braid group, and its image in the Hecke algebra, is diagonalizable in any finite dimensional representation. In joint work with Hogancamp, I aim to prove that the categorified full twist is ""categorically  diagonalizable."" This allows one to lift much of the structure  theory of Hecke algebra representations to the categorical level.  In the second approach, together with Williamson and Juteau, I will study certain categorical representations of affine Weyl groups which are significant for modular representation theory, and their quantum deformations. The goal is to compute local intersection forms, which will explain how the category degenerates in finite characteristic. This computation will give character formulas for modular representations of algebraic groups which were previously unknown. In the third approach, together with Young, I will find an algebraic description of the quantum deformation mentioned above, when the quantum parameter is a root of unity. This is related to the categorification of complex reflection groups, which is an open problem."

The set of solutions to polynomial equations can be interpreted geometrically, and many of the shapes appearing in nature such as spheres and ellipses, can be described using them.  Polynomials and the geometric objects they describe are ubiquitous, both in pure and applied mathematics, as well as in statistics, engineering, and computer science.  <br/><br/>An important theme in this proposal is to study polynomial equations defined over the rational numbers via reduction to positive characteristic.

Diophantine approximation deals with approximation of real numbers by rational numbers and with questions of classification of given numbers as irrational, algebraic, or transcendental.  Diophantine equations are algebraic equations with integer coefficients, for which integer solutions are sought. The geometry of numbers deals with the use of geometric notions to solve problems in number theory, usually via the solutions of equations in integers. One of the basic problems of mathematics is to find the solutions of a given polynomial equation. The level of difficulty of such problems depends on the shape of the polynomial and more so on what kind of solutions one is looking for. Finding complex numbers that are solutions to a polynomial equation is a relatively easy task. However, finding integer solutions to polynomial equations is a problem of much greater subtlety and depth, and is the focus of number theory.  This project aims to broaden and deepen knowledge in this fundamental area.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research project is to study the general problem of counting integral solutions of Diophantine equations and its applications. The PI will develop methodological advances by combining techniques from classical analysis with modern applications of analytic number theory and arithmetic geometry to address some important and long standing Diophantine problems effectively and explicitly. The research is also concerned with studying the distribution of integral solutions to Diophantine equations. Results of the project are anticipated to lead to substantially better understanding of the geometric and analytic properties of certain arithmetic objects, such as elliptic curves."

The first topic is Gromov-Witten (GW) theory, which roughly speaking is about a systematic way of counting numbers of curves with particular constraints in a space defined by a set of polynomial equations. For example on  a plane there are four conics passing three given points and two given lines in general positions. The second topic is Donaldson-Thomas (DT) theory, which studies properties of the space parametrizing sets of polynomials defining one dimensional objects with certain topological constraints in a space. In a so-called Calabi-Yau space, a series of remarkable conjectures say that counting using GW theory is equivalent to that using DT theory. Different branches of mathematics are linked together by these two theories and deep properties of geometric objects have been uncovered by calculating invariants they give rise to. In this project the PI will investigate a conjectured duality between these two theories and relate them to other branches of mathematics and physics. <br/><br/>In more detail, the projects in this proposal are designed to study several aspects of enumerative properties of the moduli spaces of geometric objects in algebraic geometry. The first topic is Gromov-Witten theory.

Since then, profound connections have been discovered between double affine Hecke algebras and a broad spectrum of areas in mathematics, including combinatorics, algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory, harmonic analysis, knot theory, special functions, many body problems, and conformal field theory. Recent results hint at a new and promising connection between double affine Hecke algebras and Lie superalgebras and open the door to many intriguing possibilities that will be explored at the workshop.

Part of their mystery and beauty is a bit frustrating; we want to understand their common features, not just as a list of five unrelated objects. It has long been known that having enough reflection symmetries is part of this story.  This project is about understanding reflection groups, via their generating reflections and the algebra that governs how the reflections compose, in a broader context. Results of the work are expected to have application to random sorting networks and to better understanding of the representation theory of the finite general linear groups.<br/> <br/>Classical reflection groups are not only unified in that they are generated by reflections -- they also share common features with general linear groups over a finite field. Particularly gratifying is that, when viewing the finite general linear group as a reflection group, one is led to questions about its representation theory and its invariant theory that (conjecturally) have surprisingly simple and elegant answers. In this project, the ordinary representation theory of finite general linear groups will be explored using the method pioneered by Okounkov and Vershik for studying symmetric groups. Also, the characteristic-p invariant theory of finite general linear groups will be studied using ideas arising from the connection between Catalan combinatorics and the characteristic zero invariant theory of real reflection groups."

Moduli theory is concerned with how these shapes deform when parameters are varied in a continuous fashion, and compactified moduli spaces describe in particular the kind of degenerate limiting shapes that may appear when deformations are performed. Various geometric properties of interest do not change under deformations and are often easier to analyze if limits adequate for the problem at hand are allowed. The ""wall-crossing phenomenon"" refers loosely to changing the compactified moduli spaces by disallowing certain limiting shapes and replacing them with different ones. The compactified moduli spaces studied in this project have deep connections with the mirror symmetry phenomenon discovered in string theory, a very active area of theoretical physics. In the last two decades, the results and techniques from algebraic geometry, especially the theory of moduli spaces, have been successfully employed in string theory. On the other hand, ideas from string theory have opened up new directions of research in mathematics by suggesting striking conjectures and at the same time putting old unsolved problems into a new light. This project will continue this fruitful interaction by offering new insights on mirror symmetry at higher genus, via the study of wall-crossing between moduli spaces.<br/><br/>This project aims to continue the investigator's study of compactifications of moduli spaces of maps from curves to a large class of GIT quotient targets. These compactifications, called moduli spaces of stable quasimaps, produce new curve-counting invariants, which should be related to Gromov-Witten invariants by wall-crossing formulas. Indeed, such wall-crossing formulas in genus zero were established by the PI with Kim in recent years, and they turn out to provide significant generalizations of Givental's toric mirror theorems. One of the main goals of this project is to vastly extend the wall-crossing formulas by establishing them in higher genus and at the level of virtual classes for many compact targets. These formulas will then have many consequences which will be investigated. An important application is to the Mirror Conjecture at higher genus for complete intersection Calabi-Yau varieties, such as the quintic threefold. In this case, the wall-crossing formula may be viewed as giving a mathematically rigorous interpretation of the physicist's ""`holomorphic limit of the B-model partition function"" as the generating function for quasimap invariants. Further applications and generalizations that emerge from the study of wall-crossing relate to the so-called Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence, and more generally to the new theory of the gauged linear sigma model of Fan-Jarvis-Ruan in higher genus."

Being able to provide points that look random, statistically, is extremely important both from applied and pure points of view. An illustration of the importance of the task is given by secure communications, such as bank transfers and other electronic commerce, which start with a scheme that picks a random pair of prime numbers from the collection of all primes of an appropriate size. Being sufficiently random is one of the requirements that keeps many such schemes secure. However, providing a random point from a pool of points is a computational task that is much harder than it might seem.  This research project studies mathematical questions underpinning the random choice of elements of a set.  One of the main aims of this project is to establish that, if the group of symmetries of a collection of points is complicated enough, then one can provide a pseudo-random point rather quickly, compared to the number of points. The main focus of this project is to develop a very concrete way of measuring how complicated a group is by using polynomial equations. As part of the project, the investigator plans to explore some of its applications to pure mathematics, for example, generalizations of the work on sum and product sets that says: given a finite set of integers, the collection of all possible pairwise sums, and, the collection of all possible pairwise products, these collections cannot both be small. <br/><br/>The principal aim of this project is to prove the main conjecture of super-approximation and explore its applications to the other areas of mathematics. Super-approximation roughly says: whether a random walk (with respect to finitely many elements with algebraic entries) in invertible matrices over some topological ring, e.g., real numbers, p-adic numbers, or adeles, has spectral gap depends only on the Zariski closure of the group generated by the given set of matrices. In the past decade there has been substantial progress in this subject, and super-approximation has been shown to be extremely useful in various parts of mathematics, including number theory (affine sieve; variations of Galois representations) and group theory (sieve in groups; hyperbolic geometry; orbit equivalence rigidity). Another goal of this project is to find additional applications of super-approximation."

The investigators have been investigating K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of threefolds, as well as GW and quasimap invariants of Nakajima quiver varieties. Because some of conjectures motivated by theoretical physics can only be properly formulated in terms of K-theoretic enumerative invariants, they plan to study dualities relating K-theoretic enumerative invariants of different geometries, and to lift results on traditional enumerative invariants to the K-theoretic setting."

The goal is produce mathematicians of the next generation who will have both the tools to succeed in their chosen fields and the facility necessary to bridge the gap between areas.<br/><br/>This project will establish a Research Training Group in geometry as a collaborative effort between the Stony Brook Mathematics Department and the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics. It unites a long commitment to training young mathematicians at a traditional mathematics department with the exceptional scientific opportunities presented by a major international research center located next door. The overall aim of the program is to train a group of young mathematicians who will combine expertise in a specific geometric field with a serious appreciation of the other subfields of geometry and of the connections between geometry and mathematical physics. The RTG will have three main components. It will fund nine Postdoctoral Fellows who will be full participating members of both the mathematics department and the Simons Center. Besides engaging in a full range of traditional mathematical activities, the Fellows will participate in joint seminars bringing together postdocs in mathematics and theoretical physics. The program will also provide partial support to a cadre of graduate trainees in mathematics, who will have an affiliation in the Simons Center and will participate fully in activities in the Center. Finally, the program will put in place a number of new activities designed to enrich the experiences of Stony Brook mathematics undergraduates, including those interested in teaching careers, and to introduce them to the scientific focus of the Simons Center."

The second project aims to classify a large subclass of the class of simple saturated 2-fusion systems of component type.

The cohomology groups of a complex algebraic variety carry mixed Hodge structures, and Hodge theory studies these structures and their interaction with the geometry of the variety. The theory of mixed Hodge modules provides a modern framework for this, using the language of perverse sheaves and D-modules. The main educational component of the project is to improve the teaching of mathematics to undergraduate students pursuing a major in a non-mathematics STEM field. The PI will design and teach, in consultation with faculty from another department, a new two-semester course that meets the current mathematical needs of their students.

This is a field that deals with the study of algebraic varieties: geometric objects given as the solutions of a system of polynomial equations. For example, the solution set of a single polynomial equation in two variables can be geometrically realized as a curve in the plane (e.g., a parabola y=x^2). One important aspect is to understand the local picture of these solution sets, which has applications in many sciences and engineering. For example, the parabola is smooth (meaning that locally it looks like a line) while the curve defined by y^2=x^3 is smooth except at the origin, where it is a cusp. The singular or non-smooth points of an algebraic variety have rich and subtle local structure, and detailing their properties is a crucial part of many investigations. The projects that will be explored are focused on the local properties of algebraic varieties, such as their local intersection numbers and the multiplicities (which is a measure of how bad the singular points are). Several of the questions under study are longstanding and of fundamental importance. <br/><br/>This project investigates several longstanding open questions in commutative algebra from new perspectives. One is to attack Serre's conjecture on positivity of intersection multiplicities and Hochster's direct summand conjecture using a new notion called lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences of modules, whose existence will establish both conjectures. Another is to attack Lech's conjecture on Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities using advances in positive characteristic methods. The investigator recently settled this conjecture in dimension three in equal characteristic (the conjecture was previously known only in dimension less than or equal to two). The goal here is to improve the methods and to seek solutions in higher dimension. Other research projects include studying singularities in positive characteristic, especially investigating their behavior under deformation, under passing to a generic linkage, and their connections with F-module and D-module theory. A crucial technique to be employed is the Frobenius structures on local cohomology modules."

Focused primarily on varieties defined by polynomial equations, algebraic geometry is an ancient subject that plays a key role in numerous fields of mathematics, both pure and applied, as well as in physics. The main theme of this project is that a broad class of geometric objects, so called Calabi-Yau varieties, come with a natural system of coordinates.  Informally speaking, creatures living on a Calabi-Yau variety should be able to perceive natural, intrinsic quantities whose values determine their precise position. As these geometric objects play a fundamental role in diverse areas of mathematics, these intrinsic quantities should play a similar fundamental role in theoretical physics, particularly in superstring theory. Since string theory models suggest that extra dimensions of spacetime comprise a Calabi-Yau variety, this study suggests there are corresponding fundamental intrinsic quantities, not yet understood, in our world. This research project aims to deepen and advance knowledge in this field.<br/><br/>The main objective of the proposed research is to continue the investigator's collaborative work to generalize the classical theory of theta functions for abelian varieties to polarized Calabi-Yau varieties, both open (i.e. log) and compact. More precisely, the goal is to give a canonical basis for the vector space of global sections, and a formula for the structure constants for the multiplication rule in the coordinate ring, expressed in the canonical basis, as counts of holomorphic disks on the mirror. The existence of such generalized theta functions points to the existence of a geometrically meaningful compactification of the moduli space, vastly generalizing the compactificaton of polarized abelian varieties and the theory of the secondary polytope, and at the same time suggests a synthetic construction of the mirror in terms of the canonically described ring. The project includes a detailed scheme for constructing the compactification in dimension two, and the synthetic construction of the mirror in full generality, by counting rigid analytic disks."

The idea of associating discrete or linear invariants to algebraic varieties has been intensively and successfully used in algebraic geometry to understand the properties of algebraic varieties and to classify them. This project aims to employ modern techniques that make use of the geometric properties of the variety to more fully investigate these invariants, which may lead to decisive progress towards the solution of several long-standing problems.  One of the main objectives is to understand to what extent an algebraic variety could be parametrized by independent parameters. In this direction, even the case of cubics -- varieties defined by a single equation of degree 3 in four or more variables -- is far from being completely understood. <br/><br/>The project addresses four questions. The first is about birational properties of algebraic varieties. The investigator plans to apply specialization techniques, based on properties of Chow group of zero-cycles, to quadric fibrations over rational surfaces. The second problem concerns Chow groups of cycles on algebraic varieties and the cycle class maps to the cohomology groups: integral aspects of the Hodge and Tate conjectures. These questions can be approached by computing unramified cohomology groups. The project will investigate these and related geometric properties, such as spaces of rational curves on varieties and R-equivalence. The third problem concerns Galois-theoretic invariants and local-global principles over function fields of curves. The cases of particular importance are threefolds over finite fields or abelian varieties. The last problem focuses on properties of classifying spaces of algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields."

Representation theory is a branch of mathematics devoted to the study of symmetries of mathematical and physical systems that has applications to many other areas of mathematics, particularly number theory and geometry. This is the 42nd anniversary of the original Midwest Conference. Over the years it has served as an important source of information for experts in the field and numerous collaborative efforts have originated from these meetings. This year's meeting will continue that tradition. <br/><br/>The conference will feature ten main talks, including talks by young researchers, on a broad range of topics in representation theory of groups over non-archimedean local fields. Topics covered may include Plancherel formula, supercuspidal representations, the structure of smooth representations of reductive groups via types and covers, functorial transfer to general linear groups, and the Local Langlands Correspondence.

Number fields play a central role in number theory, while surfaces play a central role in geometry.  The research project concerns number fields that arise naturally from the geometry of surfaces, via a construction dating back to work of the mathematician Adolph Hurwitz around 1900.  These Hurwitz number fields have a combination of properties that is very unusual from a purely number-theoretic point of view: their degrees and Galois groups are typically very large, while their sets of ramifying primes are very small.  In fact, Hurwitz number fields are so extreme with respect to these invariants that their existence contradicts a heuristic that has successfully guided other recent research into number fields. The goal of this research project is to establish that these outlying number fields all behave in a uniform and highly structured way. The results of the project are expected to support future developments interrelating several disciplines surrounding number theory.  The project includes collaborations with three undergraduates, designed specifically to better prepare them for scientific careers. These collaborations will serve as models for future involvement of students in high-level mathematics research.<br/><br/>Hurwitz number fields arise as fields of definition of maps for Riemann surfaces to the Riemann sphere. The main focus of the research project will be on the explicit description of ramification in an arbitrary Hurwitz number field.  From the geometric data defining the field, one can read off a finite set of primes outside of which ramification is known to be tame.  The project will pursue exact formulas for ramification at these tame primes and sharp upper bounds for the wild ramification at the remaining primes.  Besides studying ramification, the investigator will aim to establish a geometric analog of a conjecture on the unboundedness of degrees for a given set of ramifying primes. In a different direction, where the set of ramifying primes is allowed to grow, the investigator aims to demonstrate further uniformity of behavior by finding multi-indexed sequences of multivariate polynomials that define infinitely many Hurwitz number fields at once."

In algebraic geometry, the project aims, among other things, to show that one of the simplest parameter spaces already has bad singularities, and in fact contains every singularity imaginable.  Many of the specific research topics contained in the project are at a level accessible to beginning graduate students, and one of the goals is to involve students in the research.<br/><br/>More specifically, given a Galois extension K of Q with Galois group G,  the project will extend geometry-of-numbers methods to study the ""fragments"" of K cut out by an idempotent of the group ring QG, in the hope of developing a new way to prove the nonexistence of certain Galois representations.  It will also study correspondences from a curve to itself that are unramified on one side, from the point of view of arithmetic dynamics, since such setups yield new examples of almost-everywhere-unramified arboreal representations.  In algebraic geometry proper, the project will study infinitesimal neighborhoods of the vertex of a cone to try to prove that the Hilbert scheme of points satisfies Murphy's law.  Finally, the project will explore whether there is an idele class group variant of the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics."

These Meetings Workshops will bring the rising women stars and current mathematical leaders together with graduate students and recent graduates from a variety of fields in pure and applied mathematics. By creating a rich intellectual community centered on shared research interests, the activities promise to generate new mentoring relations, new research collaborations, and increased activity in the associated research areas. Such relationships can lead to a lifetime of professional success. Moreover, these events at highly visible national meetings benefit the entire mathematical community by showcasing the excellent mathematical work done by women.<br/><br/>Each Meetings Workshop has a research focus derived from a prior AWM Research Collaboration Workshop, a week-long event where participants work together on open research problems. At the Meetings Workshops, leaders in each research field will introduce younger mathematicians to a deeper understanding of the field and its connections with their own work. Graduate students will, in turn, share their research during poster sessions and small group interactions. The research topics that will be highlighted in the next four workshops include Dynamical Systems with applications to Medical Problems;  Number Theory;  Numerical Partial Differential Equations; and Noncommutative Algebra. These topics span a broad spectrum of current mathematical problems, and will correspondingly enhance the future careers of many young women mathematicians.

For example, the question of whether there are infinitely many 7's in the decimal expansion of pi asks about a property of the geometric constant pi as expressed in our base-10 representation of it. This research project in the foundations of mathematics investigates the effective, and more generally definable, aspects of Diophantine approximation, the meta-mathematical status of familiar theorems in countable combinatorics, and the pure structure theory of relative definability. <br/><br/>One can view classical theorems in Diophantine approximation, such as Borel's almost-every real number is absolutely normal or Roth's every irrational algebraic number has irrationality exponent 2, as asserting properties of real numbers in terms of our descriptions of them. Borel's theorem asserts a property of expansions by integer bases, and Roth's theorem asserts a property of approximation by rational numbers. There is a natural affinity between this tradition in number theory and the study of definability in recursion theory. This research project will investigate the connections between these areas. For example, what is the exact relationship between the irrationality exponent of a real number, or more generally its Mahler transcendence measures, and the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial segments of its binary expansion? Second, a real number is absolutely normal if for every integer base b, each digit appears with asymptotic frequency 1/b. What other patterns of asymptotic frequencies are possible? This last question also touches dynamical systems in the form of Furstenberg's x2 x3 conjecture."

The main areas to be explored are algebraic and symplectic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest and most fundamental branches of mathematics. It has a wide range of applications from coding and data security to high energy physics and string theory. The principal objects of study are algebraic varieties, the sets of solutions of systems of algebraic equations in several variables; classical examples are ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. Symplectic geometry is the modern framework of classical mechanics. It also plays an important role in modern quantum theories in physics. The main objects of study are symplectic manifolds, which are abstractions of the notion of phase space from physics. An important class of symplectic manifolds are algebraic varieties.  Through this connection, the research project explores interactions between algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry, with the goal of advancing understanding in both areas.<br/><br/>A central theme of this project is to associate convex bodies, known as the Newton-Okounkov bodies, to algebraic varieties, encoding information about the geometry of the variety. It gives a general framework to extend the scope of convex geometry methods from toric varieties to general varieties. The project will explore applications of this area in symplectic geometry and other directions. Some fundamental topics to be addressed in the project are: (1) constructing Hamiltonian torus actions on general projective varieties; (2) a general approach to the ""principle of independence of polarization"" in geometric quantization for a large class of projective varieties; (3) establishing connections with tropical geometry and computational algebra; and (4) investigating the notion of entropy from the point of view of the theory of Newton-Okunkov bodies. Among the applications, the project is expected to contribute to mathematical physics and quantum mechanics, via geometric quantization. The project will also investigate connections with tropical geometry, a branch of algebraic geometry connected to convex optimization."

Geometric methods have become more and more fundamental in all of these areas. One of the main objectives of these conferences is to introduce beginning researchers in representation theory to the power of geometric methods. The keynote speakers for these conferences will be Harm Derksen in 2016 and Julia Pevtsova in 2017. Each keynote speaker will give two one-hour lectures, emphasizing geometric methods; these talks will be accessible to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. There will also be several expository lectures given by other experts. The remainder of the lectures will be research talks given by both senior and junior mathematicians. These will include several talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers related to their Ph.D. theses. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere in which new collaborations can be formed and young researchers have the opportunity to learn about cutting-edge geometric methods in representation theory. Moreover, the conference will enable junior representation theorists to present their work and interact  with the broader research community.<br/><br/>Over the last 40 years, the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras has enjoyed a great impact of methods from algebraic geometry, in particular from geometric invariant theory and transformation groups. At the same time, this influence has led to the feedback of ideas and techniques from representation theory to geometry. One of the goals of the conferences on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory is to help strengthen and advance this interaction between geometry and representation theory. The topics of these conferences will include: semi-invariants for bound quivers; representations of group schemes of constant Jordan type and vector bundles; geometric aspects of cluster algebras; degenerations of modules and the geometry of orbit closures in module varieties; moduli problems for finite dimensional algebras; and universal deformation rings and their connection to moduli spaces.

The investigators are developing the theory of Mixed-Spin-P (MSP) fields, to interpolate GW theory of quintic threefolds and FJRW theory of Fermat quintic polynomials, and to study algebraic structures of higher genus GW and FJRW invariants. The new theories of GLSM and MSP fields will provide new tools to attack the central and longstanding problem of computing higher genus GW invariants of compact Calabi-Yau threefolds. The investigators have been investigating K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of threefolds, as well as GW and quasimap invariants of Nakajima quiver varieties. Because some of conjectures motivated by theoretical physics can only be properly formulated in terms of K-theoretic enumerative invariants, they plan to study dualities relating K-theoretic enumerative invariants of different geometries, and to lift results on traditional enumerative invariants to the K-theoretic setting."

The meetings consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast.   Each meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty.  Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks.     <br/><br/>A primary goal of the Southeastern Number Theory Meetings is to provide members of the number theory community in the Southeast with an opportunity to learn about new and significant research in number theory and to disseminate their own research.  Students and junior researchers in the community particularly benefit from the meetings. The meetings strengthen their knowledge base, expose their work to a wider audience, and give them insightful input and feedback from other participants.

In addition, the research project aims to have concrete applications to field theory and quantization.  The project also aims to build a new arsenal of geometric techniques applicable to the theory of algebraic cycles, symplectic topology, and high energy physics.

The resolution of these questions will consolidate and demystify several existing quantization schemes in geometry, symplectic topology, and field theory. Three directions will be studied. The first aims to characterize those moduli spaces that admit a realization as the critical locus of a potential. The characterization requires the development of the formalism of shifted symplectic and Poisson structures in derived geometry and the theory of isotropic foliations. In the second project a new method will be investigated for constructing motivic orientation data on non-abelian cohomology by building explicit Lagrangian foliations and computing the associated potential functions.

In this situation, it is often very useful to classify all solutions up to the action of these symmetries, two solutions considered equivalent if they are related by a symmetry transformation. Within the field of algebraic geometry, the theory known as geometric invariant theory provides a very good answer to this classification question. There is reason to suspect that the methods of geometric invariant theory extend to a much broader context. In particle physics, the universe is described as a set of solutions of some equations up to the action of a very large set of symmetries. This project aims to broaden the methods and results of geometric invariant theory and bring them to bear on a large set of classification problems in algebraic geometry, including some of those studied in high energy physics.<br/><br/>This project envisions a new general approach to moduli problems in algebraic geometry. The main technical tool is a special kind of stratification on an algebraic stack called a theta stratification. Theta stratifications are a common generalization of the Kempf-Ness stratification studied in geometric invariant theory and the Harder-Narasimhan stratification of the moduli space of vector bundles on a curve. Classically these stratifications were used, in the case of smooth stacks, to study the Betti numbers of the moduli stack of semistable objects. The project will pursue several generalizations of these results to situations where the stack is not necessarily smooth, and to extracting more subtle topological information about the stack. Examples include wall-crossing formulas for integrals of tautological K-theory classes, and more generally extracting information about the derived category of coherent sheaves on the stack and the semistable locus."

The investigators have been investigating K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of threefolds, as well as GW and quasimap invariants of Nakajima quiver varieties.

This activity will bring together both senior and junior researchers in two overlapping fields of mathematics, namely hypergeometric motives and Calabi-Yau differential equations, to discuss recent developments and future directions in both areas. The topic of this program is related to the phenomenon of mirror symmetry and belongs to the cutting edge of number theory and mathematical physics at the same time. Families of Calabi--Yau varieties naturally arise in the context of mirror symmetry and often appear to be hypergeometric. On the other hand, hypergeometric motives are handy objects on which important standard conjectures could be tested and perhaps even some new features could be discovered. Expected participants of the program represent a wide variety of geographical locations and academic levels, including quite a few junior participants from the United States. In addition to theoretic developments, the workshop will foster the role of software Magma, SageMath, and Pari/GP in research. In return, the program will enhance the implementation of hypergeometric motives.<br/><br/>More particularly, the goals of the program are: to study general L-functions, which are central objects in number theory, using the L-functions of so-called hypergeometric motives as an important but more approachable class; and to investigate the arithmetic and geometry of families of Calabi--Yau manifolds, in particular the integrality and modularity phenomena arising in mirror symmetry. By the influential Langlands program, motivic L-functions are expected to coincide with L-functions arising from automorphic forms and consequently satisfy functional equations and can be continued analytically; in other words, they behave similarly to the classical Riemann zeta function. Already for many years much effort was spent on creation of a useful library of L-functions and automorphic forms, the most recent example being the LMFDB project (http://www.lmfdb.org/) sponsored by NSF. Since 2009 a group of reserachers led by Fernando Rodriguez Villegas (http://users.ictp.it/~villegas/hgm/index.html) was investigating and computing explicitly the L-functions of hypergeometric motives, which are expected to cover a wide range of known L-functions. They developed efficient computational techniques, most of which are already implemented in computer algebra software. Another step towards understanding the local factors of these L-functions was brought to the scene by investigating finite hypergeometric functions, understanding them as periods over finite fields and drawing analogies between them and classical hypergeometric functions. An overall expectation is that periods over finite fields form a new direction in understanding the integrality phenomenon arising in mirror symmetry. Originally discovered by physicists the mid-1980s, mirror symmetry remains one of the central research themes binding string theory and algebraic geometry. Numerous examples show that the expression of the mirror map in so-called canonical coordinates possesses rich arithmetic properties, such as modularity. This expression involves particular solutions to Picard--Fuchs differential equations attached to families of Calabi--Yau manifolds near a singular point. Explaining modularity is an ultimate goal on the arithmetic side of mirror symmetry. Quite remarkably, Calabi--Yau differential equations show up in several other contexts as diverse as rational approximations to pi, Mahler measures and generating functions of random walks in models of statistical mechanics.<br/><br/>More information can be found on the conference website:<br/>http://www.matrixatmelbourne.org.au/events/hypergeometric-motives-and-calabi-yau-differential-equations"

This research project investigates modular forms, which are central objects in number theory that occur throughout mathematics and physics. The work aims to broaden and deepen understanding in this fundamental area. The investigator plans to widen the impacts of the research program by continued mentoring of junior mathematicians and organization of national and international workshops and conferences.  <br/><br/>This project investigates the arithmetic of hypergeometric varieties and noncongruence modular forms. A majority of modular forms are noncongruence in the sense that their symmetry groups cannot be described in terms of congruences.  The link between the two topics of study is manifest by the fact that all algebraic curves defined over number fields can be realized as modular curves of finite index subgroups of the modular group. Modular forms are arithmetic invariants of the modular curves. Among all algebraic curves, the generalized Legendre curves are particularly amiable models for both theoretical and computational investigations. Hypergeometric varieties are higher dimensional analogues of the generalized Legendre curves. The objectives of this research project are: (1) to translate a class of classical hypergeometric formulas to the finite field setting; (2) to use these transformation formulas to compute arithmetic invariants of the hypergeometric varieties; (3) to obtain new automorphy results for Galois representations associated with noncongruence modular forms based on explicit Galois representations arising from hypergeometric varieties; and (4) to further investigate other properties of noncongruence modular forms, including a longstanding unbounded denominator conjecture."

This research project investigates the interrelations between the commutative and noncommutative settings, and the possible ways to study the latter via geometry and combinatorics. The geometric approach attaches structures, called Poisson manifolds, to noncommutative objects.

Both approaches will be used to carry out a detailed study of the properties and symmetries of noncommutative objects. In the opposite direction, the noncommutative objects will be shown to exhibit various forms of rigidity, which in turn will be used to address algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial problems of independent interest.

One direction of this program is the description of the automorphism groups and invariants, such as discriminants, of noncommutative algebras via Poisson geometry and cluster algebras. Another direction targets the study of the properties of Nichols algebras and quantum groups by realizing them as cluster algebras. The geometric and combinatorial approaches will be merged in the investigation of the topology of the spectra of quantum function algebras. Noncommutative projective spaces and Calabi-Yau algebras will be studied using techniques from cluster algebras.

The broader impacts of this workshop series will include the training of graduate students and the interdisciplinary results of the workshops which will be widely disseminated in the form of monographs/proceedings.

A dynamical system here stands for an abstract set of points together with an evolution law that governs the way points move over time. Such abstract dynamical systems form the basis for models of a wide range of important phenomena in science and engineering. It turns out that also many problems in mathematics concerning simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers can be understood in terms of the behavior of dynamical systems. Furthermore, systems that arise in this context are of algebraic nature, which makes it possible to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools for their investigation. This research project aims to advance the framework of algebraic dynamical systems in approximation theory, develop new methods, and obtain far-reaching generalizations of results in the field. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project and introduced to new methods and techniques in number theory and dynamics.  These students will also supervise research projects within the framework of the PRIMES program, an after-school research program for high school students. <br/><br/>During recent years there has been an influx of new ideas concerning connections between number theory and dynamical systems, making it possible to rethink a spectrum of possibilities for further work.

Two important and challenging dualities are Langlands duality, which has origins in number theory, and mirror symmetry, which was first discovered by theoretical physicists and is playing an increasingly important role in mathematics as well. Neither of these two dualities is fully understood. Both of these dualities will be studied in this project.

While these questions start innocuously, they quickly become complicated and the modern approach involves a combination of geometric ideas with techniques and conjectures from other areas of mathematics and physics. For example, in one of the topics for proposed research, the PI plans to investigate the relation between certain parameter spaces and questions in knot theory; in previous work, the PI proved a special case of such a relation, motivated by ideas from mathematical physics.  In the other research topics, the PI will study similar phenomena; in each case, one expects fruitful feedback in both directions and hopes that new techniques for studying these parameter spaces will develop as a consequence.  In addition to the research aspects of this proposal, the PI plans to apply support towards mathematics education at different levels. Planned support includes outreach for middle and high-school women, activities joint with Math for America, and graduate-level courses and summer-school lectures.<br/><br/>The focus of this proposal is to study topics in the enumerative geometry of moduli spaces of various objects in algebraic geometry (sheaves, curves, surfaces), as well as questions and applications coming from neighboring fields.  The first topic is Donaldson-Thomas theory, where the proposed projects involve extending techniques based on vanishing cycles, with the goal of proving longstanding geometric conjectures in the subject.  There are also proposed applications to the study of curve singularities and knot invariants.  The second topic is quantum cohomology of quiver varieties; here the PI, jointly with A. Okounkov, has a long-term project relating geometric questions to constructions from quantum groups.

Tensor triangular geometry promises to serve as an overarching theory that facilitates the transposition of techniques and methods from one specialized area to neighboring ones, providing conceptual unification among those fields. Moreover, it displays steadily expanding influence in mathematics. For instance, via tensor triangular geometry, the subject of tale topology in modern algebraic geometry now bears new applications in modular representation theory, where it provides answers to longstanding problems about the relations between representations of finite groups of order a power of a prime number and representations of arbitrary general finite groups.  This research project aims to broaden and deepen understanding in the field of tensor triangular geometry.<br/><br/>This project studies the geometry of tensor-triangulated categories as they appear in several areas of mathematics. Tensor-triangulated categories are now in common use in algebraic geometry, in modular representation theory, stable homotopy theory, and its equivariant versions, in motivic theory, in equivariant noncommutative topology, and beyond. This project aims to develop new methods in tensor triangular geometry, in order to study those many different incarnations from a unified perspective. In recent years, much progress has been made in tale extensions (i.e., separable and commutative extensions) of tensor-triangulated categories and on the related theory of descent. The present project builds on these and related results and aims to apply descent to connect the algebraic geometry of projective support varieties with the modular representation theory of finite groups. Some applications of these techniques can be spelled out in concrete terms without tensor-triangular technicalities. For instance, in work on endotrivial modules the investigator introduced ""weak homomorphisms."" It appears that the very same weak homomorphisms are connected to complex line bundles on the Brown simplicial complex of p-subgroups. Further investigation of their role in algebraic geometry is part of the current project. Another general theme of the project is the computation of the ""spectrum"" of a tensor-triangulated category. A new general approach for such computations comes through filtering tensor-triangulated categories and understanding the successive strata via tale extensions. An early prototype of this method has been applied to compute the spectrum of the equivariant stable homotopy category of a finite group. The project aims to transport those ideas to new examples."

It involves applying homotopy theory (a branch of algebraic topology) to study arithmetic and geometry,  using coarse aspects or invariants of spaces to study arithmetic phenomena.  A generalization of the number of d-dimensional holes in a space is used to control the solutions to certain polynomial equations. When d is equal to one, this has applications to a program of Grothendieck to control solutions using the loops on a space.  Maps between certain spaces induce maps between the d-dimensional holes giving rise to a notion of degree. A generalization of degree due to F. Morel is used to study arithmetic properties of singularities. This project furthermore includes the design and implementation of a series of four week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During each of four summers, approximately eight high school students will work on an important mathematical problem which has an elegant or useful known solution, learning the background material as necessary, and then creating learning materials for other students of the same age group. The students will be accompanied by a teacher from their high schools. In addition to the work on the specific mathematical problem, career options in mathematics will be presented and support and mentorship will be provided for students interested in pursuing mathematical careers.<br/><br/>Certain arithmetic and geometric phenomena which appear delicate are invariant under appropriate notions of homotopy. Such phenomena motivate the use of homotopy theory to study arithmetic or geometry. The sub-projects contained in this project share the perspective wherein problems in arithmetic or geometry are approached by using Morel-Veoveodky's A1-homotopy theory and applying realization functors. Sub-project 1 studies an enrichment of the Section Conjecture and an approach to proving it. Running the same methods backwards produces results on the differential graded algebra of the absolute Galois group. Sub-project 2 applies an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence in tale homotopy to compute (co)homology of branched covers. This has applications to the study of the non-abelian Galois representation given by the fundamental group of the projective line with three points removed, and has applications to sub-project 1. The first step of sub-project 3 is to prove a joint conjecture with Jesse Kass that the quadratic form appearing in the Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili Signature Formula can be interpreted as a local degree in A1-homotopy, where the natural notion of degree is a quadratic form. We then enrich the Milnor number and use this enrichment to study arithmetic properties of singularities."

The study of such equations dates back almost 2,000 years and is among the most difficult problems in all of mathematics, as evidenced by the fact that it was established only 45 years ago that it is not possible to devise a general process with a finite number of operations that can decide whether a Diophantine equation has a solution.  The bounds under development in this research project, which depend only on the degree of the equation (i.e., the size of the exponents), will advance knowledge in this fundamental area of mathematics.

These conditions generally involve a constraint on the Mordell-Weil rank. Using related methods, he will also attempt to prove the uniform Manin--Mumford conjecture, which gives a uniform bound (again in terms of the genus) on the size of a torsion packet on a hyperbolic curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.

Topological recursion is an emerging field of mathematics discovered independently in the study of random matrices and in studies of dynamics and geometry. The novelty of topological recursion is its universal applicability to many problems arising in areas of mathematics and quantum physics.  For example, Catalan numbers, simple combinatorial expressions that occur in various counting problems, have generalizations associated with surfaces of complicated structure that can be calculated effectively by topological recursion. The exact same formula computes important quantities arising in the study of quantum gravity. Topological recursion not only provides theoretical formulas for many concrete problems in mathematics and physics, but also furnishes a practical computational tool. The interplay between machine computation and mathematical proof has been a driving force for recent rapid development of the field, in which many outstanding conjectures have been resolved, while new mysteries have arisen, both on the theoretical front and in computer experiments.  This timely symposium, in which half of the invited speakers are early-career researchers, is aimed to further advance this exciting, rapidly-developing field.<br/><br/>Topological recursion is a new emerging field of mathematics developed in statistical mechanical study of random matrices. Independently, essentially the same structure of the theory was discovered in research on the volume of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces. Due to the simple nature of concrete recursive formulas, topological recursion relates many current research frontiers of mathematics in a novel and understandable way. For example, counting Hurwitz numbers, Gromov-Witten theory, Gaiotto's conjecture on opers arising from string theory, the WKB analysis of Schroedinger equations, and the relation between A-polynomials and colored Jones polynomials for knots and their generalizations are all deeply related through ideas stemming from topological recursion. The goal of the symposium is to promote interest among young researchers in this exciting research frontier and to significantly enhance the subject matter by disseminating recent progress and identifying important problems for future development.

The passage from local to global in number theory is deep, mysterious, and not well-understood.  This general philosophy can be made concrete through precise conjectures on values of L-series, which are certain functions defined in terms of the local behavior of mathematical structures.  These conjectures assert that the values of L-series at integers reveal global arithmetic invariants of the structures.  While there are plentiful and very general conjectures regarding special values of L-series, only special cases of the conjectures have been proven.  This research project aims to generalize these results and deepen understanding in this important area of number theory.<br/><br/>Some of the most important and well-known conjectures in number theory concern the special values of L-series, including the conjectures of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, Stark, Beilinson, and Bloch and Kato.  For example, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture predicts that the value at s=1 of the L-series defined in terms of the number of points on an elliptic curve over the integers modulo p for all primes p carries information on the size of the set of points of the elliptic curve over the rational numbers.  In many cases, the L-series in question have alternate manifestations known as p-adic L-series, which are defined by applying a different notion of analysis from that encountered in standard Euclidean geometry.  Special-value formulae for classical and p-adic L-series hold an important place at the center of modern number theory research. In this project, the investigator will continue to study conjectures on the special values of p-adic L-functions. The methods involve studying certain explicit families of Eisenstein series and build on work on the Iwasawa Main Conjecture.  The project aims to develop new techniques to prove p-adic special-value conjectures, as well as various generalizations and refinements."

The aim of the one-week summer school is to complement the traditional training that graduate students receive by exposing them to a constructive and computational approach to many objects in number  theory. This furthers their knowledge and gives the students additional tools for their research.  Furthermore, the school provides the students the opportunity to work closely with experts in the field.<br/><br/>The summer school is valuable to students for their careers as researchers and in their post-doctoral lives, since the event helps to create research communities. By meeting and working with other graduate students in their field, the students lay the foundation for future collaboration. In the years after the summer school, they will have opportunities to meet again at one of the regional conferences, including the Palmetto Number Theory Series and the South Eastern Meeting on Numbers. Additionally, by introducing the students to a computational approach to number theory, this project will enhance the next generation of mathematicians by increasing their ability to use computing technology in their research.<br/><br/>For more information, see  http://www.uncg.edu/math/numbertheory/summerschool/"

Speakers will give 30-minute research talks in various subfields of topology and algebra; these subfields include algebraic combinatorics, enumerative geometry, knot theory, and representation theory.  Two distinguished graduate students will give hour-long presentations and one invited faculty member, Dr. Abakuse Mbrika of the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, will give a one-hour keynote address.  Invited undergraduate researchers will participate in a poster session. USTARS promotes diversity within the mathematical community by providing a platform for collaboration and professional development.  Participants are exposed to a variety of current research, ideas, and results, and meet underrepresented professors and students who will become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Indeed, the conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and hence is well-positioned to encourage participation from a diverse group of students. The participants of the conference will continue to influence the next generation of students by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the symposium is to showcase the mathematical research being conducted by underrepresented graduate students. This is done by structuring the meeting so that speakers will give 30-minute parallel research talks focusing on research leading to their graduate theses. Graduate students will give at least 75% of these presentations. Topics of prior years' presentations include: combinatorics, braid groups, graph theory, knot theory, representation theory, number theory, and algebraic geometry. In addition to the parallel sessions, two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour lectures and a poster session featuring invited undergraduates is also planned. Given the high quality and diversity of talks and participants ""The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) Invited Volume"" was created in 2014. This is a new series aimed specifically at disseminating the research of USTARS participants. The intention of this Invited Volume is to provide graduate students with an opportunity to publish their results in order to further their development as mathematical researchers. In light of this, a yearly online volume will be published at the conclusion of each annual research symposium.<br/><br/>http://www.ustars.org"

This project concerns string theory, one of the most vibrant areas of research at this interface.  As we explore the boundaries of the regime of validity of string theory and address some of its theoretical shortcomings and the conditions of its peaceful co-existence with the theory of gravity, we rely on increasingly sophisticated mathematical models. F-theory is one of the most geometric corners of string theory and relies on elliptic fibrations to geometrically engineer models for particle physics and gravity at very high energy. This project explores the mathematics that governs the physics of F-theory in order to bring new insights to the mathematics of elliptic fibrations. Elliptic fibrations are geometric spaces that locally look like a long-exposure picture of an elliptic curve moving over another space. Elliptic curves are some of the oldest but yet most prominent objects across mathematics. They are studied in algebraic geometry and number theory and play a central role in representation theory, cryptography (where they are used to secure internet's transactions), computer modeling, and theoretical physics. This multi-disciplinary project will explore connections between these mathematical and physical concepts and will also encourage graduate students both in mathematics and physics to study problems at the interface of physics and mathematics. The PI will also reach out to students from underrepresented groups to inspire them to participate in the scientific endeavor. <br/><br/>Geometric engineering is the construction of physical systems by geometric methods. This is a natural approach in the context of string theory, where the geometry of extra dimensions and the dualities between different formulation and regimes of the theory allow for a geometric formulation of many physical constraints. This project focuses on the geometry of elliptic fibrations as seen from the point of view of string theory, with strong interest in their topology, arithmetic properties, and connection to gauge theories, Grand Unified Theories, and topological defects. The research will also address the problem of resolution of singularities of Weierstrass models and its connection to Mori's theory and representation theory and will explore the structure of the singular fibers of elliptic fibrations over higher dimensional spaces. The PI will also study the physics of topological defects such as cosmic string solutions using new models of elliptic fibrations. A central theme of this project is the prominent role of singularities, their resolutions, and their topological invariants."

One of the central problems in modern theoretical physics is to construct a mathematically consistent theory of fundamental interactions. The paradigm for this construction is known as quantum field theory. An underlying theme of the research is the role of the boundary of ""space-time."" One way to think about this is the usual evolution of time over a finite interval. In this case the boundary of space-time is the union of the space at the initial time and at the target time. Quantum field theory on a space-time with boundary is important not only for high energy physics, but also for low energy physics, for example insulators and other states of matter where the surface (the boundary) has distinguishing physical properties. This project will develop algebraic tools to study two and three dimensional quantum field theories. It will also construct quantum field theories with infinite dimensional symmetries.<br/><br/>The proposal consists of three parts. The common theme is the effect of the boundary on local quantum field theory and on local spacial models in statistical mechanics. The first part is focused on representation theory. The main goals are to connect coideal subalgebras to boundary q-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation by studying vertex operators for principal series representations of the corresponding quantum affine algebras; to study integrable systems on symmetric spaces; and to construct invariants of knots with flat connections in the complement using R-matrix intertwining representations of quantum sl(2) at roots of unity and construct the corresponding invariants of 3-manifolds via surgery. In the second part the goals are to construct perturbative topological quantum field theories, which involves constructing perturbative topoplogical quantum field theory for manifolds with boundary; and to construct semiclassical asymptotic for q-6j symbols for simple Lie algebras of rank grater then one. The goal of the third part is the study of limit shapes in statistical mechanics. This part is closely related to the second part and can be regarded as the study of the semiclassical limit of spin models in statistical mechanics. The main concept is that the thermodynamical limit is similar to the semiclassical limit. The models in question involve the stochastic 6-vertex model, ASEP models and others."

At its core, algebraic geometry is the study of geometric spaces cut out by solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. The subject goes back to Greek antiquity on the one hand, while its modern development provides the mathematical foundation for current efforts to understand the physics of the early universe. For theoretical physics, the most relevant area of algebraic geometry is moduli theory, which deals with the classificaiton and deformation properties of important geometric objects of the same type. The current project will investigate moduli theory of sheaves, objects which correspond to the notion of physical (gauge) fields, such as the electromagnetic field. Mathematical invariants associated with moduli spaces of sheaves calculate amplitudes of high-energy processes in particle physics. Studying the structure of these invariants therefore bears on essential questions in both geometry and high-energy physics; the completion of this project will thus improve our understanding of both mathematics and theoretical physics. The endeavor fits in the important current research goal of setting needed mathematical foundations to contemporary theoretical physics.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the study of the geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves on low-dimensional varieties, including the important setting when the variety is allowed to vary in moduli. In particular, the virtual intersection theory of Grothendieck Quot schemes over K3 surfaces, in a relative setting, will be used to study the tautological Chow ring of the moduli space of quasipolarized K3 surfaces. Special Chow classes, such as the Chern classes of Verlinde sheaves over the moduli space, will also be investigated. More generally, the virtual intersection theory of higher-rank Grothendieck Quot schemes over an arbitrary surface will be used to deduce results on the structure of important invariants on fundamental spaces such as Hilbert schemes of points. The higher-rank Quot scheme geometry also bears interesting connections to questions in representation theory."

This project will apply methods from geometric representation theory to first reduce the computation of certain integrals that arise in the Langlands program to a discrete problem in combinatorial geometry, and then to study the solution of this latter problem.  The results are expected to deepen and extend understanding in number theory and geometric representation theory, areas of mathematics with connections to many other subjects, including cyber security and physics.<br/><br/>In work already completed, the investigator has succeeded in reducing the computation of certain orbital integrals to the problem of counting rational points of tale Hessenberg varieties over finite fields.

The second project develops homological algebra methods for new geometric settings. For a variety embedded in something other than projective space, free resolutions often fail to provide sharp connections with geometry; this project will develop homological machinery better suited to toric geometry.

The research will investigate how hyper-Khler manifolds degenerate, or break into simpler pieces. The investigator will first study how the known examples degenerate, to infer general patterns, and will then work to reverse the process to construct new examples. The work will make use of mirror symmetry, a remarkable correspondence between pairs of geometric spaces discovered by physicists. For hyper-Khler manifolds, mirror symmetry can be understood quite explicitly. This provides information about degenerations of hyper-Khler manifolds, for example, the combinatorial way in which the different pieces fit together.<br/><br/>This award supports research at the interface between algebraic geometry and differential geometry on hyper-Khler manifolds, which are important in geometry and theoretical physics. Only a few types of examples are known, and previous constructions have been based on classical algebraic geometry. The investigator will use new techniques coming from mirror symmetry, cluster algebras, and deformation theory to produce new examples, or alternatively, to discover tangible obstructions to their existence. In prior collaborative work, he developed a geometric interpretation of cluster algebras in terms of toric and birational geometry. These geometric spaces, called cluster varieties, are expected to form the building blocks of degenerations of hyper-Khler manifolds. In subsequent collaborative work, the investigator studied mirror symmetry for cluster varieties. This involves piecewise linear geometric structures that can be used to understand how to glue cluster varieties together to form a hyper-Khler manifold."

One can consider higher dimensional versions of this type of question: for example, how many Pythagorean triples (positive integers with x^2+y^2=z^2) with hypotenuse at most Z have area with at most 10 prime factors?  This particular question can be phrased in terms of counting points (x,y,z) for which xy/2 has at most 10 prime factors in an orbit of a certain group acting on (3,4,5).  In this problem, the group involved is ""big"" and one can use classical methods to approach it.  However, in the case where the underlying group is ""thin"" (as it is in the beautiful theory of Apollonian packings), one must appeal to much more modern tools, namely the Affine Sieve developed by Bourgain-Gamburd-Sarnak in 2011.  The PI proposes to study not only the arithmetic properties of orbits of specific interesting groups (such as the Apollonian group), but also to investigate properties of thin groups in general: for example, how does one tell if a given matrix group is thin?  Should one expect a random finitely generated matrix group to be thin?  These questions toy with undecidability and require an intricate combination of tools from various fields -- geometry, number theory, combinatorics -- to tackle.  In addition the PI proposes to develop several computer programs to determine the answers to some of these and related questions with high accuracy.<br/><br/>Thin subgroups of GL(n,Z) are those which are of infinite index in the Z-points of their Zariski closure in GL(n,C).  In contrast to arithmetic groups, the counterparts to thin groups which are prevalent, say, in the theory of automorphic forms, there are many unanswered core questions on thin groups which are essential in applications to the number theory of thin groups.   A pressing such question is how to tell if a given finitely generated group is thin, as well as whether thin groups are generic in some sense.  These two questions have been answered in a few situations, and the PI proposes to answer them in much higher generality.  The PI seeks to answer these questions in the subclass of thin monodromy groups.  Furthermore, the PI's proposed program will delve deeply into the geometry inherent to the groups in question, proving various theorems on thin groups which will bring them more in line with what is known on arithmetic groups.  The PI also seeks to develop various computer algorithms which would predict various properties of a group given its generators, from Zariski density to thinness.  Keeping in mind that the motivation for the current interest in thin groups stems from number theory, the PI also proposes to work on the arithmetic side of thin groups, generalizing some of the PI's previous results about the Apollonian group to a much larger class of groups."

A great wealth of such connections have been found indirectly through intermediate objects of an analytic nature.  The research outlined in the proposal aims to provide a window through which well-known conjectures and statements of arithmetic may be seen in a new and more direct light.<br/><br/>The PI has conjectured an intricate but explicit relationship between modular symbols and the arithmetic of cyclotomic fields that may be viewed as refining the Iwasawa main conjecture.

The relevant formulae are usually bridges relating analysis to algebra, two different areas of mathematics. The most elementary example of such a formula is Euler's formula about the value of the Riemann zeta-function at 2. In plain terminology, it asserts that the summation of the reciprocals of the squares of all positive integers, is exactly equal to the square of (pi/2). Here pi=3.14159... is the usual ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Besides their significant impact in mathematics, such formulae are also perfect topics that can be used to popularize mathematics to the world.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to prove two formulae about L-functions in number theory. The first one is the Colmez conjecture for CM abelian varieties, and the second one is a formula for the modular heights of quaternionic Shimura curves. The methods proposed by the PI are significant extensions of his previous joint works on the Gross-Zagier formula and the averaged Colmez conjecture. They involve the theories of automorphic forms, Shimura varieties and Arakelov geometry, and the study of the formulae will enable us to better understand the profound interactions of these areas."

The utility of group theory has been greatly expanded by advances in computation.

Research in number theory has a long history going back to the ancient Greeks. Recently research in number theory has made significant advances and has made important applications to other areas such as physics, computing, and data security. One such advance has been on gaps between prime numbers. The conference will feature three lectures by James Maynard on this topic. The conference continues a 15-year tradition at the University of Florida of conferences in number theory. There will be over thirty 40-minute and several 20-minute research presentations. Special effort will be given to support undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, women and minority participants, and those who have no other support.<br/><br/>The conference will cover the following topics: q-Series, partitions and modular forms, analytic number theory, and algebraic number theory. Historically the synergy between analytic number theory and the combinatorial/algebraic world of partitions and q-series has been extremely fruitful, starting with the collaboration of Hardy and Ramanujan. Throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first,  we have seen each area enrich the other. For example, mid-twentieth century workers like Dyson and Atkin found fruitful interactions between these two areas, and the potential for further interactions along these lines by the  participants in this conference is significant and tantalizing.  The talks and papers of the conference will be widely disseminated by making presentations and abstracts available on the conference web page and by publishing a refereed conference proceedings.

This research project studies Iwasawa theory, a branch of number theory. It relates integral and rational solutions of polynomial equations to certain analytic objects known as L-functions. The project exploits novel approaches to this study, which combine new tools from the Langlands program and algebraic geometry. The new approaches have been used to prove that a majority of elliptic curves satisfy the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, whose general truth is still a challenging open question in number theory.  This research project aims to expand the set of elliptic curves known to satisfy the conjecture.<br/><br/>More concretely, this project studies the relationships between special values of L-functions and certain arithmetic objects, namely the Selmer groups of Galois representations. For a prime number p the main problems under study are the Iwasawa main conjectures and p-adic Bloch-Kato conjectures. The project develops a new approach towards non-ordinary Iwasawa theory: first to study Greenberg type Iwasawa main conjectures that are accessible to proof due to their ordinary nature, and then to relate them to non-ordinary Iwasawa theory using explicit reciprocity laws of special cycles. The ultimate goal is to prove, for all GL(2) modular forms (of any weight and possibly with ramification at p): the p-part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula in the case when analytic rank is 1 or 0; the Iwasawa main conjecture; and that the vanishing of central critical L-value implies the corresponding Selmer group has rank at least 1. The project also aims to study these problems for higher rank motives, especially those associated to cusp forms on unitary groups."

Classical problems in number theory include questions about the distribution of prime numbers, representations of a number as a sum of squares, and counting the number of lattice points in a circle or polygon in the plane.  These questions have applications to such varied fields as cryptography, integer programming, complexity theory, and numerical integration.  This research project will study several related questions through the unifying perspective of Dirichlet series in several complex variables.  Integrated with the research activities will be continued mentorship of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The investigator will introduce these students to research-level mathematics through supervised research projects.<br/><br/>This research project will investigate number-theoretic problems in four different areas, unified by the common theme of naturally occurring multiple Dirichlet series. The research in the first area, zeta functions of prehomogeneous vector spaces (PVS), is particularly timely due to the recent resurgence of interest in this field.  A second topic is the study certain period integrals of Eisenstein series. Arithmetic consequences include explicit formulas for representation numbers of quadratic forms, which can in turn be reinterpreted as formulas for counting integral points on certain flag varieties. In a third direction, hyperbolic Fourier expansions of Eisenstein series motivate the construction of different type of multiple Dirichlet series which count totally positive elements in the ring of integers of a totally real number field. This can be reinterpreted as a lattice point counting problem in irrational polytopes. Fourthly, the project will study new types of subgroup growth and subring growth zeta functions.  While this work should stimulate new research in subgroup growth, the initial motivation for study of these objects comes from complexity theory and lattice cryptography."

Oftentimes mathematical models of natural phenomena come equipped with a large group of symmetries, and the main goal of the current project is to develop techniques that employ the symmetry in order to reveal both qualitative and quantitative features of the models. The questions and the methods are strongly influenced by classical algebraic geometry, which analyzes the models from a geometric perspective, by representation theory, which is an algebraic study of symmetry, and by D-module theory, which is an algebraic perspective on the infinitesimal study of the models. Computer experimentation is important for the success of the project. The investigator, together with students and collaborators, will develop and disseminate the necessary computer algebra software and will make available the results of experimentation that are of general interest.<br/><br/>This research project investigates a number of open questions concerning fundamental invariants associated to algebraic varieties endowed with a large group of symmetries, by analyzing the implications of the symmetries to the structure of the invariants. The main emphasis will be on the study of syzygies and local cohomology groups, with a view towards understanding further invariants such as regularity and projective dimension, cohomological dimension and arithmetic rank, or Lyubeznik numbers and Bernstein-Sato polynomials. The project will combine methods from commutative algebra and classical algebraic geometry, as well as techniques from representation theory and the theory of D-modules. For instance, the investigator will explore the D-module structure of the local cohomology groups associated to natural stratifications of the spaces of binary forms. On a separate note, the investigator will research the connections between syzygies of ideals in rings of polynomial functions on spaces of matrices, and representations of general linear Lie superalgebras."

Often, the most effective method to solve a problem is to create a mathematical model. Frequently, such models involve unknown parameters related by several equations that are often impossible to solve exactly. Commutative algebra is the qualitative study of such systems of polynomial equations. Its applications are far-reaching and include diverse fields such as computer science, cryptography, coding theory, robotics, pattern recognition, and theoretical physics. One can study the sets of solutions of these systems either geometrically or algebraically. This project deals with the algebraic approach. One of the goals of the project is to understand the smallest number of equations needed to describe a geometric object like a curve or surface. Another is to construct the system of equations defining a given geometric object. A third goal is the study of the relations among a given set of polynomial equations, the relations among the relations, and so on. The project involves undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in the research. <br/><br/>This research project has three main themes. The first is to develop criteria for a variety in projective space to be a set-theoretic complete intersection. A fundamental tool to solve this problem is the theory of local cohomology modules. Local cohomology modules encode the algebraic and topological structure of an algebraic variety. As modules over the ring, local cohomology modules are huge (neither finitely generated nor Artinian), hence intractable. However, as modules over the Weil algebra they can be filtered by simple objects and become manageable. Hence an important task is to understand the D-module structure of local cohomology modules. The second theme is the study of local rings using the notion of distance. This notion was introduced in recent work of the investigator and collaborators to understand the integral closure of ideals. The idea is to use distance as a substitute for shifts in homogeneous resolutions and for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of graded modules. The main goal is to prove general results that are inspired by statements in the graded case. The last theme is to study the implicit equations defining the graph and the image of rational maps between projective spaces. This is a classical problem in elimination theory, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry with applications, for instance, in geometric modeling."

The present project is related to both these topics: one of its aims is to use geometry of infinite dimensional spaces to answer questions motivated by Langlands duality; another one is to exploit more classical, finite dimensional geometric objects and their quantization to study representations.<br/><br/>The project will advance the representation theory of quantized symplectic resolutions by applying ideas of mirror symmetry and Langlands duality.

The main goals of this research project are to use tools from linear algebra and geometry to better understand and exploit natural symmetries enjoyed by symplectic varieties known as symplectic resolutions. The work is expected to strengthen connections of the field with geometric representation theory, combinatorics, and string theory.<br/><br/>In more detail, this research project consists of four interrelated subprojects. The first subproject is to study symplectic duality between pairs of symplectic resolutions. This duality is closely related to mirror duality for 3-dimensional gauge theories. The second subproject is to prove a conjecture relating the intersection cohomology of a symplectic cone to the quantum cohomology of its symplectic resolution. The third subproject is to classify hypertoric varieties using zonotopal tilings, much in the same way that toric varieties are classified by fans. The fourth subproject is to study a new invariant of a matroid called its Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial."

Algebraic geometry is the mathematical study of spaces described by arbitrary algebraic equations. Fundamental investigation of such diverse scientific disciplines as high energy physics, cryptography, phylogenetics, robotics, or control theory, often reveals that key concepts of the discipline can be encoded in terms of such geometric spaces. In some cases, such interactions suggest deep new problems in algebraic geometry whose solution is necessary for further progress. In other instances, the scientific intuition actually suggests new methods for solving old problems in algebraic geometry that were otherwise inaccessible. String theory and quantum field theory (QFT) explore physics at the smallest length scales, or correspondingly at the highest energy levels.
