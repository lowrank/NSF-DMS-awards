Algebraic geometry has significant applications in coding, industrial control, and computation. But the topics of this project are more closely related to applications in theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as a piece of the fine structure of our universe. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli theory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is manifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own right. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of ""organisms"" as itself being an ""organism"" is not just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. The other topic studied in this project is birational geometry, which is devoted to a certain abstract relationship, called birational equivalence, among algebraic varieties, which lies at the foundation of algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>The investigator will continue studying problems in moduli theory; the main foci of the project are Moduli spaces of stable logarithmic maps and Artin fans. Additional topics include the degeneration formula for KKO invariants, the birational geometry of torus quotients, and logarithmic Kodaira dimensions of fibered powers in relation to uniformity of stably integral points."

Furthermore, fundamental and interesting objects can often be described using polynomial equations (for example, consider the familiar equation for a circle).  Though polynomials are based upon some of the most elementary operations (namely, addition and multiplication), they are able to describe a rich variety of phenomena, and can sometimes behave in mysterious and complicated ways.  This research project concerns the mathematical field of commutative algebra, that is, the study of polynomial equations.  This field has many important applications; for example, it is used in cryptography and physics.  The broad goal of this project is to understand mathematical structures that arise in the study of polynomial equations.  Many of the methods employed in the research project involve techniques from other areas of mathematics.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to advance the understanding of some fundamental objects in commutative algebra.  In particular, it aims to shed light on the structure of local cohomology modules, rings of mixed characteristic, Bernstein-Sato polynomials, and singularities in characteristic p.  The investigator is especially motivated by the deep connections between these topics.  The project seeks to do the following: (1) to study local cohomology modules using group actions and D-module theory;  (2) to use the Lyubeznik numbers (and variants introduced recently by the investigator and collaborator) to compare rings of equal characteristic and mixed characteristic, and to understand rings of mixed characteristic; and (3) to find explicit formulas for F-thresholds and use these to produce roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial.  The techniques employed use invariant theory, noncommutative algebra, and combinatorics."

By contrast, linear algebra, a fundamental tool of the sciences, is the study of linear systems of equations. Often linear equations do not suffice to describe complex systems, and higher degree polynomials must be used. Commutative algebras provide models, called rings, of systems of polynomial equations where one can add and multiply. The rings studied in this proposal usually come from a system of polynomial equations.  By studying the properties of this model, one can then better understand the original system of equations. There are two main methods. One is to understand the theory of modules over such rings. Modules are a type of special representation of spaces where the equations hold. Studying these models has been an extremely effective way to study equations. The other main technical method is to study the same basic equations in rings which are reduced modulo a prime number. In such a system, arithmetic becomes easier. For instance modulo 2 means that every even number is thought of as 0, and all odd numbers as 1. This has a number of profound advantages which are used throughout this project. This project has a substantial educational component. The PI has served as PhD advisor and postdoc mentor to many researchers, and will continue this level of activity.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate several aspects of commutative algebras which all fall under the rubric of uniformity.  Three fundamental questions on symbolic powers of ideals and their relationship to regular powers are proposed. Significant partial results have been obtained. The PI will also investigate a fundamental question of Stillman concerning the complexity of equations.  A variety of other problems will be studied, including classification of Golod rings, existence of rigid modules, the structure of iterated socles, and the development of Frobenius Betti numbers and their properties. Several of the projects are intended for collaboration with graduate students, postdocs, and young researchers."

An algebra is a fundamental object throughout mathematics. One use of algebras is to encode information about geometric structures. Many algebras arising in mathematics and physics are noncommutative, i.e., the product of two elements depends on the order in which elements are multiplied. The PI will investigate noncommutative algebras that are related to noncommutative geometry and noncommutative invariant theory.<br/><br/>The research of the principal investigator lies in two subfields of noncommutative algebra entitled Noncommutative Projective Algebraic Geometry (NCPAG) and Noncommutative Invariant Theory (NCIT). The first area was launched in the 1980s to examine algebras, especially the three-dimensional Sklyanin algebras Skly3, whose ring-theoretic behavior could not be determined using purely algebraic techniques. The PI plans to continue using techniques of NCPAG to establish results on Skly3 and on algebras arising in physics and Lie theory, such as the Virasoro algebra and other related algebras.  The goal of the second area of research, NCIT, is to extend results in classical invariant theory to a noncommutative setting. To do so, we replace an action of a group on a commutative polynomial ring by an action of a Hopf algebra (or quantum group) on a noncommutative regular algebra that shares homological properties with its commutative counterpart. Although it is difficult for a Hopf algebra to act on an algebra, the PI has works in progress on actions of Hopf algebras on commutative domains, on their quantizations, and on algebras arising from NCPAG. The PI also intends to continue to contribute results on algebras arising from these actions, such as invariant subrings and smash product algebras. This will lead to new examples of algebras whose representation theory merit further investigation."

Algebraic varieties -- geometric objects defined by equations -- play a central role in many parts of mathematics, including its most applied areas. For example, special algebraic varieties called elliptic curves are used in algorithms to encrypt data for transmission and for efficient digital signatures. In its most basic form, an elliptic curve is a curve defined by a certain type of polynomial equation in two variables. Historically number theorists have been interested in finding solutions of these equations in which the variables take values that are either whole numbers or fractions. The investigator will study some new questions about points on algebraic varieties, and the connections between these points and other mathematical objects and concepts.<br/><br/>Some of the most basic and important questions in number theory are about rational points on varieties. These questions include connections with L-functions, such as the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. In this project the investigator plans to use many different techniques, including algebraic, p-adic, and analytic tools, to study various aspects of these questions. One set of questions to be studied includes refined class number formulas over number fields and higher rank Kolyvagin systems. In previous work of the investigator, Kolyvagin systems have proved to be a very useful tool for relating L-values and arithmetic.  In another direction, the investigator plans to use Selmer groups of twists of abelian varieties to study how the set of rational points on a curve changes when the base field is increased."

The fundamental problem in algebraic geometry is the study and classification of geometric objects given by solutions to polynomial equations. This research project focuses more specifically on the application of the tools and techniques used in algebraic geometry to study equations arising from algebraic number theory. The study of such equations has a rich history and can be traced back to Diophantus, who first studied solutions to what are today called Diophantine equations. Because of their diversity, the study of such equations has led to numerous applications in fields such as biology, chemistry, cosmology, and computer encryption. The general strategy towards classification of such arithmetic objects is to associate various invariants to the given geometric objects. One example of such an invariant is a set of complex numbers, usually known as periods, associated to a given polynomial system. A central focus of this research project to study which complex numbers can arise as periods of various objects appearing in algebraic geometry. The project also contributes to the training of the next generation of researchers by engaging postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students in research.<br/><br/>In this project, the principal investigator intends to study periods arising from the theory of algebraic varieties. The study of periods is in fact a shadow of some foundational questions in the theory of motives and algebraic cycles. The PI intends to pursue three broad projects dealing with such questions. In the first project, The PI studies periods of vector bundles with connections. Periods arise when the rational structures on two different cohomology groups are compared. This project attempts to generalize to higher dimensions results on the periods of irregular connections in the case of curves. The second project deals with giving explicit constructions of mixed Tate motives. In previous work, the PI constructed such motives from the higher homotopy of algebraic varieties. An explicit outcome of this project will be to compute the periods and Galois modules coming from these higher homotopy motives. In addition to these projects, the PI also plans to use K-theory to study the deformation theory of algebraic cycles as well as the behavior of algebraic cycles under extension of base fields. The last project attempts to apply methods in algebraic geometry to the study of infinite dimensional representations of certain p-adic algebraic groups, and is an excellent example of an application of algebraic geometry to other areas of mathematics."

Geometry flowered in the third and fourth centuries BC with the study of conic sections by the Greeks; more recent approaches related these geometric objects to quadratic equations.  Algebraic geometry is the more general study of geometric objects using polynomials.

The workshop is known for its inclusive, supportive atmosphere. Historically, about half of the presentations are given by mathematicians at early stages of their careers. Additionally, the workshop has a long history of involving women and members of other underrepresented groups in the automorphic forms community and facilitating the establishment of research connections.  The workshop has led to many collaborations and research papers. Moreover, the workshop traditionally includes panel discussions on topics designed to further the mathematical careers of junior participants. This award supports participation in the workshop of twenty early-career U.S.-based mathematicians, including students.  Additional information can be found at the workshop's website: automorphicformsworkshop.org.<br/><br/>Automorphic forms, in all of their various guises, are of central importance in modern number theory and illuminate deep connections between number theory and other mathematical disciplines including coding theory, mathematical physics, representation theory and topology. Some of the most remarkable mathematical breakthroughs of the 20th century, for instance Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, made extensive use of automorphic forms. Moreover, several celebrated conjectures, such as those of Langlands and Bloch-Kato, are automorphic in nature. Many important classes of automorphic forms have only recently been discovered, for instance the harmonic Maass forms and mock modular forms that underlie Ramanujan's mock theta functions. The 29th AFW will feature talks on all aspects of automorphic forms with a special emphasis on mock modular forms and their applications.  The workshop will highlight recent developments in the field and catalyze future research progress."

There is a long tradition of interaction between commutative algebra and algebraic topology, and commutative algebra and representation theory. Techniques and concepts that arose and were developed in one field have driven developments in the other. Regrettably, opportunities for building and fostering collaborations, especially among graduate students and  younger researchers, from the three subjects (or indeed any two of them) have been all too rare, especially in the U.S. The three subjects have witnessed remarkable changes and developments in the last decade, and the CRM program comes at an opportune moment. This NSF award will fund the travel of younger researchers (graduate students, recent PhDs, and junior faculty) at U.S. institutions to participate in some of the key events of the program. This will provide them with a unique opportunity to learn about current research in these fields and the interactions between fields; discuss ideas with one another, and begin collaborations on future research.<br/><br/>The topics to be covered by the CRM program, and in particular the advanced courses and workshops: matrix factorizations, maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules; cluster algebras and cluster categories; cohomological theory of support varieties; and tilting theory, to name a few, are at the intersection of several important and rapidly developing areas of mathematics, each subject benefitting from advances in the others. The CRM program will bring together leading researchers in each of these subjects, and one can be optimistic that this will lead to the new insights and developments in them. The highlights of the program include two, week-long, advanced courses, one in February 2015, titled (Re)emerging methods in Commutative Algebra and Representation Theory, and another in April 2015, titled Building bridges between Algebra and Topology. Each will be followed by a week-long workshop. Additionally, a conference is scheduled for  25--29th May, 2015."

The algebraic geometry community has developed the now longstanding tradition of running an institute every ten years with the purpose of convening a majority of practitioners in the world to overview the developments of the past decade and to outline the most pressing and far-reaching problems for the next.  The next AMS Summer Institute in Algebraic Geometry will take place at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, on July 13-31, 2015. Increasingly, algebraic geometry has become so diverse and technically demanding that it is daunting for graduate students and postdocs to master the techniques and wide range of activity that occurs in the field beyond their immediate areas of study. It has thus become imperative to run a ""boot camp"" in the week preceding the institute designed exclusively for advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The purpose of the boot camp is threefold:<br/>1) To familiarize the participants with a broad range of developments in algebraic geometry in an informal setting, thus increasing their ability to follow discussions and participate at the institute.<br/>2) To introduce young algebraic geometers to their peers and the previous generation of experts in order to increase collaborations and form a support group for young researchers.<br/>3) To introduce young researchers to new techniques and questions in order to make them more effective researchers.<br/> <br/>The boot camp will focus on several subjects in algebraic geometry that have seen significant advances in the last decade, including birational geometry, Bridgeland stability, the Hassett-Keel program, p-adic Hodge theory, Shimura varieties, perfectoid spaces, the tautological ring of the moduli spaces of curves, Boij-Soderbeg theory, and singularities in characteristic p. The choices of topics are results of coordination with the organizers of the AMS Summer Institute in Algebraic Geometry. The boot camp will have wide-ranging broader impacts as it will introduce the most dynamic and brightest young algebraic geometry graduate students and postdocs to each other. It is expected that many new collaborations will result from this interaction. In addition to the scientific benefits, young researchers will form a support network of their peers, which can significantly improve retention and success in the STEM disciplines.

The systems of interest typically involve many equations and many variables, and it is essential to look for ways to simplify them.  One way to do this is by tuning certain parameters to zero; if done carefully, the resulting system retains many properties of the original one, and may be more amenable to analysis.  Another way to simplify is to look for symmetry in the set of solutions, and take advantage of this to reduce the problem and extract information about the original solution set from a smaller set.  These techniques, respectively known as ""degeneration"" and ""equivariant localization"", can be used in concert: for example, one may degenerate to a system possessing extra symmetry.  This project will use these methods to study several problems of interest in enumerative geometry.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to study the geometry of algebraic varieties with group actions using equivariant and degeneration techniques.  The PI will study flag varieties, Schubert varieties, and toric varieties using methods from equivariant cohomology, as well as the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies.  Motivating problems are to determine criteria for a variety to admit a flat degeneration to a toric variety, and to produce a wider class of examples where the Newton-Okounkov body can be computed explicitly.  The PI will also continue his study of degeneracy loci, and investigate their finer geometric properties by developing the combinatorics of diagrams for signed permutations.

The finer distribution of prime numbers, such as whether they end in certain blocks of digits more often than others, is captured by highly structured oscillating sequences known as Dirichlet characters, which give rise to the associated L-functions. This project will prove analytic results about certain special values of L-functions and sums of the values of Dirichlet characters, and it will specifically investigate the impact of the underlying modulus being composed of many smaller factors on these results and on the tools available to prove them. As a prototype of the other class of objects to be studied, signals and motions (such as light waves or vibrations of a string) are often much better understood when viewed as combinations, or superpositions, of simple periodic motions. The wave-like functions that analogously serve as building blocks of analysis on other spaces are known as eigenfunctions and are central in disciplines ranging from spectral geometry to quantum mechanics. This project will investigate the behavior of rapidly oscillating eigenfunctions on spaces with a rich set of symmetries that are arithmetic in nature, in particular how pronounced are their extreme values.<br/><br/>This research project centers around two principal themes, that of extremal behavior of high-energy eigenfunctions on arithmetic manifolds and that of the depth and smooth aspects in analytic number theory. On certain arithmetic manifolds with a specific geometric and functorial structure, the joint eigenfunctions (Hecke--Maass eigenforms) exhibit power growth, which is neither generically expected nor predicted by physical models. The PI will seek out extremal growth and investigate in detail the sup-norm and restriction norm problems on several specific classes of arithmetic manifolds to inform general conjectures and understanding of the phenomenon of concentration of mass on arithmetic manifolds, the precise structure that drives it, and its place within the framework of the correspondence principle of quantum mechanics. In number-theoretic problems involving characters and automorphic forms of large level, the depth and smooth aspects, which are concerned with highly powerful or factorable conductors, play a very distinctive role. The structural impact of the powerful or factorable structure on nonvanishing, subconvexity, and moments of L-functions, as well as exponential sums involving p-adically analytic fluctuations will be studied using non-archimedean analysis, analytic number theory, and spectral theory."

This research focuses on spaces given by the set of points that satisfy certain polynomial equations in many variables. Since many phenomena can be described in terms of polynomial equations, these spaces appear in many fields of science and its applications. In such spaces most points are what is called ""smooth"", which, roughly speaking, means that after zooming in, their vicinity looks like a linear space. For instance, in a sphere every point is smooth and, just as the Earth, from a very close view its neighborhood looks like a plane. Then, those points that are not smooth present a particular behavior and, for that reason, are called ""singular points"". For instance, a cone has exactly one singular point at its vertex. The set of singular points can be described in terms of the derivatives of the polynomial equations that the points in the space satisfy. For many purposes, detecting singularities is not enough, as some are worse than others. For instance, the sharper vertices of cones are considered worse. To distinguish different singularities, one needs to use more sophisticated algebraic techniques. This research project seeks to study singularities using local cohomology modules, which can be seen as algebraic objects associated to a point. This has already proven to be a powerful tool to detect different kinds of singularities. The Principal Investigator plans to use local cohomology to study measurements of how bad a singular point is. The research includes long-standing problems in the study of singularities as well as new conjectures that could have theoretical and computational consequences. The project involves graduate students in the research. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigator seeks to study the structure of local cohomology modules and singularities in positive and mixed characteristic. One of the main problems that one encounters while working with local cohomology modules is that they are usually very large and difficult to handle. However, these modules behave as if they were finitely generated over regular local rings that contain a field. An example of a regular ring in mixed characteristic for which injective dimension behaves differently from equal characteristic was recently found. Motivated by this result, the Principal Investigator intends to explore potential counter-examples for the properties regarding associated primes and Bass numbers of local cohomology modules over regular local rings of mixed characteristic. In addition, the Principal Investigator plans to work on the following related conjecture: the support of a local cohomology module is a Zariski closed set in the spectrum of the ring. Using local cohomology over rings containing a field, Lyubeznik introduced a family of invariants now called Lyubeznik numbers. These invariants have shown several connections with the algebraic and geometric properties of a ring. This inspired an analogous definition of these numbers in mixed characteristic. The project aims to compare the Lyubeznik numbers of rings that contain fields with those that do not. In particular, the research seeks a topological or arithmetic criterion that relates both notions of Lyubeznik numbers. In addition, the project seeks to find geometric properties encoded by the Lyubeznik numbers in mixed characteristic. Lastly, the Principal Investigator plans to work on singularities in positive characteristic via the Frobenius map. In particular, he is planning to work on the ACC conjecture for F-pure thresholds and its corollaries. In addition, the Principal Investigator and a collaborator will investigate a conjectured inequality that relates the F-pure thresholds with the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities. If this project succeeds, the conjectured relation could have several computational and geometric consequences."

The main goal of this project is twofold. On the one hand, it aims to discover new constructions and shed new light on longstanding mathematical problems using natural physical phenomena as a source of conceptual inspiration. On the other, a rigorous mathematical formulation of physical problems is expected to provide valuable insight into important theoretical physics problems such as black hole entropy and quantum particle dynamics. A concrete illustrative example is the classification of knots in three dimensions, a problem with deep ramifications both in abstract mathematics and theoretical physics. Three-dimensional knots can be easily visualized: a knot is simply a piece of rope tangled up in a complicated way with its ends joined together. The main goal of the knot classification problem is to assign concrete mathematical invariants to such objects that can distinguish between two different tangles. This question turns out to be surprisingly difficult. A significant part of the proposed research is focused on constructing polynomial knot invariants by counting quantum particles in abstract models emerging from string theory. While such theoretical models are not directly related to our world, they do lead to novel and fascinating mathematical constructions, as well as important conceptual advances in theoretical physics. The other projects contained in this proposal are similarly centered on the relation between quantum particle counting in string theory and counting of geometric objects in enumerative algebraic geometry. This research program offers multiple opportunities for students of all levels -- ranging from undergraduate to advanced graduate -- as well as postdoctoral fellows to get involved in research at early stages in their careers. <br/><br/>From a more technical point of view, the current proposal aims to make significant advances in several long standing mathematical problems such as the cohomology of character varieties, the construction of knot invariants, and questions related to modularity in enumerative geometry. The central idea of this work is that such problems are naturally related to BPS states counting problems in string theory. Then string duality ultimately leads to new and precise mathematical conjectures showing that many such problems occur naturally in the context of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds. This provides new proof strategies and opens new directions of research, unraveling further unexpected relations. More concretely, the aim is to apply this strategy to the study of the cohomology of wildly ramified character varieties, Khovanov-Rozansky invariants for non-algebraic knots, and the relation between modular forms and Donaldson-Thomas invariants of K3-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds."

While a majority of the faculty in commutative algebra at the Universities of Minnesota and Wisconsin are relatively junior, both institutions have broad and deep communities of researchers whose work interacts with commutative algebra, but who primarily work in other fields, including algebraic geometry, combinatorics, number theory, applied algebra, representation theory, and computational algebra.  Thus these conferences are well positioned to lead to collaborations across different areas of algebra.  Attendees will consist of a mix of professors, postdoctoral researchers, and students from the two hosting institutions plus other nearby institutions."

Having led to the solution of a number of outstanding conjectures, such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the Mordell Conjecture, it continues to give rise to deep and important problems in algebra. Local-global principles are a central theme in this interplay of subjects, and many important outstanding problems can be expressed in terms of such principles. This project has the objective of understanding local-global principles and their obstructions, in contexts that are broader than those considered in number theory. The project will also support and enhance the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers through seminars, conferences and workshops, and mentoring activities.<br/><br/>The Focused Research Group will focus on local-global principles for algebraic structures defined over function fields of curves over base fields such as p-adic fields, with a longer term goal of treating the case of function fields of curves over global fields. The obstructions to such local-global principles can often be formulated in terms of cohomology. Our project aims to study the finiteness of these obstructions and determine criteria for them to vanish. The resulting understanding will be applied to proving conjectures and solving open problems concerning algebraic structures such as quadratic forms and associative algebras. This will include situations that have been studied by many researchers but where solutions had previously seemed out of reach. Research methods will include field patching, cohomological methods including residues and duality, and approaches from geometry."

In this project the PI will establish new connections between representation theory and geometry, and develop techniques that will shed light on longstanding problems in both areas. The project also contains several educational outreach initiatives aimed at elementary, middle and junior high school student in Seattle area. These initiatives range from an enrichment math program at a local elementary school, to a city wide math circle for middle schoolers, to public math lectures and a special Math Olympiad for students in grades 5-10. These opportunities are designed to attract more young people, particularly young women, to careers in the mathematical sciences, and to raise awareness and appreciation of the beautiful nature of mathematics in the next generation.<br/><br/>This research focuses on four interrelated directions traceable to Quillen's fundamental work in group cohomology from 1971. A significant part of the project concentrates on interpreting categories associated to representations in geometric terms. In the first three projects, the PI will classify triangulated subcategories using support theories, find an analogue of the Beilinson-Bernstein localization theorem for complex Lie algebras in the case of infinitesimal neighborhoods of algebraic groups in positive characteristic, and investigate the Orlov correspondence for representation theoretic categories. In a fourth project, which is of a more algebraic nature and has geometric applications, the PI will establish the finite generation of cohomology for a new class of finite dimensional Hopf algebras."

Algebraists in the Southwest region pursue research on a variety of topics under the umbrella of pure and applied ring theory. The geographical distances in the region are such that interactions between people at different institutions rarely happen spontaneously. The meeting will bring together students and faculty from a variety of institutions for inspiring talks, with ample time for scientific interaction, providing opportunities for participants to begin new collaborations and catalyzing new research projects. About 50 participants are expected, including students and young and senior faculty from throughout the Southwest and South. The participation of students from underrepresented minority groups, women, untenured faculty, and faculty at non-Ph.D. granting institutions is particularly encouraged. Six experts will deliver hour-long talks on topics within their areas of specialty; the lectures will be accessible to graduate students. The meeting will also feature three hour-long poster sessions in which the participating students will present their research.

In this problem, one studies whether the structure of an electrical network can be recovered by performing measurements at particular nodes.

Algebraic geometry is fundamental to many applications of mathematics -- such as those to physics, computer science and, more recently, biology -- and was already studied in the work of the ancient Greeks, if not earlier. However, the subject experienced a spectacular revival in the recent past, thanks largely to the work of Alexander Grothendieck and his collaborators. One of the major insights gained from this work was that the study of ""approximate"" solutions (in the sense of modular or ""clockwork"" arithmetic) to polynomial equations sheds quite a bit of light on the ""true"" solutions. In this project, the investigator will expand the techniques available to study ""approximate"" solutions, and contribute to bridging the gap between ""approximate"" and ""true"" solutions. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study algebraic geometry in the positive characteristic and p-adic settings. First, with Morrow and Scholze, the PI intends to give an algebro-geometric construction of Breuil-Kisin modules (or p-adic shtukas) associated to p-adic manifolds; this may be viewed as a p-adic analogue of the association of a Hodge structure to a complex manifold, and would have new consequences for the cohomology of algebraic varieties. Secondly, with Scholze, the PI plans to study algebraic geometry over perfect schemes, and its relation to the h-topology; the sought-for descent result for vector bundles would be used to construct determinant line bundles for certain complexes of sheaves that are not linear over the structure sheaf, which will give a new source of algebraic cycles. Finally, with Esnault and Kindler, the PI will work on extensions of Gieseker conjecture (relating fundamental groups to D-modules in characteristic p) and the Grothendieck conjecture (relating stratifying cohomology with the perfection of coherent cohomology). The central theme running through all these projects is the systematic use of ""large"" objects (such as the pro-etale and h- topologies, perfect and derived schemes) to study ""small"" objects (such as torsion in cohomology, or line bundles on Grassmanians)."

In mathematics symmetries are described by abstract objects called groups.  Representation theory, originating in the work of mathematicians such as Issai Schur and Ferdinand Frobenius at the end of the 19th century, studies how the structure of groups can be captured by simpler, linear objects, in particular, matrices.  Apart from making groups more concrete, it has long been realized that this is critical for understanding how groups act on other objects.  For example, in physics one is interested in how the symmetry groups of nature, such as translations and rotations, act on physical systems.  This is why, starting in the 1920's, the representation theory of unitary groups, in particular, has been central to the development of quantum mechanics and particle physics.   Recently, surprising connections have also been uncovered between representation theory and problems of a seemingly very different character, such as finding the number of operations required on a computer to carry out arithmetic computations, aligning a large number of noisy images of the same molecule taken by a certain type of electron-microscope, and ranking problems in statistical machine learning.  The aim of the summer school is to engage graduate students from across the sciences in research in these exciting new areas.<br/><br/>In recent years representation theory has found new applications in a range of domains from cryo-electron microscopy, through machine learning, to holographic algorithms.  The fact that the subject is usually taught for an audience in pure mathematics makes it challenging for graduate students in more applied disciplines to learn the material. Conversely, mathematicians are often not aware of the new, exciting applications of representation theory.  This summer school attempts to bridge this gap by starting with a short introduction to representation theory, followed by a series of mini-courses on some of the most recent work on using representation theoretical ideas in imaging, signal processing, holographic algorithms, quantum computing, algebraic and geometric computational complexity theory, non-commutative Fourier transforms, and other areas.  Each of these subjects is presented by one of the leading experts in the area.

The subject has undergone tremendous exploration recently due to its close connection to a number of areas of mathematics and mathematical physics, including algebraic topology, Lie theory, homotopy algebras, mirror symmetry, string theory, quantum field theory and noncommutative geometry. The project will be devoted to bringing together different aspects of higher structures, in particular derived geometry and quantization, as well as identifying new emerging directions of investigation, which is becoming more and more urgent as the field progresses. Derived geometry develops a powerful machinery for studying the residual geometry of badly behaved intersections and quotient spaces of high current interest in different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics while quantization establishes bridges between classical and quantum physics.

Surprisingly, while it can be extremely difficult to determine the precise list of solution figures that satisfy the conditions, it is often possible to predict the number of such solutions.

A major goal in Schubert calculus is to obtain formulas for the multiplicative structure constants of this ring with respect to its basis of Schubert classes.  The PI will attempt to prove a positive combinatorial formula that expresses the cohomological structure constants of any three-step flag variety as the number of puzzles that can be created using a list of puzzle pieces. The Gromov-Witten invariants of a flag manifold X count the number of rational curves that meet general Schubert varieties in X when this number is finite.  When infinitely many curves meet a general configuration of Schubert varieties, the collection of these curves form a moduli space called a Gromov-Witten variety. Gromov-Witten varieties in turn define K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants that are encoded in the quantum K-theory ring of X.  The study of this ring provides a useful benchmark for our understanding of the singularities and rationality properties of Gromov-Witten varieties and related spaces.  The PI will attempt to answer several open questions about positivity and finiteness properties of quantum K-theory.

A connection between them was established in a 1993 paper where D-modules were used to solve problems from Commutative Algebra. It is always exciting when two different fields converge. This enriches both fields by making available new tools to attack old problems. By now the range of applications of D-modules to commutative algebra has expanded well beyond that 1993 paper. On the other hand, these applications have motivated important developments in the theory of D-modules itself. Yet despite these developments many questions remain open. There have been many exciting developments in the world of D-modules whose implications for commutative algebra have not been fully explored; for instance, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence and Berthelot's theory of arithmetic D-modules, just to name two. During the conference there will be three short lecture series on the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, on arithmetic D-modules, and on applications of D-modules in commutative algebra. The conference will include a number of research talks as well as a moderated open problem session.<br/><br/>Conference web site: https://sites.google.com/site/dmodulesincommutativealgebra/home"

While whole numbers are in a sense discrete objects, in modern times they are often studied using techniques of continuous mathematics, such as calculus. The PI's work focuses in particular on the use of p-adic numbers, which were introduced early in the 20th century as a number system analogous to the real numbers, but recording information about divisibility of integers. In addition to theoretical results, the p-adic numbers give rise to computational techniques with some relevance in computer science, especially in modern cryptography.<br/><br/>Building on recent breakthroughs in p-adic Hodge theory, we extend the field in several different directions. We extend the theory of p-adic representations to allow coefficients in larger rings, with an eye towards applications to the p-adic interpolation of automorphic forms. We also allow the replacement of p-adic Galois groups with etale fundamental groups; this is expected to shed new light on the p-adic Langlands correspondence. Finally, we consider ways to replace the p-adic numbers with the full ring of integers; this involves systematic use of Witt vectors over arbitrary rings.<br/><br/>"

Some of the well-studied objects in algebraic geometry are the projective plane (the plane with additional ""points at infinity"") and curves on it. A natural question is that of finding the number of curves that satisfy certain special conditions, such as passing through fixed points or having special shapes, which was the starting point of a branch of algebraic geometry called enumerative geometry. During the past twenty years, the interaction between enumerative geometry and string theory in physics has resulted in many exciting new developments and has been a central area of current research.  This research project aims to define and study new invariants, in a broader sense on general algebraic surfaces, that have connections to both mathematics and physics. These invariants contain sophisticated information about the number of singular curves, the geometric properties of the surface, and the parametrization space of singular curves. The project envisages development of a theoretical framework and tools for computation, as well as establishing connections between different subjects in mathematics.  It will add to the understanding of geometry of algebraic varieties and has application to the description of spacetime in string theory.<br/><br/>This research project treats several problems in algebraic geometry, especially about the enumeration of singular curves on algebraic surfaces and its motivic generalization. Previous work has established that the numbers of varieties with certain given singularities satisfy universal formulas. This project concerns the generalization of these universal formulas in the motivic sense. The research defines a sequence of motivic invariants and studies their quantitative properties as well as their geometric interpretation. The work aims to extend the existing connections with Gromov-Witten theory, stable pairs theory, and modular forms for these new invariants, and to compare them with other motivic curve-counting invariants. One of the advantages of these new invariants is that they satisfy nice formulas and only depend on topological intersection numbers."

Hence, algebraic geometry sees many applications in other parts of mathematics such as number theory or complex geometry, and also in other scientific or engineering disciplines such as physics, coding theory, robotics, and computational biology. In particular, any general structure theory of these algebraic objects can be very useful in many fields of study. The part of algebraic geometry devoted to this structure theory is called higher dimensional algebraic geometry and it is the main subject of this research project. The project aims to further develop the theory of higher dimensional algebraic geometry. <br/><br/>For studying varieties over a field of characteristic zero and of positive characteristic, there are very different tools available. Examples of the former are Hodge theory and the related vanishing theorems, while examples for the latter are Frobenius lifting techniques or quotients by p-closed foliations.

Algebraic geometry studies solutions of such polynomial systems. Often, the solutions of these systems vary in a continuous manner depending on parameters in the defining equations of these systems, leading to parametrized spaces of solutions. A difficult-to-study system may lie in the same parameter space as a system that is easy to solve, allowing one to deduce geometric constraints on the difficult system. This project studies the geometry of some parameter spaces that are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics, so-called moduli spaces of vector bundles and moduli spaces of curves. The research computes geometric invariants of these spaces by relating them to simpler spaces. A recent breakthrough called Bridgeland stability has allowed computation of many of the invariants that were previously inaccessible. This research project aims to extend these results.  In addition, the project contributes to training the next generation of researchers in mathematics through the involvement of graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the research. <br/><br/>Bridgeland stability conditions provide a new tool for studying the geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves. This project aims to combine Bridgeland stability conditions with recent advances in birational geometry to study longstanding questions about the geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces and moduli spaces of curves. These moduli spaces play a central role in many branches of mathematics. Consequently, it is crucial to understand their cohomology and birational geometry. The project involves three parts. First, building on work with collaborators, the PI will study the birational geometry of the moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces. He will compute their birational invariants such as the cones of ample, movable, and effective divisors, concentrating on Hirzebruch surfaces, del Pezzo surfaces, and certain surfaces of general type. Second, the PI will study resolutions of ideal sheaves of points and curves in projective space in terms of other exceptional collections. In the case of the plane, the geometry is significantly simplified if one resolves sheaves in terms of an appropriately chosen exceptional collection; this work will apply the same ideas to sheaves on higher-dimensional projective spaces. Third, the PI will continue collaborative projects on the effective cones of higher codimension cycles on moduli spaces of curves, the Kawamata-Morrison Cone Conjecture, and extremality properties of cycles in homogeneous spaces."

This proposal is concerned with periodic functions in a new guise, when the functions are defined not on a group but on a finite cover of a group. This blends arithmetic and analysis in a new way.  Moreover, the techniques to be studied may have connections to constructions in mathematical physics.<br/><br/>The main objects of study in this project are automorphic forms on covering groups.  The principal investigator will focus first on Eisenstein series, which are obtained by an averaging process.  Many of the standard tools from automorphic forms do not carry over (e.g. Whittaker functionals are typically not unique), but a surprising picture blending representation theory (canonical bases,  Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen cycles) and number theory is emerging.  The principal investigator will investigate these and and their number-theoretic applications. He also will study the residues of metaplectic Eisenstein series, ""higher theta series.""  There is much to be done to understand the unipotent orbits attached to these objects, to develop relations between such series on different groups, and to use them both globally and in local constructions. A third project concerns unique functionals and Iwahori Hecke algebras.  It offers the potential for new constructions of unique functionals."

For example, an infinite sequence of numbers might be compactly encoded as the values of a simple function. One such occurrence relevant to this project is the dimensions of a sequence of spaces. In many cases of interest, it may not be possible to directly compute these numbers, but one can instead hope to analyze their rate of growth. An old theme in mathematics has been to understand such problems by finding some algebraic structure on the sequence. Recently, several groups of researchers have found new, exotic algebraic structures that apply to previously unexpected examples of such sequences in areas such as topology, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. The purpose of this project is to study and uncover the fundamental properties of these new algebraic structures by applying and combining tools from commutative algebra and representation theory.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to work on several projects at the interface between commutative algebra and representation theory, specifically the study of new classes of algebraic objects (e.g., twisted commutative algebras, Delta-modules, and FI-modules) and their applications to classical topics  (syzygies of algebraic varieties, homological stability, homology of arithmetic groups, etc.). Additionally, the PI will work on problems in Boij-Sderberg theory, which is the study of algebraic invariants, such as Betti tables of graded modules and cohomology tables of vector bundles, ""up to scalar multiple."" This topic is connected to the general theme in indirect and subtle ways that are still not well understood. The basic theme is to identify a class of examples that have the structure of a module over one of these algebraic structures and to prove that it is finitely generated. The finite generation reveals some information akin to an existence result, but often the results do not come with bounds or any sharper information, so should be seen as a first step in a larger program. The PI proposes to import ideas from commutative algebra and homological algebra, such as Hilbert functions, projective resolutions, Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, and Koszul duality, to further enhance the understanding of such examples and to reveal new information."

It studies geometric objects defined by algebraic equations. Algebraic geometry has important connections to mathematical physics and coding theory. The research will improve understanding of the relations between the geometry of algebraic curves and higher dimensional varieties and the set of higher relations among the equations defining the varieties. These relations are called the syzygies of the varieties. The investigator and collaborators will investigate the properties of the syzygies of algebraic curves and higher dimensional varieties. They will study singularities of higher dimensional varieties and their relations to the minimal model program and other branches of mathematics. The project has extensive training components as well. The PI has already trained several successful young algebraic geometers and is currently supervising two graduate students who are working on various problems related to the project. The PI and co-authors are writing a book on multiplier ideals, extension theorems, and geometry of arc spaces. The book aims to help young researchers understand how these techniques can be applied to understanding higher dimensional algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>The research project involves study of syzygies by studying properties of the Hilbert schemes of points on the curve. It is also planned to investigate the asymptotic behavior of syzygies of an algebraic variety and their relations to the intrinsic geometry of the variety. The project would extend the classical results previously only known in the case of algebraic curves to higher dimensional varieties. Multiplier ideals together with their vanishing theorems play an important role in the development of the higher dimensional minimal model program; these ideals are also an important measure of the complexity of singularities. Mather-Jacobian ideals have an advantage over the classical multiplier ideals because these ideals are defined for non-Q-Gorenstein singularities. Higher co-dimension effective cycles should be very useful in understanding the geometry of higher dimensional varieties. The investigator and collaborators are planning to study numerical invariants such as log-canonical thresholds and minimal log-discrepancies attached to the singularities of algebraic varieties. These invariants play central roles in the study of minimal model program. They also show up naturally in the theory of D-modules, positive characteristic commutative algebra, and the geometry of arc spaces."

Polynomial equations over the rational numbers are among the oldest topics in all of mathematics; indeed, they are often called ""Diophantine equations"" after Diophantus of Alexandria, who was one of the first to study them, in the 3rd century AD.  Many of the most important questions have been solved, at least partially, in the case of one and two dimensional systems of equations, but there is much that is unknown in dimensions three and up.  One of the primary goals of this award is to use dynamics (simply the repeated application of a function) to solve an open question about solutions to certain types of three-dimensional systems of equations.  Another goal is to develop a good notion of what it means for tuples of points to be in ""dynamically special position"", which means loosely that the points don't interact upon repeated application of a function.<br/><br/>An important conjecture of Zhang asks that if f is a self-map of an algebraic variety X defined over a number field, then under reasonably general conditions, there should be an algebraic point of X whose orbit under f is Zariski dense in X.  We seek to prove this conjecture in the case where f is an automorphism and X has dimension 3.  The chief tool here is the p-adic parametrization of orbits, which may be thought of as a more general dynamical version of Skolem's method for treating linear recurrence sequences.  Another goal of the project is to prove that if n is larger than 1, then given n distinct points in C and a list of n preperiods and periods, there is a polynomial of degree n+1 in normal form such that each point has the desired period and preperiod.<br/>The methods here are a combination of diophantine approximation over function fields and the ""unlikely intersection"" techniques pioneered by Masser, Zannier, Baker, DeMarco, and others."

Since its founding in 1997, the primary activity of the Southwest Center is the Arizona Winter School (AWS), an annual meeting which has become a prominent national event and provides high-level training and research experience for graduate students in arithmetic geometry and related areas. The AWS is an intensive five-day meeting, organized around a different central topic each year, that features a set of courses and accompanying research projects carefully designed and delivered by leading and emerging experts. At the Winter School, connections among peers are formed, and mentoring relationships between students and senior researchers are developed. As has been the case at previous Winter Schools, subsequent collaborations between participants at all levels are the norm. Students make concrete strides toward becoming research mathematicians, post-doctoral assistants gain valuable mentoring experience in their academic careers, and faculty develop new interests and see new connections that lead to important published results. The Southwest Center website shares reusable content from the Winter Schools, including lecture notes, project descriptions, and audio and video of lectures. Through these thorough records, the dialogues begun at the AWS are extended to the greater community, and the efforts of the AWS participants are made freely and indefinitely available to all.<br/><br/>The AWS is a unique fusion of traditional mathematics conference and intensive research workshop: the speakers organize courses of four lectures, provide lecture notes in advance, and propose research projects for graduate students to work on during the meeting. Nightly working sessions on these projects and on separate problem sets are run by the speakers and postdoctoral fellows. On the last day, students present their findings to the participants of the meeting. The result is a particularly intense and focused five days of mathematical activity for everyone involved.  Recent Winter School topics have included ""Modular forms and modular curves"",  ""Arithmetic statistics"", and ""Arithmetic and higher dimensional varieties."" The topics of upcoming Winter Schools will be guided by future mathematical developments.

Under previous grants, the investigator constructed and studied so-called ""elliptic"" analogues of these functions (a significant generalization that includes most of the generalized hypergeometric functions and generalized Painleve transcendents in the literature), as well as their implications for the more classical special functions.  The current project continues this work, and aims to provide a more solid conceptual framework by relating elliptic special functions to noncommutative algebraic geometry, which is a relatively recent variant of algebraic geometry, one of the fundamental disciplines within mathematics.<br/><br/>This connection is based on a new construction of noncommutative rational surfaces in terms of difference operators on elliptic curves (giving a discrete analogue of D-module theory), giving rise to a (functorial) relation between linear elliptic difference equations and sheaves on the noncommutative surfaces.  The Painleve equations (and generalizations) are most naturally interpreted as flows in moduli spaces of differential equations, so one expects their elliptic analogues to be related to moduli spaces of difference equations, and thus to moduli spaces of sheaves.  In particular, the investigator expects to be able to leverage the existing literature on noncommutative algebraic geometry to understand the structure of such moduli spaces, as well as various natural maps between them (e.g., twisting by line bundles).  In addition, since the new construction of highly-blown-up noncommutative rational surfaces is considerably more concrete than the previously existing constructions, the investigator expects the project to contribute significantly to our understanding of such surfaces in their own right (as well as their derived categories). Finally, several of the difference operators that arise in the construction are univariate analogues of operators that appeared in earlier work of the investigator on elliptic analogues of Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials; this leads to a multivariate analogue of the construction with connections not just to those elliptic analogues but also to certain integrable systems and to an elliptic analogue of the ""double affine Hecke algebras"" of Cherednik."

A number of projects are connected with local cohomology theory: this theory often provides the best answers to basic questions such as the least number of polynomials needed to define a solution set.<br/><br/>The projects on local cohomology theory include algorithmic aspects, as well as structural properties such as support and injective dimension.  There is a special focus on local cohomology modules of polynomial rings and hypersurfaces over the integers: this stems from the fact that there is a canonical homomorphism from the integers to any ring, and this makes local cohomology modules over the integers, in a sense, universal; this viewpoint has proved useful in recent work of the PI and collaborators. The project will also investigate local cohomology over the integers.  The research will further develop the connections of local cohomology with prime characteristic numerical invariants such as the F-pure threshold, and will study the composition series of local cohomology modules over rings of differential operators."

Among these, the relation between special values of L-functions and periods, which the PI proposes to study, is one of the most important problems. Precisely, the first part of the proposal is about the global restriction problems of automorphic representations in the framework of the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture. With various collaborators, the PI will formulate an explicit conjecture for those periods, generalizing the work of Ichino-Ikeda, as well as study the case of unitary groups using the tool of relative trace formula, proposed by Jacquet-Rallis in a special case and the PI in general. The second part of the proposal is to understand the relation between central derivatives of L-functions and certain arithmetic periods, namely, height of cycles on Shimura varieties. The PI proposes to study such relation via arithmetic theta lifting after Kudla and the PI himself, in particular, in the next unknown case of U(2,2).<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this research is to better understand one of the central questions in mathematics: how to solve equations, particularly, algebraic equations in number fields. These equations hide themselves in various kinds of mathematical objects, such as algebraic cycles, representations, period relations, etc. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is one of the most famous questions toward this direction. Outside pure mathematics, algebraic equations like elliptic curves, have important application in cryptography."

This award will support participants at two scientific symposia. The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) is a society of scientists dedicated to fostering the success of Hispanic/Chicano and Native American scientists from college students to professionals to attain advanced degrees, careers, and positions of leadership in science. One way SACNAS strives to achieve their goals is through their annual National Conference, whose programming includes scientific symposia sessions featuring talks by members of the scientific research community. The purpose of these sessions is to present research from diverse disciplines, share advanced research and discoveries, interact with attendees, and mentor science students. As part of this special program the PIs will organize scientific symposia in the mathematical sciences; specifically, they will organize three sessions dealing with research in abstract algebra at the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate level. These scientific symposia sessions address a variety of broader impacts. First, by organizing these sessions during one of the nations largest conferences for Hispanics and Native Americans, the PIs will reach students and professionals from traditionally underrepresented groups in academia. These participants will have the opportunity to see and contribute to current mathematical research presented at the 2015 SACNAS National Conference. In addition, conference participants will be able to hear from mathematicians who have mentored and advised students in numerous mathematical research projects; hence giving participants an opportunity to hear about possible research projects and meet new mentors and/or advisers. <br/><br/>The undergraduate session, ""Abstract Algebra research topics for undergraduates,"" will introduce algebra research topics that are accessible to students with a post-calculus background. Emphasis will be placed on providing a wide range of interesting problems so to encourage undergraduates to continue their studies and motivate them to pursue further research and work in mathematics. The graduate session, ""On my way to becoming an algebraist"" will invite underrepresented graduate students to present research talks, thus providing them with a venue to present their scholarly work, network with other researchers, and gain the opportunity for collaboration and furthering their current projects. The postgraduate session, ""Algebra: much more than arithmetic"" will introduce cutting edge mathematical research done by mathematicians from underrepresented groups as well as provide a venue to meet and interact with researchers interested in mentoring underrepresented students in mathematics. The design of the sessions include four speakers per scientific symposia, allowing for 12 talks with topics in abstract algebra at a wide range of mathematical levels. By providing mathematical talks at a wide range of mathematical levels, the sessions aim to increase interest among conference attendees. In addition, at least 75% of presenters in each session will be from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.  The conference website is http://sacnas.org/events/national-conf"

This area of mathematics has applications to areas such as cryptography and to physics. The particular branch of number theory considered in this project is arithmetic geometry where properties of interest in number theory are studied by geometric methods. The overall theme of the research is the interplay between arithmetic geometry and the Langlands correspondence for number fields. There have been many recent breakthroughs in the field, such as new techniques for proving reciprocity (modularity lifting theorems as well as the emerging p-adic Langlands program) and the construction of Galois representations associated to torsion classes in the cohomology of locally symmetric spaces. All of these developments have depended crucially on being able to p-adically interpolate automorphic forms. The concept of p-adic automorphic forms has a natural definition in terms of the geometry and cohomology of Shimura varieties and therefore p-adic arithmetic geometry is useful for studying them.<br/><br/>The PI investigates two intertwined areas: on one hand, applications of p-adic arithmetic geometry (specifically the theory of perfectoid spaces) to p-adic automorphic forms and, on the other hand, p-adic and mod p analogues of the classical Langlands program. Specifically, the PI will study a new approach to the p-adic local Langlands correspondence via the Taylor-Wiles method, to further study torsion occurring in the cohomology of Shimura varieties and the properties at p of the associated Galois representations and to develop a new approach to instances of the Tate conjecture in the context of Shimura varieties. Some of the new techniques that the PI intends to use are the Taylor-Wiles patching method applied to completed cohomology and matching parameters in local deformation rings with Hecke operators. Another key idea involves studying perfectoid Shimura varieties via their associated period domains. The research project lies at the intersection of algebraic number theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry, with a focus on the interplay between p-adic arithmetic geometry and the Langlands correspondence for number fields. A central motif in number theory is the classification of algebraic extensions of number fields. Class field theory addresses this for extensions with abelian Galois group. The Langlands program provides a framework for a vast generalization of class field theory to the non-abelian setting. At its heart is the conjectural correspondence between automorphic representations and Galois representations, which is often realized by geometric objects, such as Shimura varieties. Therefore, arithmetic geometry provides many important tools for studying Langlands correspondences.  Many of the most spectacular recent results in number theory are instances of the Langlands correspondence, such as Fermat's last theorem, the Sato-Tate conjecture and Serre's conjecture."

KUMUNU is the annual weekend conference anchored by the University of Kansas (KU), University of Missouri (MU), and University of Nebraska  (NU). It was founded by the algebraists in these three institutions in 1999 to promote interaction among faculty, post docs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines. The three institutions are within 5 hours driving distance and with modest travel and lodging support the weekend KUMUNU conferences continue to have significant regional impact. The KUMUNU conference has a strong tradition of playing an important mentoring role for graduate students, recent PhDs, and early career faculty in research institutions and four-year colleges. KUMUNU provides an annual venue for these groups to come together with senior researchers at KU, MU and NU along with two or three senior researchers from some institutions not so near.  The conference also features talks by three graduate students, one each from KU, MU and NU who present their developing theses.  KUMUNU stimulates interactions by having talks on current research accessible to graduate students with ample time and opportunity for interaction outside of talks in an informal and friendly setting. Kumunu 2015 will feature talks by Professors Craig Huneke(Virginia), Christel Rotthaus (Michigan State) and Anurag Singh (Utah) and three talks by faculty from KU, MU and NU. In addition to faculty and students from KU, MU and NU, and other institutions from Kansas,  Missouri and Nebraska,  KUMUNU draws participants from neighboring states such as Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.  One of the main goals is to showcase research of young faculty, helping enrich the research programs of recent PhDs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related fields by both formal and informal mentoring  from experienced  researchers. In addition, KUMUNU serves to enhance the existing strengths at these  three  institutions. The conference website is http://kumunu.missouri.edu<br/><br/>The KUMUNU 2015 will provide an opportunity for mathematicians to interact and establish research connections  with each other; in particular, the participants will interact with other researchers and hear and discuss recent developments in the field and its relationships  with other areas. The primary impacts of the conference will be its dissemination of recent ideas in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of students and early career participants. Participants will take ideas from the conference back to their colleagues and students, stimulating further research and mathematical enrichment at their home institutions. The relatively small size of the meeting and its geographic and disciplinary focus will be particularly effective at enabling participants to establish productive collaborative relationships. Encouragement and mentoring that begins at the conference will significantly contribute to the success and professional development of early career mathematicians whether in research institutions or primarily teaching institutions.  The travel and lodging support provided by NSF for this conference is a key element for the success of the conference."

Such parameter spaces often themselves have rich geometric structures, and are called moduli spaces. In complex geometry, one studies objects that have complex coordinates - that is, from close up look like complex numbers. In complex algebraic geometry, one further restricts to studying shapes defined by polynomial equations in complex numbers - and the basic classification problem is to study all such shapes of a given type, find the parameters for such shapes, and what conditions these parameters must satisfy.  Moduli spaces are ubiquitous in algebraic geometry, and in recent times have provided some of the most powerful tools for understanding individual geometric objects, by deformation and degeneration. In particular, algebraic curves (Riemann surfaces) permeate many constructions in algebraic geometry; abelian varieties appear naturally in varied contexts ranging from number theory to integrable systems to physics. The proposed research aims to obtain new information about the geometry of moduli spaces and relations among them. The investigator will seek new deep relations and properties of various moduli problems with the aim of providing further tools that could be used by researchers in complex and algebraic geometry, Teichmuller theory, string perturbation theory, and integrable systems.<br/><br/>The investigator will work to further understand the geometry of moduli spaces over complex numbers, especially focusing on the moduli spaces of abelian varieties, and of curves. The investigator will build on the techniques and results he developed with Hulek, Tommasi, and Zakharov to define and study an extended tautological ring for suitable compactifications of the moduli space of abelian varieties, trying to determine whether it may be Gorenstein, and whether the intersection numbers may satisfy an interesting recursion relation. The investigator will apply the real-analytic techniques he developed with Krichever, and inspired by integrable systems, to study the classical problem of bounding the number of cusps of plane curves, and to study complete subvarieties of the moduli space of curves. The investigator will use this work to characterize geometrically the locus where the Prym map fails to be injective.

The former two branches of mathematics originate from physics, while the last deals with applications of purely algebraic concepts to geometry. Representation theory concerns the study of symmetries of a vector space such as our three-dimensional space (more generally, an infinite dimensional space) with additional structures. These symmetries can be often thought of as algebraic structures. The following two cases are of particular interest: (1) the case of pair-wise commuting symmetries, when sufficiently many exist, is of central importance in the study of integrable systems; (2) the case when the underlying vector space arises from geometric objects is of central importance in geometric representation theory. In this project the principal investigator plans to explore these concepts in the particular cases of algebras known as quantum toroidal algebras and affine Yangians. These associative algebras can be viewed as deformations of Lie algebras and provide generalizations of the classical quantum affine algebras and Yangians that have been studied extensively in recent decades. <br/><br/>This project is devoted to the study of quantum toroidal algebras and affine Yangians. The PI's plan is as follows: (1) Develop shuffle realizations of all quantum toroidal/affine algebras of ADE type. (2) Unify all known different constructions of their representations and provide a wider class of shuffle type modules. (3) Study the maximal commutative subalgebras of quantum toroidal algebras via the shuffle realization, and develop a new (shuffle) approach to the well-known Bethe ansatz problem, concerning diagonalization of such maximal commutative subalgebras in interesting classes of representations. (4) Relate the aforementioned maximal commutative subalgebras to the study of quantum cohomology and quantum K-theory of Nakajima quiver varieties and affine Laumon spaces.

The conference is centered around recent advances on the ""rationality problem"" in algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry studies systems of polynomial equations -- ubiquitous in mathematics, science, and engineering -- by looking at the geometry of the set of solutions. A system of polynomial equations is called ""rational"" (respectively ""unirational"") if there is a polynomial function whose outputs always give solutions of the system, and such that a general solution occurs among the outputs of this function exactly once (respectively only a finite number of times). This property is of great practical value, but unfortunately it is notoriously difficult to tell whether a given system is rational or unirational. The conference will bring together experts to discuss recent progress on this open problem; it will foster interactions between experts in different fields, and it will train young mathematicians in these important techniques. This award supports participation, primarily by junior researchers, in the conference.<br/><br/>Specifically, the conference will explore four themes related to rationality questions:<br/>(1) Algebraic cycles and Hodge theory<br/>(2) Derived categories<br/>(3) Bridgeland stability conditions<br/>(4) Birational geometry<br/>The conference will feature presentations by leading experts in these areas. Throughout the history of algebraic geometry, the ""rationality problem"" has been a touchstone, motivating major progress in Hodge theory (the Clemens-Griffiths theorem disproving the Lroth conjecture), the minimal model program (the Iskovskikh-Manin theorem and Mori's proof of the Hartshorne conjecture), invariant theory (Saltman's negative solution of Noether's problem), and tale cohomology (the Artin-Mumford theorem solving the stable Lroth problem). Although the problem has many direct applications, its main value has been inspiring new techniques and serving as a point of contact between different areas. There have been major recent advances on the rationality problem in several parts of algebraic geometry, and this is a rare moment of opportunity to bring together researchers with complementary expertise. Indeed, a complete solution, for instance in the case of cubic fourfolds, likely requires multiple approaches, and there are few mathematicians expert in all these areas. There will be a number of activities specifically for junior participants (such as a one-day mini-school introducing some of the topics), and an effort will be made to recruit a diverse body of participants.

The study of Hodge structures and their symmetry groups, MumfordTate groups, lies at the intersection of complex geometry, representation theory and arithmetic. The proposed work addresses the relationship between Hodge theory and representation theory, with a focus on those aspects that may be described using complex geometry. (The Hodge theory of algebraic varieties will not be addressed: the emphasis is on Hodge structures as objects of independent interest.)  In the classical case that the Hodge domain D is a Hermitian symmetric space that may be equivariantly embedded in Siegel's upper-half space, the relation between Hodge theory and the geometric and arithmetic properties of a variety is a deep and extensively researched subject. The area is considerably less developed in the non-classical case, and it is generally felt that the principle obstacle to generalizing the theory (arithmetic properties, automorphic forms, theory of Shimura varieties, et cetera) is our limited understanding of the system of differential equations governing variations of Hodge structure.  The principle motivation and objective of this project is to better understand this system, the complex geometry of the Hodge domain D, and the associated representation theory in the non-classical setting.<br/><br/>Hodge theory lies at the crossroads of several mathematical subjects, including Algebraic Geometry, Complex Geometry, Number Theory and Representation Theory.  This rich confluence makes the subject a fertile and influential area of research.  The underlying motivation to study variations of Hodge structure (a dominant theme in this proposal) is to understand moduli of algebraic varieties.  Algebraic varieties arise as the solution spaces to polynomial equations.  The ability to understand and manipulate solutions of systems of polynomial equations is essential in many areas of engineering, science and mathematics."

Open questions relate to simplicity of description, expression in terms of cyclic classes, and the search for a reasonable definition of dimension for fields and for algebraic groups such as PGLn. Algebraic geometers study the Brauer group as an important invariant of a scheme arising from etale cohomology. This point of view goes back to the 1960's and Grothendieck, who suggested problems that are still actively being investigated. Recently deep connections have arisen between Brauer groups of schemes and stack theory, and these are being used not only to attack some longstanding open problems, but to serve as inspiration for new problems and approaches.<br/><br/>For more information see the conference web-site: http://torsor.github.io/brauer/"

Its main predictions include a connection (called reciprocity) between the world of diophantine equations and a world of analytic objects called automorphic forms, and surprising relations (called functoriality) within the latter. The present project focuses on the second of these predictions which, as much as it has been studied in recent decades, is lacking a proper understanding (what exactly is the nature of functoriality? what are the objects that we are supposed to compare?) or strategy for its proof (besides the extremely important, but relatively limited instances of ""endoscopy"" proved with the Arthur-Selberg trace formula). The project will establish the foundations for a generalization of these conjectures -- termed ""relative functoriality"" -- as follows: the objects to be compared are Schwartz functions on algebro-geometric spaces called ""stacks,"" and ways to compare them will be investigated along the lines of the ""beyond endoscopy"" ideas set forth by Langlands.<br/><br/>More precisely, the algebraic stacks to be considered arise from a pair of spherical varieties with an action of a reductive group G. There is an L-function attached to each of these varieties, generalizing the method of Rankin-Selberg and period integrals; this L-function will be studied building upon earlier work of the PI and others. The relative trace formula of Jacquet will be further developed, generalizing the Arthur-Selberg trace formula, as a distribution on the quotient of these varieties by the diagonal action of G. Starting from low-rank cases, the investigator will examine new, ""non-standard"" ways of comparing relative trace formulas via integral transforms. Along the way, new results in harmonic analysis on homogeneous spaces will be developed."

A system of linear differential equations can be encoded in an algebraic structure known as a D-module; this encoding allows us to isolate algebraic properties of the system of equations from questions about features of its solutions. In the presence of spatial symmetry, those D-modules preserved by the symmetry possess a special structure reflecting a corresponding decomposition of space itself into simpler pieces. The focus of this research is to refine these structural features and apply them in mathematics and physics.<br/><br/>D-modules provide fundamental objects in geometric representation theory.  They and their more flexible symplectic counterparts, which we call ""microlocal sheaves,"" have been systematically mined in the subject for several decades. In recent work, the PI (jointly with McGerty) has established the existence of a new structural feature, categorical Morse decomposition, for G-equivariant D-modules on a variety X, or, generalizing the quotient of X by G, on a more general class of algebraic stacks. This categorical decomposition mirrors, one categorical level higher, long-anticipated Morse-theoretic assertions for the geometry of the equivariant cotangent bundle of X (i.e., the cotangent bundle of the quotient stack). This research places the structure of categorical Morse decomposition at the center of a web of interconnected directions and problems informed by, and with applications to, representation theory, topology, geometry, and the mathematics of supersymmetric field theories. ""Peeling off the top layer"" of the categorical Morse decomposition leads to applications to the representation theory of algebras that are realized by quantum Hamiltonian reduction (examples include many symplectic reflection algebras). Decategorifying leads to applications to classical topological invariants of hyperkahler and algebraic symplectic quotients. Applying the framework to algebraic varieties that arise as moduli of vacua in supersymmetric gauge theories will yield insight into mathematical structures of these physically-defined spaces."

The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. This research project studies mathematically the application of topological phases of matter to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit in quantum computation.<br/><br/>In this project the investigators study mathematical models for topological phases, focusing on their applications to topological quantum computation.  Topological phases of matter in two spatial dimensions are well-described in the framework of modular categories, but relatively little is known in three spatial dimensions.  A large part of this project is devoted to developing appropriate mathematical models in three spatial dimensions and analyzing the corresponding computational paradigms.  Specifically, the project will study (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories and representations of the loop braid group, and symmetry enriched topological order and gauging symmetry.  In addition, because locality and universality are two desirable properties for quantum computation that are manifested in the representations of the braid group, this project also aims to formulate conjectures characterizing when these properties hold and to verify and adapt these conjectures where appropriate to better characterize physical and computational aspects.  To compare the computational power of topological quantum computers to that of classical computers, the project investigates the complexity of the most natural computation in this setting: topological invariants."

For example, a representation of a group is a concrete realization of the elements of the group as invertible matrices, with the group operation corresponding to matrix multiplication. Representation theory has a pervasive influence throughout mathematics.  It also plays an important role in physics, chemistry, and other sciences as it provides the correct language to study the effects of symmetry in a physical system.  This project is part of the the geometric Langlands program, a major component of modern representation theory.  The Langlands program is a network of far-reaching and influential conjectures connecting seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics.  In their original formulation the conjectures linked number theory and the representation theory of algebraic groups.  More recent reformulations of the Langlands program have moved into the realm of geometry.  The simplest case asserts a relationship between first-order matrix differential equations and representations of a group of invertible matrices with Laurent series as entries.  <br/><br/>The PI has developed a new approach to the study of irregular singular flat G-bundles for reductive groups G: a geometric version of Moy and Prasad's theory of fundamental strata (or minimal K-types) for p-adic groups.  In the geometric theory, one associates a fundamental stratum -- data involving an appropriate filtration on the loop algebra -- to a formal flat G-bundle. Intuitively, this stratum plays the role of the ""leading term"" of the flat G-bundle and allows one to define its slope. The PI will use this approach to answer various questions related to irregular flat G-bundles and the geometric Langlands correspondence.  The PI will construct moduli spaces of flat G-bundles on the projective line with toral singularities -- singularities associated to a certain special class of strata called regular strata.  He will also investigate the geometry of the irregular monodromy map in this setting. The PI will study the Deligne-Simpson and rigidity problems for flat G-bundles with toral singularities.  He will construct de Rham analogues of Yun's generalized Kloosterman sheaves and show that they are rigid. Furthermore, the PI will show that fundamental strata may be associated to objects on the representation-theoretic side of the geometric Langlands correspondence and will study the induced Langlands duality on strata.  In particular, he aims to prove that local geometric Langlands preserves depth."

The second and third workshops will cover other topics in algebraic geometry and representation theory, and will focus on the most significant current developments."

One natural problem which arose in the 19th century was to count the number of primes less than X for some variable quantity X. The resolution came in an unexpected way : this *discrete* counting problem turned out to be related to the properties of a *continuous*  function first studied by Euler but now known as the Riemann zeta function. The breakthrough hinged on a crucial property of this function discovered by Riemann, namely, that it had a hidden symmetry which related the value of the function evaluated at the point ""s"" to the value evaluated at the point ""1-s"". This hidden symmetry turns out to be merely the tip of the iceberg; there are a wide class of similar functions which exhibit similar symmetries (at least conjecturally), and these functions arise in many areas of mathematics and physics. By proving that a certain class of such functions had this symmetry, Andrew Wiles in 1994 was able to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. The PI's work aims to prove that a certain class of functions exhibit the same symmetry as the Riemann zeta function. More specifically, there are a natural collections of such functions indexed by a natural number g. When g is zero, there is a single function which was the one considered by Euler and Riemann. When g is one, the class of functions are exactly the ones studied by Wiles. The PI plans to study the functions arising when g is two. <br/><br/>An overarching theme of the PI's research (including collaborations with Emerton, Geraghty, and Venkatesh) has been the study of torsion classes in cohomology, both in the Betti cohomology of arithmetic groups and the coherent cohomology of Shimura varieties,  and their conjectural relationship with the Langlands program. The PI's work suggests that understanding torsion is at the heart of understanding reciprocity beyond Shimura varieties.  One of the main long term technical goals of the proposed project is to prove that L-functions attached to genus two curves satisfy the expected functional equations. For curves of genus one, this is the famous Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, now a theorem, which was first proved in many cases by Wiles. For curves of genus zero, this is a famous theorem of Riemann, namely, the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function. In order to approach this problem, the PI has (with David Geraghty) developed a generalization of the Taylor-Wiles method which may conceivably apply in this case. Much of his effort will be devoted to trying to overcome the numerous technical obstacles which are required to carry out this argument, including local-global compatibility for Galois representations, and vanishing of cohomology groups outside certain ranges.  More generally, the PI intends to further develop this general approach to modularity questions in other contexts, including Galois representations conjecturally associated to automorphic forms for GL(n) over the rationals. He also plans to study applications of these results to the Bloch-Kato conjecture and establishing links between K-theory, completed cohomology, and the Langlands program."

They were discovered in the mid-eighties as symmetries of one- and two-dimensional statistical mechanical models describing, for example, thin layers of ice. Amazingly, quantum groups have recently arisen as the symmetries of four-dimensional gauge theories, which describe the interaction of elementary particles such as quarks, and their five- and six-dimensional generalizations, as well as the constraints of a class of counting problems in geometry. Braid groups are another pervasive class of symmetries that arise in the mathematical study of knots, the analysis of three-dimensional shapes, the statistics of elementary particles constrained to move in two dimensions, and quantum computing. Because the presence of symmetries greatly constrains these systems, the mathematical study of the intrinsic and extrinsic structures of their groups of symmetries is key in understanding their physical and mathematical properties. This research project will lead to a deeper understanding of the relationship between the quantum groups corresponding to the plane, the sphere, and the torus. These have been traditionally thought to sit on distinct rungs in a ladder of increasing complexity. Research in progress is uncovering the striking fact that these quantum groups are, in fact, equivalent. Such equivalences are interesting in themselves, but they also allow precise characterization of the appearance of braid groups in disparate mathematical and physical contexts. <br/><br/>This research project centers on infinite-dimensional quantum groups associated to one-dimensional algebraic groups: Yangians, quantum loop algebras, and elliptic curves. The project builds on the equivalence of finite-dimensional representations of Yangians and quantum loop algebras. The PI and collaborators will promote this equivalence of finite-dimensional algebras to an equivalence between infinite-dimensional quantum loop algebras and elliptic quantum groups, thereby elucidating the structure of the latter, which is still little understood outside type A. These equivalences may be thought of as q-deformed, meromorphic versions of the Kazhdan-Lusztig equivalence between affine Lie algebras and finite-dimensional quantum groups. A key aspect of this project is the study of the meromorphic braided categories of representations of these affine quantum groups, which provides new examples of such categories. Using the newly derived equivalence, the monodromy of rational affine, trigonometric, and elliptic Casimir connections will be computed in terms of quantum Weyl group operators in a way reminiscent of the Kohno-Drinfeld quantum group. This research will have applications to Yangians, quantum loop algebras and elliptic quantum groups, quantum integrable systems, and questions in enumerative geometry."

In this theory, symmetries of the underlying space are encoded in an algebraic structure and the elements in the algebraic structure are represented by linear transformations, or, more explicitly, by matrices. Thus, a representation is basically a collection of matrices that satisfy a certain natural system of nonlinear equations. These equations are determined by the collection of symmetries that are being studied. Representations of a given structure themselves form a quite intricate and rich structure, which encodes relations (or mappings) between different representations. This higher-level structure is called the category of representations. For some types of structures (e.g., for groups, Lie algebras, and quantum groups), representations can be multiplied; in this case the corresponding categories are tensor categories because multiplication of representations is similar to multiplication of tensors. It turns out that the notion of a tensor category is very interesting in its own right, and that many tensor categories don't arise as categories of representations. This research concerns ordinary and tensor categories, some of which arise as representation categories and some of which don't, and to study connections between them. In particular, the project studies complex rank generalizations of representation categories proposed by P. Deligne. Roughly speaking, this is a generalization in which the number of elements of a set or rows of a matrix is allowed to be nonintegral. This becomes meaningful and useful when the invariants of interest turn out to be polynomials of the number of elements or rows, which is often the case. The project also involves the study of quantum groups which describe hidden symmetries of quantum systems, and yield tensor categories which lead to invariants allowing us to distinguish in-equivalent knots and links. <br/><br/>This research project will study tensor categories; Hopf algebra actions on rings; quantum groups; representation theory in complex rank; Hecke algebras, Cherednik algebras, symplectic reflection algebras; noncommutative algebra; and Poisson homology. The PI's plan is as follows. (1) Develop a theory of actions of finite dimensional Hopf algebras on division algebras (in particular, fields) and apply it to proving non-existence statements for Hopf actions, develop a theory of extensions of tensor categories, classify unipotent categories, and classify fiber functors and module categories for the small quantum group. (2) Study a discrete analog of the monodromy theorem of Toledano Laredo for the Casimir connection, using dynamical Weyl groups; trace functions for quantum affine algebras; and signatures of representations of quantum groups for |q|=1.  (3) Develop the ideas of P. Deligne, and extend representation theories of various classical structures (containing the symmetric group S(n) or classical Lie groups GL(n), O(n), Sp(2n)) to complex values of n.  (4) Study the representation theory of double Yangians, of Cherednik algebras on curves, on elliptic algebras, and on signatures of representations of rational Cherednik algebras. (5) Supervise the work of undergraduate and high school students on the lower central series of associative algebras."

Algebraic Geometry is the study of the solutions of polynomial equations in several variables.  As polynomials arise in every topic that can be studied numerically, algebraic geometry plays a central role within mathematics and has close ties to the sciences.  The field traces its roots back to the foundations of mathematics, has led to some of the most significant mathematical accomplishments in the past hundred years, and continues to be a burgeoning and vital field today. Within the field of algebraic geometry, complex algebraic geometry plays a special role. Namely, the complex structure of the solution sets allows for a wide range of techniques, including those from geometry, analysis, and topology. Some of the most powerful techniques involve the use of Hodge theory, which uses harmonic theory on compact manifolds to relate the topology, complex structure, and algebraic properties of the solutions sets. Recently, the connections with physics have played an increasingly important role in algebraic geometry. Many questions in physics can be phrased naturally in the language of differential geometry.  Through deep and surprising connections that exist between differential geometry and complex algebraic geometry, some of these questions can be addressed using the techniques of algebraic geometry.  Questions posed by physicists have been solved using techniques developed by algebraic geometers.  In turn, recent developments in physics have led to astonishing new results and open problems in algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>The purpose of the workshop is to survey the recent developments in the field of complex algebraic geometry with a focus on the following 3 main topics: (1) Topology and geometry of algebraic surfaces and 4-manifolds, (2) Vector bundles and G-bundles, and (3) Geometric applications of Hodge theory. These are central topics in the field of complex algebraic geometry, that have seen a number of interesting recent developments, and lie at the intersection of a number of fields of mathematics, but which have been less well represented lately in terms of workshops. The workshop will bring together some of the leading experts in the field, as well as a number of young researchers, who will further propel developments in these directions.

The proof of Fermat's last theorem included verification of a small part of the Langlands program, a vast web of conjectures involving disparate areas of mathematics, which, in this case, connected Galois representations and automorphic forms and the L-functions of elliptic curves. The investigator will pursue research directions that involve strong global techniques to study automorphic forms and Galois representations. These may include methods such as the trace formula, Shimura varieties, p-adically completed cohomology, or the Taylor-Wiles-Kisin patching construction. <br/><br/>This research project will address the following topics. (1) The Langlands-Kottwitz approach to the cohomology of Shimura varieties of abelian type with good reduction in full generality; (2) Arithmetic statistics for families of automorphic representations and their L-functions; (3) The endoscopic classification for representations of local and global unitary groups that are not quasi-split; and (4) p-adic Langlands program beyond GL(2,Qp). The common theme of the investigator's research is to obtain strong consequences from these techniques via a clear understanding of interactions between local and global theories. The Langlands-Kottwitz method is a fundamental component of the Langlands program, and its completion for Shimura varieties of abelian type will not only be a milestone but also lead to further arithmetic applications. The study of families of L-functions makes a connection with random matrix theory and would shed light on families of algebraic varieties. The project on unitary groups settles an interesting case of Langlands functoriality as well as the local Langlands classification with several expected applications in arithmetic, which rely essentially on the use of (often non-quasi-split) unitary groups. The continued effort on the p-adic Langlands program aiming at general groups would have growing impact and open up new research directions."

Broadly speaking, representation theory attempts to realize abstract algebraic objects in concrete terms, usually via collections of matrices or other well-understood constructs. The philosophy is that to better explore the behavior of a group (arising as symmetries of objects) or an algebra (arising as functions between objects) or any other pertinent algebraic structure, one can start by characterizing all manners in which such a structure can act upon a set.  Writing down such a characterization can be a tremendously difficult problem, but there are fields of mathematics that can lead to deeper understanding of these actions, including commutative algebra.  This conference will examine the data that can be gleaned about representation theory from this point of view. The conference will seek to disseminate recent results while inviting the next generation of junior researchers to take part in new developments.  Experts will share theoretical progress and lend perspective to the questions, and early career participants will discuss their contributions through poster presentations.

The aim of this conference is to address several specific questions and a number of problems that have evolved from these geometric approaches."

We mention, for example, recent work establishing special cases of the p-adic local Langlands correspondence; the proof that most hyperelliptic curves of odd degree have just one rational point; developments on non-abelian Coleman integration and integral points on curves; work on the fundamental curve of p-adic Hodge theory; and recent results on perfectoid spaces.

One can consider higher dimensional versions of this type of question: for example, how many Pythagorean triples (positive integers with x^2+y^2=z^2) with hypotenuse at most Z have area with at most 10 prime factors?  This particular question can be phrased in terms of counting points (x,y,z) for which xy/2 has at most 10 prime factors in an orbit of a certain group acting on (3,4,5).  In this problem, the group involved is ""big"" and one can use classical methods to approach it.  However, in the case where the underlying group is ""thin"" (as it is in the beautiful theory of Apollonian packings), one must appeal to much more modern tools, namely the Affine Sieve developed by Bourgain-Gamburd-Sarnak in 2011.  The PI proposes to study not only the arithmetic properties of orbits of specific interesting groups (such as the Apollonian group), but also to investigate properties of thin groups in general: for example, how does one tell if a given matrix group is thin?  Should one expect a random finitely generated matrix group to be thin?  These questions toy with undecidability and require an intricate combination of tools from various fields -- geometry, number theory, combinatorics -- to tackle.  In addition the PI proposes to develop several computer programs to determine the answers to some of these and related questions with high accuracy.<br/><br/>Thin subgroups of GL(n,Z) are those which are of infinite index in the Z-points of their Zariski closure in GL(n,C).  In contrast to arithmetic groups, the counterparts to thin groups which are prevalent, say, in the theory of automorphic forms, there are many unanswered core questions on thin groups which are essential in applications to the number theory of thin groups.   A pressing such question is how to tell if a given finitely generated group is thin, as well as whether thin groups are generic in some sense.  These two questions have been answered in a few situations, and the PI proposes to answer them in much higher generality.  The PI seeks to answer these questions in the subclass of thin monodromy groups.  Furthermore, the PI's proposed program will delve deeply into the geometry inherent to the groups in question, proving various theorems on thin groups which will bring them more in line with what is known on arithmetic groups.  The PI also seeks to develop various computer algorithms which would predict various properties of a group given its generators, from Zariski density to thinness.  Keeping in mind that the motivation for the current interest in thin groups stems from number theory, the PI also proposes to work on the arithmetic side of thin groups, generalizing some of the PI's previous results about the Apollonian group to a much larger class of groups."

The PI is currently supervising two Ph.D. students from Georgia Tech and one Ph.D. student from UC Berkeley, in addition to one undergraduate research student and two high school students, each of whom is working on projects related to this project.  The PI also has been involved in a number of mathematical outreach activities, including an online course on Number Theory and Cryptography for gifted high school students, and he writes a popular math blog.  These activities will be continued in this project, integrating ideas from the current research whenever feasible.  The project will also contribute to the dissemination of mathematical ideas through conference organization and publication of proceedings.  <br/><br/>The primary intellectual merit of the project is that it will increase our understanding of Berkovich spaces, tropical geometry, combinatorics, and complex dynamics, and unearth new relationships between these different areas of research.  Berkovich spaces --  the modern incarnation of the pioneering early twentieth century work of Kurt Hensel on ""p-adic numbers"" -- have in recent years found applications to numerous areas of mathematical research, including algebraic geometry, number theory, and complex dynamics (where they can be used to study fractals such as the Mandelbrot set).  Berkovich spaces are also intimately connected with tropical geometry, a relatively new and very active area of research with applications to number theory, algebraic geometry, statistics, biology, and physics.  One can think of tropical geometry as a simplified model classical algebraic geometry in which the set of common solutions to a system of polynomial equations is replaced by the set of common solutions to a much simpler system of linear inequalities.   Surprisingly -- and rather mysteriously -- the tropical simplification remembers much more information about the original solutions than one might originally expect.  The investigator's previous work involved unexpected new applications of Berkovich spaces and tropical geometry, and this project will build on and significantly advance that work."

The most commonly encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum circuit model, requires challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the hardware to be of practical value, due to local interactions of the system with the surrounding environment. The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. This research project studies mathematically the application of topological phases of matter to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit in quantum computation.<br/><br/>In this project the investigators study mathematical models for topological phases, focusing on their applications to topological quantum computation.  Topological phases of matter in two spatial dimensions are well-described in the framework of modular categories, but relatively little is known in three spatial dimensions.  A large part of this project is devoted to developing appropriate mathematical models in three spatial dimensions and analyzing the corresponding computational paradigms.  Specifically, the project will study (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories and representations of the loop braid group, and symmetry enriched topological order and gauging symmetry.  In addition, because locality and universality are two desirable properties for quantum computation that are manifested in the representations of the braid group, this project also aims to formulate conjectures characterizing when these properties hold and to verify and adapt these conjectures where appropriate to better characterize physical and computational aspects.  To compare the computational power of topological quantum computers to that of classical computers, the project investigates the complexity of the most natural computation in this setting: topological invariants."

The central objects of interest in Algebraic Geometry are algebraic varieties, namely the loci of solutions of polynomial equations in many variables. Roughly, the idea is to study algebraic varieties ""indirectly,"" by using certain ""homological"" invariants associated to geometric objects on them -- for example, differential forms. The technique of the derived category was developed in Verdier's thesis, under the guidance of Grothendieck, in 1967. The original motivation was the need to find a proper foundation for Grothendieck's duality theory, which provides non-trivial relations among the above mentioned invariants. More recently, the theory of derived categories has found important and deep applications beyond the original motivation and even outside Algebraic Geometry; in particular, to Representation Theory, Symplectic Geometry, and High Energy Physics.The present proposal builds indeed on the interaction with these disciplines -- notably on the work of Kontsevich, Bondal, Orlov, Bridgeland, Kuznetsov among others -- to deduce new results in Algebraic Geometry and other areas."

This project joins together the very different realms of dynamical systems and of number theory. Diophantine problems, which ask about the set rational number solutions to polynomial equations, have been a major theme in number theory from ancient times to the present day. On the other hand, the study of dynamical systems has arisen far more recently, exhibiting not only a purely mathematical beauty but also spectacular computer drawings of fractals and related sets. This project draws on, builds on, and joins together both fields. In addition, as in three earlier successful projects, the investigator plans to supervise some students in an REU summer research project to aid in their mathematical training. Any computational data produced in the REU will be published or posted on the web, for the benefit of the larger research community. Naturally, any results will also be disseminated via websites such as ArXiv and publication in mathematical journals. In addition, the PI is currently writing a graduate-level textbook on dynamics in one non-archimedean variable, as the field has too few expository texts today.<br/><br/>One key class of problems concerns Galois actions on non-archimedean dynamical systems, related to the central number theory problem of understanding the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers. On the one hand, non-archimedean dynamics provides the local information needed in arithmetic dynamics, which in turn realizes itself as a particular kind of Diophantine problem.  A second class of problems concerns the ergodic properties, especially the entropy, of such dynamical systems; the entropy is a number that measures the amount of chaos and unpredictability in the system. These two topics are tied together by the study of Julia sets in Berkovich spaces, which are technical objects that, in the past decade, have proven to be of central importance in the study of non-archimedean dynamics. The project also draws on tools from complex dynamics, ergodic theory, and non-archimedean analysis.  The problems to be studied branch into new areas but are continuations of rich theories with long and storied histories. In particular, the Galois action problem promises to provide new (dynamical) tools for attacking the study of absolute Galois groups, while the study of the associated entropy issues promise to provide new examples in the study of the ergodic theory of dynamical systems."

This problem (the basis of the subject of knot theory) has implications in physics (quantum theory), chemistry (molecular knots) and biology (knotting of DNA).  A central tool in classifying knots, and indeed in many topological questions, is to assign an invariant to a knot:  two knots are then different if their invariants are different.  The goal is find robust invariants which can distinguish different knots.  This project explores new types of knot invariants and continues the trend of using tools from algebra to define and investigate knot invariants.  The PI will use techniques from the mathematical fields of algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory. The focus of the project is on the class of knots and links that arise from intersecting an algebraic curve in the plane with a small sphere centered at the singularity of the curve (such knots and links are called algebraic). In this project the PI will study the interaction between the topological invariants of algebraic knots and links and certain algebraic and combinatorial objects associated to the corresponding curve.<br/><br/>Quantum knot invariants have proven to be a powerful tool in low-dimensional topology.  To every knot one can associate a polynomial with integer coefficients in one variable (as in the Alexander polynomial or the Jones polynomial) or in two variables (as in the HOMFLY polynomial).  It has recently been discovered by the PI and his collaborators that for torus knots all coefficients in the HOMFLY polynomial are in fact nonnegative.  To prove this fact, certain representations of the rational Cherednik algebra were studied and it was shown that the dimensions of some graded subspaces match the HOMFLY coefficients.  Khovanov and Rozansky introduced another collection of vector spaces, called HOMFLY homology, such that the HOMFLY coefficients are presented as alternating sums of their dimensions.  The similarity of the two constructions suggests that for a torus knot Khovanov-Rozansky homology may be isomorphic to a representation of the rational Cherednik algebra, equipped with an extra grading (or filtration).  This conjecture has been verified in many examples, but remains open in general.  The PI plans to use the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras for the construction of explicit combinatorial and geometric models for the Khovanov-Rozansky homology of torus knots, and their generalizations to algebraic knots and links.  Other knot homology theories, such as Heegaard-Floer homology, will also be studied."

Specific research questions will include: How to interpret moduli spaces of K3 surfaces with level structure geometrically? To what extent can these be organized using notions of derived equivalence for K3 surfaces and their twisted analogs? Can these techniques be used to evaluate Brauer-Manin obstructions explicitly? Given two derived-equivalent K3 surfaces, how are their Diophantine properties related, especially over local fields? For del Pezzo fibrations over curves, how are spaces of rational curves governed by cohomological invariants? As the numerical invariants of the fibrations vary, what inductive structures are shown by the spaces of rational curves?  These will be addressed using deformation-theoretic properties of rational curves, structural descriptions of cones of effective curves arising from Bridgeland stability conditions, and classifications of degenerate fibers of K3 fibrations."

The Principal Investigator plans to investigate universal properties of such families in terms of various notions of negativity in curvature. Some of the problems to be studied are longstanding ones in algebraic and complex geometry. Another line of research is on the classification of some special geometric objects known as fake compact Hermitian symmetric spaces. These objects provide interesting geometric models for studying a wide range of problems from different areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, differential geometry, number theory, and representation theory. <br/><br/>More specifically, the Principal Investigator will pursue research in several directions in algebraic and complex geometry. In the first part of the project, he intends to apply recently-developed tools involving generalized Weil-Petersson metrics to understand various hyperbolicity properties of specific families of polarized manifolds, including the hyperbolicity for families of Kahler Ricci flat manifolds, families of special log-general type manifolds, and families of general-type manifolds. In particular, he will investigate a conjecture of Viehweg about log-general type properties of moduli spaces of canonically polarized manifolds. In the second part, he plans to complete a collaborative project on the classification of arithmetic fake compact Hermitian symmetric spaces, a natural continuation of earlier work on fake projective planes. In addition, he will study problems related to these fake structures, such as the investigation of exceptional collections on fake projective planes from the point of view of derived categories, the characterization of the universal covering of a complex exotic quadric or a fake quadric, and the understanding of geometric properties of Cartwright-Steger surfaces."

Number theory is among the oldest branches of mathematics; its applications to technology are prevalent and vital for communication systems, data processing, and computational algorithms. The goals of this project are driven by landmark problems on arithmetic families. Families arise when assembling and studying together objects that share common features. Families are often crucial even if one is a priori interested in a single object and thereby are central to the recent resolution of certain difficult algebraic and asymptotic questions. These goals of the project are complemented by concrete initiatives targeted at undergraduate and graduate education that are centered on developing effective writing and communication skills. In collaboration with the Institute for Writing at Cornell University, the PI will organize a monthly seminar on writing, regular writing groups, and an online wiki that will serve as a communication platform and access to resources for the general public. The PI will continue to mentor undergraduate research projects, disseminating knowledge and discoveries while promoting learning through the investigation of open problems.<br/><br/>This research project aims to develop a quantitative theory of the asymptotics of special functions, such as characters of representations. The long-term goal is to solve problems on automorphic periods, subconvexity and non-vanishing of L-functions, and arithmetic statistics of families.  The trace formula is a fundamental tool in number theory and the development of the Langlands program in particular. Even though there has been enormous progress, important questions remain open, notably analytic aspects that are critical for many applications. These questions are now ripe for investigation following the works of Arthur and others. An immediate outcome of this research is a Sato-Tate equi-distribution theorem for families of Maass forms on GL(n), resolving a long-standing problem.  The understanding of the absolute convergence of the geometric side of the trace formula is currently one of the most urgent problems in the subject. A second focus is on trace characters, which are a central concern in representation theory, such as the local Langlands correspondence and functorial transfers. The PI will work on quantitative aspects that have seen little progress since the seminal work of Harish-Chandra. Related to this, the PI will continue work on Whittaker periods, notably towards a conjecture of Zuckerman on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. The proposed activity is to bring methods from analysis, geometry, representation theory, and mathematical physics in their full strength, notably symplectic geometry and integrable systems; an immediate goal is the systematic study of the quantitative aspects of coadjoint orbits."

Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest and richest fields of study in mathematics, dating back to the fifth century B.C. It is concerned with understanding geometric objects, called algebraic varieties, defined by the vanishing of polynomial functions, like circles or hyperbolas. Over the centuries, a vast array of technical tools have arisen for studying algebraic varieties. Relatively recently, homological algebra and mirror symmetry from physics have provided impressive insight. Even so, pressing questions persist. One in particular: What is the precise extent of the differences that can be detected between two varieties when using homological algebra or physics? This project seeks to elucidate this and related questions.<br/><br/>The project focuses on a new tool for comparing derived categories: windows. Windows are a robust framework for establishing derived equivalences and semi-orthogonal decompositions, but, being very new, they are still developing. The project seeks to push the theory of windows by generalizing the framework and by reinterpreting the functors arising in terms of the geometry of compactifications and kernels. The project seeks to apply this new understanding to symplectic topology through mirror symmetry. Additionally, the project proposes to relate algebraic geometry to noncommutative algebra through the language of kernels and to use Hall algebras to study generation-style invariants of triangulated categories."

Each day of the conference starts with expository lectures by known international experts in various fields. There will also be student presentations explaining their own results. The rest of the lectures will be traditional conference talks. The goal of the expository talks and student talks is to make current research in algebra accessible to graduate students and postdocs and to give beginning researchers a platform to display their achievements. The meetings also introduce international leaders in the field to young US researchers, who become better known in the world and make outside contacts. The conference will help make current topics in new branches of algebra more accessible and more popular in the US. This successful yearly event will continue to expand its participation and extend support to more young researchers.  <br/><br/>In the twenty-first century, Auslander-Reiten theory has had considerable new impact in many fields; particularly important is the fact that the cluster theory of Fomin and Zelevinsky, which is connected to so many different fields, is also intimately related to the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. The Maurice Auslander International Conference is intended to be a center of activity for this area of algebra in the United States. The meeting brings together mathematicians from representation theory and related areas of algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and mathematical physics.  This conference places special emphasis on:  Representation theory of algebras, usually noncommutative; Relation of representation theory of algebras to other fields such as representations of groups, vector bundles over weighted projective space, the topology of surfaces, Poisson geometry, and cluster structures on Grassmannians;  Application of techniques from the representation theory of algebras to related fields such as invariant theory and combinatorics;  Applications of results from other fields in order to motivate new methods in the representation theory of algebras in terms of both problem solving and development of new questions, in particular for cluster algebras, which were invented to study Lusztig's canonical bases arising from quantized enveloping algebras, and applications to quantum field theory such as the Cecotti-Vafa theory of BPS quivers. <br/><br/>More information can be found at the conference web site www.northeastern.edu/martsinkovsky/p/MADL/MADL.html"

Historically, equations having extra symmetry have been a focus of inquiry since the automorphisms of the corresponding geometric object provide extra structure which helps illuminate the set of solutions. The PI's research is about functions on curves defined by polynomial equations with coefficients in a finite field. The goal is to analyze invariants of algebraic structures attached to these curves, to determine how these invariants vary across parameter spaces for the curves, and to investigate which exceptional structures occur. As a broader impact of the proposal, the PI will collaborate with the Fort Collins Museum of Discovery to build activity kits about cryptography for children. The PI is also involved with other initiatives that have broader impacts: the PI is a leader of the WIN network, whose goal is to vitalize the research careers of women in number theory via new research collaborations; and the PI was a co-organizer of the Arizona Winter School from 2010-2015.   <br/><br/>Curves and abelian varieties exhibit new phenomena in positive characteristic p. These phenomena typically arise due to the underlying presence of morphisms of degree p. They lead to important cohomological invariants, such as the p-rank, Newton polygon, and Ekedahl-Oort type. The goal of the PI's proposal is to prove: (non)-existence results about abelian varieties and curves with given invariants; and structural results about the stratifications induced by the invariants on various moduli spaces. In particular, the PI will investigate supersingular abelian varieties and Jacobians; the interplay between automorphisms and p-torsion invariants; formulae, akin to the Deuring-Shafarevich formula, for the variation in more refined invariants of the Ekedahl-Oort type in terms of ramification data; and rational points of curves over non-algebraically closed fields. Key techniques include: intersection of divisors on moduli spaces; degeneration to singular curves of compact type; results about monodromy of families of curves; cohomology calculations (de Rham or of resolutions); and actions of Frobenius and Vershiebung."

Number theorists study arithmetic objects by attaching to them invariants in order to make them clearly visible. Each important object of interest in number theory has associated to it certain mathematical objects called its L-functions. As they are functions of complex or p-adic variables, one can evaluate them at integers, getting concrete numbers associated with the object under study. There are two fundamental problems concerning invariants in number theory:<br/>A.  Find a relation (or an identity) among two or more arithmetic invariants of different nature;<br/>B.  Distinguish between the non-triviality and triviality of important arithmetic invariants.<br/>This project will develop an algebraic theory dealing with Problem B. In particular, the research will study non-triviality of values of zeta functions and their derivatives.  By a well-known principle (for example, the Birch-Swinnerton Dyer conjecture), these L-values encode solutions of deep Diophantine problems, and if we can show non-vanishing or vanishing of zeta values, we should be able to predict how many rational solutions modular and elliptic equations have.  <br/><br/>This research project aims to develop a systematic theory for distinguishing between the non-triviality and triviality of important arithmetic invariants.  Earlier work of the investigator and a collaborator developed new understanding of p-adic Galois representations and Hecke algebras, p-adic analytic families of modular forms and their L-functions, and analysis of arithmetic invariants.  This research project will follow on these developments.  For example, the project will investigate how to measure the size of the image of modular Galois representation with coefficients in a big Hecke algebra (a nontriviality question concerning the image).   As another example, the work will study non-vanishing (and non-vanishing modulo a prime)  of p-adic L-functions and non-triviality of modular attempts of creating rational points in rational elliptic curves and abelian varieties."

The first direction of research is the development of an algorithm for computing signatures of invariant hermitian forms for the affine Hecke algebra, motivated by the recent results obtained in the setting of real reductive groups. A second direction concerns basic abstract harmonic analysis problems for (graded) affine Hecke algebras, and certain applications of Dirac operator theory in this setting.<br/><br/>The project falls in the area of representation theory of Lie groups. Lie groups, named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, are mathematical objects underlying the symmetries inherent in a system, and their representations, i.e., the ways in which the Lie groups can manifest themselves, have had an important impact in theoretical physics and number theory.

The other institutions that are actively involved in these events are the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The various research groups at these institutions have compatible interests, but at the same time complementary expertise, and collaborations are already ongoing. Many of the national and international experts in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry will be brought together, but there will also be ample opportunities for young researchers to present and discuss their work. In addition, every meeting will include a panel discussion about professional issues. This will help guide junior researchers through the critical transition from graduate school to academic employment.<br/><br/>Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry are vibrant fields with rich and ever evolving connections among them and to other areas of mathematics: Intriguing parallels between algebraic phenomena in prime characteristic and birational geometry are being explored, and maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules have found applications in physics. There have been important advances in the minimal model program, and in the study of free resolutions through the solution of the Boij-Soderberg conjecture. The central Midwest has a long tradition of excellence in these areas and a high concentration of commutative algebraists and algebraic geometers. Areas of common interests among our groups include birational geometry, Rees algebras, multiplier ideals, liaison theory, the homological conjectures, Hilbert functions, local cohomology, and combinatorial methods. The topic of the conference at Purdue will be Recent Advances in Commutative Algebra and its Interaction with Algebraic Geometry, with particular emphasis on multiplier ideals, characteristic p methods, and the homological conjectures. The meeting in Kentucky will focus on Free Resolutions and Representation Theoretic Methods. The emphasis of the conference at the Center for Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame will be Multiplicity Theory and Implicitization Problems."

Geometric, topological, and probabilistic methods are often used in the study of groups and dynamical systems. The conference will provide an opportunity to all participants to keep abreast of recent developments simultaneously in all five of these components (geometry, topology, probability, group theory, dynamics), with special emphasis on their interplay.  There will be close to 100 participants, who will present 16 invited talks and 45 contributed talks. At least half of the contributed talks will be presented by researchers in early stages of their careers and graduate students. The mixture of participants, ranging from some of the world's most established researchers to postdocs and graduate students, will provide a sense of community and continuity. The conference, blending research and education, will stimulate healthy communication flow and collaboration between researchers in different areas and in different generations for years to come.<br/><br/>The wealth of ideas and applications related to the use of geometric and/or probabilistic approaches in group theory and dynamical systems is immense, and it practically touches all other areas in mathematics. Many important open problems in group theory and dynamical systems are essentially related to asymptotic, geometric, analytic or probabilistic concepts. The conference will showcase the recent advances and achievements related to such problems and it will provide strong momentum and set directions for further research in such diverse areas as amenability, virtual Haken conjecture, CAT(0) cube complexes, random groups and random subgroups, Borel equivalence relations and cost, sofic groups, interval exchange groups, iterated monodromy groups, and many others.

The investigator plans to study quantities associated to Anderson-Drinfeld motives and to Mahler measures of multivariable polynomials in order to exhibit concretely this interplay between analytic and arithmetic information. Several parts of the project lead naturally to problems for student research. <br/><br/>For problems on special values over function fields, the investigator will study periods and logarithms of Anderson-Drinfeld motives in positive characteristic so as to discover new results about values of zeta functions, multiple zeta functions, Goss L-functions, and Drinfeld polylogarithms. One line of inquiry will be to apply the Galois theory of Frobenius difference equations to find new results on algebraic independence of L-values and multiple zeta values over arbitrary base rings. Another path of investigation will be to uncover log-algebraic power series identities for Drinfeld modules and their tensor powers so as to produce new formulas for values of Goss L-functions and their twists that illustrate their connections with Taelman class modules.

Reciprocity laws are found in abundance in many disciplines, ranging from mathematics and physics to engineering, network theory, and social sciences. The two sets of objects may a priori have no way of seeing each other and that makes such laws truly fascinating. One of the deepest examples of reciprocity are those appearing in number theory, a rather general form of which is due to Artin and Langlands, for which the famous ""Quadratic Reciprocity Law"" is just a first example. <br/><br/>Such reciprocity laws suggest an indexing of certain presentations of ""Galois groups"" by complex matrices, objects of arithmetic nature, with infinite dimensional presentations of general linear groups over local fields, objects of analytic nature, preserving certain complex functions (root numbers and L-functions) attached to them by totally separate means. An important part of this project is to show that this reciprocity is robust by developing an approach to establishing this equality for all such factors.  More precisely, this project suggests an approach to establishing the equality of certain Artin factors (Artin root numbers and L-functions) with those obtained from analytic methods, e.g., those coming from Langlands-Shahidi method. These will carry information from one side to the other including equality of conductors, root numbers and possibly R-groups. There will be consequences in representation theory and automorphic forms such as many cases of tempered L-packet and its converse, generic A-packet conjectures, as well as normalization of intertwining operators by means of Artin factors as demanded by Arthur and Langlands and the conjecture of Lapid and Mao as well as others. As another project, one hopes to obtain results on p-adic L-functions by means of Fourier coefficients of Eisenstein series where their complex versions show up. Certain intertwining relations for covering groups will also be established, as well as study of Weyl's law by means of twisted trace formula as part of a student doctorate thesis. The project suggests training of graduate students through teaching courses, mentoring, and advising."

A first research objective is to study the birational geometry of the Grothendieck-Knudsen moduli space of stable rational curves, in particular, via arithmetic techniques; a sub-project is to develop the Arakelov theory of this space. A second objective is to prove that 2-Fano manifolds are rationally simply connected. This is an analogue of the celebrated Kollr-Miyaoka-Mori result that Fano manifolds are rationally connected. Using results of de Jong and Starr, a consequence will be a generalization of Tsen's theorem, namely, that a 2-Fano manifold defined over the function field of a surface has a rational point. This would give a natural geometric condition for the existence of rational points.<br/><br/>The broader context of the project is the area of algebraic geometry, currently one of the most active branches of mathematics, with widespread applications throughout mathematics and reaching into physics and engineering. Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, which are geometric objects given by the solutions of systems of polynomial equations. The variation of algebraic varieties is captured by the so-called moduli spaces, which are themselves algebraic varieties with a very rich structure. In the two main themes of this project, moduli spaces play a central role, both as spaces whose geometry we investigate, and as tools for answering questions about whether certain systems of polynomial equations have solutions or not. The expectation is that the projects will significantly impact other areas of mathematics, especially arithmetic geometry."

The local Langands correspondence is a mysterious conjectural relationship between two kinds of symmetries -- a geometric one, offered by groups of matrices with coefficients in real, complex, or p-adic fields, and an arithmetic one, offered by the Galois group of the real or a p-adic field. The last decade has seen a tremendous progress in this area, but the theory is still largely conjectural. The PI and his collaborators will attempt to establish new cases of the conjectural correspondence through the use of type-theory, as well as to elucidate the connection between types and the cohomology of Rapoport-Zink spaces, in particular in the case of low-rank unitary groups. The already existing constructions will be investigated more deeply using the theory of endoscopy. Furthermore, the PI and his collaborators will study both the local and the global Langlands correspondences for unitary groups of arbitrary rank, using the trace-formula techniques developed by Arthur.<br/><br/>The Langlands program brings together several areas of mathematics, including arithmetic, geometry, analysis, and symmetry. By establishing deep and surprising ties between them, it provides the means for answering very hard questions about the arithmetic of numbers, as exemplified by the recent proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. A sophisticated understanding of the arithmetic of numbers is in turn fundamental to many recent technological developments, including error-correcting codes, compression, encryption and secure communication. This project aims at deepening our understanding of the Langlands program by exploring connections between several approaches to it, as well as by exploiting techniques which have only recently become available."

The conference will bring together leading experts and outstanding young researchers, providing an opportunity to report on and discuss exciting recent advances in the field. It is expected that approximately 80 mathematicians will attend the conference. The meeting will play an important role in the further development of the subject by helping to identify interesting and challenging open problems and new applications. The location and timing has been chosen to be compatible with an independent conference on ""Finite Simple Groups and their Applications"" to be held the previous week at the University of Warwick, UK.<br/><br/>The subject of the conference is related to the study of finite simple groups, which is a classical area of algebra that has been at the heart of research in group theory for two centuries. Simple groups are the basic building blocks of all finite groups, and the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG) is widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematical achievements of the 20th century, involving many researchers over a period of many years. This fundamental theorem has led to many interesting new problems in group theory and beyond, and the development of powerful techniques to solve them. In the last thirty years or so, post-CFSG, there have been great advances in our understanding of the subgroup structure and representation theory of simple groups. These topics are of fundamental importance in their own right, and they are essential for many applications. The meeting will focus on the theory of simple groups, with a particular emphasis on their subgroup structure and representations. The interplay between finite and algebraic simple groups will be a common theme, and we will focus on applications, both in group theory and in other areas of mathematics such as computational algebra, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, number theory, and model theory.

Algebraic geometry is also a tool for applications, since physical objects can be described by polynomial equations, and relations between concepts in science and engineering may be modeled by polynomials. Whatever their source, once polynomials enter the picture, the theoretical base, trove of classical examples, and modern computational tools of algebraic geometry may be brought to bear on the problem at hand. This research project aims to strengthen the role of algebraic geometry as a tool for applications, in two ways. First, a major focus will be on developing the interface between algebraic geometry and applications. Second is work on combinatorial aspects of algebraic geometry, for this develops tools and ideas to better understand objects in algebraic geometry with special structure, and these highly structured objects are those that appear most commonly in the interactions between algebraic geometry and other fields, both within mathematics and in the applied sciences. This project will also involve training of students and postdocs, the investigator's outreach activities at the local level through a mathematics circle, and his continued interaction with mathematics in Nigeria. <br/><br/>Oftentimes, objects from algebraic geometry that arise in other parts of mathematics or science have strong combinatorial structures (e.g., toric varieties or Grassmannians) or else the application demands real solutions. Consequently, the research in areas of combinatorial and real algebraic geometry in this project will serve both to advance our basic understanding of these topics and to help build a foundation for applications. This project involves research in three topics within algebraic geometry: real toric varieties, tropical geometry, and Schubert calculus. In each of these areas the investigator will work with collaborators and students on projects ranging from developing foundations to understanding key examples to work inspired by problems from applications. Of particular note are the goals of developing a rich and robust theory of irrational toric varieties, understanding the geometry and topology of complements of tropical objects, establishing positivity in type C Schubert calculus via a useful theory of shifted dual equivalence, and understanding Galois groups in the Schubert calculus. <br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory and Combinatorics programs."

On the one hand, the principal investigator is investigating Shimura varieties, whose definition itself involves both geometry and representation theory. These objects lie at the center of modern number theory. In their simplest cases, the modular curves, they have been studied for more than one hundred years and were essential to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, one of the most famous and oldest conjectures in mathematics. On the other hand, the investigator's research results in recent years have become useful in algebraic curve cryptosystems. These are essential to the safety of electronic commerce and communication. The investigator will continue to work on these types of applications. <br/><br/>In one of the projects joint with Bruinier, Howard, Kudla, and Rapoport, the investigator aims to prove that a generating function of arithmetic Chow cycles in the Shimura varieties of unitary type is modular. As an application, he will prove more non-Abelian cases of the Colmez Conjecture. In another project, the investigator will try to understand the L-function side of the Colmez conjecture and obtain clues on how to attack the general case. In yet another project, the investigator will study, with collaborators, CM values of some interesting Borcherds projects. These have two purposes: one is to prove some classical conjectures, and the other is an application to cryptosystems."

In recent years many new mathematical subjects have been created due to the influence of attempts to study the nature of subatomic particles. One important example of such new mathematics is the rapidly-developing subject of Gromov-Witten theory. One reason for the importance of Gromov-Witten theory is its deep connections with many other subjects, such as string theory, integrable systems of partial differential equations, counting of geometric objects, and parameter spaces for geometric objects. Another example is mirror symmetry, which is a duality arising from physics and is interpreted in mathematics as the equivalence of two seemingly completely unrelated geometric objects. Such a highly nontrivial correspondence is extremely interesting in its own right, while also important for theoretical physics. This research project will explore several key questions in the deep relations between Gromov-Witten theory and mirror symmetry. The research will further advance knowledge about mirror symmetry, enumeration of holomorphic disks, and the geometry of parameter spaces of surfaces, and it will also further promote the existing interactions between algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, combinatorics, mathematical physics, and string theory. <br/><br/>This research project aims to study several aspects of open Gromov-Witten theory and mirror symmetry: calculations of open Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds; understanding the relations between mirror maps defined using period integrals and open Gromov-Witten invariants; proving mirror symmetry statements for open Gromow-Witten invariants of symplectic toric orbifolds; and studying the behaviors of open Gromov-Witten invariants under birational transformations. The PI plans to study open Gromov-Witten invariants by relating them to other quantities, such as closed Gromov-Witten invariants, and to derive relations among open Gromov-Witten invariants. Techniques such as virtual localization, mirror theorems, analysis of Kuranishi spaces, tropical geometry, Seidel representations, and quantum differential equations will be used in the research."

It has long been known that in general one cannot hope to find exact solutions to polynomial equations, even for a single equation in one variable. Nevertheless, it is often possible to answer more qualitative questions about the set of solutions. In particular, one of the most fundamental and notoriously difficult questions in algebraic geometry is whether solutions exist at all. Motivic homotopy theory is a relatively new approach to such questions, and it has already helped solve many open problems in the past twenty years. It borrows many ideas and techniques from a different field of mathematics, topology, and successfully applies them to algebraic geometry in unexpected ways. Following this trend, this project aims to bring several fruitful ideas from topology to the world of algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This project consists of two parts. In the first part, the PI will develop equivariant motivic homotopy theory from the point of view of parametrized homotopy theory. In the second part, the PI will study highly structured commutative algebras in motivic homotopy theory and hopes to address the problem of recognizing motivic loop spaces. More specifically, the PI will lay solid foundations for equivariant motivic homotopy theory by constructing Grothendieck's six-functor formalism for fiberwise homotopy theory over algebraic stacks. The mere existence of this formalism has interesting consequences for classical invariants of stacks, like algebraic K-theory; it can also be used to construct new well-behaved cohomological invariants of algebraic stacks, and to better understand the relations between them. In the second part of this project, the PI will introduce a motivic refinement of the notion of E_infinity ring and show that many classical cohomological invariants of algebraic varieties possess this refined multiplicative structure. The PI will also introduce the related notion of motivic E_infinity space and investigate their role in a potential recognition principle for infinite motivic loop spaces. To achieve these goals, the PI will use existing as well as new methods from equivariant algebraic geometry, ordinary motivic homotopy theory, classical algebraic topology, and higher category theory."

Solutions of such systems play an important role in many areas of science and engineering, hence the proposed research has applied aspects as well. One of its objectives is to devise numerical criteria for when the solution sets of different systems of equations are ""alike,"" another one aims at constructing systems of equations that have a given geometric object, like a curve or a surface, as its solution set. This second problem is also relevant for applications in geometric modeling and computer-aided design. A third goal of the project is to further develop a fundamental tool in algebra, called ""free resolutions."" Free resolutions are a method to study complex algebraic structures by means of a possibly infinite sequence of simpler objects, namely, matrices.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the topics of this project are equisingularity theory, the implicitization problem for Rees algebras, algebraic properties of multiplier ideals, the extension to local rings of results and techniques that are inherent to the graded setting. To be more specific, a general goal in equisingularity theory is to devise fiberwise numerical criteria for when a family of analytic spaces is topologically trivial, is Whitney equisingular, or satisfies other equisingularity conditions. With Kleiman and Validashti the PI proved that a family of isolated singularities is Whitney equisingular, and hence topologically trivial, if a newly defined generalized multiplicity, the epsilon multiplicity, is constant across the family. Now the PI plans to examine which stronger equisingularity conditions the constancy of the epsilon multiplicity implies. A related, fundamental problem is to understand singularities whose Jacobian module has epsilon multiplicity zero. Equisingularity conditions are closely related to numerical criteria for integral dependence of modules, and the PI wishes to devise such a criterion based on intersection numbers. A classical problem in elimination theory is to determine the defining ideals of Rees algebras, which gives, in particular, the implicit equations of graphs and images of rational maps between projective spaces. The PI plans to work on this problem for regular maps parametrizing a surface or, more generally, for rational maps with codimension three base locus. In recent joint work with Corso, Huneke, and Polini, the PI introduced the notion of distance in free resolutions over local rings and used it to study integral closures of ideals. Now the PI proposes this notion as a substitute for the shifts in graded free resolutions, in order to extend known results from the graded to the local case -- such as criteria for the Cohen-Macaulay and Gorenstein properties of associated graded rings and bounds for the Loewy length of modules having finite projective dimension. Another of the PI's goals is tostudy algebraic properties of (Mather-Jacobian) multiplier ideals on singular varieties and to determine which ideals can be realized as multiplier ideals."

The school is the second of its kind in Latin America, with the first ELGA being held in Argentina in 2011. The school has several goals: to introduce a new generation of students and researchers to the subject of Algebraic Geometry, to present a broad view of recent developments in the area, to disseminate new problems and directions of research, to promote greater interaction among researchers and students, and to help young researchers build a network of collaborations. <br/><br/>Algebraic Geometry is a fundamental field of research, with applications and connections throughout mathematics and other sciences. The first week of the school will include four mini courses (of 5 hours each) which cover some of the most active topics in the field, as well as reflect the diversity and scope of modern Algebraic Geometry. The main speakers are prominent algebraic geometers: Robert Lazarsfeld, Olivier Debarre, Barbara Fantechi, and Burt Totaro. The second week will be a research conference, with 28 talks given by world class researchers. The hosting institution is IMPA (Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. There are 6 organizers working in several different countries: Brazil, Chile, Italy, France, Mexico, and the United States. The II ELGA is the only event in Latin America in two years devoted to Algebraic Geometry and explicitly aimed at Ph.D. students and young researchers. The organizers expect a large participation and impact for the school, as Algebraic Geometry is much on the rise in Latin America. The success of the first ELGA school, along with the high reputation of IMPA and the speakers, should guarantee a large international participation. The award funds will be used to support Ph.D. students and young researchers working in the United States.

This project lays the foundations of classical geometric  methods in category theory. Today, in  the second decade of the 21st century, modern geometry and theoretical physics are more intertwined than ever before. The convergence of ideas from mathematics and physics is accelerating at the same time as elementary particle physics is on the cusp of a profound revolution to be brought about by the new experimental results coming out of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). At the same time, a lot of mathematical work remains to be done to provide a suitable framework for the new physical theories that are being proposed. The geometric objects investigated in this project  are the foundations for such a framework: homological mirror symmetry is the mathematical realization of dualities and higher categories, the analogues of classical  manifolds, are the mathematical foundation for quantum field theories. These new flavors of geometry on which this project is based will continue to play a fundamental role in the future development of theoretical physics.<br/><br/>The proposed approach is based on the pioneering works by Seidel, Ein, Lazarsfeld, Mustata, Nakamaye, Popa, and Budur. The PIs will go further and conjecture that the categorical multiplier ideal sheaf  is  related to the Orlov spectrum of the category. Developing K-calculus and making it rigorous the PIs will break new ground in studying classical questions in Algebraic Geometry, including questions of rationality of projective varieties. In particular the PIs plan to consider  some more than hundred years old questions about nonrationality of conic bundles and four dimensional cubics. The applications go beyond the scope of Algebraic Geometry. Classical questions in Sympletcic  Geometry will be studied as well  - using invariants of Fukaya category one can try to distinguish symplectic manifolds with the same Seiberg - Witten invariants. The approach connects  K-calculus with so called tasting configurations used in the study of the existence of  Kahler-Einstein metrics. An intriguing question is that of finding a connection between Orlov spectra and the existence of  Kahler-Einstein metrics. Another direction of the project is the investigation of the connection of  K-calculus with physics, for which a starting point is the interpretation of monodromy data of the K - calculus as limited stability conditions."

Symmetries often form algebraic structures, such as associative algebras. The algebras studied in this project all have a geometric nature and originate from quantum physics. The goal is to understand representations of a given algebra, meaning ways the algebra can be represented as  linear symmetries of something else. The basic building blocks here are irreducible representations, and a large part of this project deals with describing possible irreducible representations and computing important invariants, such as their dimensions. A second important question to be addressed in this project is understanding how more complicated representations may be built from irreducible representations. <br/><br/>The project is devoted to the study of the representation theory W-algebras, rational Cherednik algebras, and quantized quiver varieties. For W-algebras, the investigator plans to classify the finite dimensional irreducible representations. For rational Cherednik algebras, the investigator plans to compute the number of simple objects in associated category O with given support. For quantized quiver varieties, the investigator plans to compute the characters of finite dimensional irreducible representations, study the structure of the corresponding category O, and produce derived equivalences as Ringel dualities for standardly stratified structures. This includes computing the dimensions of supports of irreducible modules."

The conference is centered on the topic of arithmetic and algebraic differentiation, with a special emphasis on the role of the Witt vectors. This is a rich and exotic algebraic construction that originated in the early 20th century in algebraic number theory and which, in recent decades, has played a key part in some of the most important advances in arithmetic algebraic geometry. The subject has attracted the attention of mathematical researchers from disparate fields who have traditionally worked in parallel.  A principal goal of this conference is to bring together these researchers from number theory, algebraic topology, and applied model theory to propel the study of the Witt vectors in all of these fields through this intellectual cross-fertilization.<br/> <br/>The conference will concentrate on topics related to  Witt vectors. The Witt vectors have been especially crucial in the arithmetic geometry, notably in p-adic Hodge theory.  Even more recently, in the form of the de Rham--Witt complex, the Witt vectors have had important applications in algebraic topology, especially in the work of Hesselholt-Madsen and their followers on algebraic K-theory. In the meantime, Witt vectors have grown further in number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry, perhaps most importantly in Buium's work. His key insight was that Witt vectors are closely related to certain arithmetic analogues of differential operators, and he was then able to extend large parts of classical differential algebraic geometry to an ""arithmetic differential"" algebraic geometry. Here, we take seriously the analogy that ordinary differentiation is to formal power series as arithmetic differentiation is to the Witt vectors. This program includes, most notably, extending applications in Diophantine questions over function fields to such questions over number fields. This aspect of the theory was then picked up and carried further by applied model theorists especially in the work of Blair-Macintyre-Scanlon in which Ax-Kochen-Ershov-style theorems are proven for the Witt vectors considered as a first-order structure in the language of rings augmented by the Witt-Frobenius operator and then in the work of Scanlon (and the recent extensions by Rideau) putting Buium's p-differential operators into a model theoretic context.  The work of Chatzidakis-Hrushovski on the model theory of difference fields brought out the fine structure of the algebraic part of the theory of arithmetic differential equations.  The subsequent applications of this theory to diophantine geometry by Hrushovski and Scanlon demonstrated its power and the reworking of the theory by Pink-Rssler and then by Rssler alone returned the ideas to algebraic geometry proper. As number theory, algebraic topology, and applied model theory have traditionally been quite separate fields, and it has not been easy for experts on Witt vectors and arithmetic differentiation in one of these fields to keep on top of developments in the others, even though they are working with largely the same mathematical objects. The purpose of the conference, then, is to remedy this. It will bring together researchers in these fields who study Witt vectors and arithmetic differentiation from their own points of view and for their own purposes. This will allow them to learn about the latest developments in other fields. Further, one hopes that bringing together researchers from very different traditions with very different ways of thinking about the same mathematical objects will lead to jolts forward in all of these fields.<br/><br/>Conference web site: https://math.berkeley.edu/~scanlon/aad15.html"
