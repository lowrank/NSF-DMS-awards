Originally, it treated figures defined               in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.                  Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from              analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in                 those fields.

The fundamental problem is to find presentations             for these algebras, which would solve various explicit                          combinatorial problems.  These combinatorial problems have interest             in their own right, and currently seem more likely to be solved                 than the general problem of finding presentations.  Other questions             to be considered are whether the quotient field of C(n,r) is purely             transcendental over K and what is the structure of the variety of               representations of a group G in the trace ring.                                      The research supported concerns matrix theory, ring theory and             the calculation of invariants.  In particular, this involves an old             problem of determining what mathematical functions are preserved                under various transformations.  This is of interest in many areas               of science as well as in mathematics."

A graph is a network of lines                 (""edges"") joining points (""vertices""), so that graph theory                     becomes a natural tool for studying interrelationships among                    separated entities.  Graph Theory is used not only in                           Communications Theory but in surprisingly many parts of pure and                applied mathematics, as well as in Theoretical Computer Science."

One of the major mathematical accomplishments of                the past 15 years was the classification of the finite simple                   groups.  There are 26 exceptional groups, called the sporadic                   simple groups, which did not fit into the classification scheme.                These had to be handled individually.

The first is a continuation of previous                    work on the K-theory of twisted forms of reductive group                        schemes, with the goal of computing a part of the K-cohomology                  of such schemes.  The second project is to use this                             computation of the K-theory of group schemes to get a good                      description of the K-theory of homogeneous spaces for                           reductive groups, and their twisted forms.  The third project                   is an investigation of some constructions in motivic                            cohomology.                                                                          This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory.  In                    a broad sense algebraic K-theory concerns the evolution of                      concepts from linear algebra such as basis and vector space.                    This work has significant implications for number theory and                    algebraic geometry, and promises to make exciting connections                   between a number of different areas in mathematics."

In the main, the program that will be developed will be designed to provide information about a wide variety of properties of groups. Combinatorial Group Theory is an important in abstract algebra, and with close connections to topology, logic and wide variety of other disciplines as well. Its study leads to a deeper understanding of structures underlying many aspects of science."

She will also examine certain triples of quasisimple groups of Lie type in an effort to classify the maximal subgroups of the finite classical groups. Finally she will work on extending a homomorphism of finite groups of Lie type to a morphism of suitable algebraic groups. A group is an algebraic object with a single operation defined on it. Groups occur naturally in many different areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and chemistry. During the last decade, many researchers have worked on determining the subgroup structure of finite simple groups of Lie type. The approach used in this project is to view the question on finite groups in the context of algebraic groups."

Recent ideas of Lusztig relating quantum groups and modular representations will be explored, with emphasis on injective modules. Representations arising from the cohomology of line bundles on flag varieties will be another central issue; a major question here concerns the relationship with Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for the affine Weyl group. The study of algebraic groups should provide further insight into representations of associated finite simple groups; here a number of open questions and conjectures about injective modules and decomposition behavior mod p of ordinary characters will be studied. This research is in the general area of algebraic groups. The proposed research falls under two broad headings: cohomology of line bundles on flag varieties, and injective modules. Advances along these lines would both shed light on Lusztig's conjecture, as well as point the way beyond it."
