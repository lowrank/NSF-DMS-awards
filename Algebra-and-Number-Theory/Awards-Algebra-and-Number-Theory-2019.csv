There will be a summer school June 3-7 with several lecture series to provide background material for early career participants in the conference. The overall goal of the conference is to study interactions between the two areas of mathematics in the title. <br/><br/>""Topology"" is the study of shapes that are allowed to stretch and bend. For example, a triangle and circle are considered to be topologically equivalent because one can be stretched into the other, and similarly a cube and sphere are considered topologically equivalent. ""Low dimensional topology"" studies shapes or objects in dimensions 2, 3, and 4, such as surfaces, or knotted loops in 3-dimensional space. This can be useful in other sciences; for example, DNA can be knotted, or the shape of the universe could have a nontrivial topology. ""Representation theory"" is the study of symmetries in mathematics, and at a concrete level, these symmetries often manifest themselves as solutions to systems of equations where the variables represent matrices instead of numbers. This mathematical area has also had applications in other sciences, such as symmetries of elementary particles in physics, or symmetries of molecules in<br/>chemistry. There are sophisticated mathematical techniques for taking certain spaces of solutions to polynomial equations and producing solutions to matrix equations, and recently low dimensional topology has been used to find solutions to the same equations, using completely different mathematical constructions. One of the goals of the conference is to understand this new phenomenon using ideas coming from mathematical physics. This award will fund participation of early career US scientists in this summer school and conference so they can learn about these exciting new ideas.More details about the conference are available at https://www.icms.org.uk/geometricrepresentation.php.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent breakthroughs in mathematics. Continuing a three-decade long tradition, the AFW will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and we make a particular effort to support women at all career stages. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks -- including the opportunity to give 3-minute ""speed talks"" on preliminary results -- exchanging ideas, and beginning new collaborations. In addition to the research talks, the AFW will continue the longstanding tradition of having two professional development panels on topics such as facilitating engagement and success in mathematics for underrepresented groups, preparing for the job market, and balancing professional responsibilities. To increase accessibility to a wider audience, the Workshop will begin with a one-day ""bootcamp"" to be held March 6th.  <br/><br/>Automorphic forms constitute a major area of study in number theory and related areas. One of the goals of the AFW is to promote new interactions and collaborations between researchers working in different areas concerning automorphic forms. Thus, the workshop will highlight a wide range of developments in areas including the analytic, algebraic, combinatorial, and p-adic theory of automorphic forms and related topics such as L-functions. Automorphic forms have played a key role in many breakthroughs in mathematics, including the proofs of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent),the Monstrous Moonshine Conjecture (for which Borcherds was awarded the Fields Medal), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal). The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include Bianchi, elliptic, Jacobi, Hilbert, and Siegel modular forms, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular forms, quadratic forms, and additional related areas of research.

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest. The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. (Number theorists refer to the conjectured relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ""reciprocity law."") Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic methods to study the conjectures. These are methods that exploit the many symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics known as ""the Langlands program."" A more recent approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, the representation theoretic methods and p-adic methods have begun to be unified into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, and to use them to establish new reciprocity laws.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of the research project is to investigate the p-adic aspects of the Langlands program. At the heart of the Langlands program is a conjectured reciprocity law relating automorphic representations to p-adic Galois representations. The precise description of the manner in which automorphic forms and Galois representations are supposed to correspond involves local reciprocity laws, that is, reciprocity laws that relate the behavior of the automorphic representation at a prime q to the behavior of the Galois representation at that same prime. These local laws are most subtle when q is taken to be the same prime p that governs the coefficients of the Galois representation; indeed, in this case such a local reciprocity law would constitute a p-adic local Langlands correspondence, and its existence remains conjectural other than in the abelian case, and the case of GL_2(Q_p). Together with various collaborators, the principal investigator aims to investigate this hoped-for but mysterious p-adic local reciprocity law in various ways. The PI's study of moduli stacks of p-adic Galois representations will provide new geometric insight into p-adic local Langlands and related problems such as the Breuil--Mezard conjecture.  The PI's proposed trace formula for p-adically completed cohomology should yield new insight into local-global compatibility in the p-adic context.  The PI's research on growth of cohomology will increase the range of applicability of stable trace formula, one of the most powerful tools available for studying reciprocity laws associated to automorphic forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The general goal of KUMUNU is to provide a setting to share cutting-edge mathematical research and promote collaborations among algebraists in or within driving distance of the Great Plains region. KUMUNU aims to advance mathematics through the dissemination of new and innovated results and techniques via research talks.  These talks may inspire participating mathematicians with new ideas, and promote collaboration among them. Informal discussions while talks are not running should also help spread new results and ideas. The conferences will also give opportunities for early-career mathematicians to showcase their work.<br/> <br/>Confirmed speakers for the 2019 conference are Federico Castillo (University of Kansas), Srikanth Iyengar (University of Utah), Linquan Ma (Purdue University),  Hamid Rahmati (University of Nebraska), Liana Sega (University of Missouri - Kansas City), and Gordana Todorov (Northeastern University). The conference will also include a poster session for junior researchers.  The talks will be held from noon on Saturday to noon on Sunday, to minimize expenses for participants. Since some of the talks will not be focused purely in commutative algebra or algebraic geometry, new connections may be made. Moreover, the conference will hold a poster session aiming to give a number of junior researchers exposure in the commutative algebra and algebraic geometry community, a chance to meet potential collaborators, and a venue to network with senior researchers.

While the rules for manipulating such equations are the same as the ones learned in high-school algebra, the general setting in which they are studied yields powerful tools that put commutative algebra at the heart of much of pure mathematics with applications to many other areas of study, such as number theory (the study of properties of the integers)  and algebraic geometry (the study of geometric properties of solutions to systems of polynomial equations). Homological algebra is the branch of algebra related to the field of algebraic topology (the study of topological spaces, i.e.""shapes""). A central object of study in homological algebra is that of a complex of modules, which can be thought of an abstraction of the notion of a topological space (""shape""). One specific goal of this project is to settle some long-standing conjectures concerning such complexes and the analogous topological spaces.  The award will also support graduate students working on affiliated topics. <br/><br/>In more detail, this research project aims to settle various conjectures concerning bounded complexes of finite rank free modules over commutative rings, in particular concerning the possible ranks of the modules appearing in such complexes that have finite length homology.  These topics relate to conjectures of Halperin and Carlsson concerning free actions of tori and elementary abelian p-groups on topological spaces. The success of the proposed research on these topics will thus advance our understanding of homological algebra over commutative rings, of algebraic topology, and of the interaction of the two. This research also will pursue several conjectures about smooth and proper dg-categories, focusing on the example of the dg-category of matrix factorizations associated to a hyper-surface with an isolated singularity. Smooth and property dg-categories can be thought of as non-commutative analogues of smooth and proper algebraic varieties. The success of the goals in this area will advance our understanding of the non-commutative analogues of well-known conjectures in classical algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, in the classifications of molecules in chemistry, the most basic objects are the chemical elements appearing on the periodic table, and the combinations are the various bonds that can form between them. In algebraic number theory, the subject of this project, the goal is to classify algebraic structures called Galois representations, which capture the symmetries of solutions to ""Diophantine equations,"" polynomial equations where we seek solutions among the integers. The basic objects are called ""irreducible,"" and the ways they can be combined are called ""extensions."" There is a very rich theory of extensions even between relatively simple irreducible pieces. In this project, the PI aims to establish instances of conjectures that parameterize the structure of these extensions by objects coming from other areas of mathematics, including analysis and geometry. The guiding principle comes from deformation theory: starting with the simplest possible extension between two irreducibles, if there are many ways to deform it, then there must be many other extensions, whereas if it is more rigid, the structure of extensions is simpler. When explicit deformations can be found, this gives information about extensions. Deformation theory is crucial in modern number theory and played a central role in Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.<br/><br/>In this project, the extension groups to be analyzed are Selmer groups. The PI will develop techniques for studying the deformation theory of reducible representations by systematically using pseudorepresentations. In this case, explicit deformations come from congruences between Eisenstein series and cuspidal modular forms. Analysis of deformations leads to results relating the size of Selmer groups to special values of L-functions, as predicted by the Bloch-Kato conjectures. Of particular interest are refined conjectures, such as Sharifi's conjecture, which extract finer information about Selmer groups from more delicate properties of congruences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The boundary of this space is the plane together with the point at infinity. Most often the trajectory of a collection of symmetries in this space accumulates on a fractal on the plane, the study of which is related to dynamics of flows on the hyperbolic manifold, given by the quotient of the hyperbolic three space by the symmetry group. One beautiful example of such fractals is the Apollonian gasket which is constructed by a theorem proven by the ancient Greek geometer Apollonius. Fractals are abundant in nature as can be seen in the coastlines, ocean waves, Romanesco cauliflowers, etc.  A drop of oil in soy sauce creates a circle packing akin to the Apollonian gasket. This project is expected to be of value in interpreting the structure of fractals arising in nature.<br/><br/>Whereas most of hyperbolic three manifolds have infinite volume, the dynamical rigidity properties of hyperbolic manifolds have been investigated mostly for finite volume cases. The project concerns with dynamics on infinite volume hyperbolic manifolds, which turn out to be quite a rich theory and has several deep and striking applications.

These functions encode information such as how many primes there are up to a given magnitude, or the frequency of rational number solutions to certain equations, or the distribution of special points on a surface, all of which are important in number theory.   L-functions are often studied in collections called families. In this project we will use a new approach called ""stratification"" to study the distribution of the values of L-functions in families.<br/><br/>In recent years researchers have found very precise conjectures about the statistics of values and zeros of the Riemann zeta function and other families of L-functions. For low order moments these conjectures follow from precise knowledge or conjectures about correlations of generalized divisor functions.  But for higher moments this linkage has been missing. The main goal of this project is to complete this picture and prove that the moment conjectures for families of L-functions follow from knowledge of divisor correlations, which is equivalent to counting points in specified regions of certain varieties.  We will also investigate the same scenario but for averages of ratios of L-functions in families with the divisor correlations replaced by the general Hardy-Littlewood conjectures about prime tuples. For the Riemann zeta-function the project will follow the method outlined in recent work by two of the PIs. For other families of L-functions another innovation is required. This project will be informed by Manin's ideas for counting rational points on varieties by identifying the stratified subvarieties that play a role and counting the points on these. We will also investigate the exponential sums that naturally arise in counting points on these subvarieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Finite group theory is the study of the symmetry of finite objects by algebraic means. While the project involves fundamental research, group theory is applicable in many of the natural sciences where highly symmetric objects are found, including in biology, chemistry, and physics, and in the study of communication networks and cryptographic schemes. A finite simple group is akin to an atom in that it cannot be broken down into smaller groups.  Each finite group of symmetries is made up of simple groups stacked on top one another analogously to the way molecules are built out of atoms.  One of the premier mathematical achievements of the<br/>20th century was the description and classification of all the finite simple groups (CFSG).  Its proof is however long and difficult, currently spanning around 10,000-15,000 pages, and it is desirable to have significantly simpler proofs.  The PI will investigate this problem by using strategies that come form topology, a branch of mathematics that studies properties of objects that are invariant under continuous transformations. One bridge between group theory and topology is given by the classifying space of a group. When the group is finite, there is an associated set of prime numbers, and both the group and its classifying space can be studied ""one prime at a time"".  This strategy has been abstracted into the notion of a p-fusion system, the basic object of study.<br/><br/>The project arises out of two recent major developments in fusion systems: a program for the classification of simple 2-fusion systems of component type (CSFS) whose ultimate aim is to give a substantially simpler proof of the CFSG, and the recent solution of the existence and uniqueness of centric linking systems, which provide the bridge from fusion systems to topology.  Both developments are brought together by their connections with the cohomology of various functors defined on the orbit category and other related categories.  The investigator will: (1) investigate fusion systems at the prime 2 whose linking systems support a noninner rigid automorphism by using methods from the CSFS, (2) work to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of centralizers of fusion subsystems through the definition and computation of the cohomology of functors which obstruct internal rigid actions on centric linking systems, and (3) work directly within the nearly-completed CSFS to solve certain outstanding problems, and to generalize others for use in related problems such as in (3).  The three interrelated projects aim to gain a better understanding of some aspect of the p-local structure of finite groups and/or the homotopy theory of p-completed classifying spaces by exploiting their interplay. Project (1) uses finite group theoretic methods to provide a better understanding of the group of self-homotopy equivalences of the p-completed classifying space of a finite group, while project (2) provides an application of functor cohomology to the open problem of constructing centralizers.  The construction of centralizers is a fundamental problem with applications within the CSFS, e.g. in the defining and understanding of standard subsystems of fusion systems, and it also has potential applications to the open problem of describing maps between different p-completed classifying spaces. Project (3) sits within the CSFS proper, simultaneously supporting the goals in (1) and the completion of the classification program.<br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Langlands functoriality conjecture is a profound unifying force in modern mathematics.  Though largely open, even what is currently known has consequences that ripple throughout number theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, and even mathematical physics. The basic objects of study are automorphic representations.  Automorphic representations are defined using locally symmetric spaces, which are highly symmetric spaces that can be thought of as arbitrary dimensional drums.  Every sound on a drum is a superposition of pure tones and automorphic representations are analogous to these pure tones.  These are very complicated objects. Every locally symmetric space has a comparatively simple invariant called an L-group, and the functoriality conjecture predicts that when one can relate L-groups one can relate (the far more complicated) automorphic representations. The PI will also train graduate students in this area of research and is involved in mentoring activities at all levels from high school through to post-doctoral.<br/><br/><br/>Using  relations between L-groups one defines functions called L-functions, and proving L-functions are ""nice"" is enough to prove Langlands functoriality.  This proejct will develop new techniques to prove that L-functions are nice.  The oldest tool available for proving L-functions are nice is the Poisson summation formula familiar from Fourier analysis, signal processing, etc.  The PI and B. Liu have recently discovered generalizations of the Poisson summation formula that are the first of their kind. The more particular goal of the research is to extend and exploit these generalizations with the aim of studying triple product L-functions in higher rank.  Using converse theory as developed by Cogdell and Piatetski-Shapiro many cases of Langlands functoriality can be reduced to the study of triple product L-functions so this is of fundamental importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Automorphic Forms are functions with abundant symmetries. These symmetries are the guidelines to understanding the intrinsic structures of objects in our universe. In Mathematics, these symmetries are common grounds for  many different theories such as Geometry, Number Theory, Mathematical Physics, Algebra and Analysis.  Hence the modern theory of automorphic forms, essentially the Langlands program, provides the organizing principle  for further research in these areas.  The research of the PI has a goal of establishing basic structures for automorphic forms.  The PI will train graduate students and postodcs, and  give lectures on his research to broader community, including public lectures, primary lectures and research talks in  various occasions and conferences. <br/><br/><br/>The PI, Dihua Jiang, will continue his research on the discrete spectrum of square-integrable automorphic forms, L-functions and the Langlands functoriality conjectures. The basic problems that the PI has been investigating are refined structures of the discrete spectrum of automorphic forms on classical groups, analytic and arithmetic properties of automorphic L-functions, and explicit Langlands functorial transfers for square-integrable automorphic forms via automorphic integral transforms. The theory of endoscopy, the existence of which was discovered by R. Langlands in 1980's and confirmed through the fundamental work of B.-C. Ngo and J. Arthur and others via the trace formula approach. On the one hand, the PI intends to study refined structure based on the existence of endoscopy. On the other hand, the PI intends to construct explicit modules for the cuspidal automorphic forms via integral transform with automorphic kernel functions, so that the endoscopic transfers can be realized via integral transforms, Moreover, the PI will develop the theory of twisted automorphic descents that can be used to prove substantially new cases of the global Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture, establish new higher rank cases of non-vanishing of the central critical value of tensor product $L$-functions. Meanwhile, the PI also plans to develop the local theory, relating basic problems in harmonic analysis of groups over a local filed to the arithmetic data that are given by the local Langlands conjecture.  The long term research goal of the PI is to understand the general local-global-automorphic principles in the theory of automorphic forms, which reflects one of the basic principles in the arithmetic and number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, starting with quantum mechanics, a great number of models emerged that led to mathematical problems involving variables that no longer commute. Noncommutative Algebra is one of the areas of mathematics that studies those structures. The research projects that are funded by this award investigate the interrelations between the commutative and noncommutative settings, using a branch of geometry called Poisson geometry. Three other approaches are used to study the noncommutative setting:  a combinatorial approach based on intricate internal transformations of the objects, called cluster mutations;  an algebraic approach that investigates intrinsically defined structures called Calabi-Yau categories; and  a noncommutative geometric approach using quantum versions of symmetric spaces. The four approaches are simultaneously used to carry out a detailed study of the properties and symmetries of noncommutative objects. Further, the noncommutative objects are shown to exhibit various forms of rigidity. This is used to settle problems in algebra, geometry, combinators, and dynamical systems that were previously posed without any reference to the noncommutative setting. These research activities will be used as the foundation for the training of graduate and undergraduate students and for mentoring mathematics postdocs.<br/><br/>The research projects funded under this awaard investigate problems in noncommutative algebra, quantum symmetric spaces, and noncommutative projective algebraic geometry and the relations of these problems to Poisson geometry, combinatorics, triangulated categories, and integrable systems. On the one hand, the program aims at using methods from the latter areas to describe the structure and representations of quantum cluster algebras at roots of unity, the Drinfeld doubles of Nichols algebras, the algebras that appear in the theory of quantum symmetric pairs, and the algebras that describe noncommutative projective spaces. In the opposite direction, previously posed problems in the latter areas are converted to problems for noncommutative algebras and their representation categories, and are then resolved within that setting. One of the directions of this program is the construction of universal K-matrices on the symmetric subalgebras of the Drinfeld doubles of Nichols algebras, and using this to study the ring theoretic properties of Nichols algebras. Another direction aims at the classification of irreducible representations of Nichols algebras of diagonal type using Poisson orders and noncommutative discriminants. A third direction develops a general setting for the study of finite dimensional representations of quantum cluster algebras at root of unity using Poisson geometry and Cayley-Hamilton algebras. Three additional directions investigate the geometry of noncommutative projective spaces modeled by higher dimensional elliptic algebras, the structure of 2-Calabi-Yau categories via categorical C-vectors and dynamical systems, and the construction of integral quantum cluster algebra structures on the canonical forms of quantized coordinate rings of varieties in theory of Lie groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The equations can be thought of as dependence relations between physical quantities in some model, while the solution set of these equations describes the geometric shape of the model. Natural phenomena often come equipped with a rich symmetry, which is important to identify and incorporate into the modeling process. To imagine how equations, geometry and symmetry naturally fit together, one should think about lines and planes that are defined using linear equations and exhibit translational symmetries, or about circles and spheres that are described by quadratic equations and display rotational symmetries. For more complex systems, the degrees of the equations alone are not able to capture the geometry or the symmetries. The goal of this project is to systematically analyze (higher) relations between the equations defining elaborate systems, that are robust enough to accurately predict shapes and portray symmetries. The techniques developed by the PI will be used to study curves and configurations of linear spaces, polynomials and their factorization pattern, or spaces of matrices and higher dimensional tensors. Such spaces are not only important for the fundamental research in mathematics, but they also play a central role in applications throughout the sciences. The research is suitable for engaging students in research, as well as for computer experimentation and software development.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate a number of fundamental invariants in homological commutative algebra and classical algebraic geometry. An important emphasis will be on the study of problems that are concrete, exhibit a rich symmetry, and that touch upon a number of related fields within mathematics. The PI will continue to advance the theory and applications of Koszul modules, exploring their uses to group theory and to syzygies of curves, to hyperplane arrangements or to the homological theory of algebraic varieties. The PI will study homological invariants such as syzygies and Ext modules, regularity and projective dimension, local cohomology and Lyubeznik numbers, in the context of examining central objects such as determinantal and monomial ideals, Segre and Veronese varieties, binary forms, or representations with finitely many orbits. The methods employed fall mainly in the realm of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, but also incorporate tools from combinatorics, D-module, quiver and representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ubiquitous in mathematics, algebraic varieties are critical objects of study in complex geometry, number theory, topology, and representation theory. It is often particularly important to understand their moduli, that is, how they vary as the coefficients of the polynomial equations defining them are varied. Hodge theory offers one perspective on this problem: the moduli of algebraic varieties can be understood in terms of how integrals of differential forms vary. This research project will use new methods stemming from model theory, representation theory, and complex geometry to understand this connection. The project especially aims to promote interactions with closely-related areas of mathematics and to encourage the participation of students and young researchers.   <br/><br/>The project will address two main types of research problems. Hodge theory is a powerful tool in algebraic geometry but it is fundamentally transcendental in nature.  Recent work of the PI and coauthors has demonstrated that techniques from model theory and complex geometry can be used to bridge this divide systematically, and the first goal of the project is to develop the application of these techniques more deeply. Secondly, the project will develop a more detailed understanding of the moduli of certain varieties which are particularly closely related to Hodge theory, including abelian varieties and hyperkahler varieties. Building on previous work using techniques from differential and complex geometry, the PI will further investigate the geometry and arithmetic of the moduli spaces of these varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a fundamental and highly active field of research within the mathematical sciences and has ramifications throughout all of mathematics and the sciences. There are large communities of group theory researchers in all continents, and they keep in touch through international meetings and conferences. However, local conditions and cultural circumstances under which mathematical research is done differ quite a bit between different regions of the world. The focus of this proposal is on research in group theory in the USA and in China. One major goal of the conference is to establish and strengthen ties between group theorists in China and the USA. It is the first conference in group theory with this focus. <br/><br/>The conference will provide group theory researchers in China and the USA a forum to disseminate their own research as well as to learn about new and significant results in the area. It will help to bridge the gap between the group theory communities in the United States and China, and lead to future cooperation and collaborations. Speakers from both countries will cover a large variety of the subjects in the area, which include representations of solvable groups, representations of simple groups, character theory, classes of groups, groups and combinatorics, p-groups, and fusion systems. There will be about fifteen invited talks and a limited number of contributed talks. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere to foster new collaborations; young researchers will have the opportunity to present their work and learn about the latest developments in the field. It is expected that it will have a great impact on the math research communities in both countries.

In each case, ""duality"" means that one phenomenon has two equally valid descriptions. However, at the current level of understanding these seem unrelated. Two distinct descriptions of the same object suggest that a more comprehensive framework would serve to give a conceptual explanation of the observed dualities. The aim of this project is to develop such a framework. The mathematical origin of these developments is the so called Langlands program, which is the modern view on classical number theory. The Langlands program functions as a bridge between mathematics (representation theory, algebraic geometry, homotopy theory) and physics (gauge theory, string theory). Graduate students will be involved in the research.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, this project will extend the formulation of the geometric Langlands program from one dimension to arbitrary dimensions. Going beyond dimension one requires a reformulation of the geometric Langlands program that better matches physical theories in higher dimensions. The basis of this project is the construction of a conjectural ""inner cohomology in algebraic geometry,"" including noncommutative coefficients. Here, ""inner"" means that the values of this cohomology would be objects in derived algebraic geometry rather than simply sets. As a consequence, geometric class field theory in arbitrary dimension should be Poincare duality for this inner cohomology and the geometric Langlands program should be an extension of Poincare duality to non-commutative cohomology. A classical problem is that cohomology with coefficients in a non-abelian group is not defined beyond degree two and does not have much content beyond degree one. The point of view taken in this project is that higher cohomology with coefficients in a reductive group can be defined as certain local distributions on cohomology with coefficients in tori.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A random walk is a path where decisions about which way to go at a particular point in the walk is chosen in some random fashion. The main goal of this project is to investigate whether main features of random-walks in a fixed compact group stay the same as we choose different random-walks. An example of a compact group would be the surface of a sphere. The PI will conduct reading courses on the subjects related to this project. One of the important features of this project is its connections with many areas of  mathematics. And this can help students to see what kind of mathematics makes them more excited. The PI will run a weekly seminar, and invites both young and prominent mathematicians. Having such an active seminar is crucial for our graduate students to reach to their potential. The PI continues to promote participation of underrepresented minorities in any such activities. <br/><br/>A random-walk in a compact space is understood the best if it has the so-called spectral gap. This property more or less says one reaches to a (pseudo)-random point quite fast. For that reason random-walks have been used in computer science for generating pseudo-random numbers. If the compact space in hand (continuously) factors through finite sets, then one gets highly connected (sparse) graphs - called expanders, which have many applications in computer science and communications. Finding even a single random-walk with spectral gap in a sphere is highly non-trivial; and, such a random-walk was the source of giving an affirmative answer to Banach-Ruziewicz problem; and more recently they are used in quantum computing. In the past decade, (local) spectral gap have been proved to be instrumental in various branches of mathematics: affine sieve, variation of Galois representations, group theory, hyperbolic geometry, orbit equivalence rigidity, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups are one of the fundamental tools in mathematics and arise in many areas including analysis, geometry and number theory as well as in the study of symmetries in chemistry and physics. The classification of finite simple groups was completed in 2006 and has led to a revolution in using group theory to study other fields. The classification basically says that the finite simple groups are analogs of the simple Lie groups and so to understand them, one must study simple Lie and algebraic groups. The best way to understand and use group theory is to study the action of groups on different objects. One aspect of this project is to understand groups acting on Riemann surfaces (and their analog over finite fields). This will lead to a new fundamental understanding of basic objects including rational functions and should lead to advances in cryptography and fundamental problems in number theory. The utility of group theory has also been greatly expanded due to advances in computation. Another aspect of this project is to find useful presentations of the finite simple groups which will lead to more computational efficiency. A third important problem addressed in this project is to greatly generalize what is called the Tits alternative. This will lead to results showing the existence (and construction) of expander graphs. These are graphs that are highly connected relative to the number of edges in them. This has been of great importance in computer science. Graduate students will be trained through research.<br/> <br/>In particular, we plan to study the problem of producing strongly dense subgroups of semisimple algebraic groups and proving a generalization of the Tits alternative. This will give some new results about superstrong approximation in number theory and results on expander graphs. Earlier results of the PI, with Breuillard, Green, and Tao, will be generalized using new stronger methods. We also want to prove the conjecture that every finite simple group has a presentation with two generators and at most four relations. This should lead to advances in computational number theory. Deep results in group theory have led to major advances in basic problems about bijective polynomials over finite fields (viewed as mappings on a smooth projective curve) and has had applications to cryptography and solved problems over a century old. Another goal of the project is to completely classify monodromy groups of coverings of low genus Riemann surfaces leading to fundamental breakthroughs in number theory and also to classify monodromy groups of mappings from generic Riemann surfaces (first studied in Zariski's thesis). Finally, we want to classify generic stabilizers for simple algebraic groups in irreducible linear representations. This has been done in characteristic zero but new ideas are required in positive characteristic. This will have consequences for essential dimension and some special cases will fit into the program of Bhargava to solve interesting classification problems of algebraic families.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The field of algebraic geometry studies geometric models by distilling and encoding their essential complexity in polynomial equations. The project integrates ideas from quantum physics and the physical study of symmetries of the fundamental laws of nature to extract new and unexpected information about the geometry of spaces. The project will focus on unravelling the hidden structure of multi-dimensional geometric models of quantum fields and to capture this structure in a cascade of polynomial invariants. These invariants will give a new mathematical tool for understanding and proving various empirically observed physics dualities which are expected to identify a priori unrelated quantum theories. The project aims to unify the analytic and geometric properties of parameter spaces of representations in arbitrary dimension and sets the stage for understanding the basic structure of moduli problems in a way suitable for pragmatic use in a broad spectrum of applications. The proposed work will be immediately relevant to deep questions in symplectic geometry, geometric representation theory, string theory and quantum field theory.<br/><br/><br/>Three directions will be studied. The first is to investigate how the Hodge theory of varieties with potentials and the associated perverse and weight filtrations are exchanged by T-duality. In the second project a new method will be developed for constructing moduli of irregular connections on non-compact algebraic manifolds, for building explicit symplectic foliations, and for computing their leaves. This will involve a new de Rham theory of formal boundaries of varieties, and a new construction of sheaf theoretic invariants from the formal geometry. The final project will build  a spectral coverformalism for constructing Hecke eigensheaves on moduli of bundles related to intersections of quadrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A basic example is the Fourier expansion of a function on the circle as a sum of trigonometric functions. The circle is a very symmetric object. We can rotate it for any angle without changing its shape. Rotations of a circle form what is called in mathematics a group of transformations, or simply a group. Every function on the circle has a Fourier expansion in which it is written as a sum of trigonometric functions. Trigonometric functions are the simplest functions on the circle, and so the analysis of functions on the circle, or periodic functions, is reduced to trigonometric functions. It has been known for over a century that Fourier expansions and their generalizations carry significant number theoretic information. Motivated by this example, over the past fifty years a large class of problems has been unified in a scheme known as the Langlands program. Roughly speaking, the goal is to decompose any function on a group as a sum of the simplest possible functions. This decomposition problem is the main theme of this project. This project will include training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically the main goal of this project is to complete the Langlands classification for the group G2. This group was discovered by Eugene Dickson and it has been found to play an important role in physics and string theory. The principal tool employed in this research is the theory of exceptional theta correspondences that was developed by the PI in previous work. Applications of the exceptional theta correspondence to dual pairs of real groups and to supercuspidal representations of p-adic groups will developed as well.

The Langlands program started as a series of conjectures proposed by Robert Langlands beginning in 1967. From its origins in number theory and representation theory, it developed into a framework connecting and influencing many areas of mathematics. In particular, the geometric Langlands program is formulated in terms of algebraic geometry and can be interpreted in physical terms as a duality in quantum field theory. This project introduces new geometric ideas into the area. It is likely that the techniques developed in this project will find applications in other areas of mathematics. This award provides training of graduate students through research.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will work on the classical limit of the local geometric Langlands conjecture and on the duality for compactified Jacobians of formal curves. In earlier work, the PI has studied the classical limit of the global geometric conjecture; while progress in the special case of the group GL(n) was made, it became apparent that the general case will require new tools. One goal of this project is to develop such tools using local methods. At the same time, the research focuses on an essentially unexplored direction in the geometric Langlands program: while the general shape of conjectures is known (and stated in the proposal), the details are unclear at this point.

Since mid-1990s, various mathematicians have conjectured that an explicit construction of certain four-dimensional topological field theories (4d TQFTs) should exist, the discovery of which will enhance our mathematical understanding of four-dimensional quantum physics. The objective of this project is to develop an accessible approach towards explicitly realizing such 4d TQFTs. The 4d TQFTs will admit combinatorial descriptions and be computable in practice for applications. They are related to, yet more subtle than, an earlier construction in dimension three. The project naturally fits into a larger program of relating certain three-dimensional field theories and four-dimensional ones by a process called categorification, where ""shadow"" concepts in three dimensions are replaced by richer structures in four dimensions. The higher structures obtained can be utilized to resolve problems in lower dimensions. In addition, algebraic structures will be developed along the the way that it will shed new light on topics in classical algebraic studies.<br/><br/>In more detail, this is a project to investigate categorifications of quantum groups at prime roots of unity, and their categorical representation theory. This constitutes part of a long term program to categorify the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev three-dimensional topological quantum field theory, producing a four-dimensional theory. The existence of such liftings of topological quantum field theories by categorification was conjectured by Crane and Frenkel in 1994. A key ingredient in this program is to find a categorical enhancement of certain link homology theories, such as Khovanov homology, at prime roots of unity. The project will be carried out by further developing a recently introduced generalized homological algebraic theory called ""hopfological algebra."" Incorporating this newly developed hopfological theory into earlier works on categorified representation theory of quantum group at a prime root of unity will allow one to explicitly construct hopfological invariant for links and 3-manifolds, thereby explicitly lifting Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev's three-dimensional topological quantum field theorys via categorification. In the process, categorified representation theory of quantum groups a prime root of unity will be investigated, together with their new hopofological features."

Just like the familiar light and sound waves, continuous objects such as signals or mass distributions on spaces of varying geometry can be best understood as superpositions of simpler, fundamental harmonics known as eigenfunctions. On curved spaces with a rich set of arithmetic symmetries (arithmetic manifolds), the role of these building blocks closely attuned to their geometry, dynamics, and the underlying algebraic structure is played by cusp forms. This project will investigate the extreme oscillating behavior and geometric impact of non-spherical cusp forms, and the distribution of families of cusp forms within natural ambient spaces.

From an analytic perspective, cusp forms are joint eigenfunctions of invariant differential operators including the Laplacian, whose long-term/large-scale analytic behavior (such as their size) should reflect the spectral geometry and chaotic dynamics on arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds. The PI will leverage the trace formula, geometry of numbers, and explicit inversion to study such analytic properties of non-spherical cusp forms. Cusp forms naturally occur in families, and it is of central interest to identify the size of a family in expanding and shrinking regions of adelic parameters (generalizing Weyl's law, originally formulated by physicists) and their distribution including symmetry type.

In terms of practical applications of the project, the PI expects that his refined version of Ross and Selinger algorithm will be used if a physical quantum computer is built. The hope is that quantum computers will eventually be able to efficiently simulate quantum physics and study many (important) computationally difficult problems inaccessible to modern-day computers. There are models such as the Quantum Gates Model that give theoretical constructions of efficient circuits to be used in quantum computers. This model is connected to the study of integral solutions to Diophantine equations, an ancient subject of interest to mathematicians. A question of interest to both quantum computer scientists as well as mathematicians is the optimal approximation of real solutions of special Diophantine equations by integral solutions. The PI has proved new (optimal) results in this direction. Furthermore, he has proved that this task is computationally hard (NP-complete) for generic inputs.<br/><br/>On a more technical level, one of the central problems in the Quantum Gates Model is the approximation of an arbitrary qubit using a fixed set of generators called universal quantum gates. In the single-qubit case, this amounts to navigating the unitary group SU(2) by a specific set of topological generators (e.g. V-gates or the Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak generators) that are carefully chosen such that the associated transition matrix has the optimal spectral gap (e.g. the eigenvalues of the Hecke operators satisfy the Ramanujan bound). The PI proposes a refinement of the Ross and Selinger algorithm for approximating an arbitrary single-qubit that removes all heuristic assumptions from their algorithm. Among the new tools in this approach are the delta method, Sieve theory, and the spectral theory of modular forms and bounds on their Fourier coefficients. An objective of this project is to generalize the results of the PI to higher rank arithmetic groups which brings in the theory of the oscillator representation and the theory of automorphic representations. Motivated by Berry's conjecture in Quantum Chaos, the PI studies the statistical properties and the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix of the quantum gates (the Hecke operators). So far, the PI has proved power saving upper bounds as well as absolute upper bound on the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the Hecke operators. Furthermore, the PI has proved lower bounds on the discrepancy of the spectral measure with respect to the Plancherel measure. The project brings together the deformation theory of Galois representations, Iwasawa theory, the Taylor-Wiles method, trace formulae, and other tools from the algebraic and analytic number theorists' toolbox in order to answer questions of interest to computer scientists as well as mathematicians.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combinatorics studies various discrete structures (such as permutations, partially ordered sets, and graphs), which are well suited for encoding complex mathematical objects and for the related computations. Representation theory is a fundamental tool for studying symmetry, by realizing the elements of abstract groups/algebras as linear transformations (of some vector spaces). The PI studies representations of Lie algebras and quantum groups, which have many applications to physics, such as calculating the probability of a particle system being in a given state at a particular time. In geometry, the PI focuses on Schubert calculus, which has its origins in enumerative geometry (e.g., counting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions), but is currently related to modern areas such as quantum cohomology. Some of the models developed by the PI have been or will be implemented in the open source computer algebra system SAGE.<br/><br/>The proposed research consists of the following main projects, to be pursued with several collaborators. (1) The PI will extend his work on uniform combinatorial models for Kirillov-Reshetikhin (KR) crystals of affine Lie algebras from the single column KR crystals to the arbitrary ones. (2) Uniform combinatorial formulas are sought for the (non-metaplectic and metaplectic) Iwahori Whittaker functions, which are a basic tool in the theory of automorphic forms. Connections with Schubert calculus will also be investigated. (3) The combinatorics of the geometric Satake correspondence (realizing geometrically the irreducible representations of reductive groups) is studied via a combinatorial decomposition of Lusztig's q-analogue of the Weyl character. (4) In Schubert calculus, the PI has several projects related to various cohomologies of generalized flag varieties. In particular, an extension of Schubert calculus beyond K-theory is pursued based on the so-called Kazhdan-Lusztig Schubert classes in hyperbolic cohomology (which gives a stalk version of the elliptic cohomology of Ginzburg-Kapranov-Vasserot); these classes were defined by the PI in previous joint work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Non-abelian techniques subsequently gave a motivic proof of finiteness of solutions to the unit equation and laid the foundations of a program to push p-adic analytic techniques beyond the limitations of abelian integrals. The last decade has witnessed rapid progress (and applications), despite the technical depth of the subject. To effectively disseminate such a technical topic, the lecture series will be closely coordinated, and include classical Chabauty, computational aspects and applications, heights, arithmetic intersection theory, quadratic Chabauty, and a series of lectures about the conceptual and conjectural framework. Potential future topics for the AWS series include ""Shimura Varieties,"" which would prepare students to be users of this ubiquitous theory; ""Unlikely Intersections,"" which would survey recent advances on finiteness theorems for geometrically interesting intersections (e.g. the conjectures of Manin-Mumford and the Andre-Oort conjecture); ""Complexity of Arithmetic Geometry Algorithms,"" which would focus on the theoretical analysis of algorithms in number theory and algebraic geometry; and ""Automorphic Forms Beyond GL_2,"" which would introduce students to automorphic forms on groups beyond GL_2, emphasizing their applications to concrete number-theoretic problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is concerned with the study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Polynomial equations model many real world phenomena, ranging from robotics motion planning to physics to conservation programs. To each system of polynomial equations, we associate a set of points, called a variety, which correspond to the set of solutions for all the equations. There is a growing body of literature that shows that the computational complexity of the system of polynomial equations has deep connections to the geometry of the associated variety. In nice cases, when the associated variety is smooth, there are well understood bounds limiting the computational complexity. In the worst possible cases, complexity is doubly exponential. Recent work of the PI shows there is a middle ground which is still poorly understood. The goal of this research is to better understand this connection.<br/><br/>The research aims to attack several open questions concerning projective bounds on syzygies. One goal is to study Rees-Like Algebras, which were essential in the PI's construction of counterexamples to the Eisenbud-Goto Conjecture (joint with I.

For such tractable example as a two-dimensional plane one can study symmetries via periodic tessellations they generate. Beautiful examples and even complete lists of such tessellations are frequently implemented via artistic means, as illustrated in Escher's famous symmetry drawings or wallpaper patterns in the Alhambra in Spain. In fact, it is known that there are exactly seventeen essentially different tessellations of the plane. Enumerating symmetries of more complicated and higher dimensional objects is often a daunting if not outright impossible task. Yet, having a grasp on such complicated symmetries proves to be important not only in representation theory but in many other areas, both pure and applied, including geometry, topology, algebra, as well as physics and chemistry. In this project, the PI will investigate certain invariants of symmetries that come in the form of interesting geometric shapes. Her goal is to investigate how much data about the original symmetries these geometric objects contain, shaping them to be a useful tool in the study of symmetries themselves.  <br/> <br/>Founded more than a hundred years ago, representation theory is now a thriving field that exhibits many deep connections with other areas of mathematics. Modular representation theory draws methods and motivation from a host of other areas, including algebraic geometry and topology.

This research project has its roots in Quillen's work, seeking to develop the theory of support varieties in several different, but interrelated contexts. This involves solving several fundamental problems concerning the structure of representations and the cohomology of finite dimensional algebras. The applications will provide new information on the global structure of various triangulated categories associated to representations of finite supergroup schemes, Schur algebras, Nichols algebras, Frobenius kernels of reductive groups, and Lie superalgebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Noncommutative algebra creates an algebraic framework for generalizing the study of polynomials to other rings that fail to be commutative, and representation theory is a powerful tool for investigating the action of an algebraic object on a space as linear operators and matrices.

The Langlands program is a web of far-reaching and influential conjectures that predicts surprising connections between arithmetic (e.g., properties of integer solutions to polynomial equations) and analysis (e.g., automorphic forms, which are highly symmetric solutions to certain differential equations on symmetric manifolds). The celebrated proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by A. Wiles, for instance, uses early results in the Langlands program proved by Langlands and Tunnell. In another direction, automorphic forms have deep connections with the string theory and the study of black holes in physics. In this project the PI will investigate analytic properties of automorphic forms and their number-theoretic consequences in the Langlands program. The project also integrates educational opportunities, including public outreach lectures, undergraduate and graduate research activities, cross-disciplinary training and research, and graduate curriculum development. <br/><br/>A main theme in the theory of automorphic forms is to study the discrete spectrum of a connected reductive algebraic group defined over a number field. By the pioneering work of Arthur, followed by many others, the discrete spectrum of a classical group has been classified into so-called Arthur packets, which are parametrized by Arthur parameters. The first part of this project is to analyze the finer structure of Arthur packets, including: concrete constructions of modules in each Arthur packet; Fourier coefficients of automorphic representations in each Arthur packet, including Jiang's conjecture; cuspidality of each Arthur packet; and relations among Arthur packets of different but closely related groups (via automorphic descent). The PI will also work on establishing Langlands functorial descent for exceptional groups, towards studying the Langlands functoriality and the discrete spectra of exceptional groups. The second part of the project is about converse problems. Converse problems aim to recover modular/automorphic forms from their Fourier coefficients. For example, the famous converse theorems of Hecke and Weil give sufficient conditions for a Dirichlet series to be the Mellin transform of a modular form. It is known that converse theorems play an important role in the establishment of Langlands functoriality. In this part of the project the PI will develop approaches to several conjectures, including Jacquet's conjecture and Cogdell-Piatetski-Shapiro conjecture, in order to prove optimal local and global converse theorems, as well as converse problems for exceptional groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is concerned with such a unification, known as ""Tensor-Triangular Geometry,"" that merges aspects of topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory and of other areas of mathematics under a single umbrella. In this project, Tensor-Triangular Geometry will be deployed at the interface of modular representation theory of finite groups and the theory of motives in number theory. The explicit nature of the former enhances our understanding of the latter, providing classification results among other applications. Graduate students will be trained through the research.<br/> <br/>The specific objectives of this project are the classifications of objects that appear in two categories in two distinct areas. On one hand, one can consider Artin-Tate motives over various ground fields in Voevodsky's derived category of motives, and on the other one can consider complexes of filtered representations over pro-finite groups, typically the absolute Galois groups of the above fields. Thanks to tensor-triangular geometry, such classifications are equivalent to the computation of a space (the spectrum) associated to the categories in question. The proposed methods involve etale extensions in tensor-triangular geometry. These extensions are a new development that have incarnations in both settings, as finite extensions of the ground field in the motivic case and as the corresponding restriction to finite-index subgroups in the equivariant case. Understanding Artin-Tate motives via filtered representations in turn sheds new light on the classification of objects in the larger and more mysterious category of motives, which is a long-term goal of researchers in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This workshop aims to bring together a diverse group of leading and emerging researchers working in number theory, algebraic geometry and topology to obtain a global view of a fast emerging and multidisciplinary area, to train participants in the range of methods available, and to generate a robust problem list that can guide activity in the area for the next 5-10 years. <br/><br/><br/>The last 10 years have brought a burst of activity at the intersection of algebraic topology, number theory and algebraic geometry. This has led to a wealth of:<br/>1) new theorems, such as Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland's proof of the<br/>Cohen-Lenstra heuristics for function fields; <br/>2) new sources of heuristics in topology, such as Vakil-Wood's predictions from the Grothendieck ring, or the notion and coincidences of homological densities as in Farb-Wolfson-Wood; <br/>3) refinements of classical enumerative theorems using modern topological tools, such as Kass-Wickelgren's arithmetic count of the 27 lines on a cubic surface; and<br/>4) a renewed focus on unstable homology, as in Galatius-Kupers-Randal-Williams and Miller-Wilson. <br/>The organizers of the workshop believe that these results are just the beginning of the emerging area of arithmetic topology. They are organizing a 5 day workshop to bring together a diverse group of junior and senior researchers from across these areas with the goal of: <br/>1) giving participants a global view of a fast emerging and multidisciplinary area,<br/>2) giving participants a detailed awareness on the range of methods available, and<br/>3) emerging with a robust problem list which can help guide activity in the area for the next 5-10 years.<br/><br/>More information is available at the conference website:<br/>https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/190610-pwat.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One might expect that equations would grow ever more complex as the number of variables increases; in fact, this sort of phenomenon is known as the ""curse of dimensionality"" and it is very common in mathematics.  However, recent work of Ananyan and Hochster has shown that this does not happen:  under a certain regime, the complexity of solving equations does not increase as the number of variables increases.  In fact in some ways, the problem even becomes simpler.  In this project, the PI will try to carry the core insights of Ananyan and Hochster to new types of equations.  This would sharpen our understanding of the structure of systems of equations, with the potential for both theoretical and computational applications.<br/><br/>The recent progress on Stillman's Conjecture has led to a plethora of new bounded results in algebra, many of which are modern twists on classical results of Hilbert.  In previous work, the PI had constructed new limit rings, involving inverse limits and ultraproducts, and applied these limit rings to homological questions in commutative algebra.  This led to two new proofs of Stillman's Conjecture.  The PI proposes developing similar new frameworks for regular local rings and for coherent sheaves on projective space.  The intellectual merit of this project would primarily come through the broad array of boundedness results this would yield for regular local rings and for cohomology of coherent sheaves on projective space    This project will also have impacts on K-12 education through the PI's leadership of the Madison Math Circle, an outreach program that provides a taste of exciting ideas in math and science to high school and advanced middle school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also a meeting ground for many other branches of mathematics -- analysis, geometry, representation theory (to name a few) -- and progress on the fundamental problems in number theory continues to reveal surprising connections between these branches as well as new applications to other areas.  This project is focused on one of these fundamental problems and aims to establish new instances of these connections.<br/><br/>The fundamental problem at the heart of this project is to determine the arithmetic nature of the special values of L-functions of an algebraic variety or motive and to relate these values to the orders of algebraic quantities associated to the variety or motive (such as a Chow group, a class group, or a Selmer group).  An important and motivating instance is the celebrated Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture for elliptic curves, vastly generalized by the Bloch-Kato Conjectures.  This project will extend progress toward this fundamental problem through further development of connections between: L-functions, Galois representations, automorphic forms, representation theory, p-adic variation of L-values and modular forms, special cycles (especially on Shimura varieties), and special classes in Galois cohomology groups. This progress will unfold in two primary directions: (A) the proof of new instances of the Bloch-Kato Conjectures or their consequences (such as new cases of the p-part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula), and (B) the development of new tools and new methods for proving results towards these conjectures (such as new applications of representation theory to the existence Euler systems).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main theme of the conference is Geometry; one of the cornerstones of modern Mathematics with broad applications, ranging from String Theory to Cryptography.  Through newly discovered, deep connections between various active areas of research in Geometry, including Arithmetic, Algebraic and Complex Differential Geometry, each subject has witnessed unexpected and groundbreaking advances. The conference aims to facilitate interactions among researchers in these diverse fields to further these developments. Such activities have proved to be of unparalleled importance for geometers in these interconnected areas, specially for those in early stages of their careers.<br/><br/><br/>The event supported by this award is composed of a master class (1 week long) and 4 international conferences, each one week long: Singular Metrics in Kaehler Geometry (week 2), Birational Geometry and Hodge Theory (week 3), Entire Curves, Rational Curves and Foliations (week 4), and Ball Quotient Surfaces and Lattices (week 5). The last couple of years have been witness to important progress in our understanding of the geometry of complex algebraic varieties, and more generally Kaehler varieties. The aim of this conference is to facilitate the gathering of experts of international stature in various active areas of research. The aim of the Master Class is  the introduction of techniques and theories that will be used throughout the conference. This will mainly consist of three courses: Hodge theory, K3 surfaces and special metrics on manifolds. During the second week, the goal is to study various geometric problems where the theory of singular metrics play an important role. This includes the following topics: Singular Kaehler-Einstein varieties and their moduli, Positivity in Complex Geometry and Generalized Yau-Tian-Donaldson Conjecture. The aim of the third week is to investigate various methods in Algebraic Geometry with a view towards applications in Birational Geometry and Moduli spaces. The following  topics will be of particular importance: Hodge theory and Moduli of higher dimensional varieties. The goal of the fourth week is to gather specialists in different fields working on the geometry of algebraic and transcendental curves in complex varieties. Topics include: jet spaces and foliations, Special Varieties and Nevanlinna theory. Despite an intensive search for finding a geometric construction for ball quotient surfaces, very few examples have been obtained with explicit equations. Recently Cartwright and Steger have introduced new algorithms for such constructions, leading to the completion of the classification of fake projective planes. The focus of the final week will be a detailed analysis of this fundamental work and its applications.

In particular it concerns work on polynomial equations and their solutions. Associated to the solutions of  a collection of polynomial equations is a mathematical object, their zeta function. This research will  investigate a deep collection  of conjectures  concerning these zeta functions, made by  Alexander Beilinson, Don Zagier and others 30-40 years ago. These investigations also have consequences for theoretical Physics.  Another aspect of the project is that it will support the training of graduate students in this area of research.<br/><br/>Any system of polynomial equations  with integral coefficients gives rise to a  function of one complex variable,  the Zeta Function Z(s). It  encodes in a very mysterious way the most important characteristics of the space of solutions.  In particular,  the special values of the zeta function Z(s) at the integral values of  s should be expressed as periods, that is integrals of certain specific type. The PI is going to study the special values of the zeta functions, relating them  to the very classical mathematical objects, going back to Euler  - the classical polylogarithm functions, which generalize the logarithm function. The technique  the PI is using came from  several  parts of Mathematics and Mathematical Physics, such as the theory of motives, algebraic K-theory on one hand, and cluster varieties and their quantization on the other. The very existence of deep connections between polylogarithms and cluster varieties is surprising. It will have many applications far beyond Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory, e.g. in the investigation of Scattering Amplitudes in Theoretical Physics. The PI will continue his work on  quantum geometry of various moduli spaces and their applications in Algebraic Geometry, Mathematical Physics and Number Theory, including  the study of classical and quantum polylogarithms, special values of L-functions,  motivic Galois groups,  Quantum Hodge Field Theory, cluster structure and quantization of   moduli spaces of local systems. The main priorities of the project are the following:<br/>a) To use the  relationship between cluster varieties and polylogarithms to prove Zagier's conjecture on the  special values  of the Dedekind zeta function at least for s=5, and relate the motivic cohomology to the cohomology of the polylogarithmic motivic complexes.  <br/>b) To develop the theory of quantum multiple polylogarithms, providing a quantum deformation of the periods of the prounipotent completion of the motivic  fundamental group of the punctured projective line. <br/>c) To give a comprehensive treatment of the cluster structure of various moduli related to the moduli spaces of G-local systems on surfaces. Apply this to quantization of these moduli spaces, representation theory of quantum groups,  mirror symmetry and Mathematical Physics. <br/>d) Develop  Quantum Hodge Field Theory. Its tree level gives a Feynman integral approach to Hodge theory. Derive it as a  Hodge-theoretic analog of Chern-Simons theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Prime Number Theorem (which describes the distribution of the primes among the positive integers) was proved in 1896 independently by Hadamard and de la Vallee Poussin by understanding certain properties of the Riemann zeta-function. The Riemann zeta-function and its generalizations, called L-functions, are ubiquitous yet mysterious functions in number theory. These functions can be defined in association with a plethora of mathematical objects, including Dirichlet characters, number fields, and elliptic curves. Understanding the location of the zeros of L-functions is a central problem in all of mathematics. While we cannot presently prove the Riemann Hypothesis, posed by Riemann in 1859, there are many fruitful investigations to pursue to better understand the zeros of L-functions. In particular, the vertical distribution of the zeros of L-functions has deep connections to two other central problems: the class number problem, which has its beginnings in the work of Gauss, and the possibility of a special type of counterexample to the (Generalized) Riemann Hypothesis. These hypothetical counterexamples are called Landau-Siegel zeros, and presently their existence cannot be ruled out.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project will pursue problems in the intersection of analytic and algebraic number theory. It will study applications related to the Chebotarev density theorem for families of L-functions, the vertical distribution of zeros of L-functions, and class numbers of number fields.

Algebraic geometry studies solutions of many polynomial equations in many variables.  Understanding this problem  is of fundamental importance in many sciences, in engineering, and in other  disciplines as well. It is often difficult to determine whether to expect any  solution, finitely many solutions, or infinitely many:  in the last case  one wants to know  how many degrees of freedom one has in describing the solutions. One can study  the solutions  geometrically, or algebraically, by  investigating certain  functions on  the solution space that form what is called a commutative ring.  This dual perspective creates  a close connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that is very valuable.   The problems that will be studied are long standing and of fundamental, central importance.   The results obtained will be disseminated by journal and book publications, lectures at conferences  and workshops, and via the internet. There is a strong educational component. The principal investigator will continue to mentor graduate students, postdocs, high school students through several programs that he has established over the years with a particular attention to attracting students that underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator will continue exploring several long standing questions in the theory of Noetherian rings.  Tigran Ananyan and the PI have proved Stillman's conjecture in all characteristics,  but the bounds on projective dimension and on other properties, such as numbers of generators of ideals associated with primary decompositions, can certainly be improved, and this problem will be studied.  The PI will also study whether there is an analogue of tight closure in mixed  characteristic that has the certain standard properties: both the usual colon-capturing and Dietz's  version of this property, the property that all ideals of regular rings are closed, persistence, and a test element theory. It is the final two that appear to be most difficult.  It is expected that new methods  from perfectoid geometry will be among the tools needed. Jointly with Sema Gunturkun, the PI is studying the long standing Eisenbud-Green-Harris conjecture on quadratic forms, which predicts  minimum values for the Hilbert functions of certain ideals.  Jointly with Bhargav Bhatt  and Linquan Ma, the PI will continue to study the existence and properties of lim  Cohen-Macaulay sequences of  modules.  This work, as well as some other asymptotic approaches,  may resolve the long open question of whether Serre intersection multiplicities are positive, in general,  in the case of mixed characteristic regular rings. Another direction for research includes the finiteness of support and other properties of local cohomology, such as the faithfulness of the highest non-vanishing local cohomology module over a local domain with support in a specified ideal. The PI has a  continuing project with Jack Jeffries exploring the latter problem.  A number of these problems  are  intended for collaboration with graduate students and postdoctoral faculty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference website is https://www2.math.binghamton.edu/p/bugcat/start.<br/><br/>Conference participation is an irreplaceable component in the development of young mathematicians. It is especially helpful if a conference is run at the level appropriate for graduates students so that they can both understand the various ideas and trends and present their own research. This is especially important for the members of underrepresented  groups: they are often more prone to being unduly intimidated by high-level research conferences. The BUGCAT conference is run for the graduate students, by the graduate students, with a diverse group of organizers. It strives to provide an inclusive environment for young researchers in Algebra, Topology, and related fields. These are some of the traditional areas of strength at Binghamton University, with a large number of local graduate student participants and organizers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pick one---let's call it x---at random, such that every angle has the same probability to appear. Now, apply the rotation x twice. In mathematical notation, this is x*x. It is not hard to show that the rotation x*x is again random, and every angle has the same probability to appear as the angle of rotation of x*x. Surprisingly, this is false in three dimensions: if x is a random rotation in space (each such looks like a rotation around some axis) chosen in such a way that each rotation has the same probability to appear, then some rotations have a higher probability of being x*x and some have lower probability, although this probability is never zero. Similarly, one can take two random rotations x and y and consider other expressions such as x*y*x*x*y and understand their distributions. More generally, one can ask similar questions replacing the collection of rotations by the collection of symmetries of other mathematical objects. This award provides support for graduate students working in areas related to the project.<br/><br/>In technical terms, the PI will study word maps of groups---that is, maps from G^d to G that are obtained by substitution into a fixed element w in the free group on d generators. There are three parts of this project. In the first part, the PI will study quantitative aspects of word maps for compact groups. This will be expressed via the word measure, which is the push-forward of the Haar measure on G^d by the word map. The goal of this part is to bound the Fourier coefficients of the word measure, as well as to understand its density at the identity. In the second part, the PI will study word maps in higher-rank arithmetic groups, trying to determine whether words have finite widths in these groups. In the third part, the PI will study word maps in finite groups. The big question there is whether a word is determined by its distributions on all finite groups. A major part of this project will be about applications of word maps. Most notably are applications in logic (the model theory of arithmetic lattices), representation theory (Kirillov's orbit method for algebraic groups over local rings of positive characteristic), and connections of distributions of word values and low-dimensional topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematical exploration and development of these types of ""higher"" symmetries reveals structure and form in any system where they are present, reducing degrees of uncertainty in these system and bringing progress within reach.  While a great deal of progress has been made developing these higher symmetries, the razor's edge of current understanding has revealed that the most exciting applications will require a more flexible theory than has been previously developed.

The primary aim is to expand the notion of categorified quantum group from its additive framework to a more robust and homotopically flavored theory that is better adapted for solving the most pressing open problems in the area.  In particular, such a framework will shed light on tensor products of higher representations, lead to a richer higher representation theory that allows for infinite dimensional representations, and provide direct applications to stable refinements in link homology.

This central subject in mathematics has seen contributions made by many well-known mathematicians including Fermat, Euler, and Gauss. Modern study of Diophantine equations in the early 20th century started with the theory of quadratic forms by Hilbert, followed by the remarkable discovery of the local-to-global principle of Hasse and Minkowski. Weil carried the idea of Hasse-Minkowski further,  incorporating the idea of Riemann zeta function, to define what is now called Hasse-Weil zeta function, which is built up on the numbers of solutions of polynomial equations in the much simpler setting of modular arithmetic.  Can one recover to a certain extent the integral or rational solutions from the Hasse-Weil zeta function (and hence from the solutions in modular arithmetic)? In the 1960s, based on computational experiment, Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjectured that, for a class of polynomial equations (corresponding to elliptic curves), the vanishing of the Hasse-Weil zeta function at the center of its symmetry reveals the existence of infinitely many solutions. This research project aims to deepen the understanding of Diophantine equations in the direction pioneered by the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (B-SD) conjecture.<br/><br/>The  project is to study rational algebraic cycles (a natural high dimensional generalization of the concept of rational solutions to Diophantine equations) and their connection to the special values of L-functions over both functional fields and number fields. The theorems of Gross-Zagier and of Kolyvagin proved the B-SD conjecture when the analytic rank of the Hasse-Weil L-function of an elliptic curve is at most one. One of the PI?s goals is to establish the same type of results in certain high dimensional cases: the case of the  Gan-Gross-Prasad cycles from the product of unitary Shimura varieties, and the new case arising from a symmetric pair of reductive groups. This would establish new cases of conjectures of Beilinson, Bloch, and Kato. Another goal of the project is to study special cycles on the moduli space of Shtukas, which is likely to shed light on the B-SD conjecture over function fields.  The methods in the project are from the theory of automorphic L-functions and of relative trace formula, algebro-geometric technique for cycles and moduli spaces, and techniques from harmonic analysis and representation theory of reductive groups over local fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Local-global principles are a central theme in this interplay of subjects, and many important outstanding problems can be expressed in terms of such principles. This project has the objective of understanding local-global principles and their obstructions, in contexts that are broader than those considered in number theory. The project will also support and enhance the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers through seminars, conferences and workshops, and mentoring activities.<br/><br/>The Focused Research Group will focus on local-global principles for algebraic structures defined over function fields of curves over base fields such as p-adic fields, with a longer term goal of treating the case of function fields of curves over global fields. The obstructions to such local-global principles can often be formulated in terms of cohomology. Our project aims to study the finiteness of these obstructions and determine criteria for them to vanish. The resulting understanding will be applied to proving conjectures and solving open problems concerning algebraic structures such as quadratic forms and associative algebras. This will include situations that have been studied by many researchers but where solutions had previously seemed out of reach. Research methods will include field patching, cohomological methods including residues and duality, and approaches from geometry."

Second, moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces and threefolds, especially in the important example of Hilbert schemes, parametrize global objects, and their study involves different techniques. The intersection of the two classes of spaces consists of local geometries such as the plane or toric surfaces, wherein many physical quantities can be explicitly computed.

This research concerns an extraordinary web of conjectures, including the Langlands conjectures, connecting algebra (i.e. the theory of polynomial equations) with analysis and geometry (particularly the study of geometric symmetries). Whenever these conjectures can be established, they provide a powerful tool which can reduce very hard problems in one domain to much easier problems in the other. The most celebrated example was Andrew Wiles' proof, after over 300 years of effort, of Fermat's last theorem. Wiles, partly in conjunction with the PI, reduced this algebraic problem to a much easier problem concerning symmetries of the hyperbolic plane (a sort of geometry popularized in Escher's ""Circle Limit"" woodcuts).

Further progress seems possible. One of the PI's students is also working on related issues and the PI will continue himself to think about these questions.

L-functions are mathematical objects that conjecturally allow us to understand this statistical feature of primes and other objects from the theory of numbers. This project investigates an important conjecture about L-functions, known as the subconvexity problem, which states that the values taken by these L-functions are smaller than expected. If true, it would be an important step in unlocking the statistical information that L- functions contain.<br/><br/>The aim of this award is to make progress on the subconvexity problem for L-functions in higher rank, and to prove subconvexity for as wide a range of automorphic forms as possible. The project will focus on the groups U(n+1) x U(n) and GL(n+1) x GL(n). The PI will approach the problem using arithmetic amplification, representation theory, and ideas from microlocal analysis. A key role will be played by microlocal lifts. The methods used will not depend on the rank of the group in an essential way.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A system of polynomial equations has a geometric avatar, called an algebraic variety.  The mantra of arithmetic geometry is that geometric properties of an algebraic variety, like curvature, bear strongly on the types and the structure of solutions to the underlying system of polynomial equations.  The PI studies systems of polynomial equations whose algebraic varieties are surfaces, i.e., they are two-dimensional.  Algebraic surfaces are classified into four rough phyla. Within this classification, the PI studies the class of K3 surfaces, within a phylum of ""intermediate complexity.""  Our knowledge of the geometry of K3 surfaces is ripe enough now for a meaningful study of the rational points they harbor.  The projects supported by this award aim to answer questions like: given a set of polynomial equation that define a K3 surface, is there an algorithm that will determine whether the system of equations has solutions?  If so, can this algorithm be implemented?<br/><br/>K3 surfaces have a rich and structured geometry; their arithmetic is subtle, yet conceivably tractable. A host of conjectures in the last 10 years point to a surprising expectation: given equations for a K3 surface over a number field, there should be an algorithm that detects whether the surface caries rational points. Many of the projects are designed to either provide evidence towards this expectation, or to give practical methods for detecting the existence of rational points on K3 surfaces.  Proposed projects include a detailed study of moduli spaces of K3 surfaces with Brauer group level structures, as well as a type of inverse Galois problem to study the possible algebraic Brauer groups of K3 surfaces.  The PI also proposes to study a class of orbifold points on algebraic varieties that interpolate between rational points and integral points, and to do so in a uniform way, so as to develop a better understanding of when treatments of these two types of points must be separated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It turns out that also many problems in mathematics concerning simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers can be understood in terms of the behavior of dynamical systems. Furthermore, systems that arise in this context are of algebraic nature, which makes it possible to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools for their investigation.

This is a field that deals with the study of algebraic varieties, that is, the solution set of a system of polynomial equations in several variables. For example, the parabola defined by the equation y=x^2 in the plane is smooth, meaning that  locally, at any point, it looks like a line, while the curve defined by the equation y^2=x^3 is not smooth at the origin (it looks like a cusp near the origin). The singular or non-smooth points of an algebraic variety have very rich algebraic and geometric structures, and investigating their properties has many applications in other sciences and engineering. The projects that will be explored are the study of singular points of algebraic varieties (i.e., singularities), with a focus on measuring the singularities (e.g., assigning some invariant to compare them with each other) using the theory multiplier/test ideals and multiplicities. <br/><br/>The PI plans to develop a mixed characteristic singularity theory that is parallel to singularities in the minimal model program and tight closure theory from equal characteristic. This is motivated by the recent breakthrough of Yves Andre that solved Hochster's long-standing direct summand conjecture and the existence of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras. Together with Karl Schwede, the PI utilizes Andre`'s techniques from perfectoid algebras and spaces to start building such a theory, introducing a perfectoid version of multiplier/test ideals. There will be applications on the study of symbolic powers in mixed characteristic, as well as the study of family of singularities when the characteristic varies. Another research direction is the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities attached to singularities, with a focus on Lech's conjecture, Lech's inequality, and the Stuckrad--Vogel invariant. The PI has settled the dimension three equal characteristic case of the longstanding Lech's conjecture, and has recently settled the Stuckrad--Vogel conjecture (together with Klein, Pham, Smirnov and Yao). The proposed projects include attacking the higher dimensional case of Lech's conjecture by studying and improving the classical Lech's inequality.

Understanding the solutions of systems of polynomial equations is a key to advances in many areas, including computer aided geometric design, robotics and physics. In most cases a small change of the coefficients results in a  small change of the geometric objects. For example, increasing the radius of a  sphere a little results in a slightly larger sphere. The aim of this project is to give a general theoretical framework for analyzing those cases when a small change of the coefficients results in a dramatic change of the geometric objects.  These are the cases when a small error in measurement or manufacturing may have large consequences.<br/><br/><br/>The main aim of the project is to understand what a good family of algebraic varieties is. The moduli of curves and its compactification constructed by Deligne and Mumford are among the most important objects in mathematics and in string theory. The goal of higher dimensional moduli theory is to construct more general versions and to use this in understanding the geometry of higher dimensional algebraic varieties. An approach to compactifying the moduli space of varieties of general type was proposed by Kollar and Shepherd-Barron in 1988. The limiting objects are called stable varieties. These satisfy a local condition  (having only log-canonical singularities) and a global condition (having ample canonical class). More generally, following Alexeev,  one should consider moduli spaces of pairs of a projective, reduced scheme and a non-negative linear combination (with rational or real coefficients) of divisors. In order to get a reasonable moduli space, these pairs should satisfy a local condition  (the pair has only semi-log-canonical singularities) and a global condition (having ample log canonical class). The aim of the project is to apply the study of semi-log-canonical singularities to complete the moduli theory of stable pairs. The theory is complete as far as the underlying varieties are concerned, but the divisor parts of the pairs exhibit non-flat behavior that is harder to approach with the usual techniques. For stable varieties without divisors, the existence of the moduli space are known, but it needs to be written down in a systematic way. When a divisor is added, we run into the problem  (first observed by Hassett) that a deformation  of the pair need not induce a flat deformation of the divisor part. For seminormal base spaces the theory of Chow varieties is ideal to understand non-flat deformations over. The first main aim is to generalize this to reduced base spaces. In general we may expect a better theory when the coefficients in the divisorial part are bigger than a half.  The second main aim is to work out the moduli theory by treating the variety and the divisor  as essentially independent objects varying flatly. A third aim is to understand what happens when the coefficients in the divisorial part are allowed to be a half, since this  case  comes up frequently in applications. Besides being important in its own right,  this is a test case for the various techniques that one can use in general. The fourth, most speculative part is to develop a general moduli theory that works optimally in all cases. A key problem is that there are several competing definitions that give slightly different answers for some non-reduced schemes. We need to understand the precise relationships and to find the optimal theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator works on the connections between the algebraic properties of equations and the geometric properties of the spaces they define. In particular, this research project uses syzygies to study fundamental questions regarding Riemann surfaces, one of the most important classes of geometric objects. The investigation of syzygies, or the relations amongst equations, has long played a central role in algebra, with a history ranging from 19th-century invariant theory to 21st-century theoretical physics.  Applications of this research include moduli spaces, matrix factorizations, string theory, enumerative geometry, and mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>In more detail, the investigator is working on relating the algebraic invariants associated to the extrinsic geometry of a Riemann surface embedded in projective space to its intrinsic geometry. The relevant algebraic invariants are the Betti numbers of the minimal free resolution of the coordinate ring, as defined by Hilbert, whereas the intrinsic geometry is encoded in the invariants of Brill-Noether theory. The investigator will explore longstanding fundamental conjectures predicting precise relationships between these invariants. The project investigates these conjectures and generalizations of them using several new techniques such as intersection theory, the moduli space of curves, Hurwitz space, and vector bundle techniques."

The deep relationship between arithmetic and geometry allows the techniques, tools, and intuitions from one to be applied with great effect to the other, leading to new and important insights, results, and conjectures. The research of the PI will continue this tradition and push the analogy in new directions.<br/><br/>The project will develop a new analogue of Iwasawa theory for function fields by investigating the structure and growth of the p-divisible groups of the Jacobians associated to a pro-p branched Galois tower of curves over a finite field of characteristic p.  These p-divisible groups break up into three pieces: an etale part, a multiplicative part, and a local-local part. Using Dieudonne theory and its relation to p-adic cohomology, the PI expects to prove under very general hypotheses that the etale and multiplicative parts exhibit strikingly regular and predictable behavior in any such tower.

It a suite of conjectures which encompasses classical patterns in numbers (called ""reciprocity laws"") discovered by Euler and Gauss, as well as modern results like Fermat's Last Theorem. In brief, the Langlands program unites two sorts of symmetries: one coming from continuous entities (think of all the ways a sphere might be rotated in space), and the other from roots of algebraic equations (think of the ""plus or minus"" in the quadratic formula). The PI proposes research on the Langlands program, specifically the part dealing with the p-adic numbers, which are the strange cousins of the real numbers. (The letter p here stands for a prime number.  The real numbers form a connected continuum, whereas the p-adic numbers are totally disconnected, like infinite fractal dust.)  The Langlands program as it applies to the real numbers was worked out by Langlands himself, while the p-adic story remains somewhat mysterious.  The PI intends to contribute to this portion of the Langlands program by studying the geometry of some fascinating new structures discovered in the last several years, namely perfectoid spaces and diamonds.  These structures were invented by Peter Scholze, who received the Fields Medal in 2018 for their discovery. The project also supports work of the PI's graduate student, Maria Fernandez, on related topics.<br/><br/>Since their introduction around 2012, perfectoid spaces have had some unexpected applications. One of these is Laurent Fargues' program to geometrize the Langlands program over the p-adic numbers.  That is, he has brought it in line with the parallel program of geometric Langlands, which seems rather more tractable.  Inspired by Fargues' program, the PI has proved (in joint work with Tasho Kaletha and David Hansen) a form of Kottwitz' conjecture on the cohomology of Rapoport-Zink spaces, using a version of the Lefschetz fixed-point formula which can apply to perfectoid spaces. This can be recognized as a geometric manifestion of Langlands functoriality between a p-adic group and one of its inner twists. The PI will expand these methods to apply to other sorts of functorialities. There is a further project concerning the ""smoothness"" of perfectoid spaces (a beautiful concept dating to 2016), and another on the modularity of elliptic curves over function fields, which is joint with the PI's graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over last 20 year important connections with string theory were discovered as well. Algebraic Geometry is the study of algebraic varieties: geometric objects that can be described as the collections of points satisfying a set of polynomial equations. One of the aims of the field is to classify algebraic varieties. This can be done by first associating discrete invariants to algebraic varieties and then studying all algebraic varieties with a given set of invariants. A basic invariant used in algebraic geometry, as well as in differential geometry, is the first Chern class. Algebraic varieties can be divided into classes according to the positivity properties (or lack thereof) of this invariant. One of the most important of these classes is that of varieties with first Chern class equal to zero. These varieties have a crucial role also in physics and in differential geometry.  With this project the PI aims to advance our knowledge of hyper-K\""ahler manifolds which are, together with complex tori and Calabi-Yau manifolds, one of the building blocks of varieties with trivial first Chern class.<br/><br/>More specifically, the PI plans to carry out the research in following directions:  investigating the relation between hyper-Kahler manifolds and cubic fourfolds,  improving the current knowledge of Lagrangian fibrations, using Lagrangian fibrations to expand our knowledge of the known examples, and carrying out a systematic study of symplectic resolutions.

A wide-range of conjectures imply that in many cases the distribution of integer solutions mimics a randomly generated set in the ambient space. Systems of equation that have a large enough group of symmetries are called homogeneous and they play a central role in this project. These symmetries can be used to relate different integer solutions to each other and facilitate the introduction of methods from the theory of dynamical systems to this research area. The dynamical methods have been immensely successful in solving long standing problems in number theory. Early breakthroughs include Linnik's results about the equidistribution of integral points on the sphere and Margulis's solution of the Oppenheim conjecture regarding the values attained by an irrational quadratic form at integer points. The PI will integrate methods from dynamics and number theory to study questions which could not be solved by either of these techniques by itself. <br/><br/>The integral points on a homogeneous variety are dual to periodic orbits of the point stabilizer. The point stabilizer acts on an arithmetic homogeneous space. The main focus of this project is the case of torus stabilizers.

Periodic torus orbits unify several objects in number theory and homogeneous dynamics into a single framework. In addition to integral points on some varieties, periodic torus orbits also generalize the notion of Heegner points and closed geodesics on the modular curve and their higher rank variants, e.g. Galois orbits of special points on Shimura varieties. Periodic torus orbits are closely related to some automorphic L-functions by period formulae like the Waldspurger formula and Hecke's formula for Eisenstein series. A complete description of all the orbits for a higher rank torus action on a homogeneous space is a long standing open problem.

The P.I. will primarily study functions which are natural relatives to modular forms called mock modular and quantum modular forms, and harmonic Maass forms.  Modular forms are among the most fundamental objects in the area of number theory in mathematics. For example, they are central to the Riemann Hypothesis (1859), so significant a conjecture  that the Clay Mathematics Institute is offering one million dollars to anyone who can solve it.  Major developments in the theory of modular forms were also crucial to the 1995 proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (1637), a conjecture which defeated mathematicians for 358 years. Beyond number theory, modular forms also yield applications to the diverse areas of combinatorics, mathematical physics, cryptography,  and more.  The newer related theories of harmonic Maass forms and mock modular forms have evolved substantially over the last 10-15 years, and have opened the door to many new applications and significant results;  a comprehensive theory is still lacking, however.  Moreover, within the last few years, the relatively new subject of quantum modular forms has shown intriguing connections to other areas including topology, mathematical physics, representation theory, combinatorics, and more.  <br/><br/>The P.I. will study the theory and applications of harmonic Maass forms, mock modular forms, quantum modular forms and related functions.  An overarching question is to understand the various roles played by the holomorphic parts of harmonic Maass forms and related automorphic objects in mathematics and number theory.  Methods include tools from the theory of harmonic Maass forms, aspects of the developing theory of quantum modular forms, transformation and other properties of mock modular and mock Jacobi forms,  zeta functions, analytic properties of Mordell and Eichler integrals, theta functions, and combinatorial q-hypergeometric series.  The relatively new subject of quantum  modular forms in particular has shown rich connections to other areas including harmonic Maass forms, Eichler integrals, radial limits and mock modular forms, combinatorics, partial theta functions, Jacobi forms, topology, and vertex algebras, many of which are included within the scope of this proposal.

The subject has a strong classical tradition. At present, in one significant strand, research efforts in the field go toward establishing mathematical foundations for the physics of the early universe. A particularly important role in this effort is played by moduli theory, which deals with the classification and deformation properties of important geometric objects of the same type. The current project will investigate moduli theory of sheaves, objects corresponding to gauge fields (such as the electromagnetic field) in physics. Mathematical quantities associated with moduli spaces of sheaves correspond to amplitudes of scattering processes in particle physics. Studying the structure of these quantities therefore bears on important questions in both geometry and high-energy physics. Thus, while contributing to geometry, the project also seeks to improve our understanding of theoretical physics.<br/><br/>In one direction, the PI will investigate central series of invariants on Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces -- spaces which have emerged as essential objects in both geometry and representation theory.  She will also try to put on rigorous geometric footing a q-deformation of two dimensional Yang-Mills theory, by interpreting it in a four-dimensional context, and connecting it with recent work on modularity of invariants for moduli spaces of stable sheaves on surfaces. In a different direction, the PI's efforts will be concentrated on understanding the groups of cycles modulo rational equivalence of moduli spaces of stable sheaves on curves and K3 surfaces, not least with a view toward confirming the Hodge conjecture for these spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have been classified completely in dimensions one, two, and three by delicate geometric arguments and case-by-case analysis. According to the mirror symmetry phenomenon from theoretical physics, Calabi-Yau shapes come in pairs X and Y such that geometric properties of X correspond in a precise way to different geometric properties of Y, and vice versa. There is a version of mirror symmetry for Fano shapes as well: if X is a Fano shape of dimension n then its mirror partner is a union of Calabi-Yau shapes of dimension n-1. This project will use mirror symmetry to develop an approach to classification of Fano shapes which is amenable to computation, and to investigate new viewpoints on Fano shapes provided by the mirror correspondence. <br/> <br/>Fano manifolds are positively curved spaces that play a central role in algebraic and complex geometry. There are finitely many topological types of Fano manifold in each dimension. Fano manifolds of dimension at most three have been classified by hand, but due to the scale of the problem a computational approach to classification is needed in higher dimensions. There is a version of the mirror symmetry phenomenon that applies to Fano manifolds: the mirror partner of a Fano manifold X of dimension n is the total space Y of a one parameter family of Calabi-Yau manifolds of dimension n-1.

Algebraic geometry is concerned with the study of the geometric spaces which locally can be modeled as the set of solutions of systems of polynomials in several variables, typically over a field but also over arithmetically interesting rings such as the integers. Such spaces are ubiquitous in mathematics, arising in many other areas such as representation theory, combinatorics and mathematical physics. They also arise naturally in a variety of applications in other disciplines such as computer science and engineering. A common theme in mathematics when studying complex objects, such as algebraic varieties, is to consider various features or invariants which are more tractable yet rich enough to capture meaningful information. The project will advance our understanding of several such invariants and study applications in algebraic and arithmetic geometry.<br/><br/>More specifically the project is concerned with the following topics. Most of the work will be carried out with collaborators and students. (1) Derived categories of coherent sheaves on smooth projective algebraic varieties over a field and understanding additional cohomological features of equivalences between such categories. The goal is understand to what extent the derived category of coherent sheaves, together with additional structure, determines the isomorphism class, or possibly the birational equivalence class, of an algebraic variety. (2) Log coherent sheaves and Hochschild and topological Hochschild homology for log schemes. The objective is to understand a suitable dg category of coherent sheaves associated to a morphism of log schemes. The investigation of such a category also has broader implications for the study of degeneration phenomena for coherent sheaves. (3) Reconstruction theorems for algebraic varieties. In particular, the PI will investigate new approaches to, and generalizations of, reconstruction results previously studied using model theory.

The number systems in which these solutions live are called algebraic number fields.  One of the central motivating questions in number theory for over a century has been whether one can construct certain special algebraic number fields using analytic techniques.  Hilbert stated this problem as the 12th in his famous list of 23 problems at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians.  The problem has been solved in only the simplest cases.  These solutions use special values of modular forms, which are certain analytic functions that have a rich supply of symmetries.  This project outlines a program to give a solution to Hilbert's 12th problem in an infinite family of new situations.  The key ideas are to use a modern form of analysis, called p-adic analysis, in conjunction with other advanced techniques in number theory including modular forms, Galois representations, and Iwasawa theory.  Solving Hilbert's 12th problems in these new cases will be a major advance in our understanding of algebraic number systems.<br/>    <br/>The PI has stated a conjecture with Spiess for an exact p-adic analytic formula for Gross-Stark units.  These units, along with other easily written elements, generate the maximal abelian extension of totally real fields.  Therefore, solving this problem can be viewed as providing a solution to Hilbert's 12th problem for totally real fields.  Such a solution to Hilbert's 12th problem is not provided by the usual framework of conjectures for L-functions, such as Stark's conjectures.  The PI will continue his work with Kakde on attacking his conjecture.  Two new ideas relative to previous work on this topic are the use of the Taylor-Wiles ""horizontal Iwasawa theory"" method, as well as the introduction of group-ring families of modular forms.  Next, in joint work with Spiess, the PI has stated a conjecture for the principal minors and characteristic polynomial of Gross' regulator.   The PI plans to work together with Spiess and Kakde to generalize the techniques described above to higher rank (in particular the application of the Taylor-Wiles method) and thereby prove his conjecture on principal minors, which again goes beyond the usual framework of p-adic L-functions. Finally, the PI will work with Guido Kings to apply the Eisenstein cocycle to the study of abelian L-functions of general number fields.  Two important test cases to consider are ground fields that are almost totally real and ground fields that are abelian extensions of CM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As an example, there are eight symmetries of a square, consisting of transformations like ""rotate by 90 degrees,"" or ""reflect across a diagonal line,"" and combinations of these.  Each of these symmetries represents a transformation of the plane that leaves the square unchanged, and we say that the transformations of the plane form a representation of the symmetry group of the square. The symmetries of the square and other polygons are special examples of a family of groups called Coxeter groups, which capture and generalize the intuitive notion of a reflection group. In recent decades, mathematicians have discovered a rich theory of representations in which the object being acted on is not a plane (or some higher dimensional analogue), but rather a more structured sort of object, called a category.  This project is concerned with the categorical representation theory of Coxeter groups and some closely related objects, called Hecke algebras, and connections to other areas of mathematics, such as the study of knots and links in topology.<br/><br/>In more detail, three interrelated objects will be studied: (a) categories of Soergel bimodules, (b) Hilbert schemes of points in the plane, and (c) Khovanov-Rozansky link homology.  First, the investogator will continue to develop the theory of categorical diagonalization and apply the results to the categorified representation theory of Hecke algebras and quantum groups. This includes work on the categorified Casimir operator.  As an application of categorical diagonalization, the full-twist Rouquier complex acting on categories of Soergel bimodules will be diagonalized, extending work already accomplished in type A.  The resulting eigendecompositions present a method for approaching recent conjectures of Gorsky, Negut, and Rasmussen regarding a deep correspondence between Soergel bimodules and Hilbert schemes. The investigator will utilize categorical diagonalization, as well as recent computational breakthroughs, to work toward a proof of this correspondence.  Finally, the Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen correspondence makes several predictions regarding the structure of the triply graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology, which the investigator will explore using insights from the connection with Hilbert schemes."

The research aims to use sophisticated modern methods in algebraic geometry and number theory to produce general bounds on the number of solutions to certain Diophantine equations.  The study of Diophantine equations involves finding whole number solutions to polynomial equalities, such as when the sum of two fifth powers is again a fifth power. The study of such equations dates back almost 2,000 years and is among the most difficult problems in all of mathematics, as evidenced by the fact that it was established only 45 years ago that it is not possible to devise a general process with a finite number of operations that can decide whether a Diophantine equation has a solution.  The bounds under development in this research project, which depend only on the degree of the equation (i.e., the size of the exponents), will advance knowledge in this fundamental area of mathematics. The project also involves a middle- and high-school enrichment program, in addition to support for undergraduate and graduate education. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigator seeks to use p-adic analysis and the Chabauty-Coleman method, along with ideas from tropical and non-Archimedean geometry, to give uniform bounds (in terms of the genus) on the number of rational points on hyperbolic curves satisfying certain conditions, refining earlier results. These conditions generally involve a constraint on the Mordell-Weil rank. Using related methods, he will also attempt to prove the uniform Manin--Mumford conjecture, which gives a uniform bound (again in terms of the genus) on the size of a torsion packet on a hyperbolic curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Ideally this result would be unconditional; as a first step, the principal investigator will treat Mumford curves and curves with compact-type reduction."

It involves applying homotopy theory (a branch of algebraic topology) to study arithmetic and geometry,  using coarse aspects or invariants of spaces to study arithmetic phenomena.  A generalization of the number of d-dimensional holes in a space is used to control the solutions to certain polynomial equations. When d is equal to one, this has applications to a program of Grothendieck to control solutions using the loops on a space.  Maps between certain spaces induce maps between the d-dimensional holes giving rise to a notion of degree. A generalization of degree due to F. Morel is used to study arithmetic properties of singularities. This project furthermore includes the design and implementation of a series of four week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During each of four summers, approximately eight high school students will work on an important mathematical problem which has an elegant or useful known solution, learning the background material as necessary, and then creating learning materials for other students of the same age group.

In addition to the work on the specific mathematical problem, career options in mathematics will be presented and support and mentorship will be provided for students interested in pursuing mathematical careers.<br/><br/>Certain arithmetic and geometric phenomena which appear delicate are invariant under appropriate notions of homotopy. Such phenomena motivate the use of homotopy theory to study arithmetic or geometry. The sub-projects contained in this project share the perspective wherein problems in arithmetic or geometry are approached by using Morel-Veoveodky's A1-homotopy theory and applying realization functors. Sub-project 1 studies an enrichment of the Section Conjecture and an approach to proving it. Running the same methods backwards produces results on the differential graded algebra of the absolute Galois group.

This has applications to the study of the non-abelian Galois representation given by the fundamental group of the projective line with three points removed, and has applications to sub-project 1. The first step of sub-project 3 is to prove a joint conjecture with Jesse Kass that the quadratic form appearing in the Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili Signature Formula can be interpreted as a local degree in A1-homotopy, where the natural notion of degree is a quadratic form. We then enrich the Milnor number and use this enrichment to study arithmetic properties of singularities."

Arithmetic geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies integer solutions of polynomial equations and has played a central role in solving many outstanding problems in number theory, such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the Mordell conjecture concerning the number of rational points on a curve. The main objects of study in this research project are called ""Shimura varieties,"" the study of which is at the interface of algebraic geometry, number theory, and representation theory and has broad applications to a number of far-reaching and influential conjectures<br/><br/>The project concerns problems in and applications of the arithmetic of Shimura varieties, which are generalizations of the moduli space of abelian varieties. In the first part of the project the PI plans to study the structure of the cohomology of Shimura varieties, and the structure of their mod p points. Specifically, there is a conjecture, proved by the PI in some cases, that the isogeny class of every mod p point contains the reduction of a special point. These results can be used to study the Hasse-Weil zeta function of a Shimura variety, following a program of Langlands. Another part of the project aims to study an analogue of the Mumford-Tate conjecture in crystalline  cohomology; this amounts to an algebraisation problem for certain formal cycles on a Shimura variety. Finally, the PI plans to apply techniques from the deformation theory of finite flag group schemes to study Hilbert's 13th problem, which asks for the minimal m for which the solution of a general polynomial of degree n can be written as a composite of functions of m variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some systems of equations have plenty of integer solutions. This research concerns the distribution of the integer solutions inside the continuum of real solutions. A wide-range of conjectures imply that in many cases the distribution of integer solutions mimics a randomly generated set in the ambient space. Systems of equation that have a large enough group of symmetries are called homogeneous and they play a central role in this project. These symmetries can be used to relate different integer solutions to each other and facilitate the introduction of methods from the theory of dynamical systems to this research area. The dynamical methods have been immensely successful in solving long standing problems in number theory. Early breakthroughs include Linnik's results about the equidistribution of integral points on the sphere and Margulis's solution of the Oppenheim conjecture regarding the values attained by an irrational quadratic form at integer points. The PI will integrate methods from dynamics and number theory to study questions which could not be solved by either of these techniques by itself. <br/><br/>The integral points on a homogeneous variety are dual to periodic orbits of the point stabilizer. The point stabilizer acts on an arithmetic homogeneous space. The main focus of this project is the case of torus stabilizers. The PI will study the asymptotic distribution of periodic torus orbits on arithmetic homogeneous spaces. Periodic torus orbits unify several objects in number theory and homogeneous dynamics into a single framework. In addition to integral points on some varieties, periodic torus orbits also generalize the notion of Heegner points and closed geodesics on the modular curve and their higher rank variants, e.g. Galois orbits of special points on Shimura varieties. Periodic torus orbits are closely related to some automorphic L-functions by period formulae like the Waldspurger formula and Hecke's formula for Eisenstein series. A complete description of all the orbits for a higher rank torus action on a homogeneous space is a long standing open problem. A fundamental difficulty is the lack of unipotents which are crucial to most of the dynamical methods. The PI intends to make progress using a combination of methods from homogeneous dynamics, automorphic forms, arithmetic geometry and multiplicative number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI has conjectured the existence of new structures that govern their shape (mathematically speaking their topology), which he will investigate in more detail. The second topic relates to lattices of high dimension.

The third meeting is tentatively planned for April 2020, with the location to be determined during the meeting on April 2019.  The meetings consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast. Each meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty. Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks. <br/><br/>A primary purpose of the Southeastern Number Theory Meetings is to regularly convene Southeastern number theorists at all career stages and from all types of institutions at low cost to the participants. Participants and speakers include graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty. Efforts will be made to increase participation of undergraduates. Many participants come from institutions that do not award Ph.D. degrees. Such participants often have limited access to travel funds or to research seminars. The Southeastern Number Theory Meetings serve the purpose of integrating them into the larger research community. The organizers will also continue to try to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and racial and ethnic minorities. As a means of engaging undergraduates at host institutions, we will include an accessible Friday colloquium lecture by one of the plenary speakers. The Southeastern Number Theory Meetings are designed to both strengthen and invigorate the number theory community in the Southeast.

Sums of squares methods found applications in many diverse areas, such as optimization, physics and computer science. Convex duality connects nonnegative polynomials to truncated moment problems of real analysis.

In terms of practical applications of the project, the PI expects that his refined version of Ross and Selinger algorithm will be used if a physical quantum computer is built. The hope is that quantum computers will eventually be able to efficiently simulate quantum physics and study many (important) computationally difficult problems inaccessible to modern-day computers. There are models such as the Quantum Gates Model that give theoretical constructions of efficient circuits to be used in quantum computers. This model is connected to the study of integral solutions to Diophantine equations, an ancient subject of interest to mathematicians. A question of interest to both quantum computer scientists as well as mathematicians is the optimal approximation of real solutions of special Diophantine equations by integral solutions. The PI has proved new (optimal) results in this direction. Furthermore, he has proved that this task is computationally hard (NP-complete) for generic inputs.<br/><br/>On a more technical level, one of the central problems in the Quantum Gates Model is the approximation of an arbitrary qubit using a fixed set of generators called universal quantum gates. In the single-qubit case, this amounts to navigating the unitary group SU(2) by a specific set of topological generators (e.g. V-gates or the Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak generators) that are carefully chosen such that the associated transition matrix has the optimal spectral gap (e.g. the eigenvalues of the Hecke operators satisfy the Ramanujan bound). The PI proposes a refinement of the Ross and Selinger algorithm for approximating an arbitrary single-qubit that removes all heuristic assumptions from their algorithm. Among the new tools in this approach are the delta method, Sieve theory, and the spectral theory of modular forms and bounds on their Fourier coefficients. An objective of this project is to generalize the results of the PI to higher rank arithmetic groups which brings in the theory of the oscillator representation and the theory of automorphic representations. Motivated by Berry's conjecture in Quantum Chaos, the PI studies the statistical properties and the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix of the quantum gates (the Hecke operators). So far, the PI has proved power saving upper bounds as well as absolute upper bound on the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the Hecke operators. Furthermore, the PI has proved lower bounds on the discrepancy of the spectral measure with respect to the Plancherel measure. The project brings together the deformation theory of Galois representations, Iwasawa theory, the Taylor-Wiles method, trace formulae, and other tools from the algebraic and analytic number theorists' toolbox in order to answer questions of interest to computer scientists as well as mathematicians.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The purpose of the conference will be to bring together both established and junior researchers in Number Theory from across the globe, and especially researchers in Function Field Arithmetic, Diophantine Geometry, and related fields.  Primary goals will be to discuss recent advances in these areas and to encourage further research and future collaboration, and one important aspect of the conference will be to increase participation of junior researchers.  In addition to twenty invited speakers ranging from established mathematicians to recent Ph.D.'s, the schedule will include 6-8 contributed talks by graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.  The conference website is http://www.ncts.ntu.edu.tw/events_2_detail.php?nid=216.<br/><br/>Since early work of Artin and Weil in the last century, it has been known that the study of function fields of algebraic curves over finite fields in positive characteristic runs in close analogy with the study of number fields.  At the same time Diophantine geometry also applies techniques from algebraic geometry to problems in number theory, and so the two subjects are closely intertwined in their efforts to resolve deep problems in number theory using geometric methods.  The conference will focus on aspects of function field arithmetic and Diophantine geometry that strengthen common points of view and present opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas, including modular forms and Galois representations, special values of L-functions, arithmetic dynamics, and rational points on varieties.  These topics are on the forefront of research in Number Theory, and there have been several major advances in these areas in recent years.  The conference will afford participants the opportunities to communicate their research with a broader mathematical community and to initiate new research projects that advance these important areas of Number Theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
