The  principal investigator will study the rigidity question for  finitely generated modules over a noetherian local ring.  He will  apply this work to the problem of determining when the tensor  product is torsion-free.  He will also work on the classification  of local rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type and will try to  determine the ranks of the indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay  modules over these rings.  Finally, he will study the  arithmetical properties of Picard groups of algebraic varieties  and several related questions concerning the multiplicative  structure of fields.   This research is concerned with a number of questions in  commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry  studies solutions of families of polynomial equations.  One can  either study the geometry of the solution set or approach  problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the  solution set that form what is called a commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a close connection between commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry."

This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,   which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. At  its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting,  although this research is more involved with comparing the  results of counting.  Sauer's theorem is a general inequality  that allows one to know that one collection contains more objects  than another.  Of course the collections must be of particular  types,  but the conditions are not hard to satisfy. Although its  roots go back several centuries, the field of combinatorics has  had an explosive development in the past few decades.  This  growth comes from its importance in communications and  information technology,  and as in this work, artificial  intelligence."

The ideas eminate  from work on the relationship between the Jacobian Conjecture and  the Kirillov-Dixmier Conjecture for the first Weyl algebra.  An  extension of this approach to higher dimensions is also  discussed.       It is well known that an invertible polynomial map on a  complex affine space has a jacobian which is a nonzero constant.   The Jacobian Conjecture asserts the converse: a polynomial map  with a jacobian which is a nonzero constant is invertible.  In  spite of the vast amount of attention which it has attracted over  the last fifty years, the Jacobian Conjecture remains open in  every dimension greater than one.  This award supports work on a  novel approach to this problem."

The  principal investigator will determine if the unramified cohomology can be used to show  the center of the generic division algebra is nonrational and if it can be used to show  other invariant fields are nonrational.  He will also see if the Merkuriev-Suslin theorem  can be made more constructible and if the theory of toric varieties can be used to find  good projective models for multiplicative invariant fields.           The research supported  is in the general area of field theory.  Fields are algebraic structures similar to the  rational numbers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers in that each nonzero  element has an inverse with respect to multiplication.  Field theory is a rich and deep  subject with its historical roots arising from the early attempts to systematically  describe the zeros of polynomials. ***"

Such complexes are called  shellable.  Shellability has proved to be an important tool in  the combinatorics of convex polytopes.  The focus will be on a  combinatorial invariant called the toric h-vector, which in  certain cases is simply a fixed linear transformation of the  vector of face-numbers of the given complex.  Until recently the  only known interpretation of the toric h-vector of an arbitrary  rational polytope came from toric variety theory, but recently  McMullen discovered a combinatorial meaning involving the  polytope algebra, in the case of simplicial polytopes.    McMullen's famous g-theorem says that the toric hvectors of  simplicial polytopes are characterized by the Macaulay  inequalities.  An attempt will be made to determine whether  the same (or stronger) inequalities hold for toric h-vectors of  other shellable complexes.

This work  will build on this via symmetric functions, local associative algebras and universal  algebra.            This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of  the most active fields in today's mathematics. At its roots, combinatorics is the study  of systematic counting.  Counting can be incredibly difficult when the objects are  difficult to list,  and combinatorists look for general methods for overcoming these  difficulties.  Today's combinatorics makes use of a wide variety of the most advanced  and modern mathematical techniques.  Although its roots go back several centuries, the  field has had an explosive development in the past few decades.  This growth comes  from its importance in communications and information technology and from the  success of modern techniques to problems of counting. ***"

Quantum rings  are a generalization of vertex algebras which include the space  of field operators of a free field theory as another special  case.  This concept will be further explored by the principal  investigator.             Conformal field theory is an important physical theory describing  both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed matter  physics and classical motions of strings in string theory.   Besides its importance in physics, the beautiful and rich  mathematical structure of conformal field theory also has  interested many mathematicians.  New relations between different  branches of mathematics, such as representations of  infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces  and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic group, modular  functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is  revealed in the study of conformal field theory."

Both mathematicians and  physicists have thus long realized that many objects of fundamental  importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.  This field is  principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but  in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its  historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge  theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in information  theory. ***"

This conjecture has implications regarding refinements of the tangent and Genocchi numbers. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. At its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting and arrangement. Counting can be incredibly difficult when the objects are difficult to list, and combinatorists look for general methods for overcoming these difficulties. Today's combinatorics makes use of a wide variety of the most advanced and modern mathematical techniques. Although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few decades. This growth comes from its importance in communications and information technology and from the success of modern techniques to problems of counting. ***"

The importance of self-duality in lattices, and particularly in Stone algebras, was motivated by applications to conditional event structures in probability and rough set algebras. Once a better understanding of the self-duality is accomplished, the original applications will be reexamined and new ones sought. The point of view is a categorical one, developed through extensive work using homological methods in algebra. The work draws on diverse fields of logic and model theory, general topology, nonstandard analysis and partially ordered sets - as well as lattice theory, which still remains one of the main tools in the study of logics for computer science, artificial intelligence and expert systems. ***"

It is expected that, for crystallographic Coxeter groups, study of these rings and their integral forms will have important consequences for some central problems in Lie theory. The main object of the research is to obtain additional information on the structure of these rings and related algebras. This project is concerned with the study of Lie algebras and , in particular, with the Kahzdan-Lusztig polynomials. The Kahzdan-Lusztig polynomial is a combinatorially defined object having deep connections with structures in geometry and representation theory. This work is important both in mathematics and physics."

This is research in the field of number theory. Number theory is basically the study of whole numbers. The research done under this award studies properties of the whole numbers by encoding them into functions called modular forms. Number theory is among the oldest fields of mathematics, yet it has always played an important role in choosing directions for the rest of the subject. Within the last half century, the study of whole numbers has become doubly important as the theory has been used to develop new algorithms for computer science and to construct new error correcting codes for electronics."

These lectures are complemented by a concurrent contributed paper session. Polynomial equations are important in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. Moreover, many scientific, economic and engineering problems can be modeled by polynomial equations, and polynomials arise in computational statistics, integer programming, and a variety of other optimization problems. The theory of Groebner bases provides the foundation for many algorithms used in the analysis of such equations. So the theory plays a significant role not just in basic research but also in the solution of problems of strategic interest. Increasingly, this theory is becoming part of the standard curriculum at U.S. universities. Thus, the subject the conference is of interest to students, teachers and researchers in several disciplines, including mathematics, engineering, computer science, and operations research."

The principal investigator will study several aspects of the representation theory of semisimple algebraic groups over fields of prime characteristic, with applications to finite groups of Lie type. The program of Lusztig relating quantum groups and modular representations is of primary concern, with emphasis on injective modules and tilting modules. Representation arising from the cohomology of line budnles on flag varieties pose related problems; a major question here concerns the relationship with Kazhdon-Luztig polynomials for the affine Weyl group. The study of algebraic groups should provide further insight into representations of associated finite simple groups, and related cohomology. This research is in the general area of algebraic groups. Roughly speaking, a group which satisfies a polynomial identity is an algebraic group. The proposed research falls under two broad headings: cohomology of line bundles on flag varieties, and injective modules. Advances along these lines would both shed light on Lusztig's conjecture, as well as point the way beyond it."
