In the real                    coefficients case, he will try to validate the Adem conjecture by               improving current lower bounds.  Related geometric and                          topological problems on isoclinic planes in euclidean spaces,                   polynomial maps between spheres, and the construction of                        nonsingular bilinear maps will also be studied.                                      The research supported involves the theory of quadratic                    forms.  This, in its simplest form, is the study of polynomial                  forms of degree two.  Equivalently, it is an analysis of the                    types of inner products that can define the metric geometry of an               n-dimensional vector space.  The study of quadratic forms has                   deep interrelations with algebraic geometry and algebraic                       k-theory."
