First, the PIs propose to investigate the structure of morphism spaces between real algebraic varieties, especially unstable and stable homotopy types of spaces of ""real algebraic"" morphisms.  Second, the PIs will examine the cohomology of various discrete and arithmetic groups, including algebraic versions of homotopy invariance for cohomology and the related Friedlander-Milnor conjecture.  Third, the PIs propose to investigate invariants of singularities arising from methods involving the cdh-topology, continuing the recent flurry of activity in this subject.  Finally, motivated by comparisons between algebro-geometric and topological invariants, the PIs will investigate semi-topological or morphic invariants of algebraic varieties, which lie partway between the worlds of algebraic geometry and topology.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, one of the oldest branches of mathematics, has at its heart the goal of studying the structure of solutions to systems of polynomial equations; these collections of solutions are called algebraic varieties.  Homotopy theory, sometimes called rubber sheet geometry, attempts to study those aspects of geometric objects that are independent of the way they are pulled or twisted; one way to do this is to attach ""invariants,"" e.g., numbers (or more general algebraic structures), to these objects.  Algebraic varieties arising from equations with real or complex coefficients can be studied by means of homotopy theory, and the invariants that arise are necessarily somewhat restricted.  The goal of this project is to study classical questions in algebraic geometry using invariants of algebraic varieties arising from homotopy theory.  A major aim of this project is to convey some of the enthusiasm, techniques, and mathematical goals of the principal investigators to the next generation of mathematicians represented by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  Methods to recruit and involve early career mathematicians will include the organization of a large international conference, the running of several workshops, the sharing of travel funds, and activities involving visitors from other institutions."

The Langlands program studies the interrelations between several subjects, including the representation theory of reductive groups (both over local fields and over the adeles of a global field), automorphic forms, global Galois representations, and L-functions.  Each of these subjects has a p-adic aspect:  one may consider p-adic or adelic groups acting on topological p-adic vector spaces, p-adic automorphic forms (or their close cousins, cohomology classes with p-adic coefficients on arithmetic quotients of symmetric spaces), p-adic representations of Galois groups and their deformation theory, and p-adic L-functions.  The proposed investigation will encompass all these.   Some of the particular results expected to follow from this investigation are: new results regarding the structure of p-adically completed cohomology on arithmetic quotients of symmetric spaces, and new results relating special values of L-functions attached to modular forms to the arithmetic properties of the associated Galois representations.<br/><br/>Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies phenomena related to properties of whole numbers.  A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest. The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions.  The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures(or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form.  (Number theorists refer to Langlands conjectured relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ""reciprocity law"".)  Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic methods to study his conjectures.  These are methods that exploit the many symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics known as ""the Langlands program"".  A more recent approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods.  These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms and L-functions.   Recently, the representation theoretic methods and p-adic methods have begun to be unified into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program"". The proposer aims to develop new results and methods in the  p-adic Langlands program, and to use them to establish new results about L-functions, and to develop tools for establishing new reciprocity laws."

The research is largely motivated by concrete questions of a combinatorial nature, but it also addresses questions of interest in category theory and general algebra, which in turn should find applications elsewhere. The PI has recently completed an 800 page monograph  (coauthored with Swapneel Mahajan from IIT Mumbai), on which a solid conceptual framework for the study of a large class of Hopf algebras that arise in combinatorics was laid out. This project took about 7 years of dedicated work. This long journey has opened the door to a wealth of new questions and exciting avenues to explore. A very important  finding of this work is the existence of a general construction of Hopf algebras which includes at the same time the combinatorial Hopf algebras alluded to above, and the deformations of the enveloping algebras of simple Lie algebras (quantum groups). This connection has not been explored in depth yet, but it certainly deserves to be. Thus, an important goal of this project will be to bridge between the world of combinatorial Hopf algebras and that of abstract Hopf algebras. There have been recent important advances in the latter (by Andruskiewitsch, Schneider, and others) which should be mutually beneficial to this endeavor.  Central to this work is Joyal's notion of species. It provides the right framework for the application of categorical ideas to algebraic combinatorics. The theory of Fock functors, whose first stages are developed in the PI's work with Mahajan, links the setting of Hopf monoids in species with that of graded Hopf algebras. Extensions of the theory will be explored. Concrete applications to algebraic combinatorics will be a theme of major focus for this project.<br/><br/>The use of algebraic techniques in order to study concrete combinatorial problems, pioneered by Rota, Stanley, and many others, has gained solid ground over the past two decades. This project builds in this direction by exploiting notions and ideas from category theory. Categorical ideas, properly employed, can be very powerful and clarifying. Conversely, the concrete questions studied in this project will serve as motivation and guide for new developments in algebra and category theory. The PI will introduce graduate students to this area of research and make international contacts and collaborations in Europe, Latin America, and India."

The second direction of proposed projects concerns Clifford algebras of higher degree forms and their representations. The projects in this direction include using arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay bundles to construct moduli spaces of irreducible representations of Clifford algebras of ternary cubic forms, and using Clifford algebras of binary forms to construct maximal orders on surfaces. The third direction of proposed projects concerns computations of Lefschetz numbers for Hecke correspondences of certain Shimura varieties. <br/><br/>Over the past few decades there have been increasing and fruitful interactions between various areas of mathematics and theoretical physics. One important thread in these connections has been algebraic geometry, a very old subject that dates back at least to ancient Greece. Algebraic geometry is a subject in which solutions of many variable polynomial equations are studied as geometric objects. The proposed projects use tools from algebraic geometry to solve problems in noncommutative algebra. In noncommutative algebra, the main objects of study are polynomials in which the xy is not the same as yx. Such noncommutative algebras are of interest to physicists as well. A great deal of progress has been achieved in the past 15 years in understanding such algebras and the projects in this proposal will advance this knowledge. The proposed projects in another direction lie at the intersection of number theory (where number systems are studied), representation theory (where symmetries are studied), and topology. In topology, properties of spaces are studied which do not change under elastic deformations such as twisting and stretching. The spaces to be studied in this project encode number theoretic information and possess various kinds of symmetries."

These include an integral representation of the adjoint L function of GL(5), and an extension of the so-called doubling method to the exceptional group G2. <br/><br/>Langlands L functions are certain functions of a single complex variable which appear in the subject of automorphic forms, at the intersection of number theory and representation theory.  The simplest example is the Riemann zeta function, which plays a crucial role in estimating the number of prime integers less than a given number.  The next simplest examples are the Dirichlet L functions, which play a similar role in estimating the distribution of primes in an arithmetic progression.  Other examples were defined using modular forms and elliptic curves, resulting in functions with properties nearly identical to these classical examples.  In the last century it emerged that it was possible to study modular forms and elliptic curves from the point of view of representation theory, which is essentially the study of collections of linear operators acting on a vector space.  At the same time, certain complex functions with nearly the same properties as the classical number theoretic functions discussed above arose naturally in representation theory.  These are Langlands L functions.  The main strategy for studying these functions is via integral representations.  This means, simply, that one tries to take a function of two variables, one of which is complex, and integrate it over the other one.  The result is a function of one complex variable, and one hopes that by setting everything up right one can arrange for it to be a Langlands L function.  To date, no one really knows exactly what it takes for this to work out, although a number of useful heuristics have been suggested.  The PI wishes to continue his study of this intriguing phenomenon."

For large primes, this both directly and indirectly involves quantum groups, in methods pioneered by the PIs. There are immediate consequences, from a classical ""generic cohomology"" theory, obtained by the PIs years ago in collaboration with other authors, to asymptotic estimates for bounds for finite groups of Lie type, with more modern methods sometimes allowing these to be improved to actual bounds. This program has been carried out for degree 1 cohomology, and to the point of generic cohomology for all higher degrees. These results lead to important new questions involving the rates of growth of the cohomology spaces. Again the issues in the structures are intertwined, and the study of algebraic groups is a decided advantage for analyzing the quantum case, with both structures contributing to estimates for the growth of sizes of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.  For algebraic groups, there are many open questions, especially that of a polynomial rate of growth. Such growth rate issues occur broadly in mathematics, especially in algorithmic issues, and are prominent in theoretical computer science. The PIs will also continue to study Koszul properties for the finite dimensional algebras which come up in the representations of semi-simple groups and quantum groups. Koszul structures arise, or may be conjectured, from geometric considerations (perverse sheaves and their filtrations), but the authors have been pushing entirely algebraic methods into areas where geometry may not directly apply.  Applications to the graded and filtered structures of standard (Weyl) modules have already been found,  with additional results expected, as well as applications to filtrations of resolutions and cohomology groups of these modules. Often this work uses a conjecture due to Lusztig, which has been proved true for large primes. These studies exhibit deeper consequences of the conjecture (and could even provide insight for establishing it in more cases). Finally, the PIs will continue their work in small characteristic and the calculation of support varieties.<br/><br/>This proposal concerns the representation and cohomology theory of important  algebraic structures, including semisimple algebraic groups and their finite and infinitesimal subgroups, quantum groups, and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. These structures are interrelated, so can be profitably studied together. A central aspect includes representations of important classes of finite groups. Over the past century, similar theories for continuous groups played a large role in quantum theory and the theory of elementary particles. Their finite analogs have already proved valuable in the design of communications and data storage devices. Though this finite theory remains very incomplete, it will surely be even more important in the future. This project also points to the future in its manifold involvement of graduate and undergraduate students."

It has been proved recently by Parimala and Suresh that every quadratic form in at least nine variables over the function field of a p-adic curve has a nontrivial zero. Further, patching techniques developed by Harbater-Hartmann-Krashen have provided tools to study certain local-global principle for existence of rational points on homogeneous spaces over such fields under the assumption that the algebraic group is rational. We propose to study homogeneous spaces under linear algebraic groups over function fields of curves over local and global fields. The study over function fields over global fields would have tremendous consequences and could lead to the fact that every quadratic form in large enough number of variables over function fields of curves over totally imaginary number fields  has a nontrivial zero. We propose to study questions of Hasse principle for existence of rational points on homogeneous spaces under connected linear algebraic groups over such fields. In the context of simply connected groups, the Rost invariant for principal homogeneous spaces is a powerful tool to study these spaces. We propose to study obstruction to the injectivity of the Rost invariant for function fields of curves over local and global fields.<br/><br/>The study of homogeneous spaces under linear algebraic groups includes study of several interesting algebraic objects like quadratic forms, central simple algebras, Octonian and Albert algebras. The study over number fields is enriched by class field theory techniques. A classical theorem of Hasse-Maass-Schiling for number fields is the following Hasse principle: an element in the number field is a reduced norm from a central simple algebra if and only if it is positive at all real completions where the division algebra is ramified. A similar criterion for reduced norms for 2-dimensional fields is a far-reaching extension of this classical result for number fields. We propose to replace class field theory by purely homological properties of these fields and the geometry of the associated arithmetic surfaces to study properties of homogeneous spaces in the general setting of function fields of curves over local and global fields."

Part of the proposal builds on recent work of the PI with Gopal Prasad in which the notion of weak commensurability of Zariski-dense subgroups of semi-simple algebraic groups was introduced, analyzed and then applied to problems in differential geometry dealing with length-commensurable and isospectral locally symmetric spaces. One of the goals in this area is to complete the investigation of weakly commensurable arithmetic subgroups of absolutely almost simple groups and to extend the results to some nonarithmetic groups. Further goals include investigating weak commensurability for subgroups of general semi-simple groups and for groups over fields of positive characteristic. The proposal addresses potential applications of these results to differential geometry. Another important component of the proposal is the congruence subgroup problem, which remains unresolved for anisotropic groups associated with noncommutative division algebras. The proposal discusses new criteria for the centrality of the congruence kernel that are expected to lead to the resolution of the congruence subgroup problem in new cases. In addition, the PI and G. Prasad plan to write a book on the congruence subgroup problem. Closely related to the congruence subgroup problem is the investigation of the normal subgroup structure of the groups of rational points of algebraic groups; one of the objectives here is to obtain an ultimate form of the congruence subgroup theorem for the multiplicative group of a finite-dimensional division algebra, which would complete a long line of research conducted by the PI jointly with Y. Segev and G.M. Seitz. The proposal also contains a number of problems that involve various generalizations of arithmetic groups, ranging from arbitrary Zariski-dense subgroups to the automorphism groups of free groups.<br/> <br/>Arithmetic groups are special groups whose elements are matrices with integral entries. This notion, which can be traced back to the work of Gauss on integral quadratic forms, plays a crucial role in many areas of mathematics including algebra and various parts of number theory (e.g., the theory of automorphic forms). In recent years, new applications of the theory of arithmetic groups have emerged in algebraic and differential geometry, Lie groups and combinatorics. The proposal focuses on several important aspects of the theory of arithmetic groups as well as on potential applications."

(1) Classification of Hopf algebras of small dimension: It is fundamentally important to understand some basic examples in any mathematical theory. The PI will continue to work on the classification of Hopf algebras whose dimension admits a simple factorization.(2) Gauge invariants of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras: It is generally difficult to decide whether two given finite-dimensional Hopf algebras have monoidally inequivalent representation categories. The PI expects to discover some invariants under Drinfeld twists, which are generalizations of Frobenius-Schur indicators to arbitrary finite-dimensional Hopf algebras. (3) Arithmetic properties of Frobenius-Schur indicators: The arithmetic properties of Frobenius-Schur indicators have led to the quantum Cauchy theorem for integral fusion categories and a congruence subgroup theorem for modular tensor categories. The PI will continue to explore these properties and their applications to fusion categories.<br/><br/>The appeal of symmetry has been guidance for understanding the nature of science. Some symmetry can be described in terms of algebraic structures. For instance, the symmetry of platonic solids can be described by some finite groups of spatial rotations. The symmetry of some physical systems can be described by Hopf algebras, and tensor categories, which are closely related to other areas of mathematics such as representation theory, topological invariants, and conformal field theory. The proposed research studies some fundamental questions in the field, with an eye on applications in other areas."

Selmer groups have <br/>traditionally been an important tool for studying the Mordell-Weil group of <br/>an elliptic curve over a number field.  They have also played an important <br/>role in proving special cases of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture <br/>which provides a relationship between arithmetic properties of an elliptic <br/>curve E and the behavior of the Hasse-Weil L-function for E.  In recent years, <br/>it has become clear that certain natural generalizations of the Selmer group <br/>should provide similar conjectural relationships to the behavior of much more <br/>general kinds of L-functions. Iwasawa theory provides a framework for studying <br/>these conjectures. In its essence, the idea is to study Selmer groups associated <br/>to a family of representations of the absolute Galois group of a number field. <br/>The formulation of these conjectures in a general setting leads to some <br/>fundamental problems. One problem is to find a simple way to measure how <br/>large the Selmer groups are.  Their size should be measured by an element in <br/>a certain ring. But it is difficult to find a way to define that element. One of the <br/>objectives of this project is to tackle that question in two contrasting settings. <br/>In one setting,  the ring is rather easy to describe, but is non-commutative. In <br/>the other setting,  the ring is commutative, but we know very little about its <br/>actually structure.  Another objective of this project is to better understand the <br/>behavior of certain quantities which indirectly reflect the structure of Selmer <br/>groups, especially in the non-commutative setting. These quantities are certain <br/>``multiplicities.''  There are typically an infinite number of these quantities. <br/>Professor Greenberg  hopes to show how to determine all of these quantities <br/>from just a finite number of them.  <br/><br/><br/>One of the fundamental questions in the theory of numbers is the study<br/>of solutions of an algebraic equation. The difficulty of this question<br/>depends on the degree of the equation and the number of variables. It<br/>has been understood since antiquity how to study this question when the<br/>degree is one or two and the number of variables is also one or two.<br/>However, the question becomes much more subtle when one considers<br/>equations of degree three, even if the number of variables is just two.<br/>A fundamental conjecture concerning this question was formulated in the<br/>1960s by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. Although considerable progress has<br/>been made since then, the conjecture remains unresolved. Such equations<br/>define a class of curves known as ""elliptic curves."" The study of their<br/>properties has proved to be of importance in cryptography - designing codes<br/>for the secure transmission of information. Professor Greenberg intends to<br/>continue his study of ""Selmer groups"" which have been a traditional tool in<br/>understanding the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and in studying<br/>the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer.

While our knowledge of noncongruence modular forms is still in its relative infancy, the subject has already shown its rich connections with several fruitful research frontiers: classical modular forms, Galois representations, the Langlands program, and p-adic modular forms. The general aim of this proposal is to continue the development of noncongruence modular forms by the PI and her collaborators. The proposal contains 3 objectives: 1) To study when Galois representations attached to noncongruence cusp forms constructed by A. Scholl are related to classical automorphic forms via Langlands correspondence, as well as the applications of a relation. 2) To understand a fundamental conjecture which asserts that Fourier coefficients of genuine noncongruence modular forms have unbounded denominators if all coefficients are algebraic. 3) To explore p-adic properties of noncongruence modular forms and their applications to other research areas.<br/><br/>Starting from the time of the Greeks, many great problems in number theory have challenged intellectual minds, and their considerations have provided numerous useful applications in turn.

Other specific areas of the proposed research include computations of important examples of support varieties, constructions of new invariants for small quantum groups, and advances to the theory of modules of constant Jordan type.   In addition, Pevtsova proposes to make contributions to the ``triangular geometry"", a new geometric theory that encodes the structure of triangulated categories.  Bringing the projects on finite group schemes and triangular geometry to a meeting point, Pevtsova is seeking to compare derived categories associated to different algebraic objects via their geometry.<br/><br/>Representation theory studies actions of groups and other algebraic structures on vector spaces. It takes its origins in the study of symmetries and has emerged as a subject on its own about hundred years ago in the work of Frobenius and Schur. In its current stage of development, representation theory has been discovered to be intimately intertwined with numerous brunches of mathematics, such as geometry, topology and combinatorics, as well as physics. Pevtsova is particularly interested in connections with geometry. She has always been fascinated by the beautiful interplay between algebra and geometry that transcends many areas of mathematical research. In her CAREER project,  she seeks to develop a new algebra-geometric connection, building a bridge  between algebraic descriptions of representations which can be presented in terms of matrices and certain geometric invariants which can be thought of as spaces.  In that endeavor she hopes to develop techniques that will hold a potential to shed light on some longstanding problems in both representation theory and geometry.  <br/><br/>The PI also has an extensive educational program.

She also proposes to organize a summer school for young researchers in Representation Theory and related areas in the  Summer of 2012. By creating these opportunities for talented K-12 students, undergraduates and graduate students, Pevtsova intends to attract more qualified candidates to careers in Mathematical Sciences.   <br/>"

Both students and senior faculty will benefit from this meeting.<br/><br/>Commutative algebra studies the relationship between algebraic equations, such as polynomial equations, and geometry. This idea goes back to Descartes and the idea of coordinatizing the plane, and has proved to be a powerful tool. A wide range of problems can be put into the context of solving systems of equations. For example, linear algebra studies systems of linear (degree one) equations. Commutative algebra studies the solutions of polynomial or power series equations of higher order by forming an algebraic object consisting of the 'generic' solutions. The algebraic properties of these gen then give insight into the geometric and algebraic nature of the equations. Many classical problems can be phrased in these terms. Seemingly simple questions turn out to be surprisingly complicated. For example, questions such as how many polynomials vanish along a set of points in the plane are equivalent to understanding what is called the Hilbert function of the ideal of polynomials vanishing along these points. Such functions are used to count important data.<br/>One of the main themes of this conference and workshop is the study of Hilbert functions and their ramifications.

However, the dictionary as it exists seems incomplete.  For example, while there is a good positive characteristic analog of ``log terminal singularities'', there is no known analog of ``terminal singularities''.  Schwede will attempt to fill in these gaps.  Furthermore, inspired by this dictionary, Schwede will explore both the local and global geometry of varieties in positive characteristic and characteristic zero.  One problem that Schwede plans to explore is how the test ideal (a positive characteristic analog of the multiplier ideal) behaves under birational maps.  Another problem that Schwede plans to study is whether Du Bois singularities deform.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a centrally important and very active field of mathematics with strong ties to many other areas including fields as disparate as string theory and coding theory.  Explicitly, algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) made up of the solutions to polynomial equations (such as y = x^2).  At the most basic level, Schwede plans to study relations between the geometry of these algebraic varieties, with algebraic properties of the equations themselves.  In the past, this interplay has led to new insights in both the geometric and algebraic theories.  In algebraic geometry, one of the major areas of research in the last 30 years has been the classification of algebraic varieties -- the ""minimal model program"".

The project is run by five senior faculty members (William Fulton, Robert Lazarsfeld, Mircea Mustata, Yongbin Ruan and Karen Smith) in consultation with an additional 16 senior faculty at Michigan in related areas. Algebraic geometry is a central and highly active branch of mathematics today, with increasingly important connections to other branches of mathematics and science. These other areas include commutative algebra, number theory, combinatorics, representation theory, and complex analysis, as well as string theory and other aspects of theoretical physics and computer science. The explosive growth of algebraic geometry at the end of the twentieth century has made this a very exciting time to begin research, but it has also made it difficult for young researchers to get started. This project will increase the flow of broadly trained researchers in algebraic geometry and its boundary areas. Given the size and visibility of the research groups involved in this project, Michigan's Algebraic Geometry RTG program has had and will continue to have a substantial impact at the national level in building a thriving community of young researchers in and around algebraic geometry.<br/>  <br/>The project develops the research potential of its trainees, as well as their capability to nurture the next generation. Activities include a rich array of seminar and workshop activities,  including the opportunity for post-doctoral trainees to propose, design and organize workshops under the mentorship of a senior faculty member; opportunities for post-doctoral researchers to design and lead undergraduate research projects under the mentorship of a senior faculty member; numerous opportunities for advanced graduate students and post-docs to develop their technical and expository lecturing skills, and to receive   mentoring on all aspects of a research career in mathematics; funds for trainee travel to domestic and international conferences in order to establish connections, get exposure to research trends not represented at Michigan, and gain visibility as they lecture on their work."

Perhaps most famously, in the 1980s, these techniques were applied in the study of Schubert varieties, and continue to be actively used in the study of algebraic groups.  On the other hand, in the 1970s, these techniques were used to prove fundamental results about rings of invariants by reductive groups.  These methods anticipated the fundamental ideas behind the tight closure theory.  In the 1990s, it was discovered that there is a precise dictionary between some of the notions coming from the minimal model program, and invariants defined by variants of Frobenius splitting and tight closure theory (a correspondence that is still not fully understood).  Some of these methods are also related to the study of vector bundles in characteristic p, another active area of research which has had numerous applications.<br/><br/>This conference that will take place at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, May 17th--May 22nd, 2010.

The conference will focus on Frobenius splitting and related notions, methods, and applications to the following important areas of mathematics: the representation theory of algebraic groups, commutative algebra, and higher dimensional algebraic geometry. The conference will bring researchers together and stimulate communication between the various groups (communication which previously has been somewhat limited).  It is expected that this conference will impact the mathematical community in a number of ways.  Firstly, by exposing researchers to new potential applications of their own work and also to different points of view, the meeting will inspire new communication, collaboration and research.  The participants of the conference will have different backgrounds, and thus many of the talks will necessarily be focused at a non-expert audience.  Therefore, secondly, the talks given will be suitable for young mathematicians, especially graduate students and junior faculty.

The primary tool is an algorithm to compute the unitary dual of any given group, which we are implementing inside the ""atlas"" software. We plan to use this information to prove results about the unitary dual, beginning with the unitarity of Arthur's unipotent representations. The second primary goal is to make information about representation theory of real groups accessible to non-specialists, via the software, a web site, public workshops, and other means.

In the hands of Hermann Weyl, Eugene Wigner, and Andre Weil, symmetry has come to play a central role in quantum mechanics and in number theory. Lie groups, named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, are the mathematical objects underlying symmetry.  Representation theory studies all of the ways a given symmetry, or Lie group, can manifest itself. The problem of understanding all ""unitary"" representations (in which the symmetry operations preserve lengths) is one of the most important unsolved problems in the subject, and has potential applications in many areas; for example, it is an abstract version of the question, ""what quantum mechanical systems can admit a certain kind of symmetry?"""

However, the dictionary as it exists seems incomplete.  For example, while there is a good positive characteristic analog of ``log terminal singularities'', there is no known analog of ``terminal singularities''.  Schwede will attempt to fill in these gaps.  Furthermore, inspired by this dictionary, Schwede will explore both the local and global geometry of varieties in positive characteristic and characteristic zero.  One problem that Schwede plans to explore is how the test ideal (a positive characteristic analog of the multiplier ideal) behaves under birational maps.  Another problem that Schwede plans to study is whether Du Bois singularities deform.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a centrally important and very active field of mathematics with strong ties to many other areas including fields as disparate as string theory and coding theory.  Explicitly, algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) made up of the solutions to polynomial equations (such as y = x^2).  At the most basic level, Schwede plans to study relations between the geometry of these algebraic varieties, with algebraic properties of the equations themselves.  In the past, this interplay has led to new insights in both the geometric and algebraic theories.  In algebraic geometry, one of the major areas of research in the last 30 years has been the classification of algebraic varieties -- the ""minimal model program"".

Over the years these presentations proved to be of high quality, and the role of the workshop as one of the leading forums in the area was established. This year we intend to put some emphasis on recent developments in the theory of mock modular forms. This area is very actively developing during recent years, many basic papers exist currently only as preprints, basic notions are not yet described systematically. It is already clear that this theory has a considerable amount of connections with various branches of mathematics (such as combinatorics, Artin L-functions, hypergeometric functions, Lie theory, and topology), and even some areas of physics (e.g., conformal field theory).

Traditionally, this workshop has a unique feature to attract a significant number of junior mathematicians and encourage them to deliver research presentations. About half of the participants are US mathematicians at the early stages of their careers and this workshop is especially beneficial to them. This conference  provides junior mathematicians a rare opportunity to interact with a wide range of senior mathematicians whose expertise is related to their research field. Broadening their horizons and adopting different points of view boosts their preparation and allows them to gain a deeper understanding of the subject. Attracting a considerable amount of junior mathematicians, the workshop provides them an excellent opportunity to get to know each other, and to find out about young researchers in related areas. This kind of networking may enhance their careers in various ways: initiate future research collaborations, obtain career advice, set up the links which will help a lot in future exchange of ideas. The workshop will also be attended by undergraduate students from the University of Hawaii. Many of these students belong to the local population, and may never have a chance to travel to other parts of the country. This population is heavily underrepresented in science. Attending lectures of world class mathematicians and getting to know junior mathematicians may highly motivate them, influencing their choices and preferences concerning their future education and careers.<br/><br/>"

Noncommutative geometry aims to study geometric properties of a new class of ""spaces"" whose algebras of functions are no longer commutative. The central idea goes back to quantum mechanics, in which observables such as position and momentum do not commute. The subject has undergone tremendous exploration recently due to its close connection to a number of areas of mathematics and mathematical physics, including foliation theory, index theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, quantum field theory, quantization theory, and string theory. <br/><br/>The project consists in a pair of summer schools (GAP VIII and GAP XI) aimed at gathering different streams and instances of noncommutative geometry, as well as identifying new emerging directions. The main purposes of the proposed activities are to bring together leading experts and young researchers working in rapidly developing subjects, and to promote interaction between mathematicians and physicists, and groups working on different aspects of related areas so as to foster interaction, encourage cross-fertilization between different fields, and promote the dissemination of the most recent results of current research. There are many talented young people working in this area. GAP VIII and GAP XI will provide them with excellent opportunities to disseminate their ideas and to broaden their perspective. The PIs anticipate inviting a substantial number of mathematicians at the postdoctoral and graduate student level (from Europe, the United States, and developing countries), and holding poster or short-talk sessions through which young researchers will be given the chance to present their work. The schools will provide an excellent opportunity for young American scientists to exchange ideas with their European peers and initiate collaborations. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis Program, the Algebra and Number Theory Program, and the Analysis Program."

One example of a relatively new kind of application of this technique is the study of so-called ``one-dependent'' statistical processes, which may be thought of as the results of successive experiments where the result of the next experiment depends on the result of the current one, but where knowing in addition the results of the past ones does not give any further information. (Imagine repeatedly tossing a coin that has a 2/3 chance of landing ""heads"" when tossed with heads up, and a 1/2 chance of landing ""heads"" when tossed with tails up.

Further investigation in this direction, and in particular the relation of skew total positivity to the theory of total positivity developed by George Lusztig, is the subject of the first project. The second project grew out of an attempt to reinterpret the often used standard bases of the coordinate ring of Grassmanians, and to find different kinds of bases occurring naturally. The question is closely related to the question of triangulating the cone of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, which motivated David Speyer and the PI to introduce the notion of driving rules as a way to locally determine the triangulation. Properties of the simplicial complexes and the bases which arise are the subject of the investigation. The third project deals with K-homology of Grassmanian, studied so far to a smaller extend than the dual notion of K-theory. The first step in this direction was taken by Thomas Lam and the PI who introduced dual stable Grothendieck polynomials as representatives of Schubert classes in the K-homology ring. Further questions to be studied include the K-theoretic version of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence, K-homology of complete flag varieties and more.<br/><br/>The unifying theme of all three projects is the study of nice varieties, such as Grassmanians and more general flag varieties. A Grassmanian as the variety of all k-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional space. An old and yet active research area is Schubert calculus, which - very roughly - studies how subspaces of a space intersect. A simple example would be the following question: in a three-dimensional space four lines in generic position are chosen. What is the number of lines that intersect all four of them? Schubert calculus was recently enriched by the work of George Lusztig, who defined and studied a special part of flag varieties, called totally the positive part. Real numbers naturally come with a notion of positive and negative, and when we consider flag varieties over real numbers there is a way to identify a positive part in them. The study of the totally positive part has lead to a number of beautiful recent developments.<br/><br/>"

It also links and reinforces the first and second part of the proposal.<br/><br/>The relation between representation theory and physical models was very fruitful in the twentieth century  with the famous examples of representations of Lorentz and Poincare groups and special relativity, representations of the  Heisenberg group and quantum mechanics, representations of the group  SU(3)  and quark composition of elementary particles. The author actively participated in the development of a recent relation between representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and two-dimensional quantum field theory.  His present proposal outlines a new representation theoretic approach to important areas of modern theoretical physics, namely, three dimensional quantum gravity and four dimensional quantum field theory, and has a profound relation to different areas of mathematics such as Monstrous Moonshine, absolute Galois group, quaternionic analysis, theory of instantons and non-commutative geometry."

Specifically, the PI seeks to determine a more precise interplay between weak Maass forms, mock theta functions, q-hypergeometric series, and the representation theory of affine Lie superalgebras.  The origins of such problems date back to prominent mathematical figures S. Ramanujan and G. <br/>Watson (c. 1920) who defined a finite list of functions called ``mock theta functions"", went on to realize their significance, and declared their understanding and characterization as ``the final problem"".  The problem remains current now nearly 90 years later, with major strides and a more unifying theory of weak Maass forms developed only within the last 8 years (due to work of Ono, Bringmann, Zwegers, Zagier, and others). Positive results include (1) a more general understanding of the mock theta functions and their placement within a larger group-theoretical framework in which their relationship to weak Maass forms may be understood, and (2) a realization of the roles of the mock theta functions and weak Maass forms played not only in number theory, but other areas of mathematics and science.  Despite these recent developments, a complete theory of weak Maass forms is still lacking.  One problem the PI will embark upon along these lines includes furthering recent results of the PI and Bringmann-Ono, relating weak Maass forms and mock theta functions to character formulas for affine Lie superalgebras due to Kac and Wakimoto. <br/>Another goal is to establish more unifying results relating q-hypergeometric series to modular forms and Maass forms by studying variants and more general families of such series. Currently, largely piecemeal results exist regarding the roles played by q-hypergeometric series, for example, and only very recently have we begun to understand more precisely the theory of weak Maass forms as related to the representation theory of affine Lie superalgebras.<br/><br/>The proposed area of research, number theory, is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, and continues to be a field of extensive and active research in the present day.  Classically, modular forms have played many fundamental roles;  they are central to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, the Langlands program, the Riemann hypothesis, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, for example, and yield applications in string theory, combinatorics, cryptography, mathematical physics, as well as many other areas. The central objects of study of the PI, mock theta functions and Maass forms, are natural relatives of classical modular forms, and the proposed research seeks to contribute to the understanding of their roles not only within number theory and modular forms, but also combinatorics and Lie theory.  The prominence of the mock theta functions is less bound to the original contexts of Ramanujan and Watson as described above, as evidenced by the striking number of disciplines in which they are now known to play significant roles.  Moreover, a comprehensive theory is lacking, both motivating further research."

The investigator will also study the effective cones of the moduli space of curves and stable maps. The moduli spaces of curves are among the most studied objects in mathematics. Their cones of effective divisors are important invariants, intimately tied to problems such as the Schottky problem, the Kodaira dimension of the moduli space of curves, and the existence of modular forms. Recently,  understanding the effective cone of moduli spaces has received new impetus following the seminal work of Hacon, McKernan, and their collaborators on the Minimal Model Program (MMP). The investigator proposes to run MMP on moduli spaces such as the Kontsevich moduli spaces of genus zero stable maps or Hilbert scheme of points on the projective plane. <br/><br/>Systems of polynomial equations occur in many facets of life ranging from evolutionary biology to physics and from cryptography to computer science. Algebraic geometry studies geometric properties of solutions of polynomial systems.  The solutions that have many symmetries are especially interesting and important. For example, a sphere is a perfectly symmetric space in the sense that any point can be rotated to any other point. The investigator studies the number of solutions to polynomial systems involving such perfectly symmetric spaces called homogeneous varieties. The investigator also calculates more subtle geometric invariants of systems of polynomial equations such as how the behavior of the space of solutions changes under perturbations of the system."

In the 1980's Cannon, Gromov, Thurston and others produced an infusion of geometric ideas which shed a great deal of light on earlier results and led to new research methods known collectively as geometric group theory. The main themes of geometric group theory involve the large scale geometry of cell complexes, asymptotic properties of groups, and connections with theoretical computer science.

Our major goal is to strengthen the connections group theory has with other branches of mathematics and to highlight new promising perspectives.

This proposal focusses on understanding the Dirichlet series that arise when the automorphic representation is one on a metaplectic cover of the adelic points of a reductive group.    The recent prior work of the principal investigator and his collaborators has shown that even in the simplest case -- Eisenstein series induced from the Borel -- the Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series have a remarkably rich structure, and are related to the theory of crystal graphs, which also arise in the study of quantum groups.

The second project, joint with K. Paranjape, will aim to associate Calabi-Yau varieties with involution over the rationals of dimension m to certain basic holomorphic cusp forms of weight m+1 and rational coefficients. The emphasis here will be on the 3-dimensional case, with a view to understanding quadratic twists and functorial products. The PI will also continue his investigation into certain other topics, including the works with N. Dunfield on the circle fibrations of hyperbolic 3-manifolds of arithmetic type, and with P. Michel concerning the exact averages of L-values.<br/><br/>Many problems one encounters become amenable to elucidation by the mathematical method when they exhibit some symmetry such as periodicity or invariance under mirror reflection. This is important in the cracking of codes and in the study of crystals and precious stones, for example. The main thrust of this project is to comprehend some of the manifestations of symmetry, especially when their presence is not evident. Mathematicians, Physicists, and others often start with discrete collections of numbers, possibly from experimentation, then form their generating functions, and ask if they encode hidden symmetries. When such harmonious arrangements arise in nature, they frequently describe the tones of automorphic functions, which are continuous entities like the waveforms on a disk. Their discrete frequencies are linked to exciting constructs like lengths of curves, prime numbers, and congruence solutions of polynomial equations. A particular focus of the project is to determine when the presence of Galois symmetries implies the existence of special curved subspaces of the ambient space, relating in turn to the poles of certain zeta functions.  The ultimate aim is to understand the ubiquity and power of number formations better through geometry and analysis."

For example, the existence of nonlinear minimal syzygies is related to the existence of secant planes. An embedding of a toric variety into projective space corresponds to a lattice polytope, and the goal of this project is to further the understanding of the interplay  between the defining equations and syzygies of the embedding and the combinatorial properties of the polytope.

Two central topics of research in these fields are multiplicities and the homological behavior of modules. This proposal concerns questions related to these topics and especially their interplay. The first project involves studying whether Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, an intriguing and not well-understood measure of the complexity of a singularity in positive characteristic, has an interpretation in characteristic zero where it could be simpler or clearer to interpret geometrically (some known examples show that a limit as the characteristic goes to infinity might exist and seems to be a simpler number). The second concerns the homology of Koszul complexes, and although in this case the approaches are not exclusively from the realm of complete intersection rings, many of the same ideas arise since the Koszul complex is the first step in constructing a Tate resolution. Many directions are being examined, with several new approaches to old problems studied by Huneke, Simis, Vasconcelos and many others. The third concerns an older conjecture in rational homotopy theory, a field with which the ideas from resolutions of complete intersections and from differential graded resolutions have a long history of interaction, but have not yet been used for this particular problem; preliminary results of this approach look encouraging. The fourth concerns Serre's intersection multiplicity over non-regular rings. <br/><br/>These projects are at the center of some of the main directions in commutative algebra, but with a view towards neighboring fields of mathematics or subfields of algebra. For example, the first and main project concerns multiplicities, which are numerical measures of the complexity of a non-smooth (that is, sharp) point on a curve, surface, or higher dimensional object. The investigator is especially interested in these in an algebraic or number theoretic setting that is not directly related to the physical geometry of an object. Known results show quite mysterious behavior of these numbers and the investigator hopes to shed some light on the situation by relating the setting to a more geometric one where classical geometric techniques might be applied. This is a delicate procedure and work in progress. Likewise, the third project involves a problem that would apply ideas from her abstract field of algebra to a part of topology, a field which deals with physical spaces. In summary, although the subjects of the projects are quite varied, they hold a common theme that may not be immediately evident: Namely, the investigator proposes to apply her experience in her own area to various problems further removed from this area and not traditionally studied in this way."

The full list of organizers and speakers is available on the conference website at <http://math.stanford.edu/PRCMindex.html>.<br/><br/>The PRCM was conceived in the middle 1990s by a group of mathematicians from over 10 major universities on the west coast of the United States, in Canada, China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Korea, and Australia. It has been held every three years since 1998 in various locations on the Pacific Rim. This summer's PRCM will be the first to be held in North America. <br/>One of the main reasons for initiating this meeting was the recognition that the Pacific Rim region is not only economically vibrant, but also becoming increasingly important in scientific research. The objectives are to present the latest trends in mathematical research to a wide audience and to develop stronger ties between mathematicians in the Pacific Rim region. We expect the PRCM to be attended by approximately 200 mathematicians from Pacific Rim universities."

The PI will study the intersection homology of the moduli spaces of abelian varieties, investigate the failure of injectivity of the Torelli map for Prym varieties, and endeavor to prove by degeneration that the Schottky-Jung identities characterize Jacobians of curves among all abelian varieties. The PI will attempt to use the geometric properties of Jacobians to approach Coleman's conjecture on the finiteness of the number of Jacobians of a fixed large genus with complex multiplication. By using real-normalized meromorphic differentials, the PI will work on constructing complete subvarieties of the moduli space of curves. The PI will also investigate further mathematical and physical properties of superstring scattering amplitudes an ansatz for which he proposed.<br/><br/>Algebraic curves (aka Riemann surfaces) are real two-dimensional surfaces with a metric on them. They arise in many areas of mathematics, and are also fundamental to string theory as worldsheets (trajectories) of strings propagating in space. One can associate to any algebraic curve its Jacobian - it is an algebraic variety (a geometric set of points, such that there is an operation of ""adding"" two points together), and knowing the Jacobian one can recover the curve uniquely. This project aims to utilize and further study the intricate interplay between the geometry of the curve and of its Jacobian in order to further our understanding of curves and abelian varieties. Progress made on the questions addressed by this project would have implications in mathematics and physics going beyond algebraic and complex geometry, particularly in number theory, integrable systems, partial differential equations, and perturbative string theory.<br/>"

Elliptic motives are helping to explain, for example, why classical modular forms impose relations on special values of multiple zeta functions. They are also helping the PI to understand relations between extensions of Galois representations associated with elliptic curves and modular forms.<br/>(2) understand rational points of smooth projective curves over finitely generated infinite fields. This builds on earlier work of the principal investigator. He and his collaborators are extending it to fields of positive characteristic.<br/>(3) use knowledge of fundamental groups of certain moduli spaces (such as mapping class groups) to investigate fundamental questions in algebraic geometry. One such question being studied by the PI is whether every smooth projective curve is dominated by a smooth plane curve.<br/><br/><br/>Topology is the study of the shape of ""topological spaces"". The set of solutions of a set of algebraic equations forms a topological space.<br/>Its shape often exerts a lot of control over the set of solutions of the equations, especially when the solutions are required to be whole numbers, or ratios of whole numbers (known as ""rational numbers""). The PI, with his collaborators and students, is using his knowledge of the shapes of some very special (and complicated) spaces, called moduli spaces, to help understand rational and integer solutions to some very general systems of algebraic equations. Algebraic curves and their rational points have long been studied by mathematicians. Their study, although esoteric, now plays an important role in modern cryptography.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Algebra and Number Theory Program."

These problems have been the interplay of several kinds of mathematics. They are, on one hand, related to counting curves over a finite field and, on the other, to the asymptotic behavior of the subgroup growth of lattices. The PI has already solved several problems in this area and would like to give a better picture. The second purpose of this proposal is to describe the ""smallest"" locally symmetric orbifolds with a given covering space, or its equivalent object in the non-Archimedean setting. This natural question had been considered by many mathematicians such as Siegel, Chinburg, Friedman, Meyerhoff, Gehring, Martin, and Lubotzky, and it is solved for lattices in SL(2) over different local fields. The PI solved this problem for most of Chevalley groups over a positive characteristic local field. The PI would like to understand structure of such orbifolds. For instance, he plans to answer  Lubotzky?s question on whether the smallest orbifold is compact. The next problem is the classification of discrete vertex transitive actions on Bruhat-Tits buildings. These actions have been of interest since the 80?s. Several mathematicians have tried to construct such actions and, so far, for large dimensions, only one family of such actions have been constructed. They have been also used to construct explicit Ramanujan complexes. These combinatorial objects are generalization of Ramanujan graphs, which are highly useful in computer science, and expected to have broad applications. The PI plans to classify such actions. The PI and Mohammadi have constructed new families of simply-transitive actions on the vertex set of the Bruhat-Tits building and gave a very strong classification theorem, and it might be possible to get new examples in positive characteristic which in turn would give us new Ramanujan complexes. The PI proposes a step toward a recent conjecture by Sarnak on equi-distribution of orbits of prime powers of a unipotent element in a finite volume homogeneous space.<br/><br/>Discrete subgroups of semi-simple groups can be considered as the connecting point of several parts of mathematics. On one hand, they are related to geometry and geometric group theory, and on the other to dynamical systems and number theory. The PI proposes several related problems on this subject. In these projects, PI would like to either count number of certain combinatorial objects with rich algebraic structure, or describe ""smallest"" models with certain descriptions, which usually have more symmetries and might be useful in computer science, or seek for other evidences of the randomness of the Möbius function. These projects consist of different parts and of various mathematical nature, e.g. Bruhat-Tits theory, mass formula, subgroup growth and sieve theory. Because of its relations with a wide range of mathematics, students at both graduate and under-graduate level can be exposed to and learn different topics. Moreover, some parts are of combinatorial or computational nature which makes them more accessible to under-graduates."

Applying refined counting methods to these parametrizations has led, for example, to a proof of the first known case of the Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet class number heuristics for higher degree number fields, and other theorems of this nature are forthcoming. We expect similar theorems for ranks of elliptic curves, and other data of this kind for algebraic curves and surfaces, in the near future."

The morning sessions of the workshop consist of two courses, which are more advanced and of a different nature than typical high school courses. In the afternoon, groups of two to three participants work together on small research projects based on the material of the courses. At the end of each afternoon all the participants meet for a ""Women in Mathematics"" seminar, introducing the participants to a variety of women who chose to pursue a career in mathematics, and discussing a wide range of issues with them. Throughout the workshop the participants interact with undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty of the Mathematics Department; they are housed in one of the colleges on campus and thus get a glimpse of life as an undergraduate student."

The building and computation of these invariants requires the development of new foundational formalism of Deligne cohomology, Griffiths groups, and normal functions in non-commutative geometry. The second problem seeks a new method for analysing the fine geometric structure of the moduli of objects in differential graded categories of Clalabi-Yau type. The third problem applies the method to a problem in symplectic topology and introduces a new concrete geometric description of the Fukaya category. The fourth problem addresses the construction of the mirror map for del Pezzo surfaces, and describes a strategy for proving the homological mirror symmetry conjecture in this context. The understanding of these questions is essential for unifying various linearization procedures in algebraic geometry, symplectic topology, theoretical and mathematical physics. The project sets the stage for understanding the basic structure of algebraic varieties in a way suitable for pragmatic use in a broad spectrum of applications. Aside from the natural applications to algebraic geometry and topology, the work proposed will be immediately relevant to deep questions in quantum gravity and cosmology. The project outlines concrete interdisciplinary applications to string dualities and the quantization of three dimensional field theories.<br/><br/>The project also aims to organize a concentrated effort on enhancing and building a new geometric arsenal of techniques applicable to the theory of algebraic cycles, symplectic topology, and high energy physics.

Continuing previous research, the PI and his students plan on extending these models to numerous other families of L-functions, ranging from number field cases to elliptic curves. The latter is especially appealing, as it is the only known example with zeros with multiplicities (by the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, the multiplicity of the zero at the central point equals the geometric rank of the group of rational solutions). The main project involves modeling these zeros with a new random matrix model (a modified Jacobi ensemble) combining the arithmetic of the lower order terms and the discretization of the values of the L-functions at the central point. The numerical calculations require programs for solving non-linear Painleve VI differential equations, which will be written and made available in Matlab and Sage. In related work, the PI plans to explore classical random matrix ensembles, as these systems frequently provide powerful intuition in understanding the behavior of sub-families. <br/>Much of the analysis of the behavior of zeros near the central point of L-functions can be recast as questions about equidistribution and convergence of measures. In addition to the above number theoretic systems, these methods can also be applied to other problems, such as Benford's law of digit bias. Numerous data sets exhibit a powerful and universal bias, with the probability of the first digit being a 1 is 30%, dropping monotonically to a 5% chance of the first digit being a 9. <br/>Benford's law is frequently used to test for data integrity (the IRS uses it to flag corporate tax returns that are likely fraudulent). The PI will use the above techniques to determine which systems should exhibit such behavior, understand the rate of convergence (which is essential in proving fraud), and derive new tests for data integrity.<br/><br/>One of the central questions across disciplines is how events are distributed, be it energy levels of heavy nuclei, spacings between prime numbers or waiting times at a bank. Similar to the Central Limit Theorem, there seem to be a few universal spacing laws that govern these and other phenomena; thus studies in one of these topics can frequently provide useful insights in the others. Much of the proposed work seeks to understand the spacings between zeros of the Riemann zeta function and its generalizations, L-functions; it has long been known that many important problems in number theory (ranging from counting the number of primes to efficient primality tests) are equivalent to properties of these zeros. <br/>The most important family to be studied are the zeros of elliptic curve L-functions. This is the only known number theory family with zeros with multiplicity, and thus understanding its behavior should be useful to model other physical systems. The system, like many others, is described by a non-linear Painleve VI differential equation; in addition to constructing a model the PI and his colleagues will generate and distribute Matlab and Sage code to solve these equations. Solving these problems requires the development of tools and techniques in complex analysis, Fourier analysis, number theory and probability. These results are applicable to other fields, in particular Benford's law of digit bias (for many natural sets of data, the first digit is 1 about 30% of the time, with the probability decreasing to a first digit of 9 about 5% of the time). The PI will also work on several problems involving the distribution of leading digits of data sets, especially on the rate of convergence to Benford behavior and determining which systems should satisfy this law. Deriving techniques to detect and understand digit bias have enormous applications; for example, the IRS uses Benford's law to locate corporate tax fraud. Many of these projects have components that are amenable to numerical experimentation; these and tractable special cases will be investigated in conjunction with undergraduate research assistants."

Representation theory studies all of the ways a given symmetry, or Lie group, can manifest itself. The problem of understanding all ""unitary"" representations (in which the symmetry operations preserve lengths) is one of the most important unsolved problems in the subject, and has potential applications in many areas; for example, it is an abstract version of the question, ""what quantum mechanical systems can admit a certain kind of symmetry?"""

Perhaps the best-known such result is the ""geometric Satake equivalence,"" due to Lusztig, Ginzburg, and Mirkovic-Vilonen.  It relates representations of a group G (equivalently: coherent sheaves on a point) to spherical perverse sheaves on the affine Grassmannian for the dual group.  Another major result is the Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov-Ginzburg (ABG) equivalence, which states that there is a derived equivalence between perverse sheaves on the affine Grassmannian and coherent sheaves on the cotangent bundle of the flag variety of G.  Both these results may be regarded as part of the geometric Langlands program.  The P.I. hopes to contribute to this picture with the following two projects: (I) In collaboration with S. Riche, the P.I. hopes to prove parabolic versions of several known coherent-constructible equivalences; these results would encompass the ABG and geometric Satake equivalences as special cases. (II) The P.I. hopes to develop a new axiomatic framework which is expected to lead to theorems on derived equivalences and higher Ext-vanishing in a very general setting, with a view to applications to coherent sheaves on the nilpotent cone and on the cotangent bundle of the flag variety.<br/><br/>A ""matrix group"" is a set of invertible square matrices that contains all products and inverses of its members.  A typical example is SU(2), the group of 2x2 unitary complex matrices.  A ""representation"" of such a group is a rule that assigns to each member of the group a linear transformation of some vector space, in such a way that it transforms matrix multiplication into composition of linear transformations.  SU(2) has a natural 2-dimensional representation--the rule assigning to each element of SU(2) itself--but there are many others as well: for instance, SU(2) has a representation on the space of polynomials in two variables, given by linear substitutions in the variables.  SU(2) is also a topological space: in fact, it is topologically equivalent to a 3-sphere.  A number of modern results in representation theory involve the geometry of matrix groups and related spaces.  Two celebrated results are the geometric Satake equivalence and the Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov-Ginzburg (ABG) equivalence, both of which relate representations of a matrix group to ""D-modules"" (a sophisticated way of working with spaces of local solutions of differential equations) on a certain infinite-dimensional space called the ""affine Grassmannian.""  The proposed research includes two projects: (I) the P.I., in collaboration with S. Riche, hopes to prove a general ""parabolic-parahoric equivalence theorem"" that would include the geometric Satake and ABG equivalences as special cases; and (II) the P.I. hopes to study in an axiomatic way certain ""positivity phenomena"" that occur in the known equivalence theorems, with a view to generalizing those theorems to other settings."

Specifically, the P.I. outlines questions regarding the distribution of closed geodesics, the question of arithmetic quantum unique ergodicity, and the the strong spectral gap property on locally symmetric spaces.  The question of quantum unique ergodicity originates in the theory of quantum chaos, which studies the behavior of high energy states of quantum systems with underlying chaotic dynamics. Arithmetic surfaces, along with other arithmetic models, have proven a very fertile ground for testing predictions made in this theory. Recently there has been a great advancement in this field; application of new techniques from ergodic and analytic number theory resolved the (arithmetic) quantum unique ergodicity conjecture for arithmetic surfaces. However, for higher dimensional systems our knowledge is still very limited; for example, it is not even clear what the correct conjecture should be in this setting.<br/>The P.I. proposes to address this problem for certain higher dimensional symmetric spaces. On the other side of the spectrum, the notion of a strong spectral gap is related to the lowest energy state. This notion is crucial in many applications and in particular to the distribution of closed geodesics on these spaces. Following advancements in various mathematical disciplines, the existence and magnitude of the strong spectral gap is well understood in almost all cases. However, there are still a few cases missing in order to fully complete the picture, and it is the P.I.'s intention to work on closing this gap.<br/><br/>The problems the P.I. proposes to investigate have a long history and are still matters of active research. Although the models considered in this program are very specific and arithmetic in nature, the P.I. believes that the study of these models will lead to a better understanding of related phenomena in more general settings. In particular, results on the question of quantum unique ergodicity for arithmetic models will provide valuable insights into the behavior of other physical systems. Also, progress on the spectral gap question may lead to construction of new expanders which have uses in cryptography. Moreover, the attempts to answer these questions could lead to the development of new tools that will facilitate studying fundamental questions in number theory."

Other applications include explicit constructions of deformation quantizations of an important class of 2-dimentional algebraic surfaces known as del Pezzo sufaces.<br/><br/>The subject of quantization has a long history and takes its origins in classic works on quantum mechanics by Dirac, Heisenberg, Pauli, and others. In mathematics, the idea of quantization involves replacing familiar geometric objects by appropriate noncommutative analogues thought of as some deformations of the corresponding geometric objects. The resulting theory is often referred to as noncommutative geometry. The present Project is concerned with a more specific direction known as noncommutative algebraic geometry. This is a relatively recent area, 10-15 years old, at the crossroads between algebra, geometry and theoretical physics.

Period integrals and regulators are related to values of zeta functions. The PI's intend to study related problems concerning arithmetic properties of zeta values.  It is expected that the study of this proposal on degenerations of Hodge structures have various applications. For example, Hodge conjecture is related to degeneration of intermediate Jacobian which is understood as a class group of degenerating Hodge structures, and so, it is expected that the study of this proposal can contribute to the solution of Hodge conjecture. S. Bloch studied the relation of the theory of motives and the period integrals which appear in physics. The divergence of such period integral is an important subject in physics, and it is expected that the divergence is well understood by the degeneration of motives and degeneration of associated Hodge structures. The study of this proposal is expected to have applications to physics.<br/><br/>Understanding of degeneration for geometric objects (spaces or mathematical structures) is an important but difficult problem. By constructing enlarged classifying spaces of mathematical structures in which points on the boundary correspond to degenerations, the PI's can better understand degeneration. For example, in physics it is important to understand various infinite limits. In this program,  the divergences in physics are understood as arising from degeneration of mathematical structures, and it is expected that this study will clarify such asymptotic behavior. Values of zeta functions often appear in physics, and K. Kato, S. Bloch and T. Fukaya have studied arithmetic properties of zeta values. They intend to study the relations between degenerations and zeta values. One may hope that in this way the deep relation between nature and arithmetic can be better understood. More generally, many unsolved problems in mathematics are related to degeneration, and it is expected that the study of this proposal will contribute to the solution of them."

A first part of the project is to build the theory of algebraic stacks from scratch, with the goal of writing foundations for algebraic stacks with a minimal amount of assumptions on the base scheme, no separation axioms for algebraic spaces, and no separation axioms for algebraic stacks. This will be continually documented online in the stacks project, see http://math.columbia.edu/algebraic_geometry/stacks-git. Many algebraic stacks are quotient stacks, but this is not always the case. A second component of the project involves the question of whether every algebraic stack is always etale locally a quotient stack. This is related to the question of whether the cohomological Brauer group and the classical Brauer group coincide for separated smooth algebraic spaces over a field. This leads into other questions, especially the relation between period and index for Brauer classes. A third part of the project is to see whether there exists a natural degree map on the group of zero cycles on a GIT-stack. And finally, the project includes a fourth part aimed at studying moduli of stacky curves, which is a natural explicit example of a higher algebraic stack. Throughout the PI will moderate the stacks project mentioned above.<br/><br/>A question that has long fascinated physicists and philosophers is:<br/>What is space? For a mathematician a 3-dimensional manifold seems a good first approximation to space. After learning about special relativity a four dimensional space with a Lorentz metric seems closer. After learning about the standard model it seems that space comes endowed with certain vector bundles. And so on. In algebraic geometry students are taught early on that there are many different spaces, and that in fact the collection of all spaces forms itself some kind of space. A famous example is the moduli space of curves of genus g (Riemann surfaces) which is used by physicists in string theory. In a fundamental paper on moduli of curves in algebraic geometry, Deligne and Mumford pointed out that the space of curves has additional structure in that its points come endowed with certain finite groups (namely the automorphism groups of the corresponding curves). They coined the phrase ""algebraic stack"" to denote this type of space. It turns out that the language of algebraic stacks is an extremely useful tool in studying very classical objects such as vector bundles on curves and surfaces, moduli of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, etc, etc. The project will partly develop the foundations of algebraic stacks in a very general setting, and partly find new properties of these spaces, such as whether the finite groups attached to the points of an algebraic stack all in some natural way are contained in a single bigger group."

Furthermore, this project proposes to develop a unified theory of locally constructed ""Darmon style"" cohomology classes by linking Darmon's integration theory with the p-adic Langlands program.  Connections to other outstanding conjectures concerning trivial zeroes of p-adic L-functions will be studied.<br/><br/>This project aims to help foster an increased community of interaction and collaboration between the University of California, Santa Cruz, Stanford University, and the American Institute of Mathematics.  This increased interaction will be highlighted by regularly held mini-conferences on the topics of Number Theory and Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry.  Furthermore, a postdoc will be hired at UCSC to help foster the research environment, and in particular to interact with students on research topics.  As part of this proposal, the PI plans to continue expository writing aimed at communicating high level mathematics to a student audience. Kronecker's ""dream of youth"" was to explicitly construct all the abelian extensions of quadratic imaginary fields. Hilbert presented the problem for general number fields as the 12th problem in his famous list. The search for an explicit class field theory has motivated many great advances in number theory. Its prime successes include the Kronecker-Weber theorem and the theory of complex multiplication. This project hopes to extend the understanding of explicit class field theory beyond the setting of complex multiplication. The main technique is to study the connection between units in number fields and special values of zeta-functions. This connection is a central motivating theme in number theory.<br/>"

The LMMP gives a uniform structure of many moduli spaces of polarized algebraic varieties and of their natural compactifications. The PI intends to develop further such general relations and to apply this to 3-dimensional birational geometry. In addition, for 3-folds, he proposes a search for new birational invariants with good deformation properties of smooth families.It is expected that the dimension 3 is maximal for which the nonrationality is a smooth deformation invariant. However, one of the main conjectures in the project is about boundedness of exceptional log pairs and varieties for higher dimensions, that is, for any fixed dimension they form a coarse moduli of finite type. The problem is one of the main obstacles in the dimensional induction for the LMMP and in some closely related problems such as termination of flips, the ascending chain condition for minimal discrepancies and thresholds, boundedness of complements and in Alexeev's and Borisovs' conjecture.<br/><br/>This is a research in the field of algebra and geometry with methods and applications in birational geometry, an old and tradirional area of mathematics.

Moduli or families of such pairs are interwoven into modern geometry. The most fundamental questions about moduli are related to their boundedness, that is, to a presentation of certain moduli spaces in terms of finitely many parameters. Moduli theory interacts with most of branches of mathematics, e.g., differential geometry, topology, algebra and number theory, with applications in these fields as well as in mathematical physics, cosmology and robotics."

However, in weights greater than 2, little is known in the non-ordinary case about even the most fundamental questions on Selmer groups and L-values.<br/>The most serious obstacles to progress along these lines are (1) the wild behavior of non-ordinary p-adic L-functions, and (2) the complicated nature of the local conditions at p which arise.  To circumvent the first of these obstacles, Pollack seeks to make a systematic study of the Iwasawa theory of non-ordinary modular forms at each finite level of the cyclotomic Zp-extension.  To deal with the local obstacle, he aims to use the p-adic local Langlands correspondence to control the local structures which arise, and to then formulate an algebraic theory of theta-elements which is the analogue of the analytically defined Mazur-Tate elements.  Pollack aims to prove a series of theorems which show that these algebraically defined elements control the size and structure of Selmer groups, and to show that the main conjecture is equivalent to the equality of these elements with Mazur-Tate elements.  One particular goal of this program is to combine results of Kato and the theory of algebraic theta-elements to prove a conjecture of Mazur and Tate which asserts that their analytic theta-element lies in the Fitting ideal of a certain dual Selmer group.<br/><br/>The motivation for the study of this project comes from the theory of elliptic curves which are certain mathematical objects whose points have the shape of a doughnut.  Elliptic curves, once the focus of study of only pure mathematicians, have now become ubiquitous in both the theory and practice of cryptography.  Further, as a result of the breakthrough proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in the mid 90s, we now know that elliptic curves are intimately connected to modular forms which are functions of a complex variable with many many symmetries.  Wiles' theorem essentially states that one can make a precise dictionary between elliptic curves over the rational numbers (which are geometric objects) and certain modular forms of weight 2 (which are calculus-type objects).  This project pushes out beyond the case of weight 2 modular forms, and seeks to make a systematic study of certain properties of arbitrary weight modular forms.  It remains to be seen if these higher weight modular forms (which can be thought of as generalized elliptic curves) are also highly important from a cryptographic viewpoint."

In this theory, symmetries are represented by linear transformations of this space (by matrices). Thus, a representation of a given symmetry structure is basically a collection of matrices which satisfy a certain natural system of nonlinear relations. The relations are determined by the exact type of structure to be represented such as a group, a Lie algebra, or an associative algebra.  A higher-level structure is called the category of representations. For some type of structures (e.g. for groups, Lie algebras, quantum groups), representations can be multiplied to form tensor categories.  The present project proposes to study many ordinary and tensor categories, some of which arise as representation categories and some of which don't, and to study connections between them. The PI proposes to study complex rank generalizations of representation categories proposed by Deligne. Roughly speaking, this is a generalization in which the number of rows of a matrix is allowed to be non-integer.

Algebraic varieties have discrete characteristics that allow to classify their species: rational curves, Del Pezzo surfaces, Abelian varieties, Calabi-Yau varieties, varieties of general type, etc. Varieties of each type depend on certain continuous parameters (called moduli) and the set of all parameters has a rich structure of the so-called moduli space. One is particularly interested in compact moduli spaces that parametrize varieties with allowed mild degenerations. For example, a hyperbola xy=C on the plane can degenerate to the union of two lines xy=0 when C goes to 0. The principal investigator will study these compact moduli spaces and related problems in algebraic geometry. This centuries-old concept of pure mathematics has rich relationship with physics, and applications to computational algebraic geometry will lead to new algorithms useful in algebraic statistics and mathematical biology."

Using the work of Tiep and the PI, small representations of simple groups will be studied.  This work has already had applications to various questions of Katz, Kollar, and Larsen in algebraic geometry.  The most critical open case is to classify all closed subgroups which are irreducible on exterior powers of a module.  This is also closely related to questions about the classification of maximal subgroups of the finite simple groups. This latter questions leads to many basic problems. In particular the PI will look at problems about bounding the number of irreducible representations of bounded dimension for various families of simple groups.<br/><br/>The PI and his collaborators have shown recently that with the possible exception of one family, every finite simple group has a presentation with at most fifty relations. In many cases, one can do much better (for example, an infinite number of alternating groups can be presented with two generators and four relations).  Allowing the number of relations to increase a bit, one can even produce short presentations (essentially best possible). The most  fundamental problem is the relationship between discrete presentations and profinite presentations and cohomology (one way to think of a profinite presentation is that if one is given by generators and relations and one already knows the group is finite, then one can identify the group). This leads one to try to produce very good bounds on the size of the first and second cohomology groups of finite and algebraic groups with coefficients in a simple module.  One goal is to prove that every finite simple group has a profinite presentation with two generators and at most four relations (one cannot do better). This may be even be true without the profiniteness condition but no one has any idea of how to approach this in general.  Another major problem is to complete the classification of exceptional polynomials over finite  fields. Exceptional polynomials are precisely the bijective polynomials assuming the field size is sufficiently large compared to the degree and have been studied seriously since the thesis of Dickson in the 1890's, as well as by Schur, Fried and others. The classification of indecomposable exceptional polynomials whose degree is not a power of the characteristic used a combination of deep group theory together with methods arithmetic algebraic geometry. The PI intends to use these methods and use new results to study these problems.  This should have applications to cryptography."

A first application is to obtain the symmetry types of certain thin families of L-functions in various higher rank situations. A broad range of further applications are expected.  Additionally, the following research problems will be investigated: a search for a new class of Multiple Dirichlet Series will be executed; supercuspidal representations in higher rank will be studied; the Affine Linear Sieve will be combined with bilinear forms methods to exhibit thin orbits containing an infinitude of primes; and finally, effective infinite-volume counting problems will be attacked.<br/><br/>The theory of automorphic forms, representations, and L-functions is a central theme in modern number theory, and has provided links between such diverse areas of mathematics as algebraic geometry, representation theory, probability, combinatorics, and mathematical physics.

Besides giving exposure to the research of advanced graduate students, the conference is an invaluable opportunity for students who have not chosen a research area yet to explore what topics are currently being fruitfully studied. The faculty members who attend serve an essential role in both providing new ideas as well as probing the ideas of graduate students, suggesting ideas for future study, and encouraging students to meet and work with people interested in their areas of research. Graduate students who attend the BUGCAT are better equipped to find academic positions and continue research and collaboration. The conference also promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences, both by encouraging women and minorities to attend and by encouraging participation from a broad range of graduate programs.

Specifically, the PI seeks to determine a more precise interplay between weak Maass forms, mock theta functions, q-hypergeometric series, and the representation theory of affine Lie superalgebras.  The origins of such problems date back to prominent mathematical figures S. Ramanujan and G. <br/>Watson (c. 1920) who defined a finite list of functions called ``mock theta functions"", went on to realize their significance, and declared their understanding and characterization as ``the final problem"".  The problem remains current now nearly 90 years later, with major strides and a more unifying theory of weak Maass forms developed only within the last 8 years (due to work of Ono, Bringmann, Zwegers, Zagier, and others). Positive results include (1) a more general understanding of the mock theta functions and their placement within a larger group-theoretical framework in which their relationship to weak Maass forms may be understood, and (2) a realization of the roles of the mock theta functions and weak Maass forms played not only in number theory, but other areas of mathematics and science.  Despite these recent developments, a complete theory of weak Maass forms is still lacking.  One problem the PI will embark upon along these lines includes furthering recent results of the PI and Bringmann-Ono, relating weak Maass forms and mock theta functions to character formulas for affine Lie superalgebras due to Kac and Wakimoto. <br/>Another goal is to establish more unifying results relating q-hypergeometric series to modular forms and Maass forms by studying variants and more general families of such series. Currently, largely piecemeal results exist regarding the roles played by q-hypergeometric series, for example, and only very recently have we begun to understand more precisely the theory of weak Maass forms as related to the representation theory of affine Lie superalgebras.<br/><br/>The proposed area of research, number theory, is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, and continues to be a field of extensive and active research in the present day.  Classically, modular forms have played many fundamental roles;  they are central to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, the Langlands program, the Riemann hypothesis, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, for example, and yield applications in string theory, combinatorics, cryptography, mathematical physics, as well as many other areas. The central objects of study of the PI, mock theta functions and Maass forms, are natural relatives of classical modular forms, and the proposed research seeks to contribute to the understanding of their roles not only within number theory and modular forms, but also combinatorics and Lie theory.

It is a ramification of Langlands' formulation of non-abelian class field theory, probably the most important  problem in modern number theory, which can be tested in a self-contained manner within the context of the theory of automorphic representations. The successful approach to this problem taken by the proposer and his coworkers is  via thetheory of L-functions of automorphic representations  and the development of a  Converse Theorem for these L-functions for the general linear group. <br/>These L-functions are analytic invariants that can be attached both arithmetic objects and analytic objects and are used to mediate between them; Langlands non-abelian class field theory is one such connection. Converse Theorems allow one to characterize the analytic side of this equation via the properties of these invariants. The problem of Functoriality comes from interpreting arithmetic phenomena on the analytic side in term of these L-function invariants.  The main thrust of this proposal is to develop techniques that will allow for the extension of these efforts. The local projects are to extend the proposers previous work on Bessel functions and stability of local L-functions and related invariants and to develop techniques for computing local L-functions at ramified and infinite places. <br/>The global aspects  of the project are to improve the Converse Theorem, which is the engine that drives the results on Functoriality.<br/>Besides applications to extending the proposers results on Functoriality, which is the main motivation, these results, local and global, should have applications to unveiling the  arithmetic hidden in special values of L-functions.<br/><br/>The projects in this proposal all fall under the broad rubric of analytic number theory. At its most basic level, number theory is interested in understanding the integers. Additively, the integers are quite simple, generated by 1, but from the point of view of multiplication and factoring they are quite complicated and mysterious. The multiplicative structure is generated by the prime numbers and a large swath of number theory  is devoted to the study of prime numbers. This study is full of problems that are simple to state but with no apparent machinery  with which to attack them. Over the ages a vast and subtle algebraic structure has been built around these problems -- this is algebraic number theory.  But as with many problems,  to bring in seemingly incongruous techniques from other areas can lead to new insights. One such ``incongruous'' area is analysis and the theory of group representations; this leads to the theory  of automorphic forms, a type of analytic number theory. The connection between the two in its most basic guise is  ``class field theory'' and is mediated by certain analytic invariants, called L-functions. Class field theory  is a deep and hard problem and any light we can shed on this connection lets us bring the tools of analysis to bear on basic arithmetic problems. This proposal continues our investigations of these invariants, the L-functions, from both the algebraic and analytic points of view, in hopes of narrowing the gap between these two areas in the short term and impacting our understanding of class field theory in the long term."

When the variety in question is the cotangent bundle to a flag variety, then the category that one obtains is equivalent to a block of the ""Category O"" of representations of a Lie algebra, originally introduced by Bernstein, Gelfand, and Gelfand.  For this reason, this category is referred to as ""Geometric Category O"".  This category is conjectured to have many beautiful properties, which have been verified in certain special cases that arise naturally from representation theory and polyhedral geometry.  Chief among these conjectures is that the categories are Koszul, and that each symplectic variety has a ""symplectic dual"" whose associated category is Koszul dual to that of the original variety.  This phenomenon is expected to form a bridge between various approaches to categorification of Lie algebra representations and link invariants that were previously thought to be unrelated.<br/><br/>Symplectic algebraic varieties arise naturally from many different areas of mathematics. Geometric and topological properties of hypertoric varieties have shed new light on the topology of hyperplane arrangements and the combinatorics of matroids. Quiver varieties provide geometric realizations of actions of infinite dimensional Lie algebras, leading to canonical bases and to actions on categories of sheaves. This grant plays a key role in this picture, providing new geometric insight to such phenomena as Gale duality in combinatorics and level-rank duality in representation theory. This project will contribute to each of these endeavors independently, and will also advance a common treatment that unifies our understanding of the various individual phenomena.  In addition to the research component, the grant includes an annual workshop for graduate students and postdocs that bridges these various fields."

Representation theory studies all of the ways a given symmetry, or Lie group, can manifest itself. The problem of understanding all ""unitary"" representations (in which the symmetry operations preserve lengths) is one of the most important unsolved problems in the subject, and has potential applications in many areas; for example, it is an abstract version of the question, ""what quantum mechanical systems can admit a certain kind of symmetry?"""

All these areas have seen fascinating progress in the last decade.<br/><br/>The project will be conducted with active involvement of graduate and undergraduate students and post-docs.  These areas of mathematics are closely related to many recent developments in mathematical physics (the mathematical side of theoretical physics), mostly to quantum field theory, string theory, and statistical mechanics.  Combinatorial problems which will be addressed also have direct applications in biology, for instance in the study of phylogenetic trees.  This grant (in combination with other grants) will be used to fund a number of training workshops and master-classes on hot research topics aimed at post-doctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate students."

The ability to perform increasingly complicated computations in more and more areas of these two fields continues to revolutionize both research in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra and the breadth of the applications of these fields to other areas of research. Most of the other related computer algebra systems are based in foreign countries and continued competitiveness of Macaulay 2, a leading United States--based program, depends on both a broad community contributing to its development and the funding to support this community through intensive workgroup meetings. <br/><br/><br/>Two intensive workshops for generating and improving key ``packages'' <br/>for Macaulay 2 will be held January 7-13, 2010 and in August, 2010. <br/>Approximately 30 researchers will attend each workshop. The main objective is to implement algorithms in the following three rapidly growing areas: algebraic statistics, numerical algebraic geometry and toric geometry. These areas have significant applications in fields as diverse as computational biology, data analysis and statistics. It is the expectation, therefore, that the packages developed through this workshop will advance our knowledge and understanding across multiple disciplines. The participation of both experienced and novice researchers from a variety of institutions is crucial to the work of these workshops. These intensive workshops are also a great opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to enhance their package-writing skills early in their careers, taking advantage of the experience and research expertise of the more senior researchers as well as sharing their own expertise with the group. A strong presence rom young researchers also helps the base of mathematicians programming for Macaulay 2 to grow over time. Travel and lodging support for these workshops are critical to both the intensive nature of the workshop and to the future development of Macaulay 2."
