Polynomial equations arise naturally in a number of situations, and commutative algebra continues to develop a fascinating interaction with several fields, becoming an increasingly valuable tool in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The focus of the project is on questions in commutative algebra relating to local cohomology, tight closure theory, and classical rings of invariants; all of these questions arise quite naturally from recent developments. Local cohomology often provides the best answers to fundamental questions such as the least number of polynomial equations needed to define a solution set. Projects in this direction include algorithmic aspects as well as structural properties; there is a special focus on local cohomology modules of polynomial rings over the integers: this stems from the fact that there is a canonical homomorphism from the integers to any ring, and this makes local cohomology modules over the integers, in a sense, universal. This viewpoint has proved useful in recent joint work with Lyubeznik and Walther. At the same time, new techniques for investigating local cohomology over the integers have been developed in joint work with Bhatt, Blickle, Lyubeznik, and Zhang; it is proposed to extend these new techniques to an algorithm. Projects related to tight closure theory include investigating the singularities of Hankel determinantal rings, a question coming from recent joint work with Conca, Mostafazadehfard, and Varbaro, and whether these rings arise as invariant rings for actions of linearly reductive groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the context of the Mathematics Department, and more precisely, this Research Training Group project, the Principal Investigators (who have a broad expertise in Geometry and its connections with Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Topology, and Algebraic Number Theory) together with other faculty members, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students intend to focus on building communities which will impact, at all stages of the academic pipeline, the number and readiness of people entering the U.S. mathematical workforce (both academic and industrial), and bolstering in particular the representation of women and underrepresented minorities in the mathematical sciences. Moreover, structures put in place will see a vertical community of women mathematicians, a vertical community of mathematicians from low-income households and underrepresented minority groups, a community of young scholars who will pursue research careers in industry,  and a horizontal community of strong junior and senior math majors.<br/><br/>The RTG Senior Faculty will use their research expertise and previous experience to mentor research of junior mathematicians centered on Geometry. Reflecting the strongly collaborative relationship of the team, contributions will come from perspectives not only within but also across the disciplines of Analysis and PDE, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Topology, Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Number Theory. To that end, vertical integration of postdocs and students will allow collaborative research projects, and this will be aided by developing an expository writing seminar in the mathematical sciences for freshmen as an alternative entry point into mathematical thinking, as well as organize conferences of RTG programs to share ideas, the highlights of which will be stored in a public written record. The log-cabin conferences and undergraduate conferences will give participants the opportunity to disseminate their research and grow collaborative networks. There will be opportunities for summer internships in local industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hence a better understanding of cluster algebras is not only interesting in its own right, but also has significant potential application in other areas of mathematics and beyond. The project will provide training for students through involvement in the research.  <br/><br/>Rigid modules, invariant curves, and knots are fundamental objects in many branches of mathematics.

The proposed research deals with the question of whether a given dynamical system has rigidity properties, namely whether different trajectories must display a lot of common patterns. The principal investigator will conduct research on the topic, collaborate with other researchers, work with graduate and undergraduate students, and disseminate ideas developed in the project.

One of such classes are actions on smooth manifolds by higher-rank commutative groups or by lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups. These actions are often expected to have rigidity, a phenomenon characterized by the scarcity of invariant structures under the action.  Another proposed line of research is the study of some special cases of the Mobius disjointness conjecture. These include certain distal topological systems and other systems whose trajectories have strict patterns in sufficiently long term.

The study of the (bilateral, translation, rotational, scaling and other) symmetries of a given chemical, physical or mathematical system is often key to its understanding, and ultimate solution, since their presence greatly constrains the system. Quantum groups are deformations of the most basic symmetries of Nature. They were discovered in the 1980s as symmetries of one and two-dimensional statistical mechanical models that describe, for example, thin layers of ice. Quantum groups have re-emerged very recently as the symmetries of four-dimensional gauge theories that describe the interaction of elementary particles such as quarks. <br/><br/>Quantum groups form a hierarchy that depends on the strength of the deformation and their dependence on a spectral parameter: constant, rational, trigonometric or elliptic. As the hierarchical level rises, an interesting trade-off occurs: some of the structure becomes far more intricate, while some simplifies radically. This project will further uncover relations that exist between different members of the hierarchy by building conceptual bridges between them. These conceptual bridges will have fundamental consequences for the quantum groups they link. On the one hand, they will give a radically simpler description of the multivaluedness of the differential or difference equations for one quantum group in terms of its hierarchical superior. On the other, they will give a self-contained description of the latter in terms of the former which, in addition to clarifying its structure, has potentially far reaching arithmetic consequences. More precisely, the present project will explore the relations between affine quantum groups. One main theme of the project is to extend the description of the monodromy of the rational Casimir connection of a symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebra, in terms of quantum Weyl group operators, to numerical values of the deformation parameter, and to the difference analogue of the connection. The second main theme of the project is to use the meromorphic tensor equivalence of finite dimensional representations of Yangians and quantum loop algebras, and of quantum loop algebras and elliptic quantum groups, to compute the monodromy of the trigonomeric Casimir connection and of the rational and trigonometric qKZ equations, thus proving the difference analog of the Drinfeld-Kohno theorem conjectured by Frenkel and Reshetikhin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The subject grew into a testing ground for Intersection Theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern mathematics.  This workshop will bring together researchers and students coming from different backgrounds, to present various points of view on the subject of Schubert Calculus.<br/><br/>A large part of Schubert Calculus concerns the cohomology rings of Grassmannians and flag manifolds, as well as their generalizations.

A guiding problem is to find combinatorial formulas for the multiplication of Schubert classes in flag varieties; several new cases of this problem were solved.  New research has extended our understanding of Schubert calculus to the infinite-dimensional affine (and Kac-Moody) flag varieties, simultaneously deepening the connection with representation theory.  Major goals of this conference include sharing new results and introducing a new generation of students to the techniques, applications, and open problems in the field.

The latter studies abstract algebraic structure by presenting their elements by matrices. It was first developed by Frobenius about a century ago and has become pervasive across all fields of mathematics. This research project sits at the crossroads of the above two branches of mathematics. The goal of the project is to understand the intricate relations between two seemingly unrelated, but fundamental, objects: Nakajima quiver varieties from algebraic geometry and representations of symmetric pairs from the representation theory. <br/><br/>Nakajima varieties provide a natural home for geometric representation theory of simply-laced complex simple Lie algebras. This project will address the following two long-standing, fundamental problems in Nakajima theory. The first is to develop a Nakajima theory for the non-simply-laced complex simple Lie algebras. Ultimately, Nakajima theory is a theory about the interaction of symplectic geometry and representation theory. The second problem arises from this perspective: deduce representation theoretic information from the partial symplectic resolutions recently shown to arise from Nakajima varieties as fixed-point loci of symplectic and anti-symplectic automorphisms. It turns out that the two problems are two sides of a coin and they provide answers to each other. Furthermore, via the geometric R-matrix theory of Okounkov and his collaborators, the study of the two problems converges to a Nakajima theory for symmetric pairs, for which a research plan is laid out in this project. The latter  can be thought of as an infinitesimal version of a Nakajima theory of real simple Lie groups/algebras, upon which this project aims to shed light.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In two dimensions, this is a relatively simple question which was addressed in the early part of the 20th century.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the area of mathematics known as Representation Theory had applications to this goal in dimension three.  In the late 1990s the program of categorification, which encompasses various areas of mathematics, was introduced to tackle this question in dimension four. This National Science Foundation funded collaborative project aims to further this already deep connection between the two fundamental fields of mathematics. <br/><br/>Soon after quantum groups were introduced in the 1980s, certain knot invariants, such as the Jones polynomial, were constructed from these objects.  Specializing the parameter of a quantum group to a root of unity led to invariants of three-dimensional manifolds.  Categorification is an interdisciplinary area of research which seeks to ""upgrade"" certain structures in mathematics such as replacing numbers with vector spaces and vector spaces with categories.  A link homology discovered in the 1990s categorified the Jones polynomial.  This led a surge in research in categorifying various aspects of quantum groups and their representations at a generic value of the quantum parameter.  In order to categorify three-manifold invariants coming from quantum groups, one must try to understand categorified quantum groups at a root of unity.  The subject of hopfological algebra was outlined in the early 2000s to accomplish this goal.  Quantum groups at roots of unity are associative algebras defined over rings of cyclotomic polynomials.  Such rings are categorified by stable categories of modules over truncated polynomial algebras.  The investigators will look for module categories over these stable categories in order to try to categorify the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity including knot and three-manifold invariants.  In order to categorify the associated 3-dimensional TQFT, one must work over a slightly larger ring where certain integers are inverted.  This ring has been categorified recently and the investigators will attempt to incorporate this structure into categorical representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their construction is intimately related to quantum cohomology of the symplectic resolutions. These subjects have played an important role in several areas of modern mathematics. Some of the most recent research directions (such as i-quiver varieties) have emerged only in the last year or so, and are currently aligning with Maulik-Okounkov's theory.

The geometric study of singularities is incorporated into this project in at least two ways: canonical threefold singularities can be used to engineer 5 dimensional superconformal field theories, and certain codimension 2 singularities can be used to engineer gauge theories analogous to the Hitchin system.    Proposed research in string theory proper includes a more careful analysis of the holomorphic anomaly equation with particular attention to the Principal Investigator's earlier work on BPS invariants of elliptic fibrations and Jacobi forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this end, one considers the collection of all solutions of a system of equations as a geometric object and investigates the functions defined on this object. Reversing the perspective leads to the implicitization problem, which the investigator plans to work on: Given a geometric object, such as a curve or a surface, one wishes to construct a system of polynomial equations that has the geometric object as its solution set. Once the system of polynomial equations is known, it becomes much easier, for instance, to decide whether a specific point lies on the surface or whether the surface is smooth at one of its points. The implicitization problem is difficult and requires advanced techniques from pure mathematics, but its solution even in particular cases has numerous applications, for instance in computer aided design, robotics, and other areas of engineering.<br/> <br/><br/>This project addresses several topics in Commutative Algebra that have close connections with Algebraic and Analytic Geometry and with Elimination Theory. They include the implicitization problem for Rees algebras and rational maps, equisingularity theory, the Poincare problem for plane foliations, and residual intersection theory. Determining the implicit equations of graphs and images of rational maps is a classical, but open problem in elimination theory, which amounts to finding defining ideals of Rees algebras. Previously, the PI and his collaborators solved this problem for Rees algebras of codimension three Gorenstein ideals, under the additional assumption that the entries of a syzygy matrix of the ideal generate a complete intersection. Now the PI intends to remove this crucial hypothesis. The PI also plans to investigate Rees algebras of more general ideals, with the aim to obtain at least qualitative statements and bounds for the implicit equations. A goal in equisingularity theory is to devise fiberwise numerical criteria for when a family of analytic spaces is topologically trivial. An important intermediate step are numerical characterizations of integral dependence of modules. The PI intends to prove such a characterization using a notion of multiplicity that is inspired by intersection theory. Poincare had asked how to decide whether a singular algebraic foliation of the complex plane has an algebraic curve as a leaf. In more recent times, this question has often been treated as a problem about relating invariants of a vector field to invariants of curves or varieties that are left invariant by the vector field. The PI will investigate this problem, using his expertise from prior work on algebraic differentials and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. The notion of residual intersection, a generalization of linkage or liaison, is ubiquitous and appears naturally in intersection theory and in the study of Rees algebras, for instance. Of central importance are the Cohen-Macaulayness and duality properties of residual intersections. Based on partial results and experimental evidence, David Eisenbud and the PI have observed that, unexpectedly, many residual intersections, even when they fail to be Cohen-Macaulay, admit maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules of rank one that are self-dual. The PI and his collaborators intend to give a proof of this unusual phenomenon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This subject has seen major developments in the last few years. One of the most striking is the invention of modern invariants counting the number of curves with certain properties in spaces that are expected to be related to our current universe's space-time. A major breakthrough came from understanding that the computation of some of these invariants can be understood in terms of solutions of certain equations related to the geometry of so-called mirror spaces. While the initial description of these invariants was geometric in nature, work of Kontsevich and Costello suggests that an algebraic approach would lead to increased flexibility and more efficient computation. The goal of this project is to expand that work and define the invariants in such a way that existing results on the Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture will automatically imply that existing numerical predictions on curve-counts are correct.  <br/><br/><br/>Kevin Costello introduced in 2005 a categorical generalization of Gromov-Witten invariants, defined for all genera. Despite considerable interest, very little is known about these invariants. The first calculation of them, for the universal family of elliptic curves, was achieved by the PI in 2017, in joint work with Junwu Tu. In this project the PI expand the current understanding of these invariants. The PI will complete ideas originally proposed  by K. Costello, and then use the resulting theory to compute B-model Gromov-Witten invariants of positive genus for higher dimensional varieties, including the quintic threefold.  This will verify the validity of the mirror symmetry predictions in higher genus. The main approach will be to replace the geometric spaces with algebraic structures called categories of matrix factorizations. This is of independent interest in itself: the invariants of these categories should be closely related to the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariants, but such a relationship is not explicitly known.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, if reflective symmetry is available, then computations can be cut in half: only half of the object is needed to understand it fully. Conversely, a lack of symmetry can also limit whether a material or object can possess a certain property. The overall theme of this project is to better understand certain groups of symmetries by studying how they transform a one, two, three, or higher dimensional space. This is well-understood when working with algebraic spaces based on the real numbers, but much more complicated when working in the modular case, that is, when real numbers are replaced by a finite number system that depends on a fixed prime number. Modular arithmetic is computationally easy and very useful; for instance, it forms the basis of modern algorithms in coding theory and cryptography. However, the problem of understanding and classifying how symmetries transform algebraic spaces in the modular case is more difficult than for real numbers and is not as well-understood. Broadly speaking, this project will study symmetries of algebraic spaces in the modular case. <br/><br/>More precisely, much of the representation theory of a reductive, connected algebraic groups is encoded in affine Hecke algebras. Affine Hecke algebras have two geometric interpretations: equivariant constructible sheaves on the affine flag variety and equivariant coherent sheaves on the Steinberg variety. These two interpretations are known to be equivalent when working with characteristic zero sheaves. In the modular case, this is not yet known. However, if it does hold, one would expect certain structures on the coherent side that have yet to be defined. The PI will define exotic t-structures on derived categories of coherent sheaves for varieties similar to the Springer resolution and extend the powerful theory developed for intersection cohomology sheaves to the coherent setting. The PI will also define an Iwahori--Whittaker model for the Satake category. Finally, the PI will explicitly construct some central sheaves (those associated to tilting representations) in the mixed affine Hecke category. This project will strengthen the current categorical understanding of the affine Hecke algebra which, will aid its application to modular representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project develops methods of algebraic geometry for the study of algebraic varieties with a large set of symmetries using the theory of invariants. The results obtained by these methods may provide a new insight into the rationality problem of algebraic varieties that measures the complexity of algebraic objects. Much of this project concerns the development of algebraic techniques to obtain a better understanding of certain problems in geometry.<br/><br/>The project covers a wide range of aspects in algebra such as algebraic geometry, algebraic groups and motivic cohomology. The classifying spaces of certain algebraic groups classify classical objects such as simple algebras, algebras with involutions, and quadratic forms. The PI will study cohomological invariants of algebraic groups. There are two applications of cohomological invariants. The first application is related to the classification of algebraic objects when the objects are determined up to isomorphism by their cohomological invariants. The second application considered in the project is the rationality problem for classifying spaces of algebraic groups. In particular, an old problem on the rationality of classifying spaces of connected algebraic groups is addressed. The problems to be studied require elaborate techniques including representation theory of algebraic groups, motivic cohomology, algebraic cycles and Chern classes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Systems of such equations describe or model behavior and phenomena throughout the sciences; epidemiology, population dynamics, mechanics etc. The project will use methods from model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, to develop or improve procedures for showing consistency (existence of solutions) of systems of such equations, for identifying auxiliary parameters in systems of such equations, and for eliminating unknowns from such systems. The project will also extend the existing classification of sets of solutions from the case of over-determined (or finite-dimensional) systems to under-determined (or infinite-dimensional systems). <br/><br/>In this focused research group project, the team of researchers studies differential, difference, and differential-difference equations, from the point of view of model theory in the sense of mathematical logic. Among the aims is to provide decision procedures or improve existing decision procedures regarding consistency and elimination. Applications to a variety of modelling problems for physical systems are expected. The proposed research is threefold. The first is to develop efficient algorithms in cases where the existing methods from theories of differential or difference fields provide algorithms in principle. The second is to extend the existing model-theoretic classification of finite-dimensional solution spaces of systems to infinite-dimensional solution spaces, as well as developing methods to apply the classification in practice.

Representation theory is a branch of modern algebra studying symmetries in linear spaces. It interacts with many other areas in mathematics, mathematical physics, and theoretical computer science. Geometric methods have become more and more fundamental in all of these areas. One of the main objectives of these conferences is to introduce beginning researchers in representation theory to the power of geometric methods. Keynote lectures for these conferences will be Milen Yakimov in 2018 and Lidia Angeleri Hugel in 2019. Each keynote lecturer will give two one-hour lectures, emphasizing geometric methods; these talks will be accessible to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. There will also be several expository lectures given by other established researchers. The remainder of the lectures will be research talks given by other participants. These will include talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers related to their Ph.D. theses. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere in which new collaborations can be formed and young researchers will have the opportunity to learn about cutting-edge geometric methods in representation theory. Moreover, the conference will enable early-career representation theorists to present their work and interact with the broader research community. <br/><br/>Over the last 40 years, the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras has enjoyed a great impact of methods from algebraic geometry, in particular from geometric invariant theory and transformation groups. At the same time, this influence has led to the feedback of ideas and techniques from representation theory to geometry. One of the goals of the conferences on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory is to help strengthen and advance this interaction between geometry and representation theory. The topics of these conferences will include: quantum nilpotent algebras and quantum cluster algebras; Poisson geometry and quantizations of coordinate rings of varieties; tilting and silting theory; semi-invariants for bound quivers; geometric aspects of cluster algebras; degenerations of modules and the geometry of orbit closures in module varieties; moduli problems for finite dimensional algebras; and universal deformation rings and their connection to moduli spaces.

The project is focused on questions that originate in statistical mechanics, which describes the average behavior of systems with large numbers of components. The algebraic study of these systems, and their symmetries, leads to new algebras, whose structure is in turn encoded combinatorially by collections of functions that arise as solutions to systems of equations. These new algebras, their generalizations, and the resulting combinatorics are the main topics to be studied. The research will be conducted in association with students at the graduate and undergraduate level, and will enhance our understanding of how these fields of study connect to each other.<br/><br/>More precisely, the project concerns graded tensor products of cyclic current algebra modules, specifically Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules. The combinatorial framework is the quantum cluster algebra of the associated Q-systems, the solutions of which can be expressed in terms of plane tilings and non-intersecting path models.  By investigating the discrete integrability of these systems, the investigators expect to produce conserved quantities, so far achieved only in type A. In turn, these should lead to difference equations for the graded characters of tensor product product, which generalize the difference Toda equations. Moreover, the solutions of these equations can be expressed as iterated action of difference creation operators, closely related to generalized Macdonald operators defined within the context of polynomial representations of double affine Hecke algebras. Relations to quantum affine and elliptic Hall algebras will also be investigated, as well as more combinatorial questions such as the existence of some (quantum) non-commutative counterpart to the Gessel-Viennot determinant for non-intersecting path enumeration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching principle of the research of the PI is that certain algebraic problems can be reinterpreted directly as geometric problems in higher dimension, providing intriguing connections between objects from different parts of mathematics.  A great wealth of such connections have been found indirectly through intermediate objects of an analytic nature.  The research of the PI aims to provide a window through which well-known conjectures and statements of arithmetic may be seen in a new and more direct light.<br/><br/>The PI has conjectured an intricate but explicit relationship between modular symbols and cup products of cyclotomic units.  This and its proposed extensions say roughly that class groups of cyclotomic fields are explicitly determined by and determine homology groups of modular curves reduced modulo Eisenstein ideals.  The project aims to strengthen his conjecture and extend it and known results to higher-dimensional algebraic groups and other global fields.  This involves substantial foundational work to develop the necessary framework for the desired formulations that are the primary focus of the project.  The expectation is that the geometry of locally symmetric spaces should explicitly determine the arithmetic of lattices in Galois representations, which is to say the structure of Selmer groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is hoped that the need for stronger results to cater for applications in analytic number theory will drive the development of additive combinatorics, and vice versa. <br/><br/>More specifically, the PI will continue his work surrounding additive problems involving primes by developing and combining aforementioned analytic and combinatorial tools. The classical approaches using the theory of L-functions and sieve theory have achieved great results in this direction, and it is expected that by incorporating tools from additive combinatorics one can go beyond what the classical methods could achieve. The PI will also continue to investigate the theory of Gowers norms for multiplicative functions and for the von-Mangoldt function.

The proposed activities include training of graduate students in several capacities, which promotes enhancement of the US knowledge base; increased access to enrichment activities for low-income students in New York City and Los Angeles; new training opportunities for US undergraduates seeking careers in mathematics education; development of open-source software for mathematics research; and work on interactive open-source curricular materials, including the introduction on a new course on mathematical software.   <br/><br/><br/>It is hardly an overstatement to assert that the theory of perfectoid spaces since 2010 has triggered a revolution in arithmetic geometry, with rapid advances coming at a previously unknown pace; however, deep improvements in the foundations of the subject are vital in order to sustain this rate of progress.

Separately, computational advances driven by p-adic analysis have had, and will continue to have, a transformative effect on the study of arithmetic-geometric objects and their associated L-functions, by opening up vast new territories for empirical observation.

Algebraic geometry is one the most ancient subjects in mathematics with its origins traced to the algebraic study of curves by Greek mathematicians more than 2400 years ago.  Algebraic geometry drastically transformed around 60 years ago with the seminal work of Grothendieck.  This transformation led to more rigorous and much broader foundations with immensely powerful techniques which were employed to resolve a number of long-lasting conjectures not only within algebraic geometry but also other mathematical fields such as number theory, topology and statistics.  Most recently, the last few decades have seen the reach of algebraic geometry expand even further with an astounding array of practical applications.  Algebraic geometry now provides the technical backbone to cryptosystems governing online transactions, to computer graphics used in movies, games and virtual reality, to the computational methods in the study of biological systems  and the effectiveness of drug treatments, and to many other fields including data science, machine learning and computer vision. <br/><br/>This project aims to study a wide collection of ideas encircling the concept of moduli spaces.  In algebraic geometry, there is a large disparity between geometric intuition and the technical tools needed to prove results, and this disparity is perhaps no greater than in the study of moduli spaces.

The investigator will further the development of the foundations of algebraic stacks by in particular developing an intrinsic method to construct projective moduli spaces parameterizing objects that may have positive dimensional automorphism groups.

Such equations define geometric objects; among them the most accessible and fundamental ones are elliptic curves (one-dimensional case) and abelian varieties (higher-dimensional analogue). A modern way to approach these objects is to study them in families, and certain geometric objects, so-called Shimura varieties, have been used to parametrize these families. Arithmetic properties of abelian varieties can be translated into arithmetic-geometric properties of the corresponding Shimura variety. In this way, the principal investigator and her collaborators will be able to use methods from different areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, number theory, and representation theory to study the arithmetic of abelian varieties.<br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the infinitude of certain thin sets of primes arising from reduction types of abelian varieties. When the abelian varieties are over number fields, the principal investigator and her collaborators are aiming for results along the line of Elkies' theorem on supersingular reductions of elliptic curves. The research will focus on nonsimple reductions or reductions with higher Picard rank and establish a general framework to treat certain abelian varieties of arbitrarily high dimension. In the function field case, certain new phenomena appear and are related to the geometry of the Newton strata of the corresponding Shimura variety. The philosophy of this project is related to the Kudla program on arithmetic intersection of special cycles on Shimura varieties. In addition to the usual setting of the Kudla program, certain non-special cycles are studied in the framework of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the fundamental goals of number theory is to understand solution sets of polynomial equations.  These equations define geometric objects, for example, the algebraic curves on which many modern cryptographic systems are based.  Instead of focusing on solutions to a single equation, one can consider a family of equations and attempt to understand the average behavior, the extremal behavior, and in particularly nice settings, to compute the entire distribution of the number of solutions when varying through this family.  Within families of curves there are certain properties that one might want to avoid, or select for, so it is an important problem to understand how often these properties arise.  In the second half of the twentieth century, mathematicians began to develop the interplay between number theory and the theory of error-correcting codes.  This project will explore this connection, using ideas from coding theory to understand families of algebraic curves.<br/><br/>The questions examined in this research project are a part of the field of arithmetic statistics.  The principal investigator will explore distributions of rational point counts for families of elliptic curves over finite fields, especially families that play a key role in cryptography.  The project will build on earlier work studying rational point count distributions for elliptic curves over a fixed finite field, applying these ideas to answer statistical questions about Legendre curves and pairing-friendly elliptic curves.  The project will also study the distribution of rational point counts for genus-3 curves over finite fields.  Computational evidence suggests that there are more curves with many rational points than with few points.  The principal investigator aims to use ideas from the theory of error-correcting codes to understand this asymmetry.  A major theme of this project is finding boundaries between counting problems that have polynomial answers, ones where formulas are not polynomial but can be expressed in terms of quantities such as Fourier coefficients of modular forms, and problems where we can only hope for asymptotic answers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MASON is a nascent regional conference in number theory whose main goal is to promote and sustain communication and collaboration among number theorists from the Mid-Atlantic region (defined to include the states of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, plus the District of Columbia). The Mid-Atlantic has a growing and diverse community of number theorists. The need for a regular meeting like MASON is especially acute among students (both graduate and advanced undergraduates) and researchers at the many comprehensive and primarily undergraduate institutions in the region. MASON conferences will bring members of these groups in contact with one another and with distinguished number theorists. Thus, the meetings will be an important venue for professional development and networking for Ph.D. candidates, junior mathematicians and faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions. Moreover, MASON meetings will provide opportunities for the recruitment of students into graduate programs and for contacts between academic and non-academic mathematicians with interests in number theory. The award will be used primarily to support the traveling expenses of students, postdocs, and faculty without institutional travel support to the next three MASON conferences: MASON II in April of 2018 at Towson University; MASON III in the spring of 2019 at James Madison University; and MASON IV in 2020 at Gettysburg College. <br/><br/>MASON meetings will feature plenary lectures by leading experts in number theory and parallel sessions of contributed talks by participants. Each MASON meeting will feature also a problem session. The scientific focus of the conference will be on the following areas within number theory: algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, automorphic forms and L-functions, elementary and combinatorial number theory, modular forms, and the theory of partitions. The plenary lectures will introduce the audience to recent breakthroughs in these areas, which represent--in broad strokes--the spectrum of interests of researchers in the region. In the contributed talks, participants will have the opportunity to report on their own research and to learn from each other. MASON meetings will also be venues to forge future research collaborations, both among number theorists and between number theorists and research mathematicians in related mathematical fields. <br/><br/>More information about MASON can be found at the main MASON website: <br/>https://wp.towson.edu/akumchev/mason/."

An equally important objective is  to more fully understand the deeper connections between these seemingly dissimilar objects, that is, primes and permutations, thus building bridges between several areas of mathematics such as number theory, combinatorics, probability, and group theory.<br/><br/>One of the projects aims to develop a new methods, based on probabilistic reasoning, for establishing the existence of long strings of consecutive composite values in sparse sequences of integers,  in order to gain a better understanding of the gaps between prime values of the sequence.  Of particular interest are the sequences of values of a given polynomial.  Another project will show that there exist extremely large discrepancies, in a precise quantitative sense, in the distribution of primes in arithmetic  progressions to a given modulus when many residue classes are viewed together. This will also involve the creation of new tools for dealing with large deviations of multivariate distributions. The third project is dedicated toward a better understanding of the the concentration of  divisors of integers and the concentration of  fixed sets of random permutations.  The research will improve existing results about the distribution of the maximal concentration of divisors  in dyadic intervals, and maximal number of fixed sets of any size, and obtain sharp bounds on the largest interval which contains k divisors of a typical integer, for any quantity k.

Commutative algebra is the study of solutions of polynomial equations, which are ubiquitous throughout science.  One way to study polynomial functions is to view them instead in a simpler clock-arithmetic-like setting (where for example, 6+7 = 1, in other words, 7 hours after 6 o'clock is 1 o'clock).  Translating between these two number systems has been a fruitful strategy for centuries, with applications on both sides; for example, this sort of mathematics is essential in modern secure communications systems.   This project aims to develop tools to help work directly in what is called a ""mixed characteristic"" setting, which sits between the classical numerical world and the clock-arithmetic-like setting.  These tools will help unify the classical and clock arithmetic settings. The investigator plans to develop packages for open source software and to write a book on these topics.

This project largely concerns the study of the probability that random equations of various types have whole number or rational number solutions.  For example, a recent result of this kind proven during the period of the previous grant is that most equations of the form y^2 = a x^4 + b x^3 + c x^2 + d x + e, where a,b,c,d,e are whole numbers, do not possess any rational number solutions for x and y.

Number theory is one of the oldest areas in pure mathematics, which includes the study of integers and objects built out of them, such as integer solutions to equations.

By realizing abstract objects as matrices, one can reduce abstract problems to questions in linear algebra, which are often easier to study.

In particular, a wide range of junior and senior researchers from varying institutions will disseminate recent work, discuss the current state of intersection among their fields, exchange ideas on common problems, and form new collaborations. The conference will focus on two main objectives. First, the dissemination of recent and developing research trends within the focused research areas of number theory, vertex operator algebras (VOAs), and their intersection will help advance the mathematical sciences, allow researchers to stay up to date with developments in the field, and allow participants to form new connections among different research areas.  Second, the conference aims to help train and develop young and diverse scientists in the mathematical and physical sciences, while introducing them to new ideas and the international community. Presentations by senior scientists will aid in this process.<br/><br/>The conference will include forty research presentations covering a range of topics related to the intersection of vertex operator algebras, number theory, and conformal field theory. This will include topics such as group theory, Lie algebras, modular and other automorphic forms, quantum groups, representation theory, tensor category theory, and theoretical physics, as well as applications and intersections of these areas. Due to the rapidly changing landscape of these mathematical fields, and their intersection with theoretical physics, this conference serves as a timely and important opportunity for the research community to share and disseminate knowledge in order to advance new research developments.

The first direction involves the mathematical study of waves such as water waves or sound waves. Both physical experiments and numerical simulations exhibit the phenomenon of turbulence: fluids that are initially very smoothly-flowing and slowly-varying can develop much more complicated eddies and fine-scale behavior.  It remains unknown whether the equations that model fluid dynamics can give rise to ""blow-up,"" in which some portion of the simulated fluid achieves infinite velocity. This project studies the extent to which blow-up can be ""engineered"" by tweaking the equations that model fluid mechanics, such as changing the number of dimensions in space. The second direction involves questions related to the notorious twin prime conjecture in number theory. This conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that are separated by a distance of two, such as 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and 19, and so on.  It is still not known whether the assertion is true, but recently much progress has been made on understanding more tractable questions, such as how often it occurs that a pair of numbers, separated by a distance of two, both have an odd number of prime factors. This project aims to develop these promising new techniques further, with potential application to proving or disproving the twin primes conjecture and to other difficult, important questions in number theory. <br/><br/>In more detail, the fluid dynamical part of the project focuses primarily on variants of the Euler equations for incompressible fluids, especially higher-dimensional Euler equations on Riemannian manifolds. The ability to select the metric of such a manifold gives a promising way to ""program"" the equations to exhibit certain desirable behavior. Prior work has established that the dynamics of certain quadratic ordinary differential equations can be programmed into such systems.  The project will continue work towards exhibiting finite-time blow-up (or other interesting behavior, such as Turing universality) for these models. For the number-theoretic aspects of the project, the investigator and collaborators aim to establish further cases of the Chowla conjecture (or its logarithmically-averaged variants) on correlations of the Liouville function, by combining the recently-developed entropy decrement method with techniques from analytic number theory, combinatorics, and ergodic theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the questions addressed in the project come up naturally in the study of group representations, and others are motivated by applications. The investigator will study several problems along the lines of the global-local principle, including conjectures of McKay, Alperin, Brauer, and others that extend and generalize classical results in the representation theory of finite groups. The investigator also intends to study classification of modular representations of low dimension and to develop a theory of character level, with the goal of establishing strong bounds on character values for finite quasisimple groups. It is anticipated that the results can be applied to study Aschbacher's conjecture on subgroup lattices and the Kollar-Larsen problem on exterior powers, Miyamoto's problem, problems on random walks and anti-concentration, representation varieties of Fuchsian groups, word map distributions and Waring-type problems for quasisimple groups, refinements of Holt's conjecture on second cohomology groups, and representations of quasisimple groups with special properties."

Algebraic geometry concerns the study of solution sets of polynomial equations several variables. It is one of the oldest, most developed and active areas of research in mathematics. It has connections to many sub-fields within mathematics, both pure and applied, and also to computer science and theoretical physics. Moduli theory concerns the behavior of geometric shapes as the coefficients of the defining equations are allowed to vary. The focus of this project is the moduli of complex surfaces. These spaces have been studied abstractly in the past. This project will further study these spaces by understanding the set of natural loci inside the moduli space of surfaces that arise in geometric computations, as well as its structure. In particular, combining tools from classical algebraic geometry as well as theoretical physics, the project aims to develop a flexible machinery to work quantitatively with these loci, and to further apply this machinery to answer questions arising in the enumerative geometry of surfaces (that is, questions of the type: enumerate all surfaces that enjoy certain geometric properties). In addition to research, the principal investigator will be involved in high school mathematics competitions, will advise undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates, work to increase diversity in mathematics, and organize seminars and local conferences.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project concerns the study of the tautological ring of the moduli of surfaces (K3 surfaces, abelian surfaces, etc.). Some of the projects here concern obtaining structural results, understanding the size of the tautological rings, and developing an explicit calculus for tautological classes, expressions for natural geometric cycles in terms of tautological classes. This also leads to projects of independent interest, e.g., generalizations of a conjecture of Lehn concerning tautological integrals over the Hilbert scheme, a higher-rank stable pair correspondence, and connections with the Verlinde formula for new classes of surfaces.

The fundamental idea is to understand the extent to which global objects can be arithmetically determined by the collection of its local pieces. The strategies and techniques that will be utilized in this project originate in a broad range of other mathematical subjects, including analysis, geometry, algebra and in some cases, statistics.

First, the PI will conduct research that furthers the statistical study of class groups that originated with the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics; amongst others, this will include proving asymptotics for class groups of families of orders. Second, the PI will study number field distributions and the local-global principles that can control their asymptotics, beginning with the case of octic quaternion number fields. The strategy for obtaining such results will rely on arithmetic invariant theory, sieve methods, and geometry-of-numbers techniques utilized frequently in the field of arithmetic statistics. On the automorphic side, the PI will investigate arithmetic and geometric properties of p-adic families of Galois representations arising from non-conjugate self-dual regular algebraic automorphic representations of the general linear group over CM fields.

Despite its long history, our understanding of this subject remains unsatisfactory. In the 19th century, E. Galois introduced the idea of studying numbers via the equations that they satisfy, whose (discrete) symmetries are captured in the notion of Galois groups. In the 1970s, Langlands proposed a far reaching web of conjectures which relates these Galois groups to a completely different kind of symmetry, namely the (continuous) symmetries seen in vibrations on highly symmetric shapes (automorphic forms). Progress on particular cases of these conjectures has already led to spectacular achievements, such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, the proof of the Sato-Tate conjecture, solutions of many new Diophantine equations, etc. An emerging theme from these developments is that one can fruitfully study Galois groups (and hence whole numbers) by packaging the information they contain into continuous families, and strikingly these spaces are related to ideas from quantum physics. This project aims to further this circle of ideas, which is essential to make further progress in the Langlands program.<br/><br/><br/>More specifically, the project studies the structure of the moduli space of p-adic representations of Galois groups of p-adic fields. This is achieved by modelling deformation spaces of Galois representations with p-adic Hodge theory conditions in terms of spaces studied in Geometric representation theory, especially affine Springer fibers. This creates new links between two different highly-developed and active fields of mathematics. As a result, on one hand, geometric techniques can be used to make substantial progress on major problems in the mod p Langlands program such as Serre weight conjectures, the Breuil-Mezard conjecture, and local-global compatibility problems; on the other hand, insights and  heuristics from Galois theory can be used to discover and study new phenomena in modular representation theory and geometric representation theory. Furthermore, the project opens up many concrete questions, both theoretical and computational, which make excellent research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most fundamental and important problems in number theory is to solve Diophantine equations, that is, to find integer solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients. For example, the famous Fermat's Last Theorem concerns one class of Diophantine equations. In modern mathematical language, Diophantine equations can be encoded into a geometric notion, called algebraic varieties. Then the information of the solution will give rise to an arithmetic invariant of the corresponding algebraic variety. However, these algebraic varieties carry other important invariants related to the arithmetic one via the so-called L-function. It is often possible to transfer information from different invariants and achieve better understanding of all of them. This project aims to deepen understanding of fundamental relationships among such mathematical constructs.<br/><br/>The main theme of this project is to study L-functions of motives, which are a systematic generalization of algebraic varieties, via studying various aspects of Shimura varieties and the method of Arakelov geometry. The L-functions of motives play an important role in the current research in number theory, automorphic representations, and arithmetic geometry, as they encode crucial information from all these aspects. The Langlands Program predicts that motives, like rational elliptic curves, are linked with automorphic forms through L-functions. This project investigates five topics: (1) the Bloch-Kato conjecture for motives appearing in the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture; (2) modularity of Hecke actions on special cycles on Shimura varieties; (3) potential theory on non-Archimedean spaces and its connection to Arakelov geometry; (4) a higher derivative version of the Rallis inner product formula over function fields; and (5) nearby cycles for Artin stacks over general bases."

Symplectic duality is an equivalence of geometric categories associated to pairs of algebraic-symplectic varieties that was conjectured by Braden, Licata, Proudfoot, and Webster, and that generalizes many classic results in geometric representation theory (such as the Koszul duality of Beilinson, Ginzburg, and Soergel relating categories of modules for simple Lie algebras). In this project, the PI and his collaborators will use new techniques in gauge theory to establish a systematic construction of objects in the categories relevant for symplectic duality, and an explicit duality map between them.

In many cases of interest, it may not be possible to directly compute these numbers, but one can instead hope to analyze their rate of growth. An old theme in mathematics has been to understand such problems by finding some algebraic structure on the sequence. Recently, several groups of researchers have found new, exotic algebraic structures that apply to previously unexpected examples of such sequences in areas such as topology, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. The purpose of this project is to study and uncover the fundamental properties of these new algebraic structures by applying and combining tools from commutative algebra and representation theory.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to work on several projects at the interface between commutative algebra and representation theory, specifically the study of new classes of algebraic objects (e.g., twisted commutative algebras, Delta-modules, and FI-modules) and their applications to classical topics  (syzygies of algebraic varieties, homological stability, homology of arithmetic groups, etc.). Additionally, the PI will work on problems in Boij-Sderberg theory, which is the study of algebraic invariants, such as Betti tables of graded modules and cohomology tables of vector bundles, ""up to scalar multiple."" This topic is connected to the general theme in indirect and subtle ways that are still not well understood. The basic theme is to identify a class of examples that have the structure of a module over one of these algebraic structures and to prove that it is finitely generated. The finite generation reveals some information akin to an existence result, but often the results do not come with bounds or any sharper information, so should be seen as a first step in a larger program. The PI proposes to import ideas from commutative algebra and homological algebra, such as Hilbert functions, projective resolutions, Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, and Koszul duality, to further enhance the understanding of such examples and to reveal new information."

The project locates diverse symplectic algebraic varieties in a common framework---as moduli spaces in noncommutative Poisson geometry---develops general tools for their exploration, and yields applications to representation theory, topology, geometry, and supersymmetric quantum field theories. In particular, the project will develop and apply new methods to find generators for topological and categorical invariants associated to symplectic algebraic varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The topological and geometric structures of various kinds of spaces have captivated mathematicians and physicists for many years. The current proposal lies at the interface between algebra, geometry, combinatorics and analysis with applications to 2D-topological quantum field theory. In recent years the PI has organized several workshops that have specifically facilitated interactions between different research communities. The PI will continue to promote interactions between enumerative geometry, algebra and the theory of quantization in the direction emphasized in this project.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project is aimed at understanding a new point of view utilizing edge contraction operations of ribbon graphs. These operations were originally used to give a recursion relation of the generalized Catalan numbers of arbitrary genus. This recursion implies the DVV formula for the intersection numbers of tautological cotangent classes on the moduli space of stable pointed curves. The PI and a collaborator have discovered, an alternative axiomatic formulation for 2D-topological quantum field theory by edge contraction operations of ribbon graphs. The set of rules based on edge contractions also represent the key structure of topological recursion.  The edge contraction axioms reflect both the structure of a Frobenius algebra and the pair of pants decomposition of a topological surface. The pair of pants decomposition of a punctured Riemann surface was first used by Mirzakhani to give a recursion of Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary components of fixed lengths. Using the multiplication and comultiplication of the Frobenius algebra we aim at giving alternative axiomatic definition of cohomological field theories in the same way. The goal of this project is to study the interplay between topological recursion, Mirzakhani recursion of Weil-Petersson volumes, the classification theorem of CohFT for semi-simple Frobenius algebra and character varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What may have begun as simple curiosity--for instance, the impulse to construct and classify the regular polyhedra nearly two and a half thousand years ago--has turned out time and again to be the most effective way to study some of the most fundamental objects of mathematics and physics, whether through the more concrete symmetries of geometrical objects or the more abstract (but essential to our digital world) symmetries of quantum mechanics. Perhaps the most surprising role of symmetry in the sciences is in the study of the prime numbers, the fundamental objects of arithmetic, where there are no manifest ""symmetries"" such as one encounters in geometry. Nevertheless, much of our deepest knowledge of prime numbers comes from their connections with the ""symmetries"" of polynomial equations, a subject known as Galois theory. This research project will study Galois representations, which are natural packages for algebraically encoding information about prime numbers. One of the central programs of modern number theory, proposes new ways to ""unpack"" Galois representations by relating them to remarkably different mathematical objects arising in geometry. The PI will continue his research in this direction to describe these mysterious but absolutely fundamental relationships. As part of the educational component of this CAREER project, the PI will undertake a series of educational projects serving a variety of audiences. He will continue to run an intensive summer number theory program for Utah high school students, introducing them to mathematics as an object of experimentation and discovery, and thereby encouraging them to develop the habits of mind essential to creative intellectual work. This program involves both graduate students and local high school teachers as co-teachers, who can then carry its distinctive pedagogical model with them to other educational settings. With a view toward exciting a broader mathematical public, the PI will also, in conjunction with teaching a history of mathematics course at The University of Utah, develop curricular materials, particularly videos, to be disseminated online, in the history of mathematics. Finally, he will continue his work  training PhD students.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the Langlands program is a series of conjectures that guide much contemporary work in number theory, and in particular provide the deepest conjectural answers to problems relating Galois theory and prime numbers. In doing so, they reach out from number theory to algebraic geometry, representation theory, and beyond. The PI complete two main projects within the very broad purview of the Langlands program. The first concerns the deformation theory of Galois representations, one of the two pillars on which the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was built, and ever since one of the central research areas within algebraic number theory. Here the PI will study the deformation theory of Galois representations valued in general reductive groups; broadly, this work aims at generalizations of Serre's famous modularity conjecture. The second main project concerns the relationship between Galois representations and motives, the latter being in some sense the best linear approximation to the category of algebraic varieties, of fundamental interest in its own right, but also conjecturally the algebro-geometric counterpart of Galois representations. Here the PI will study a variety of problems concerned with establishing the motivic origin of Galois representations. These include instances of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture related to the PI's generalized Kuga-Satake theory; study of anabelian properties of moduli spaces; and motivic constructions underlying fundamental objects of geometric representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental Langlands Functoriality Conjectures predict that highly symmetric functions are the keys to understanding solutions to polynomial equations, making a bridge between the continuous (functions) and the discrete (solutions). A specific case of the conjectures played a key role in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Conjecture, but most cases of the Langlands Conjectures are still unproved.

While a general reciprocity law within the Langlands program is still far from properly formulated, even for objects over rational numbers, one can consider the ""Langlands Functoriality Principle,"" which is a consequence of Artin-Langlands reciprocity and is a conjecture that is currently at the core of Langlands program. This project deals with both reciprocity and functoriality and will establish new techniques and tools to study them.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will compare the Fourier transform defined by Braverman-Kazhdan and the Hankel transform defined by Ngo, for the standard L-functions for classical groups.

In terms of reciprocity, a number of cases where the equality of Artin factors with the factors defined by the Langlands-Shahidi method through the local Langlands correspondence (local reciprocity) for GL(n) will be established, following the techniques used in the cases of exterior and symmetric square factors for GL(n) proved earlier.

Since its founding in 1997, the primary activity of the Southwest Center is the Arizona Winter School (AWS), an annual meeting which has become a prominent national event and provides high-level training and research experience for graduate students in arithmetic geometry and related areas. The AWS is organized around a different central topic each year and features a set of courses and accompanying research projects carefully designed and delivered by leading and emerging experts.  The result is a unique fusion of traditional mathematics conference and intensive research workshop: the speakers organize courses of four or five lectures, provide lecture notes in advance, and propose research projects for graduate students to work on during the meeting. Nightly working sessions on these projects and on separate problem sets are run by the speakers and postdoctoral fellows. On the last day, students present their findings to the participants of the meeting. The result is a particularly intense and focused five days of mathematical activity for everyone involved.  At the AWS, connections among peers are formed, and mentoring relationships between students and senior researchers are developed. Subsequent collaborations between participants at all levels are the norm. Students make concrete strides toward becoming research mathematicians, post-doctoral assistants gain valuable mentoring experience in their academic careers, and faculty develop new interests and see new connections that lead to important published results. The Southwest Center website shares reusable content from the Winter Schools, including lecture notes, project descriptions, and audio and video of lectures (both live-streamed and permanently archived). Through these thorough records, the dialogues begun at the AWS are extended to the greater community, and the efforts of the AWS participants are made freely and indefinitely available to all. More information about the upcoming and past Arizona Winter School programs can be found at the Southwest Center's website: http://swc.math.arizona.edu/<br/><br/>The 2019 AWS will be held on the topic of Topology and Arithmetic, exploring the boundary of higher homotopy theory and arithmetic geometry. The development and maturation of higher category/homotopy theory is one of the most significant achievements in topology in the last decade, and has recently found striking applications to number theory and arithmetic geometry. The earliest applications were to topological quantum field theories, cobordisms, and elliptic cohomology; even here, the interaction between generalized cohomology theories and formal groups yielded results of interest to arithmetic geometry (especially, the elucidation of the geometry of Lubin--Tate and Gross--Hopkins moduli spaces of formal groups). More recent progress abounds. Gaitsgory--Lurie study Tamagawa numbers (a fundamental invariant of algebraic groups over global fields) via topological techniques. Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze establish the existence of a weight filtration on topological Hochschild homology whose graded pieces are related both to classical cohomology theories (de Rham, crystalline) and to integral p-adic Hodge theory.

The study of group theory is motivated by the desire to understand the symmetry of an object, whether it be in nature, art, communication networks, or any other place that symmetry might play a role.  Finite group representation theory has applications in physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences, and in recent years, research in group theory and other algebraic areas has also had a significant impact on technological advances, such as in cryptography and coding theory. Representation theory is a tool used to better understand the structure of a group and the symmetries it represents. Roughly speaking, representations provide a way to view an abstract group as a collection of matrices whose structure is often easier to understand. This project focuses on a number of problems that seek to relate the representation theory of a finite group to the structure of the group, which in turn may give more insight into the real-world objects whose symmetries are encoded in these groups and have implications for the various applications of group theory. Several of the problems under consideration involve computations and other components that are well-suited for involving undergraduate students and introducing them to group theory and mathematical research, and the investigator will recruit, encourage, and mentor students to pursuing research activities related to this project.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project is focused on irreducible characters of finite groups of Lie type, which make up the largest collection of finite simple groups.  It involves relating the character theory of a group to that of certain subgroups, through local-global conjectures and irreducible character restrictions, in addition to relating character fields of values to properties of conjugacy classes of the group. Several of the questions in the project aim to further the current knowledge in the field regarding the action of Galois automorphisms on characters of groups of Lie type.  Since the effect of various group actions on parametrizations of these characters is an especially problematic component in a number of local-global conjectures and other main problems regarding the representations of groups of Lie type, this is of interest to many other problems in the area. In particular, part of the project concerns Navarro's Galois-McKay conjecture for groups of Lie type, as well as studying reality for conjugacy classes and characters of groups of Lie type.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conjectures that relate such a broad range of topics are often especially compelling to mathematicians, and can lead to particularly powerful results. To give one example, mathematicians often find it useful to ""count points"" on spaces that parametrize mathematical objects. So-called HLV conjectures mentioned below predict not only a formula for doing this for certain spaces commonly called ""character varieties,"" but also generalize them in a way that is connected to their topology. Other conjectures in this family connect closely related spaces with some extremely compelling formulas involving diagrams, called parking functions, that are elementary to test by hand. While this project is based on algebraic methods, a full mathematical understanding of this topic is expected to reveal the geometry behind many deep open problems, some of which have roots in physics. The investigator also plans to involve undergraduate and graduate researchers in the project. This activity will focus on combinatorial methods that require minimal student prerequisites, and on the creation of algebra software for conducting computational experiments, an especially effective approach for student researchers unfamiliar with these topics. The development of general computer software is another impact of this project, which is expected to be useful to researchers in computational fields.<br/><br/>Some of the topics this project examines are the cohomology of the affine Springer fiber, Khovanov-Rozanksy knot invariants, some famous conjectures of Hausel, Letellier, and Rodriguez-Villegas (HLV), conjectures relating four-dimensional gauge theory to conformal theory due to Alday, Gaiotto, and Tachikawa (AGT), and related combinatorial extensions of the proof of the shuffle conjecture, such as the nabla-positivity conjecture. On one side of these conjectures, nearly all these topics have in common (conjectured) relationships with sheaves on the Hilbert scheme of points in the complex plane. On the other side, they are connected by the presence of a Riemann surface whose significance is hidden on the Hilbert scheme side, except through formulas. For instance, this Riemann surface would be the punctured disc C^* in the example of the Springer fiber, the punctured surface of genus g defining the character variety in the case of the HLV conjectures, or the two-dimensional surface on which the conformal field theory takes place in the case of AGT. The goal of this project is to make progress towards mathematical proofs of these conjectures, discover new ones, and ultimately understand the general mathematical picture. A major aspect of the approach is to extrapolate from explicit combinatorial formulas when they are available, such as the sort that appear in the shuffle conjecture, often called ""nabla formulas"" in Macdonald theory. Understanding this connection is of considerable interest to number theory, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. A second aspect is the creation of sophisticated computer software for testing new conjectures, as well as for generating data to make predictions about the general relationship with geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Classical algebraists study the Brauer group in its role as a directory of division algebras over a field. There are many open and difficult questions in this classic view of the Brauer Group; are all division algebras of prime degree cyclic? Do there exist non-crossed product division algebras of prime exponent? Is the n-torsion subgroup generated by the classes of cyclic algebras of degree dividing n? Algebraic geometers study the Brauer group as an important invariant of a scheme arising from tale cohomology.

Symmetry is a familiar concept in elementary geometry -- many of the most important figures (lines, circles, squares) are symmetrical. It is less widely appreciated that symmetry has been found to be fundamental for understanding the world. Both the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, two major developments in physics during the 20th century, rely heavily on ideas of symmetry. Linear algebra is another mathematical development of the late 19th and 20th centuries that is now heavily used throughout science. Representation theory is the study of how symmetry can be combined with linear algebra. This project deals with correspondences, called eta correspondences, between systems of symmetries of different objects. The first phase of this project is to show that there are eta correspondences for some of the most important finite systems of symmetries, and how to describe these correspondences. Subsequent phases of the project will extend eta correspondences to more cases, refine the concepts used to describe them, and use them to apply representation theory to a broad range of questions in pure and applied mathematics.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project introduces an innovative approach to the study of representations of classical groups over finite and local fields, an approach that seems beneficial for harmonic analysis. An effective theory of ""size"" for representations will be developed, including a precise definition and a method to analyze representations of a given size. The motivation in the finite setting comes from the fact that many questions about finite groups (e.g., random walks, word maps, Cayley graphs, etc.) can be approached using harmonic analysis. More precisely, what intervenes in such problems are the character ratios (character divided by dimension) of the irreducible representations (irreps) of the relevant group G. In general, it is not feasible to compute the character ratios exactly, but for applications it often suffices to show that the character ratios are small for most representations. Since in many cases the dimension of the representation is what makes the character ratio small, the first phase is to understand the dimensions of irreps and, especially, those with dimensions that are much smaller than average, since they most likely to make the dominant contributions to any sum of character ratios. The investigators have a theory that is applicable to all classical groups and, perhaps, even to all reductive groups over finite and local fields. They propose several different notions of rank of a representation, and they suspect that, although different in nature, these notions are equivalent. Having these notions in hand gives a lot of information on the dimensions of the irreps of G. In addition, the investigators discovered a systematic construction, called the eta correspondence, between large naturally defined families of irreps of G of a given rank, and (all, or most of) the irreps of a smaller group H. There is reason to believe that this construction is exhaustive, and the project pursues a proof of this conjecture. The eta correspondence gives strong control over character ratios for the representations it constructs, and a formal treatment of this relation will form the second phase of the project. A significant discovery so far is that although the dimensions of irreps of a given rank vary considerably, the character ratios of these irreps are nearly equal. Thus, for purposes of harmonic analysis, representations of a fixed rank form a natural family to study. Finally, in the third phase of the project, the investigators will apply bounds on character ratios and dimensions to several open problems in group theory and its applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, an infinite sequence of numbers might be compactly encoded as the values of a simple function. One such occurrence relevant to this project is the set of dimensions of a sequence of spaces. In many cases of interest, it may not be possible to directly compute these numbers, but one can instead analyze their rate of growth. An old theme in mathematics has been to understand such problems by finding some algebraic structure on the sequence. Recently, several groups of researchers have found new, exotic algebraic structures that apply to previously unexpected examples of such sequences in areas such as topology, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. The time is right for a deeper study of these structures. This project will develop such a study through targeted applications to new classes of examples which have been selected for novelty, either in settings or technical details.<br/><br/>The PI will pursue several projects that involve different kinds of categorical and classical symmetries in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The general theme of the research is to find and exploit hidden symmetries in a problem to gain new information about it. This information can take the form of a new structural property or a finiteness result about a family of invariants. This research will focus in particular on several classes of mathematical objects for which these properties or calculation of invariants have resisted more traditional means of attack. Among these are: the action of ordered injections on the homology of groups of upper-triangular matrices, the action of surjections on the cohomology of compactified moduli spaces, and Hopf ring actions on syzygies of secant varieties of varieties arising from multilinear algebra. These are three examples of variants of the recently well-studied ""FI-modules,"" which offer new technical challenges and open the door to new paradigms of ""representation stability."""

Progress in the Langlands program will not only advance our knowledge in number theory, but also demonstrate the unification of mathematics, showing that seemingly different areas in mathematics are governed by certain common principles.

In the context of  algebraic geometry, there are trace formulas of Grothendieck-Lefschetz-Verdier type. The investigator studies these trace formulas in conjunction with various geometric objects that naturally arise in the Langlands program. These geometric objects, which include Shimura varieties, moduli spaces of shtukas, Rapoport-Zink spaces, affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties, etc., are themselves moduli spaces of certain geometric structures.

They are also closely related to symmetries of topological phases of matter and are used to predict the existence of new types of such phases and their physical realization. This project deals with algebraic aspects of the theory of tensor categories: their structure, classification, and arithmetic properties. The emphasis is on categories that are most widely used in applications. Such categories admit an additional symmetry constraint called braiding that is used to model interaction of pairs of quantum particles. <br/><br/>Tensor categories provide a unified framework for studying various quantum symmetries such as quantum groups, vertex operator algebras, Jones-von Neumann subfactors,and conformal field theories.

A singularity is a place on a curve, surface, or higher dimensional space where it is not smooth, that is, it has a cusp (a sharp point, a place where it folds or turns abruptly) or it crosses itself. The understanding of singularities has applications to computer vision and medical imaging. In general, one wants to find and study measures of how extreme a singularity is and how these vary under operations such as deformations. This is done using abstract algebraic techniques as usually the dimension, or the number of equations, or variable and unknown coefficients make the spaces completely impractical to visualize. The goal is to attach invariants to singularities that are measures of the nature of the singularity. This project studies such invariants in three different ways. <br/><br/>More precisely, this project involves the study of the exterior algebra, modules of higher differentials, exterior powers of complexes, and related power operations such as Adams operations, sometimes with differential graded algebra structures playing a role. The homological behavior of exterior power operations is known to be complicated, yet these algebras and operations play a central role throughout many parts of algebra and mathematics. This project focuses on the following research directions (1) Adams operations and applications to Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities, (2) invariants of singularities for p-differentials, and (3) resolutions of graded Artinian algebras. For the first, the main goal is to develop a characteristic zero version of Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity. For the second, the focus is on studying singularities via their modules of higher differentials; the goal is to understand symmetries and the vanishing of invariants obtained from them, such as generalized Tjurina numbers, by showing how their resolutions are interrelated in the general non-isolated Gorenstein singularity setting. The third involves applying the resolution of Artinian algebras to various problems, such as conjectures on Betti numbers and finding dg-structures on resolutions in order to further understand Koszul homology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, if one takes a rectangle and identifies opposite edges, one obtains a cylinder, and further identifying the remaining edges gives what mathematicians call a torus - the surface of a donut. Starting with rectangles of different shapes one ends up with different tori. Furthermore, one can also do similar identifications starting with parallelograms, to get more tori. It can be proven that the such tori are intrinsically different - if one lives on the surface of a torus and cannot see the whole surface from far away, one can still distinguish the kind of parallelogram that was used to build the torus. The moduli space of tori is then the set of all possible shapes of tori that are intrinsically different. Amazingly enough this ""set of shapes"" itself is a nice geometric object. This project deals with posing problems of similar type: of classifying some geometric objects, together with some further information on them, and of studying the resulting moduli spaces.<br/><br/>The project aims to understand better the geometry of various compact moduli spaces. Together with various collaborators, the PI will construct a modular compactification of the moduli space of complex curves together with a differential with prescribed multiplicities of zeroes, compactifying the so-called strata - phase spaces in Teichmuller dynamics. Real-normalized meromorphic differentials will be applied to bound the number of cusps of plane curves of a given degree. The project also will investigate the birational geometry and homology of various compactifications of the moduli spaces of cubic threefolds. Lastly the project will continue the investigations on homology and higher dimensional cycles on moduli spaces of abelian varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such objects, called algebraic varieties, are very special and have a rich structure. Consequently, techniques from other fields of mathematics, such as Arithmetic, Topology, and Differential Geometry, are employed in their study. Within algebraic geometry, this project studies the geometry of moduli spaces. A moduli space is the space of all shapes of objects with prescribed numerical invariants. The study of moduli spaces is of central importance to several branches of mathematics and theoretical physics. In particular, over the past three decades there were deep cross-influences between Mathematics and Physics centered around a special class of algebraic varieties, the Calabi-Yau threefolds, and their moduli. One of the main thrusts of this project is the development of tools for the study of moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau varieties. <br/><br/>In this project, the moduli spaces are studied from the perspective of period maps. The period map is an essential tool for understanding the geometry of the moduli space of  abelian varieties and K3 surfaces. Beyond these classical cases, the investigation of the period maps is much more difficult due to some non-trivial and highly transcendental conditions (the Griffiths' transversality conditions) satisfied by the Variations of Hodge Structure arising in the geometric setting. Nonetheless, recent progress in the field makes possible the investigation of  some non-classical situations, especially surfaces of general type with small invariants, and Calabi-Yau threefolds. In a different direction,  several questions about the geometry of the moduli space of K3 surfaces and hyper-Kaehler manifolds are investigated by means of period maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representation theory is a branch of modern algebra studying symmetries in linear spaces. It interacts with many other areas in mathematics, mathematical physics, and theoretical computer science. Geometric methods have become more and more fundamental in all of these areas. One of the main objectives of these conferences is to introduce beginning researchers in representation theory to the power of geometric methods. Keynote lectures for these conferences will be Milen Yakimov in 2018 and Lidia Angeleri Hugel in 2019. Each keynote lecturer will give two one-hour lectures, emphasizing geometric methods; these talks will be accessible to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. There will also be several expository lectures given by other established researchers. The remainder of the lectures will be research talks given by other participants. These will include talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers related to their Ph.D. theses. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere in which new collaborations can be formed and young researchers will have the opportunity to learn about cutting-edge geometric methods in representation theory. Moreover, the conference will enable early-career representation theorists to present their work and interact with the broader research community. <br/><br/>Over the last 40 years, the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras has enjoyed a great impact of methods from algebraic geometry, in particular from geometric invariant theory and transformation groups. At the same time, this influence has led to the feedback of ideas and techniques from representation theory to geometry. One of the goals of the conferences on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory is to help strengthen and advance this interaction between geometry and representation theory. The topics of these conferences will include: quantum nilpotent algebras and quantum cluster algebras; Poisson geometry and quantizations of coordinate rings of varieties; tilting and silting theory; semi-invariants for bound quivers; geometric aspects of cluster algebras; degenerations of modules and the geometry of orbit closures in module varieties; moduli problems for finite dimensional algebras; and universal deformation rings and their connection to moduli spaces.

Typical examples include O(3,R), the group of orthogonal 3x3 matrices with real entries, and SU(2), the group of 2x2 unitary complex matrices.  Broadly speaking, the subject of representation theory deals with how such groups can act on a (complex) vector space via linear transformations.  One can then ask what happens if we replace the complex numbers by a finite field (or the algebraic closure of a finite field). Modular representation theory is concerned with matrix groups with entries in such a field, acting on vector spaces over the same field.

Many of the anticipated results are analogous to known facts in complex representation theory, but new tools and techniques must be developed in the modular case.   <br/> <br/>The past few years have seen the emergence of powerful new tools for applying geometric methods to the representation theory of algebraic groups in positive characteristic, including parity sheaves and the mixed modular derived category. This project will build on these developments with projects on three different topics: (i) monodromy operators in positive characteristic; (ii) generalized Springer theory for coherent sheaves; and (iii) Kazhdan-Lusztig cells, tensor ideals, and tilting modules. Topic (i) is essentially geometric in nature, while topics (ii) and (iii) are expected to have concrete consequences for representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important aspect of it is the study of equations, or systems of equations, for which we are looking for solutions that are integers. These equations are named diophantine equations after Diophantus, a Greek mathematician of the Roman era. Diophantine equations are still the object of intense study nowadays. Independently, in the 19th century, a new branch of mathematics, born of the marriage between the calculus invented by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century, and complex numbers discovered by algebraists of the 16th century, was developed: complex analysis, the study of so-called holomorphic functions, whose variable is a complex number. In a revolutionnary paper of 1859, Riemann observed that this new branch could be successfully used to solve previously intractable questions in number theory. Building on his work, mathematicians understood how to associate to any diophantine equation an holomorphic function, called its L-function, and make it a  fundamental tool in studying the equation. Yet empirically observed subtle relations between the number of solutions of certain diophantine equations, and the analytic property of their holomorphic L-functiona remain unproved and deeply mysterious. The project will employ new methods to study these  relations.  <br/><br/>The project will focus on the conjecture of Bloch-Kato, which predicts a relation between the arithmetic properties of diophantine equations (or rather their elementary components, called motives) and their holomorphic L-function. More precisely, this conjectures predicts that the rank of the Selmer group of a motive (which is an arithmetic object attached to the motive, closely related, in some fundamental cases, to the solutions of the diophantine equation defining it) is equal to the order at 1 of the L-function of that motive. The aim of this project is to prove, in many cases, one direction in this conjectural equality, namely that the Selmer groups has rank at least the order of vanishing. The proposed method involves the study of eigenvarieties,  or universal families of automorphic forms, at critical points, the method of decomposition of critical p-adic L-functions of Dasgupta and the PI, and the local study of deformation of critical Galois representations developed by the PI and Chenevier, Bergdall, Breuil and others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over last 20 year important connections with string theory were discovered as well. Algebraic Geometry is the study of algebraic varieties: geometric objects that can be described as the collections of points satisfying a set of polynomial equations. One of the aims of the field is to classify algebraic varieties. This can be done by first associating discrete invariants to algebraic varieties and then studying all algebraic varieties with a given set of invariants. A basic invariant used in algebraic geometry, as well as in differential geometry, is the first Chern class. Algebraic varieties can be divided into classes according to the positivity properties (or lack thereof) of this invariant. One of the most important of these classes is that of varieties with first Chern class equal to zero. These varieties have a crucial role also in physics and in differential geometry.

First, the PI will conduct research that furthers the statistical study of class groups that originated with the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics; amongst others, this will include proving asymptotics for class groups of families of orders. Second, the PI will study number field distributions and the local-global principles that can control their asymptotics, beginning with the case of octic quaternion number fields. The strategy for obtaining such results will rely on arithmetic invariant theory, sieve methods, and geometry-of-numbers techniques utilized frequently in the field of arithmetic statistics. On the automorphic side, the PI will investigate arithmetic and geometric properties of p-adic families of Galois representations arising from non-conjugate self-dual regular algebraic automorphic representations of the general linear group over CM fields.

In addition, this meeting will be unique among Macaulay2 workshops because it will engage researchers from number theory and applied algebra, which have not been traditional foci of Macaulay2's development. This presents a unique opportunity for Macaulay2 to develop capabilities that will be useful to those communities."

The conference will focus on problems related to, or motivated by, representations of infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their quantum analogues. The recent rapid growth, rising prominence, and emerging connections between these topics underscores the timely need for a conference that focuses on new connections by bringing together leading researchers who work on different aspects of these subjects. A main goal of the conference is to expose graduate students and early-career researchers to recent developments in representation theory. In an effort to foster their interest and engagement, the four day conference will be preceded by a three day summer school/workshop for junior researchers. <br/><br/>Infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and their quantum analogues play a prominent role in mathematics and mathematical physics. In recent decades their representation theory has been connected with a number of different subjects, such as algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, combinatorics and cluster algebras, to name but a few. The talks will focus on topics such as crystal and canonical bases, Weyl, Demazure and Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules and interaction between them, highest weight categories, Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras and their applications to categorification, cluster algebras and related structures, geometric methods in infinite dimensional representation theory (in particular, the role of quiver varieties), and map algebras. A special emphasis will be placed on interactions between various structures.

This is a field that deals with the study of algebraic varieties: geometric objects given as the solutions of a system of polynomial equations. For example, the solution set of a single polynomial equation in two variables can be geometrically realized as a curve in the plane (e.g., a parabola y=x^2). One important aspect is to understand the local picture of these solution sets, which has applications in many sciences and engineering. For example, the parabola is smooth (meaning that locally it looks like a line) while the curve defined by y^2=x^3 is smooth except at the origin, where it is a cusp. The singular or non-smooth points of an algebraic variety have rich and subtle local structure, and detailing their properties is a crucial part of many investigations. The projects that will be explored are focused on the local properties of algebraic varieties, such as their local intersection numbers and the multiplicities (which is a measure of how bad the singular points are). Several of the questions under study are longstanding and of fundamental importance. <br/><br/>This project investigates several longstanding open questions in commutative algebra from new perspectives. One is to attack Serre's conjecture on positivity of intersection multiplicities and Hochster's direct summand conjecture using a new notion called lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences of modules, whose existence will establish both conjectures. Another is to attack Lech's conjecture on Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities using advances in positive characteristic methods. The investigator recently settled this conjecture in dimension three in equal characteristic (the conjecture was previously known only in dimension less than or equal to two). The goal here is to improve the methods and to seek solutions in higher dimension. Other research projects include studying singularities in positive characteristic, especially investigating their behavior under deformation, under passing to a generic linkage, and their connections with F-module and D-module theory. A crucial technique to be employed is the Frobenius structures on local cohomology modules."

This conference is the only officially sanctioned satellite meeting in North America associated with the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), which will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from August 1-9, 2018. Holding a satellite meeting in Miami provides a unique opportunity to advance the 2018 ICM theme of pan-hemispheric cooperation in mathematics and its applications via a highly visible event at a major US research university, thereby enriching mathematical and scientific dialogue between mathematical scientists based in the United States and their counterparts in its Latin American neighbors. Customarily, ICM satellite meetings center on a narrowly focused topic within a particular mathematical sub-discipline and are held in the host country or surrounding region. ""A Pan-Hemispheric Celebration of Mathematics"" will be broader in scope than most ICM satellite meetings and will highlight four important areas at the forefront of current mathematics: algebraic geometry and topology; combinatorics; differential geometry and geometric analysis; and mathematical biology. The meeting will feature a vibrant mix of pure and applied perspectives with strong interdisciplinary connections, particularly to physics, biology and computer science.<br/><br/>The meeting will be organized around extended plenary lectures in each of the focal areas, given by leading experts in the field. These plenary lectures will be supplemented by parallel invited special sessions, with the event structured so as to offer participants a dual opportunity to learn broadly about important developments at the frontier of four important areas and to delve more deeply into one of them. Funding from NSF will be used to attract a diverse range of non-speaker participants, with a goal of advancing pan-hemispheric dialogue. The conference is part of ongoing efforts in this direction and draws its organizing committee from faculty at the University of Miami, the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politcnico Nacional (Cinvestav) in Mexico and the Instituto de Matemtica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in Brazil.

Symmetry is a familiar concept in elementary geometry -- many of the most important figures (lines, circles, squares) are symmetrical. It is less widely appreciated that symmetry has been found to be fundamental for understanding the world. Both the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, two major developments in physics during the 20th century, rely heavily on ideas of symmetry. Linear algebra is another mathematical development of the late 19th and 20th centuries that is now heavily used throughout science. Representation theory is the study of how symmetry can be combined with linear algebra. This project deals with correspondences, called eta correspondences, between systems of symmetries of different objects. The first phase of this project is to show that there are eta correspondences for some of the most important finite systems of symmetries, and how to describe these correspondences. Subsequent phases of the project will extend eta correspondences to more cases, refine the concepts used to describe them, and use them to apply representation theory to a broad range of questions in pure and applied mathematics.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project introduces an innovative approach to the study of representations of classical groups over finite and local fields, an approach that seems beneficial for harmonic analysis. An effective theory of ""size"" for representations will be developed, including a precise definition and a method to analyze representations of a given size. The motivation in the finite setting comes from the fact that many questions about finite groups (e.g., random walks, word maps, Cayley graphs, etc.) can be approached using harmonic analysis. More precisely, what intervenes in such problems are the character ratios (character divided by dimension) of the irreducible representations (irreps) of the relevant group G. In general, it is not feasible to compute the character ratios exactly, but for applications it often suffices to show that the character ratios are small for most representations. Since in many cases the dimension of the representation is what makes the character ratio small, the first phase is to understand the dimensions of irreps and, especially, those with dimensions that are much smaller than average, since they most likely to make the dominant contributions to any sum of character ratios. The investigators have a theory that is applicable to all classical groups and, perhaps, even to all reductive groups over finite and local fields. They propose several different notions of rank of a representation, and they suspect that, although different in nature, these notions are equivalent. Having these notions in hand gives a lot of information on the dimensions of the irreps of G. In addition, the investigators discovered a systematic construction, called the eta correspondence, between large naturally defined families of irreps of G of a given rank, and (all, or most of) the irreps of a smaller group H. There is reason to believe that this construction is exhaustive, and the project pursues a proof of this conjecture. The eta correspondence gives strong control over character ratios for the representations it constructs, and a formal treatment of this relation will form the second phase of the project. A significant discovery so far is that although the dimensions of irreps of a given rank vary considerably, the character ratios of these irreps are nearly equal. Thus, for purposes of harmonic analysis, representations of a fixed rank form a natural family to study. Finally, in the third phase of the project, the investigators will apply bounds on character ratios and dimensions to several open problems in group theory and its applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these tools were initially intended for certain problems about differential equations, they have also led to important breakthroughs in number theory. More precisely, Diophantine equations are potentially complicated systems of equations involving whole numbers, and mathematicians are interested in counting the number of solutions to such systems. Unlike waves, numbers do not oscillate, at least not in an obvious manner, but one can think of numbers as frequencies, and thus associate them to waves. In this way, problems related to counting the number of solutions to Diophantine systems can be rephrased in the language of quantifying wave interferences. This project will further extend the scope of decouplings towards the resolution of fundamental problems in harmonic analysis and number theory. The project will make new tools accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community.<br/><br/>Decouplings have proved remarkably flexible in addressing a wide variety of problems in such diverse fields as number theory, partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. One important circle of questions that remain to be addressed concerns the decoupling inequalities for curves on small spatial balls. Also, the cone poses a lot of interesting problems, even in three dimensions. The square function estimate, the local smoothing conjecture and, the decoupling into small caps are just a few examples of related problems for the cone. Progress on these problems is likely to lead to progress on many other problems. Finally, the combination of decouplings and the polynomial method has recently led to significant progress in the restriction theory of curved manifolds. The principal investigators intend to seek further improvements in this exciting and rapidly developing area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
