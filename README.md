# NSF-DMS-awards
This reposotory provides a small script to download the NSF-DMS awards for each year.

All programs under DMS are available. The default starting year is 1976 since the results are relatively complete.

To run the script. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python nsf_awards.py
```
