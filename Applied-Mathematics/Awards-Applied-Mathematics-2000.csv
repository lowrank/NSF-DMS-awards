The theory of calculus on measure chains treats continuous, discrete, and more general situations in a unified way.  A central theme of the study is the unification of discrete and continuous formulations.  The research investigates: (1) oscillation, nonoscillation, and disconjugacy properties of solutions of self adjoint systems and generalized Hamiltonian systems arising in a number of areas of applied mathematics, including calculus of variations, control theory, filtering theory, and continued fractions; (2) extension of existence, uniqueness, and multiplicity results for solutions to nonlinear boundary value problems via fixed point theorems of cone expansion/compression type and methods applicable to monotone operators in abstract spaces; (3) the structure of positive solutions of nonlinear boundary value problems; and (4) problems related to singular dynamical equations on a measure chain.<br/><br/>In scientific investigation of natural phenomena, mathematical models are used to give quantitative descriptions and to furnish predictions.  One form such models can take is a dynamic equation on a measure chain. This project provides new insight into the relationship between continuous and discrete descriptions of phenomena, and has application to many fields, including mathematical biology and economics.  In one application, a study of population growth, we will give conditions that ensure survival of a population, in particular for the case in which parents die before offspring are hatched. Two well-known examples of this are the seventeen-year cicada and the common mayfly.<br/><br/>"

The three <br/>classes are under three main headings: the <br/>generalized problem of Bolza, the continuous-time <br/>optimal control, and the discrete-time optimal <br/>control.  The first class, the generalized problem of<br/>Bolza, falls in the heart of nonsmooth analysis where <br/>the regularity of the integrand is lacking but <br/>compensated for by the relative regularity of its<br/>Hamiltonian.  Despite the fact that under certain <br/>hypotheses the second class can be viewed as a <br/>subclass of the first, it is quite beneficial to<br/>study this class directly on its own to obtain results <br/>that take into account the special and rich structure <br/>of the problem.  This direction of research produces <br/>for the optimal control problems, results that are, in<br/>general, distinct from those obtained by applying the <br/>results of the generalized problem of Bolza.  Furthermore, <br/>these two sets of results hold for the optimal control <br/>setting under  different sets of hypotheses.  The third <br/>class of problems is important for numerically solving the<br/>continuous-time optimal control problem via discretization.<br/>For the three classes, second-order necessary and <br/>sufficient conditions would be derived in terms of a <br/>quadratical functional, conjugate point theory, and  <br/>a Riccati equation.  Furthermore, results on the stability <br/>and sensitivity of solutions to perturbations would be <br/>investigated.  The Hamilton-Jacobi theory would be <br/>employed, as well as the latest techniques from <br/>variational and nonsmooth analysis.<br/><br/><br/>Optimization problems with dynamical structure have become <br/>prominent in a variety of disciplines as mathematical <br/>models of systems with time evolution. In particular, <br/>optimal control theory is a subject that was developed in <br/>the 1950's mainly to deal with applications arising from <br/>several disciplines. This includes engineering, operations<br/>management and economics. Most problem formulation were <br/>initially derived from engineering considerations which <br/>lead to the presence of control and state constraints. This <br/>is the case  with the ""soft moon landing problem"" and <br/>the ""rocket car problem"". Most recently, the formulation <br/>of the optimal control problem has been adapted to include <br/>considerations from other areas like management and <br/>economics. This accounts for the increased interest in <br/>optimal control problems with constraints containing both <br/>the state and the control variable. Therefore, providing <br/>new tools and better techniques to tackle these problems <br/>and to help in computing their solutions would have an <br/>important impact on the applications emanating from <br/>those disciplines. This is exactly the goal of the present <br/>proposal. In fact, the intent is to derive optimality <br/>criteria for control problems with different types of <br/>constraints. Furthermore, the stability of these criteria <br/>under small perturbations is analysed. This latter is <br/>crucial for applications, due to the error in measurements.                          <br/><br/>"

These<br/>transitions are related to increases in fitness brought about<br/>through natural selection acting on communication strategies.<br/>They approach these problems using evolutionary game theory and<br/>population dynamics.  The technical objective is to discover<br/>evolutionarily stable solutions to language games, such that when<br/>all individuals adopt these solutions, no mutant behavior can<br/>invade the population under the influence of natural selection.<br/>The challenge is to characterize the dynamics of the language<br/>game by specifying a realistic set of strategies and payoffs, and<br/>then to analyze the stability properties and accessibility of the<br/>equilibrium solutions.  The mathematical equivalence of the<br/>game-theoretical replicator equation to the Lotka-Volterra<br/>equation offers a large tool box of techniques from nonlinear<br/>dynamics with which to explore the games.  They also aim to relate<br/>these results to findings in information theory, in particular<br/>the formulation due to Shannon and Weaver (1949).  Theoretical<br/>studies of language therefore provide a set of fascinating<br/>conceptual and technical challenges, as the strategies described<br/>with the models must be rich enough to capture the symbolic and<br/>open-ended properties of signals.<br/>     While cooperation and animal communication are both areas in<br/>which much important theoretical work has been conducted, few<br/>attempts have been made to bring them together.  The study of<br/>language provides an important focus for such a synthesis.<br/>Theoretical studies of the evolution of animal communication have<br/>stressed extravagant and costly ornamentation, using Darwin's<br/>theory of sexual selection, whereas evolutionary approaches to<br/>language tend to be represented by studies in historical<br/>linguistics within human societies.  It is the objective of this<br/>project to occupy the center ground and provide a theoretical<br/>bridge between these two disciplines.  Thus the work is neither a<br/>study of animal signals and cooperation nor a mathematical<br/>investigation of human syntax and grammar, but rather an attempt<br/>to reconstruct the continuous series of stages through which<br/>evolution might have proceeded from one to the other.  The project<br/>does not not attempt to explain the glorious intricacies of human<br/>grammar studied by linguists, such as in X-bar theory.  Instead it<br/>focusses on simple design features of animal communication and<br/>human language and attempts to describe their evolution in<br/>mathematical terms.  These probably antedated grammar, phrase<br/>structure, anaphora and related linguistic constructs, and<br/>thereby provide some biological foundations upon which these<br/>later concepts might rest.<br/>"

It would be extremely<br/>useful to have an accurate, computationally efficient method of<br/>phylogenetic analysis, but no such method is yet known.  The<br/>method of phylogenetic invariants theoretically has these<br/>advantages.  Modern phylogenetic methods analyze the mathematical<br/>and statistical similarities between the nucleotide sequences of<br/>different species.  By modeling the evolution of the sequence for<br/>a proposed evolutionary tree T as a Markov model, one can obtain<br/>polynomials specifying the frequencies with which certain<br/>patterns should occur in observed sequence data.  These<br/>polynomials parameterize a high-dimensional real algebraic<br/>variety X.  Finding the equations that implicitly define X is<br/>theoretically equivalent to knowing how to determine whether T is<br/>the ""true"" evolutionary tree.  These equations have been<br/>previously found for special evolutionary models such as the<br/>Kimura 3-parameter model.  The investigator studies the<br/>invariants for the most general Markov model of nucleotide<br/>sequences and uses a combination of combinatorics and non-abelian<br/>Fourier analysis to find a complete set of invariants.

The project seeks to improve the<br/>accuracy of the tree reconstruction method using phylogenetic<br/>invariants.  The method of invariants is a computationally<br/>efficient method, which is known to theoretically give correct<br/>answers.  However, in practice, the method is very susceptible to<br/>the presence of noise in the data.

Predicting the<br/>evolution of the wave pulse from information about the<br/>`roughness' of the medium is a problem of deep mathematical and<br/>practical interest, as is the inverse problem of deducing<br/>information about the medium from measurements of a transmitted<br/>pulse.  Most often a detailed description of the (fine scale)<br/>variations of the medium is not possible, only a description of<br/>their statistical character.  Hence, the investigator considers<br/>the fine scale medium variations as a realization of a stochastic<br/>process.  This entails analysis of differential equations with<br/>randomly varying coefficients.  The project has three specific<br/>objectives: First, obtain a characterization of the<br/>transformation of sound pulses propagating in a medium with a<br/>continuum of length scales, a medium defined in terms of a random<br/>fractal.  Second, extend and use theory about the transformation<br/>of a wave pulse in some specific inverse problems, in particular,<br/>high contrast seismic imaging and time reversal mirrors.  Third,<br/>derive strict bounds for how an electromagnetic pulse can be<br/>affected by the medium heterogeneity without knowing the details<br/>of these variations.<br/>     The main question the investigator addresses is: How does a<br/>propagating wave behave in a medium that varies when the<br/>variations are not small?  For instance, when a laser beam<br/>propagates through the turbulent atmosphere how is it affected by<br/>intense, turbulent, variations in the local speed of propagation?<br/>When such medium variations are smooth, say with a constant<br/>speed of propagation, the problem is well understood.  For rough<br/>medium variations, as in the above example, the interaction of a<br/>wave pulse with the medium heterogeneities is a fundamental yet<br/>largely open question.  This problem, predicting the evolution of<br/>signal or wave pulse that propagates in a rough medium, is of<br/>deep mathematical and practical interest.  In addition to wave<br/>propagation in the turbulent atmosphere there are many other<br/>applications.  In reflection seismology the earth's crust is<br/>probed with a wave pulse and the reflected pulses are used to<br/>infer knowledge about macroscale variations in the medium.  It is<br/>then important to know how the rough microscale variations in the<br/>medium affect the probing pulse.  Remote sensing, ocean acoustics,<br/>and medical imaging provide similar examples.  In communication<br/>systems, it is important to be able to describe how medium<br/>imperfections and variations affect the propagating signal.

Specifically, two types of stability properties will be <br/>examined: input-to-output stability and incremental stability. Roughly <br/>speaking, input-to-output stability requires that the output signals <br/>eventually become small if the external input signals are small, and in <br/>particular, the output signals should converge to zero when there is no <br/>input acting on the system.  Incremental stability properties require nearby <br/>trajectories with nearby inputs stay nearby, and eventually converge to <br/>each other.  These properties are nonlinear generalizations of some <br/>frequently used ones in the study of linear systems.  To understand the <br/>properties in the nonlinear case well, it is crucial to explore their <br/>equivalent characterizations, among which the Lyapunov-like functions <br/>provide the most intrinsic insight.  The main objective of the project is to <br/>investigate the equivalent characterizations and to develop the theory of <br/>Lyapunov-like functions for the nonlinear stability properties.<br/><br/>One of the main issues in systems and control theory concerns with the <br/>study of system sensitivity to disturbances, and more generally, of the <br/>dependence of outputs on actuator and measurement errors, magnitudes of <br/>tracking signals, and the like.  For linear systems, the frequency domain <br/>approach has led great success in the study of such problems. Yet for <br/>nonlinear systems, the situation is much more complicated.  A key issue in <br/>the nonlinear case is to identify the most desired features and to formulate <br/>them into suitable mathematical notions.  During the last 10 years or so, <br/>the notion of input-to-state stability was formulated and it quickly became <br/>a fundamental concept upon which much of modern nonlinear feedback <br/>analysis and design rest.  In this project it is proposed to investigate a wide <br/>variety of extensions of the notion of input-to-state stability. The goal is to <br/>build a theoretical foundation for the study of stability-like properties for <br/>nonlinear systems, thereby providing a set of sound theoretical tools for <br/>nonlinear systems design.<br/>"

We analyze the tensorial partial differential equations that describe the flows of macromolecules to construct orientation patterns and determine their stability.  These analyses yield information about flow-induced phase transitions and models for orientation patterns routinely observed in experiments and manufacturing processes.  The research project on optical pulse propagation employs methods of integrable systems in the analysis of pulse propagation in nonlinear optical fibers.  The governing model equations are perturbations of scalar or coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations with small dispersion.  The research extends previous results on scalar equations to systems, studies new instability phenomena that arise from the coupling, constructs explicit solutions that serve as models for pulse propagation, and predicts the onset and fate of pulse degradation as a function of fiber properties and of pulse shape and power. <br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on mathematical issues central to two important technologies:  high-performance materials and optical fiber communications.  Many super-strong materials are produced from liquids comprised of large molecules whose shape and dynamics constrain manufacturing processes and are responsible for material properties.  This research develops mathematical models for the interaction of flow and microstructure, applies these models to explain observed patterns and their relation to material properties, and analyzes other phenomena that affect processing behavior and properties of materials.  Long-haul optical fiber communications systems are well-described by special nonlinear differential equations that are amenable to analysis with recently-developed mathematical methods.  Observations show that light pulses in optical fibers degrade through ripples that emerge on the pulse, and this phenomenon is also seen in computer simulations.  This project develops rigorous mathematical understanding of why ripples form and an explicit algorithm that predicts pulse degradation given the properties of the fiber and the input pulse. This tool will be useful to design optimal pulse shapes for given optical fibers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Emphasis is on developing techniques useful to experimentalists.  During the last decade, much research has been focused on the realization that sensitive dependence on initial conditions and parameters allows flexible and efficient control of a chaotic dynamical system.  Major difficulties have been connected with representing the action of the dynamical system on its phase space.  In contrast, a complete global representation of a dynamical system is available in terms of its symbolic dynamics, and a graph approximation of the symbolic grammar is a highly efficient way to completely encode coarse-grained control strategies.  This project reduces the difficult problems of developing a global control strategy to much easier problems, concerning linear algebra if targeting invariant density, or combinatorics of path searching if targeting optimal trajectories.  In this coarse-grained approximation, paths through graphs model trajectories of the dynamical system. Local feedback control and small parameter variations are used to realize paths through the graph as true trajectories.  Questions under study are closely related to Ulam's method in the theory of Frobenius-Perron operators and also to the concept of partition in information theory and in symbolic dynamics.<br/><br/>This project develops techniques for targeting, finding optimal trajectories, and highlighting desirable states.  Potential engineering applications include Navy ship-to-ship transfer by cargo crane, space mission design, design of electronic circuits that stay within desirable operating regimes, and perhaps someday preemptive control of epileptic seizures.   The work involves collaboration with experimentalists to pursue real world applications.  In addition, the project investigates applications of controlling symbolic dynamics to encode information in chaotic oscillations.<br/><br/>"

Unfortunately, quantization is not a straightforward proposition, as evidenced by the discovery, over fifty years ago, by Groenewold and Van Hove of an ""obstruction"" to quantization.  Their ""no-go theorem"" asserts that in principle it is impossible to consistently quantize every classical observable on a Euclidean phase space, regardless of which quantization procedure is employed.  Similar results hold under a wide variety of circumstances.  But no-go theorems are not universal; the principal investigator and collaborators have recently constructed examples of phase spaces which admit consistent full quantizations. The goals of this project are to delineate the circumstances under which such obstructions will appear and to study the underlying mechanisms that produce them.  Another problem, when an obstruction does exist, is to determine the maximal subalgebras of observables that can be consistently quantized.  Solutions to these problems will be used to refine extant quantization procedures, or design new ones, to adapt to the obstruction and quantize these maximal subalgebras.  From a mathematical standpoint, this research will lead to structural insights into the Poisson algebras of classical systems and their representations.

Oscar Bruno and Fernando Reitich recently proposed a new class of perturbation methods for approximating solutions of BVP and FBP which are based on the ideas of classical perturbation theory applied to domains which are small deviations from exactly solvable geometries.  These methods are interesting because they are fast, easy to implement, and translate into three and higher dimensions without major modification.  Of course, such schemes are limited by the extent of their domain of convergence, which may be quite small, and the fact that in many BVP and FBP of interest, the domain is a large perturbation of a simple geometry.  This obstacle has been effectively overcome in recent work of Bruno & Reitich in the setting of acoustic and electromagnetic scattering via the introduction of analytic continuation techniques, in particular the use of Pade approximants.  A second challenge faced by the current class of perturbative methods is that they suffer from problems of numerical ill-conditioning due to subtle cancellations which take place in their evaluation.  This drawback has been overcome by the PI & Reitich, for the problem of computing Dirichlet-Neumann operators (DNO) for Laplace's equation, via a straightforward change of variables which simply flattens the domain.  The PI proposes to extend the above results by developing a general purpose perturbative method for solving BVP and FBP which incorporates<br/>both analytic continuation and domain flattening techniques.  To date, the techniques have only been applied independently to BVP.  The first objective is to first implement them simultaneously for the BVP of computing DNO (for Laplace's equation), and then extend these methods to the case of a genuine FBP (modeling the motion of the interface of an ideal fluid) dimensions.  An investigation of the effects of bottom topography and multiple fluid layers on the methods will follow, and considerations will be made of other classical FBP (e.g. Hele-Shaw flows, Stefan problems, etc.) whose geometries will pose their own challenges.  Subsequently a thorough re-investigation of the problems of electromagnetic and acoustic scattering will be completed with domain flattening techniques implemented to overcome numerical ill-conditioning problems.  Finally, the problem of implementing transparent boundary conditions in scattering problems via DNO will be considered.<br/><br/>Many important scientific problems are defined on complicated domains that may or may not evolve in time.  These problems, such as the scattering of electromagnetic radiation from a rough surface or the evolution of surface waves on a fluid, pose severe theoretical and computational difficulties for applied mathematicians and engineers. When the domain of the problem is simple (rectangular, circular, etc.) the problem can usually be solved explicitly by classical methods.  One approach to the estimation of more general problems is to first consider domains which are small deviations from simple geometries.  Many approaches along these lines have been proposed, but unless great care is taken, they can result in approximations that actually degrade as the approximation is refined.  A new technique, developed by the PI & Fernando Reitich, avoids such difficulties and provides an exciting new method for the estimation of problems on complicated geometries.  However, challenges still remain and these are the subject of this proposal.  One challenge is to extend our new methods for small domain deviations to problems which are large deviations from a simple geometry.  Another challenge is the fast and efficient implementation of these new methods on high performance serial and parallel computers.<br/>"

Work will continue on characterization of the (effective) boundary layer behavior encountered in composite materials; the focus will first be on polygonal domains with irrational slopes, but it is expected that the techniques developed there will ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of boundary layers for arbitrary domains.  Another important activity will be the study of the qualitative and quantitative behavior of stresses in (laminated or fiber-reinforced) composites with extremely close interfaces. <br/><br/>One goal of this research is to significantly increase the effectiveness of electric and electromagnetic imaging techniques by incorporating into the mathematical algorithms information about the behavior of the associated fields in the presence of various defects and inhomogeneities.

The use of mathematical models offers a<br/>cost-effective way to make quantitative predictions about how mechanical<br/>systems will change when external forces are applied and serves as an<br/>alternative to the use of costly or difficult experiments.  Typically, when<br/>realistic mathematical models are formulated, they are in terms of equations<br/>whose solutions, which represent physical quantities of interest to engineers<br/>and scientists, are not able to be determined analytically, i.e., in a simple<br/>form one can easily write down.

In particular, the proposed methods of minimax control design are largely motivated by applications to environmental systems. The proposed study of variational stability for optimization problems with equilibrium constraints is motivated by applications to practical problems of material design in continuum mechanics.

They include the epitaxial growth of semiconductor<br/>thin films, microstructural evolution of elastically stressed solids, and<br/>macroscopic properties of martensitic microstructures. The proposer will<br/>first continue and extend his work initiated during his participation in<br/>a DARPA/NSF VIP project to develop and improve continuum models for the<br/>epitaxial growth of thin films. In particular, he will carefully examine the<br/>effect of edge diffusion and kink convection as well as that of crystalline<br/>asymmetry and anisotropy to the thin film morphology and growth scaling laws.<br/>He will then develop hybrid numerical techniques that incorporate finite<br/>element methods and multigrid algorithms into level set formulations to<br/>simulate the three-dimensional evolution of stressed microstructures. He<br/>will finally expand his previous research to further investigate complex<br/>martensitic microstructures with an emphasis on the effect of applied stress<br/>to their formation, evolution, and stability.<br/><br/>The design of innovative, intelligent, and high quality materials such as<br/>those to be studied in this project is essential to the advance of modern<br/>technologies. The success in such design demands greatly a deep understanding<br/>of the fundamental principles and basic mechanisms of the underlying physical<br/>processes and material behaviors. It is therefore the goal of this research<br/>to systematically develop rational scientific concepts and novel research<br/>techniques to accomplish such an understanding. The fulfillment of such a<br/>goal will potentially provide experimentalists with detailed information on<br/>controllable physical data, making possible the development of new and improved<br/>materials for applications in many modern technologies and industrials ranging<br/>from communication to aerospace to medicine. Highlighted by its nature of<br/>scientific integrity, on the other hand, this project will naturally foster<br/>and promote an interdisciplinary research that involves materials science,<br/>physics, applied mathematics, and high-performance computing.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>"

The mathematics of wave dynamics is also unexpectedly important for prograss concerning a fundamental problem in materials science. To understand how  an alloy's microscopic structure coarsens in time, the investigator is developing a new mathematical understanding of wave-like transport for singular mass distributions.<br/><br/>This work seeks to explain mathematically a number of poorly understood characteristics of waves of various kinds, surface waves on fluids being a prime example. Such characteristics include: the extraordinary stability of solitons (waves that persist in isolation); the tsunami-like qualities of wakes produced in certain conditions by modern fast car ferries; and the nature of the powerful forces created when waves focus and break simultaneously. The common thread that runs through these investigations is the effective understanding of physical phenomena through the development of new mathematical methods for analyzing dynamic change."

Recent research in the<br/>area known as ecological stoichiometry has highlighted the<br/>ecological importance of the relative abundance of chemical<br/>constituents, known to vary considerably among species and across<br/>trophic levels.  However, most theoeretical studies in ecology<br/>have until very recently ignored the sources and consequences of<br/>this chemical heterogeneity.  The investigator and his colleagues<br/>undertake theoretical investigations of ecological stoichiometry.<br/>They develop a relatively new theoretical framework for<br/>ecological dynamics that explicitly incorporates stoichiometric<br/>constraints.  This base model involves a stoichiometric<br/>counterpart of the familiar Rosenzweig-MacArthur equations in<br/>which the effective carrying capacity of the resource species and<br/>the transfer efficiency of the consumer species are constrained<br/>by stoichiometric principles.  Introduction of stoichiometric<br/>considerations in these equations (here, akin to ""food quality"")<br/>allows for a rich array of ecologically realistic dynamics,<br/>including deterministic extinction of the consumer species when<br/>resources are abundant but of poor quality.  They expand this<br/>model in five different directions, to explore ecological<br/>realities (i.e., complications) whose consideration has proved<br/>illuminating in other, non-stoichiometric settings.  Specifically,<br/>they analyze the dynamics of 1) a multi-nutrient model; 2)<br/>trophically complex models in which multiple consumer species<br/>share a resource; 3) time delays in nutrient recycling that are a<br/>realistic component of terrestrial ecosystems; 4) two patch<br/>models featuring habitat heterogeneity and dispersal of the<br/>consumer; and 5) age structured models in which juvenile and<br/>adult consumers differ in their nutrient requirements.  The<br/>project aims to provide an analytically rigorous foundation for<br/>burgeoning empirical research into ecological stoichiometry.<br/>     All living things, including humans, are constructed of<br/>approximately the same set of basic building blocks, chemical<br/>elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and<br/>several dozen more in smaller amounts.  However, different<br/>organisms contain different proportions of these key elements in<br/>their biomass and thus must extract these elements from their<br/>environment to differing degrees.  In many situations, the<br/>environment does not provide these key nutrient elements in the<br/>abundance and proportions that are optimal for organism growth<br/>and reproduction.  Thus, the chemical environment of life may set<br/>limits on the success of organisms in various situations.  In this<br/>project the investigators use mathematical models to simulate the<br/>flow of multiple chemical elements in natural food webs to better<br/>understand how the requirements of living things for multiple<br/>chemical elements establish key feedbacks between the living and<br/>non-living world.  This work is important for two reasons.  First,<br/>it may provide a better fundamental understanding of how chemical<br/>elements move through food webs.  Second, improved fundamental<br/>knowledge of how nutrients move in the environment and how to<br/>simulate those movements with mathematical tools may help predict<br/>and manage natural and human-dominated ecosystems, including<br/>those affected by nutrient inputs from human activities (e.g.  N<br/>and P inputs from fertilizer, sewage) or by global change (e.g.<br/>effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide on C and nutrient<br/>flow in the environment).<br/>"

Geometrically, the <br/>chronological product encodes the interaction of the components of <br/>controlled nonlinear dynamics.  Algebraically it is the fundamental <br/>structure that underlies effective series expansion and formal solution <br/>algorithms. Areas of special focus are interconnections of systems, and <br/>systems that exhibit full nonlinear dependence on the control. In either <br/>case, specific objectives are to develop normal forms and to find effective <br/>series (or product) representations (using tools from algebraic <br/>combinatorics). Possible applications include algorithms for path <br/>planning, feedback stabilization, optimal control and even numerical <br/>integration. A complementary second thread develops interactive <br/>visualization tools for research (simulation and experimentation) and for <br/>communication. This research is motivated and driven by the desire to <br/>understand the fundamental, common principles that govern the <br/>interactions of dynamical systems on any scale, from molecular levels to <br/>astronomical dimensions. The diversity of possible outcomes is a <br/>consequence of nonlinear effects that permeate our environment: When <br/>combining two subsystems, the result is generally different from just the <br/>sum of the parts.<br/><br/>This research focuses on further developing the algebra which captures <br/>such nonlinear interaction, where the effect of a+b is more than just the <br/>sum of the effects of a and b. The chronological algebra provides the <br/>formal language to model such interactions where even the order in which <br/>pieces are put together matters, where a*b is generally different from b*a. <br/>The control perspective is distinguished from the basic study of dynamical <br/>systems as it aims beyond just descriptive understanding: The objective of <br/>control theory is to exploit the subtle nature of the interactions in order to <br/>shape complex systems -- often via only minute interference with how the <br/>parts interact. While this mathematical research applies to virtually any <br/>kind of dynamical system, including even social, medical and financial <br/>environments, this project will focus on mechanical systems (like large <br/>satellites with several moving parts) in efforts to demonstrate the general <br/>principles. An important component of this project is the development of <br/>interactive visualization tools. These are used for research, and for <br/>communicating the geometry of the nonlinear interactions, to demonstrate <br/>how the profound understanding of the fundamental mathematical <br/>structures leads to effective means of controlling complex systems. This <br/>visualization effort also provides a rich environment for undergraduate <br/>students to connect with advanced theoretical research. It may prove to be <br/>an effective means to expand the pipeline bringing new talents into <br/>mathematical research.<br/>"

In particular to study core stability for <br/>combinatorial games such as assignment games. <br/>In coalitional bargaining we will look for subgame <br/>perfect stationary Nash equilibria of perfect <br/>information games which approximate in its payoff <br/>the nucleolus payoff.  In the area of dynamic games, <br/>we would like to extend the policy improvement <br/>algorithm for  undiscounted stochastic games <br/>of perfect information. We would formulate models <br/>of tax evasion as dynamic games and study their <br/>equilibria.<br/><br/>The  problems in cooperative games posed above <br/>are physically motivated by the following questions. <br/>Federal and state governments undertake costly construction <br/>facilities like bridges, freeways,  water and sewer pipes,  <br/>railroads and airports.  Often   the critical  decision <br/>facing the government is to distribute the total cost <br/>among the users in an equitable way.  The algorithms to <br/>be developed will help to arrive at such equitable costs <br/>after properly modeling the problems as cooperative games.  <br/>Tax offices are flooded with tax returns;  Indutrial <br/>corporations are flooded with  vouchers for payment <br/>approval; automobile manufacturers are supplied with large <br/>consignment of automobile parts for quick acceptance. <br/>Auditors are few in number to audit all tax returns; <br/>accountants are few to check all vouchers; laborataries <br/>and manpower are limited to test for all defective items.  <br/>One can classify the tax returns or vouchers or suppliers <br/>into various categories and make decisions on which items <br/>in the tax return or voucher to audit; what percent of <br/>defective items in a sample require acceptance or more <br/>testing. Depending on the outcome of auditing, or sequential <br/>sampling one can  make new decisions on  how frequently <br/>one should audit the future returns and vouchers from <br/>the specific class of violators.  In polluting the <br/>environment, the violators are often big manufacturers. <br/>If the pollutants are distinct, then polluters are some <br/>what identifiable and the cost of cleaning can be <br/>decentralized. If the pollutants are of a few type, then <br/>one knows roughly which  groups of polluters could have <br/>contributed to which type. The levels of violation would <br/>require sporadic or systematic inspection.  In a way <br/>the total cost has to be collected by suitable taxing <br/>policies that could vary depending on the levels of <br/>pollution. For an ordinary home owner sewer charges are <br/>simply tied to the water usage.  When the polluters are <br/>confounded one has to identify polluters by sending  <br/>inspectors now and then to make spot check for <br/>environmental violations and punish violators by <br/>various penalties.  In such problems the algorithms <br/>to be developed will show the formal ways of arriving at <br/>cost figures or inspection strategies that are both <br/>intuitively and scientifically defendable. <br/>"

The purpose of this interdisciplinary conference<br/>is to bring together researchers from interacting areas of Materials<br/>Science.  In particular special focus will be paid to the latest scientific<br/>and industrial developments concerning homogenization theory and methods.<br/>Homogenization is a powerful mathematical tool for solving, both static (effective<br/>properties) and dynamic (wave propagation, transport equations) problems in<br/>inhomogeneous materials with periodic and random microstructure. This<br/>includes prediction of mechanical and dielectrical properties of<br/>composites, shape memory materials,  materials undergoing phase<br/>transitions, and polymeric composites. Solutions of these problems provide<br/>guidance in the design of new materials possessing the specific properties <br/>required by modern technological needs. The conference shall address both <br/>modeling and computational aspects of these problems. This conference will bring<br/>together the leading scientists from Europe and the U.S. who are working on<br/>homogenization problems and applications in materials science.<br/><br/>Modern electronic and mechanical devices require materials with specific<br/>properties in their design.  For example, the automotive industry seeks<br/>lightweight yet very strong materials.  Such materials do not necessarily<br/>occur naturally.  Hence, these materials must be engineered from existing<br/>resources.  One approach is to form a composite material.  A composite<br/>material is made from a blend of other materials.  Fundamental questions in<br/>the design of composites are (1) what materials should be used to form the<br/>composite, (2) how much of each material should be used in the composite,<br/>and (3) how should the materials be combined to form the composite?  In the<br/>latter case the geometric patterns of the combined materials (think of<br/>plywood) play an important role.  Materials scientists and engineers try to<br/>answer the above keeping in mind the specific properties required from the<br/>resulting composite.  Practical experience and trial and error approaches<br/>are common means of obtaining answers.  Within the past two decades many<br/>new tools have been developed by the applied mathematics community to help<br/>answer these questions.  These tools fall under the heading of what is<br/>called homogenization theory.   One reason for holding this conference will<br/>be to highlight the use of these new tools.  A second purpose of the<br/>proposed conference will be to highlight the formulation and solution of<br/>new homogenization problems arising in materials design.  For example, one<br/>area that may further benefit from the utilization of homogenization tools<br/>is polymer-based composites.  Hence, the conference should help answer two<br/>questions: (1) what should be the future directions in homogenization<br/>theory based upon the current needs of modern technology (in short, which<br/>problems should be solved), and (2) what is the best way of utilizing newly<br/>developed mathematical tools to solve these problems in order to enhance<br/>the use of homogenization methods in materials design?  These questions<br/>will be answered through both speaker presentations and a panel discussion,<br/>which will summarize the current state of the subject and future trends.<br/><br/>"

Particular emphasis is placed on understanding the structure of defects in these systems, especially in the singular limit as some regularization is removed.  For this project the particular model under consideration is the regularized Cross-Newell phase diffusion equation.  This equation has a free energy similar to two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau free energy except that variation is restricted to the domain of gradient vector fields.  Associated defect structures are typically one-dimensional rather than being point defects. This project explores four research problems related to this interesting model.  The first concerns generalizing the model to incorporate variations over director fields (unoriented analogues of vector fields).  This extension may have important consequences for understanding the emergence of labyrinthine patterns far from threshold.  The second project involves refining the technique of self-dual reduction (a novel method to determine natural candidates for asymptotic minimizers of the free energy) to incorporate general boundary conditions as well as general geometries.  The third project will extend the model to three or more dimensions. Potential applications would be to modeling filamentary collapse, seen in some recent experimental studies of bacterial colonies.  The final project will be to undertake a study of the validity of the phase equation within a model pattern-forming microscopic system.<br/>  <br/>Patterns with almost periodic structure are ubiquitous.  One sees them in nature as sand ripples, as tiger stripes, as fingerprints and in atmospheric and geological formations.  In the laboratory, they are seen in experiments on optical beams, on convection, on flame fronts, as labyrinths on magnetic films, as textured Faraday waves.  The striking similarity between pattern textures arising in very different microscopic contexts, not only in planform (striped, hexagonal) but also in defect structures, suggests that patterns are macroscopic objects with universal features depending only on common symmetries shared by different microscopic situations.  Finding macroscopic descriptions which unify and simplify our understanding of pattern behavior wherever it occurs is the principal objective motivating this research.<br/>"

While there has been much progress along these lines for two degree-of-freedom systems, there has been little progress of a similar nature for systems with three or more degrees-of-freedom.  The geometrical point of view of dynamical systems theory offers a framework for discovering the types of higher dimensional phase space structures that govern reaction rates and energy flow in molecules.  We will apply this approach to several problems: three dimensional Rydberg atoms in crossed electric and magnetic fields, the London-Eyring-Polanti-Sato potential, rotation-vibration interaction in formaldehyde, and a study of energy flow through resonances in carbonyl sulphide (OCS).  In each case we will show that there are higher dimensional phase space structures that act as a ""transition state.""  Indeed, it may even be possible to generalize the very useful idea of a periodic orbit dividing surface to systems with three or more degrees of freedom. Our research will also focus on developing computational approaches to realize these geometric structures in these specific problems. We will also develop a wavelet-based frequency map analysis tool for studying energy flow in resonances. This work will be carried out in collaboration with chemists and physicists, as well as computational scientists.<br/><br/>This project investigates fundamental questions concerning chemical reactions.  The underlying mathematical questions involve the nonlinear dynamical foundations of transition state theory in systems with three or more degrees of freedom.  This is the fundamental theory that allows predictions concerning chemical reaction dynamics.  While there is a fairly complete understanding of this theory for simple, low dimensional, systems, there is as yet no analogous theoretical framework for more physically realistic high dimensional systems.  Such a theory will involve mathematical description of surfaces in dimensions larger than four and will require development of computational tools for realizing and visualizing such surfaces.  This will result in a detailed understanding of the dynamics of how molecules break up and of how atoms combine to form molecules.  The research is interdisciplinary, involving the collaboration of chemists, physicists, and computational scientists.<br/><br/>"

Interest centers on problems exhibiting complex spatio-temporal dynamics in gaseous combustion as well as in solid fuel combustion and in heterogeneous <br/>combustion (solid plus gas), which arise in the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis process for advanced materials. The goal of the research is to describe transitions to, and the structure of, complex solution behavior.  The project addresses gaseous combustion problems in the areas of flames with sequential reactions and flames in gas filled tubes.  These systems exhibit transitions to states with greater degrees of spatio-temporal complexity as parameters are varied.  The project also analyzes problems in solid fuel combustion, in which high temperature combustion waves, referred to as solid flames, are used to synthesize advanced materials. Research centers on the areas of solid flames and filtration combustion, which involves heterogeneous combustion, with reaction between gas and solid phases. The analytical studies are based on bifurcation and nonlinear stability theories, which employ asymptotic analysis and singular perturbation theory in the neighborhood of bifurcation or other transition points to yield a local description of the solution.  An adaptive pseudo-spectral method is employed for large scale scientific computations, with which the local description is globally extended.  The solutions exhibit layers, localized regions in which the solution varies rapidly.  The adaptive pseudo-spectral method successfully meets the challenge of accurately and efficiently resolving such layer type behavior. <br/><br/>This project is concerned with understanding processes that occur in energy conversion and materials synthesis, two areas of national importance.  The research in energy conversion is focused on flame structure and dynamics, which involve interactions among many physical mechanisms. To determine cause and effect relations among the various mechanisms, this work explores parameter dependencies.  The research in materials synthesis studies the use of combustion waves to produce materials having desired properties, for example, extreme hardness or imperviousness to temperature extremes. In this innovative technological process, which appears to enjoy advantages over conventional technology, the combustion wave propagates through the sample, converting an unreacted solid powder mixture to solid product.

This project is concerned with the numerical solution of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of constrained systems in mechanics.  The model equations of numerous problems in mechanics take the form of DAEs, not of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  The numerical integration of these DAEs is notoriously difficult, mainly due to the presence of geometrical and/or kinematic constraints.  The main research and development objectives of this project are to develop, analyze, implement, and apply numerical methods and techniques related to the numerical integration of these DAEs.  The methods proposed, which are based on Runge-Kutta type methods, make great use of the structure of the DAEs considered and they are perfectly fitted to preserve their <br/>underlying properties.  Several applications in the following areas will be considered: rigid and flexible multibody dynamics; flight formation of multiple coordinated spacecraft; classical molecular dynamics.  The educational and research aspects of this project are intertwined. Graduate students will write their M.Sc. or Ph.D. thesis as part of the project.  They will spend part of their time with partners in industry and in research laboratories/centers.

They are all examples of systems in mechanics (a branch of physics) whose motion can be mathematically modeled by certain sets of equations called ""differential-algebraic equations"".  Being able to simulate these systems on a computer can have various impacts depending on the applications considered. Vehicle-system simulation can help improve research in vehicle safety and vehicle development.  Mechanical system simulation software enables users to relatively quickly analyze multiple design variations, thereby reducing the number of costly physical prototypes, improving the quality of the design, and reducing product development time.  The concept of having multiple coordinated spacecraft has been identified as an enabling technology for many of the NASA's 21st century missions. The accurate simulation of coordinated spacecraft before they are actually sent can help reduce the risk of mission failure. Understanding the mechanics of DNA, which is at the heart of life, can have some fundamental potential medical benefits.  Understanding the collision dynamics of molecules can help to delineate the parameters that are important in the energy transfer process, so that unwanted byproducts and pollutants in chemical reactions can be reduced.

This type of control naturally<br/>appears in the problems in which there is no natural<br/>restriction on the rates of control and  as a result<br/>the  optimal control rate is infinite. The optimal<br/>policy in these types of problems is to reflect the<br/>process from an a priori unknown boundary.  Such type<br/>of action also arises in problems with additive control,<br/>as an approximation for a ""bang-bang"" optimal policy.<br/>The proposed research consists of developing the theory<br/>of the related Partial Differential Equations with gradient<br/>constraints, studying optimal reflecting barriers and<br/>optimal policies in one dimensional and multidimensional<br/>cases.  Applications include stochastic control models<br/>of flexible manufacturing systems as well as dividend<br/>optimization and  multidimensional portfolio optimization<br/>models.

While perceived by<br/>many nonspecialists as a tool for making a fast profit,<br/>mathematical finance in fact is a ""technology"" for risk<br/>reduction. In this regard its merge with insurance is only<br/>too natural.

The first <br/>two of these models (1-dimensional and 2-dimensional respectively) have <br/>been developed in the Flight Systems Research Center (FSRC) at UCLA <br/>in collaboration with NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, <br/>CA. The designing of the 3-dimensional model is in progress. Among the <br/>wing models existing in the extensive modern literature on aeroelasticity, <br/>the aforementioned ones are most physically complete. In November <br/>1999, the 1-dimensional model was tested in a series of four flight <br/>experiments at Edwards Airforce Base, CA. The experimental results are <br/>in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of the model at <br/>least for low - energy aeroelastic modes. Currently, the collaboration is <br/>supported by NSF Grant DMS-9972748 (Interdisciplinary Grants in the <br/>Mathematical Sciences). This grant provides the support for a one year <br/>visit (Fall 1999 - Spring 2000) of the principal investigator to the Center in <br/>order to study in depth the engineering and physical principles of aircraft <br/>wing modeling and to continue work on the joint project with the <br/>researchers of the Center. During recent years, the investigator's research <br/>has been focused on two main directions: (a) spectral and asymptotic <br/>analysis of non-self-adjoint operators in a Hilbert space, operators which <br/>are the dynamics generators of hyperbolic equations and systems <br/>containing damping terms and subject to dissipative boundary conditions; <br/>(b) applications of the results of this analysis to the control of distributed <br/>parameter systems governed by those equations and systems. The series of <br/>results and methods, developed in this research, has now culminated in the <br/>work on the aforementioned 1-dimensional model of a vibrating aircraft <br/>wing. Substantial progress has been made: the PI was able to obtain first in <br/>the literature explicit asymptotic formulas for the high-frequency <br/>aeroelastic modes and mode shapes. The objectives of this project include: <br/>(a) obtaining space-time domain representations for the solutions of the 1-<br/>dimensional model; (b) obtaining spectral asymptotics and representations <br/>for the solutions of most recent 2-dimensional model; (c) applying <br/>asymptotic and spectral results to the flutter suppression problem; (d) <br/>participating in the designing of a 3-dimensional model of a wing and <br/>extending the above analysis to this model.<br/><br/>The present project can be considered as a theoretical part of the broad <br/>wing modeling project conducted by the researchers at the aforementioned <br/>Centers. The ultimate goal of the entire project is to give specific practical <br/>recommendations to aircraft industry engineers working on flutter <br/>suppression in aircraft wings and tails. Flutter is a dynamic instability <br/>occurring in an aircraft in flight at a specific speed which is called a flutter <br/>speed. Damage inflicted by flutter results in significant cost to the aircraft <br/>industry. The objective of this project is to carry out a rigorous <br/>mathematical analysis of the aircraft wing model and to apply the results <br/>of this analysis to the problem of flutter control. It has been recognized in <br/>the engineering community that the results of such an analysis can provide <br/>new insights which are not available from experiments or from numerical <br/>simulations.

Several extant and future technologies call for the <br/>control of quantum systems - semiconductor heterostructures, <br/>spectroscopy, atomic lasers, quantum information processing, control of <br/>molecular dynamics, to name a few. Many of these problems can, after <br/>judicious modeling and optimization, be recast as the problem of <br/>preparing desired unitary generators, via an external control acting on a <br/>quantum system. This leads quickly to the problem of path planning for <br/>systems with drift on Lie groups, via controls that are constrained. Path <br/>planning for systems with drift, with few and constrained inputs, has not <br/>hitherto been studied. The only other alternatives for the control of <br/>quantum systems are computationally expensive optimization, and <br/>tracking which relies heavily on intuition. In this project the role of <br/>intuition and optimization will be limited to reformulating a given physical <br/>objective as state preparation for a quantum system. The latter problem <br/>will be attacked by developing structured factorization of unitary matrices, <br/>the structure being determined by the constraints. The resulting control <br/>design will be compared with other techniques such as inversion and <br/>optimal control.  Applications to lasing without inversion, molecular <br/>control, quantum computing and information will be then carried out. <br/>Related issues, such as tractable descriptions of reachable sets of quantum <br/>systems, will also be studied. The second part of the project stems from <br/>the fact that the extant non-linear control schemes are rarely directly <br/>applicable in singular situations such as a varying rank decoupling matrix <br/>and a change in relative degree. Tools from singularity theory, the theory <br/>of foliations, nonsmooth analysis and Lie groups will be developed to <br/>address this problem. A key feature will be the use of differential forms <br/>instead of vector fields for studying such issues. This should also have <br/>payoffs for singular exterior differential systems. Applications to <br/>techniques such as the method of intermediate integrals for partial <br/>differential equations and equations that change type will be studied from <br/>this vantage point. It is worth remarking that both components of the <br/>project call for similar mathematics.<br/><br/>Successful completion of this project should yield benefits for several <br/>current and future technologies. For instance, the fabrication of a quantum <br/>computer calls for solutions to precisely the type of problems being <br/>studied in the project. Similarly, obtaining a snapshot of chemical <br/>reactions at the molecular level also requires the control of quantum <br/>processes. Active control of quantum phenomena would also lead to the <br/>control of chemical reactions via tuned lasers. This should enhance <br/>product specificity in chemical reactions, thereby minimizing the presence <br/>of products that are not desired. The control of quantum phenomena is still <br/>in its infancy. The project aims to move it along further by linking it <br/>concretely to traditional control theory. Conversely, the results of the <br/>project should shed light on the control of macroworld systems. This will <br/>also have benefits for traditional technologies such as robotics, consumer <br/>electronics and electrical networks, since the underlying mathematics is <br/>quite similar. From a didactic point of view, the project's contribution will <br/>be to show to undergraduates and graduate students alike that advanced <br/>mathematics is not an arid field, but is in fact a lively process with <br/>palpable connections to real life situations. This should enhance the <br/>likelihood of students, especially from under represented groups, to pursue <br/>higher education in mathematics, science and technology.<br/>"

Such defects <br/>are fundamental structures since steps--as sinks and sources for atoms--<br/>influence mass transport at surfaces and therefore influence fundamental <br/>multidimensional surface processes such as nucleation and growth, facet <br/>formation and thermal roughening in crystals and their applications. <br/>Consequently these defects have been studied since the 1950's and fairly <br/>successful macroscopic models to describe behavior in most materials <br/>have been developed. These models express the energy of an isothermally <br/>wandering step as the integral of the (generally orientation dependent) step <br/>energy per unit length. However in the limit of vanishing step free energy, <br/>new physics [e.g. higher-order elastic interactions and step-to-step <br/>interactions] enters the picture. These higher-order effects can lead to the <br/>spontaneous development of highly periodic step structures. Such novel <br/>step morphologies are members of an increasingly important class of self-<br/>organizing systems: systems that spontaneously form atomic scale <br/>periodic patterns.  A recent (1997) pathbreaking experiment on Boron-<br/>doped Silicon in which the isothermal wanderings in question, contrary to <br/>the simple models cited, are periodic and increase with a decrease of the <br/>steady state temperature in an interval presents a significant challenge to <br/>the development of appropriate macroscopic models for this branch of <br/>crystal theory. It reveals that there is a major gap in the current technical <br/>understanding of defects in crystals of this nature, since detailed analysis <br/>of the dynamics of these fluctuating step edges is incompatible with <br/>current theories of step energetics.  Resolving this issue is important for <br/>near term attainment of non-routine applications involving crystals with <br/>small step free energy, since it has direct impact on understanding the <br/>atomic-scale structures they develop. In turn, this understanding is needed <br/>for the development of materials with uniformly closely spaced and nearly <br/>congruent self-organized [quantum dot] defects--such self-organizing <br/>materials being crucial to the development of monochromatic lasers and <br/>quantum wires, for example, as device scales shrink. The goal of that part <br/>of the present proposal involving orthodox materials is focussed on <br/>clarifying an as yet unresolved issue in the theory of nonlinearly elastic <br/>materials.  Equilibria for such materials subjected to specified boundary <br/>displacements correspond to deformations which minimize a stored energy <br/>integral whose integrand associates to each deformation a nonnegative real <br/>valued function.  Such stored energy integrands are subject to various <br/>constraints in order to correctly represent possible physical materials.  In <br/>the last decade a previously unnoticed issue has been raised. Namely in <br/>view of a little known one-dimensional variational phenomenon <br/>(originally established in 1926) that for certain variational integrands the <br/>minimizing functions can differ depending on the smoothness of the class <br/>of deformations under consideration -- even though the smoother class of <br/>functions is dense in the larger class. In fact there can be a nonzero <br/>difference between the infima of the integrals associated with such classes <br/>[Lavrentiev's gap phenomenon].  A corresponding gap between classes of <br/>continuous deformations in three dimensional nonlinear elasticity would <br/>imply that the global equilibrium deformation in the larger class would be <br/>energy minimizing and more singular than the energy minimizing global <br/>deformation in the smaller class--whereby structures devised on the basis <br/>of the less singular deformations could develop flaws [fractures], contrary <br/>to the evidence provided by calculations based on standard methods. <br/><br/>To summarize, the PI proposes in the case of the unorthodox type of <br/>crystalline material exemplified by Boron doped Silicon to devise <br/>variational models that will shed light on the entirely nonstandard physical <br/>behavior of such materials.  Such models will involve devising what are <br/>known as Landau-de Gennes type order parameter terms for the free <br/>energy of such materials to reflect the particularly delicate atomic <br/>interactions governing the nanatomic structure of such crystals. On the <br/>other hand, in the case of orthodox materials the PI intends to clarify <br/>whether in the well-established theory of nonlinear elasticity there can <br/>occur materials which for certain classes of boundary conditions can <br/>exhibit an energy gap between the minimum energy on one class of <br/>continuous smooth deformations and the minimum energy on a smaller <br/>class.  The occurrence of such an energy gap could lead to cases in which <br/>structures devised on the basis of computations associated with the smaller <br/>class could develop flaws because the actual energy minimizing <br/>deformation is more singular than the computations suggest.<br/>"

Its function is to capture the interactions of the<br/>system at finer scales with interactions or influences from larger coarser<br/>scales, and the mesoscale level itself.  Such systems, active across<br/>disparate length and time scales, are inherently metastable.  This feature<br/>is often revealed by hysteretic behavior or by a reluctance to evolve<br/>quickly to equilibrium.  The focus in this proposal is on several<br/>prototypes of these systems that occur in materials sceince.  One is <br/>the role of interfaces, or grain boundaries, in determining or limiting the <br/>behavior of polycrystalline materials. The energy and mobility of grain <br/>boundaries depends on crystallography and geometry, according to <br/>established thermodynamic principles.  Innovative new ways to determine <br/>these functions explicitly for important materials are the objective of the <br/>Mesoscale Interface Mapping Project.  This involves developing automated <br/>microscopy to harvest large amounts of data from samples and then <br/>formulating and solving a complex inverse problem.  One way to approach <br/>determination of mobility consists in the development of large scale <br/>simulations of grain boundary evolution.  The second focus is the <br/>coarse grained descriptions of mesoscale systems, the functional analytic <br/>limit processes in the microstructure of solids or the averaging to distribution <br/>functions in systems with stochastic behavior. The new methods allow <br/>study of situations where kinetics arise directly in terms of thermodynamic <br/>state functions and naturally carry with them an appropriate topology.  <br/>The issue of metastability has been under investigation in this context.  <br/>There is now the opportunity to improve understanding, for example, <br/>of microstructural evolution in shape-memory materials and diffusion <br/>mediated transport in certain liquid crystal systems and in protein motors.  <br/>This will include diagnostics for these systems.<br/><br/><br/>The challenge of the mesoscale in materials science is to understand how <br/>it constrains finer scale systems (at the molecular scale) and determines <br/>larger scale systems (at the scale of entire devices).  This is accomplished<br/>through coarse graining procedures.  For example, many technologically<br/>useful materials are polycrystalline, or granular, in nature.  The aluminum<br/>skin of an aircraft and the copper or copper-aluminum interconnects in<br/>computer chips are but two examples at vastly different size scales of such<br/>granular materials.  It is widely understood that many aspects of these<br/>materials depend on the interfaces they contain, or their grain boundaries.<br/>Properties of grain boundaries determine the reliability as well as the <br/>mechanical strength. This project will exploit the exciting opportunities and <br/>challenges for mathematical science in this field and beyond.  Specifically, <br/>coarse graining methods will be developed in order to better understand <br/>phenomena that occur in protein motors and in liquid crystals.  A related <br/>problem of coarse graining arises when information is to be extracted from <br/>the immense amounts of data that can be produced with simulations of<br/>complex systems, such as polycrystalline materials. This problem of coarse <br/>graining at an information scale rather than a physical scale will also be addressed <br/>in this project.<br/>"

The approach will be based on the relative entropy method and certain extension of large deviation theory to the quantum case.  The second part of the project concerns the dynamics of an electron interacting with a lattice structure, modeled by a phonon field.

Finally, assess the domain of validity of radiative transfer by setting up suitable inverse problems that allow determination of statistical<br/>parameters characterizing the underlying medium from boundary measurements.<br/><br/>A major recent success of radiative transport theory is the modeling of the propagation of seismic waves in the earth's crust.  Numerical study of seismic wave propagation over hundreds of kilometers remains prohibitive with a microscopic model, but simulations are now accessible<br/>using radiative transfer theory and suitable statistical methods.  Results promise to yield better understanding and prediction of earthquakes.  Another application of radiative transport and its diffusion approximation is near-infrared spectroscopy.  This novel method is increasingly<br/>used in medical imaging for monitoring properties of human tissues. Numerical simulation of forward and inverse transport problems remains an active field of research. The project provides the mathematical and numerical analysis to address these issues.<br/>"

Schur-class functions arise as the characteristic function for a <br/>contraction operator in the operator-model theory of Livsic-Brodskii, Sz.-<br/>Nagy-Foias and de Branges-Rovnyak, as the transfer function of a unitary <br/>colligation (or energy-conserving discrete-time, input-state-output linear <br/>system), and as the scattering function of a discrete-time scattering system <br/>in the sense of Lax-Phillips and Adamjan-Arov.  A major theme of the <br/>project is to develop this same confluence of ideas for various <br/>multivariable systems.  In the first such multivariable setting, the <br/>generalized Schur-class function is analytic and contractive on the unit <br/>polydisk in multidimensional complex Euclidean space, and is the transfer <br/>function of an energy-conserving multidimensional system of the type <br/>considered by Roesser.  The geometry of which scattering systems <br/>actually arise from a conservative Roesser input-state-output system lends <br/>insight into which contractive functions on the polydisk satisfy a von <br/>Neumann inequality (i.e., induce a functional calculus which maps tuples <br/>of commuting contraction operators to another contraction operator).  In <br/>the second incarnation, the generalized Schur-class function is a power <br/>series in finitely many noncommuting variables, and is the transfer <br/>function for a system with time parameter taken to lie in a free semigroup <br/>with finitely many noncommuting generators.  This analysis will give <br/>additional insight (on the system and scattering theory side) to recent work <br/>on model theory for row contractions and function theory on the ball in <br/>multidimensional complex Euclidean space.  In the third incarnation, the <br/>generalized Schur-class function is actually a contractive bundle map <br/>between two parahermitian bundles defined over an algebraic curve <br/>embedded in complex Euclidean space.  This analysis will lead to a <br/>discrete-time version of the Livsic multivariable system theory and a <br/>model theory for commuting tuples of nonunitary operators, as well as <br/>another multivariable scattering theory.  Finally, the project includes an <br/>application of some of these ideas to nonlinear settings, specifically, the <br/>development of a nonlinear H-infinity control theory for nonlinear systems <br/>with stopping cost, switching cost, and/or boundary state-space <br/>constraints.<br/><br/>The notion of an energy-conserving (or more generally, dissipative) <br/>system has long been a fundamental notion in a number of disciplines <br/>(e.g., classical and quantum mechanics and circuit theory).  A more recent <br/>generalization of this notion allows interaction of the system with an <br/>outside environment through input and output signals, and the enlargement <br/>of the energy bookkeeping to take into account energy exchange with the <br/>outside environment.  This notion in turn, together with the function and <br/>operator theory associated with it, has been fundamental in recent <br/>advances in the theory of robust control, where the engineer seeks to <br/>design a feedback control to guarantee satisfactory performance of a <br/>system even in the presence of unmodeled disturbances in the outside <br/>environment and/or modeling errors in the mathematical description of the <br/>system.  The goal of this project is to push these ideas in fundamental, new <br/>directions, namely: (1) new types of multidimensional systems and <br/>scattering, and (2) nonlinear systems with discontinuities arising from (a) <br/>instantaneous switching of the control setting, or (b) instantaneous jumps <br/>in the state dynamics caused by boundary reflections. The first direction <br/>has direct application to systems that evolve in both time and in a spatial <br/>dimension, as well as to uncertain systems with a modeled parameter-<br/>variation uncertainty and certain types of nonlinear systems.  The second <br/>direction is relevant to physical systems where instantaneous jumps occur <br/>between two or more continuous-model descriptions (hybrid systems) <br/>(such as in the setting of a traffic signal at a highway intersection), as well <br/>as to systems where the set of admissible values for some physical <br/>quantity has a boundary which leads to a boundary reflection in the system <br/>description (such as the constraint that the queue lengths be nonnegative in <br/>a queueing network).<br/>"

Stanley<br/>Department of Mathematics<br/>Univeristy of Montana<br/><br/><br/>Engineers, mathematicians and other scientists who use mathematical <br/>models to describe physical systems often need to answer the question: <br/>``How does the system response change as system parameters change?'' <br/>For example, how does the airflow around an airplane wing change as<br/>the shape of the wing changes, and how does this affect drag? <br/>Sensitivity analysis seeks to answer such questions.  The sensitivity<br/>provides quantitative information which can be useful as a <br/>mathematical tool to gain insight into the behavior of a system.<br/>This proposal deals with the analysis and design of<br/>computational methods for approximating sensitivities for a very specific <br/>class of problems.  The research focuses on shape sensitivity calculations<br/>for interface problems.  These problems arise in the analysis<br/>of a variety of physical systems such as groundwater flow through <br/>different types of sediment as well as manufacturing processes such as die <br/>casting problems and alloy solifidification problems.<br/>In die casting, for example, there is an interface<br/>between the solidifying part and the mold itself.<br/>When analyzing such a process, the mold and the part may be considered <br/>as one composite material, and in order to optimize the casting process, <br/>the designer needs to determine the sensitivity of the temperature <br/>throughout the composite material to small changes in the thickness <br/>of the respective component materials.   Since the mold and the <br/>manufactured part consist of different materials which have different <br/>heat conductivity properties, the mathematical equation governing <br/>the cooling process has a solution which lacks smoothness at the <br/>interface.  For these types of problems, computing the sensitivity <br/>requires a different, and more clever, approximation scheme than <br/>that which is typically used to determine the temperature.  The <br/>current research attempts to analyze and exploit the mathematical <br/>structure of these problems and to modify existing numerical methods <br/>in order to develop a computational algorithm which is accurate, <br/>efficient and reasonable to implement.  Estimates regarding inclusion <br/>of such techniques in the design of rocket engines show that design <br/>cycle time could be reduced from one year to one month.  Results<br/>of this magnitude make the development of such <br/>computational tools critical for the national interest<br/>both in cost savings during the design stage and in remaining<br/>on the forefront of new technology.<br/><br/>This project investigates the use of<br/>domain decomposition techniques for the development of <br/>accurate and efficient computational algorithms for shape <br/>sensitivity calculations.  Specifically, the work involves<br/>the implementation of Continuous Sensitivity Equation<br/>Methods (C-SEMs) in order to derive infinite dimensional<br/>sensitivity equations which usually take the form of<br/>partial differential equations.  The research focuses<br/>on elliptic interface problems containing <br/>parameters which determine the spatial <br/>location or the shape of the interface.  The  resulting shape <br/>sensitivities exhibit discontinuities across the interface.  <br/>Efficient computational algorithms for this<br/>class of problems rely on two essential components.  The first <br/>is the mathematical analysis needed to establish fundamental <br/>properties such as existence, uniqueness and regularity.  <br/>The second component is <br/>the clever choice of a numerical method which is suitable<br/>for solving the equations.  The theoretical analysis guides<br/>the construction of a computational method which exploits <br/>the problem structure.  Specifically, an iterative, nonoverlapping<br/>domain decomposition algorithm is used to accurately capture <br/>discontinuities in the sensitivity variable.  <br/><br/><br/>"

This research consists in developing the  mathematical tools necessary to implement this new methodology in various situations such as American and exotic options in equity markets or term-structures of interest rates in fixed income markets.<br/>The first step in this method requires an identification of the time scales present in the hidden stochastic volatility processes. This has been done for S&P500 by using variograms and spectral analysis methods. Other tools and markets will be investigated <br/>The second step consists in modeling the evolution of the price process by means of stochastic differential equations with volatility coefficients  driven by additional general ergodic processes running on faster time-scales. Risk-neutral probabilities are parameterized by market prices of volatility risk. In the Markovian case, derivative prices are obtained as solutions of partial differential equations, which are singular perturbations of the corresponding classical constant volatility equations. Asymptotic expansions are performed. The zero-order terms correspond to classical constant volatility situations. The first-order terms are shown to depend only on current prices and they are computed either explicitly or through the resolution of a partial differential equation. The case of American options leads to singular perturbations of free-boundary value problems that will be studied in detail. The hedging problem will be treated by a martingale decomposition approach also used in non-Markovian cases or infinite dimensional situations arising in fixed income markets.<br/>The next step consists in the calibration of the few parameters revealed in the first correction obtained in the expansion. This is done by using observed derivative prices in liquid markets and used for pricing other exotic derivatives.<br/>This new methodology to handle incomplete stochastic volatility markets gives rise to model independent pricing and hedging formulas easy to calibrate and to compute. Its mathematical analysis, the heart of this proposal, touches various fields of applied mathematics and leads to far reaching new tools and results.<br/>Non-Technical Description:<br/>This project addresses problems in financial mathematics of pricing and hedging derivative securities in an environment of uncertain and changing market volatility. These risk management problems are important to investors from large trading institutions to pension funds and to regulators of financial markets and economic activity such as the federal reserve.<br/>It is widely recognized that the simplicity of the famous Black-Scholes model which relates derivative prices to current stock prices and quantifies risk through a constant volatility parameter is no longer sufficient to capture modern market phenomena, especially since the 1987 crash.<br/>This research consists in the investigation of a new method for modeling, analysis and estimation that exploits the random nature and fast intrinsic time scale of the volatility. These observed volatility properties are used to derive corrections to the classical constant volatility formulas. These corrections reveal important groupings of market parameters, which otherwise are not obvious, and it turns out that estimation of these composites from market data is extremely efficient and stable.<br/>Much attention will be devoted to the more mathematically involved cases of American options, which can be exercised at any time before maturity, or other increasingly popular exotic options, which depend on the history of the underlying asset.<br/>New and original methods, based on the fundamental concept of martingale in probability theory, are developed to handle complex fixed income markets, for which the understanding of the time evolution of yield curves of interest rates is a real challenge. <br/>The goal of this research is to produce sophisticated mathematical results, which can be efficiently implemented and used by practitioners in quantitative finance.<br/>"

One project focuses on anisotropic adaptive finite element methods.  It has been demonstrated that anisotropic refinement leads to more efficient computations in thin layers, such as boundary layers.  These methods will be extended to three dimensional problems and encoded in general-purpose software.  Another project involves mathematical techniques for understanding the value of stock options and other derivative securities.  We will examine how more desirable, sophisticated pricing models differ from those in use today.  If the extra sources of uncertainty introduced in multi-factor models are not too large, we can estimate their effect on pricing and hedging strategies using perturbation methods rather than the large scale computation that they seem to require.  A third project concerns numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations.  The goal is to develop a method as accurate as Milstein's method that does not require sampling repeated Ito integrals or explicitly evaluating derivatives of noise coefficients.<br/><br/>Computation of quantities of practical interest, such as stresses in structures, fluid or heat flows, etc., are often limited by computer memory and speed, so techniques that reduce computational cost have immediate practical application.  One part of this project concerns development of a more efficient finite-element algorithm, a central tool of engineering computation.  Currently, adaptive computations automatically determine the resolution appropriate to a region, so that the computation will not waste high resolution where it is not needed (e.g. far from the source of a stress).  Anisotropic refinement, the topic of this work, goes one step further, seeking directions in which high resolution is not needed (e.g. parallel to a long crack).  A second part of this project focuses on mathematical methods used in the banking industry.  The finance industry has been transformed by computers, communications, and instant access to information.  A liquidity revolution has occurred through use of sophisticated quantitative methods.  Investors, businesses and bankers can now understand risk much better, and, through derivative instruments and markets, sell the risk to those who wish to assume it.  The New York financial community has an edge on other foreign banking centers through the use of more sophisticated quantitative market models, which pose analytical and computational challenges for finance professionals and applied mathematicians.

The focus of this project is the coupling of electrostatic<br/>and mechanical forces in MEMS devices. Due to their favorable scaling with device<br/>size, electrostatic forces are often used to actuate mechanical members of such<br/>devices. The mathematical modeling of this effect requires an understanding of <br/>coupled nonlinear elliptic systems of partial differential equations. <br/>The system consists of the equations of electrostatics coupled to the <br/>Navier equations of elasticity. Generally, the equations are coupled in two ways. <br/>First, the electrostatic potential appears as a source of mechanical force in the <br/>Navier equations. Second, the boundaries of the domain for the electrostatic <br/>problem depend upon mechanical deflections and hence the solution to the <br/>Navier equations. This two way nonlinear coupling is often additionally <br/>complicated by the appearance of nonlocal terms when the device is embedded <br/>in a circuit. In this work, a sequence of mathematical models of such devices <br/>will be designed to explain phenomena associated with MEMS devices, improve <br/>existing or suggest new numerical simulation methods and ultimately<br/>aid in the design of existing and future MEMS devices. <br/><br/>The field of microelectromechanical systems has undergone a startling revolution<br/>in recent years.

Moreover, domes often have a relatively low aspect ratio<br/>and evolve slowly.  These observations can be used as ingredients<br/>in building simple mathematical models of expanding and cooling<br/>fluid domes; this proposal surrounds the development of such<br/>models.  In particular, lava is considered as a solidifying,<br/>non-Newtonian fluid with strongly temperature-dependent material<br/>qualities and an intrinsic yield stress.  The wide array of<br/>physical ingredients to the problem make the mathematical<br/>modelling especially challenging.  The project exploits the simple<br/>geometry, slow evolution and low aspect ratio of the dome to<br/>asymptotically reduce the governing equations to a simpler form.<br/>The reduction furnishes ""shallow-lava equations,"" in much the<br/>same way that the ""shallow-ice equations"" are derived and<br/>extensively used to model ice sheets and glaciers.  Differences<br/>arise because of the viscoplastic nature of silicic lava, and<br/>because solidification creates a solid crust overlying the dome<br/>that can contribute significantly to the balance of forces,<br/>especially at the disk's edge.  The mathematical approach are<br/>complemented with an experimental one in which laboratory fluids<br/>are used as analogue models of the lava.  Both approaches are used<br/>to explore the structure and evolution of the dome, partly with<br/>the aim of learning more about how lava behaves as a fluid.  For<br/>example, some domes lose axisymmetry in what might be an<br/>intrinsic morphological instability; this pattern formation<br/>process is explored in that light.<br/>     Lava domes occur in many geological settings both on Earth<br/>and on many other planets and moons of the solar system.  These<br/>structures form when crystal-rich silicic magma is pushed up<br/>through vents onto roughly horizontal surfaces, and often occur<br/>inside the craters created by volcanic eruptions.  The shape of a<br/>lava dome is especially simple in comparison to most other lava<br/>flows.  Hence, a first step in understanding lava flows in general<br/>is to explore those domes.  Moreover, despite their slow growth,<br/>domes are natural hazards because they can be the setting of<br/>violent and dangerous events: domes can rupture and release<br/>confined gas in a pyroclastic outflow (an extremely hot and<br/>fast-moving current of air and ash), or collapse at their<br/>peripheries to create landslides and debris flows.  The proposal<br/>outlines a mathematical and experimental approach to the<br/>modelling of lava domes.  The purpose is to build models of the<br/>dome's structure and evolution, and compare these models with the<br/>real geological structures.  By modelling the domes in this way,<br/>more will be learned about how lava flows, and ultimately this<br/>may provide insight into the hazards associated with them.<br/>"

Because the earth's atmosphere and oceans are<br/>stratified fluids in a rotating frame, the work is highly<br/>relevant to geophysical applications.  Many aspects of<br/>wave-turbulence interactions are yet to be understood.  For<br/>example, it is not clear if, when and how small-scale 3D<br/>turbulence in the presence of waves can organize into large-scale<br/>coherent structures (as in 2D flows).  In purely rotating flow,<br/>the investigator previously showed that white-noise forcing at<br/>small scales leads to the generation of slow, large-scale,<br/>cyclonic vortical columns, if the Rossby number is below a<br/>critical value of order one.  This is surprising because recent<br/>work using multiple scales analysis shows, at first order,<br/>decoupling between fast, small-scale motions and slow,<br/>large-scale motions for a variety of wave-turbulence systems<br/>including rotating flow.  Several second-order mechanisms may be<br/>responsible for the upscale energy transfer to slow modes in<br/>rotating turbulence.  This project goes a step further towards<br/>understanding the large-scale dynamics in geophysical flows, by<br/>investigation of upscale energy transfer in 3D stratified and<br/>rotating, stratified turbulence.  The investigator explores the<br/>necessary conditions leading to such upscale transfer and seeks<br/>to identify the underlying mechanisms.

To complement numerical<br/>simulations and analysis, she has also planned laboratory<br/>experiments in a rotating tank, where the turbulence is driven by<br/>differentially-rotating, rough top and bottom plates.<br/>     Over relatively short time periods in rotating and/or<br/>stratified flows, there is both experimental evidence and<br/>mathematical support for the decoupling of slow, large-scale<br/>motions from fast, small-scale motions.  This means that, on time<br/>scales of perhaps days in the atmosphere and weeks in the oceans,<br/>large-scale eddies and currents evolve independently from<br/>small-scale turbulence.  Another implication is that short-term<br/>climate change is independent from rapid fluctuations of the<br/>conditions in the atmosphere and oceans.

In the context of the<br/>atmosphere, one might ask, can small-scale cumulus convection at<br/>length scales of about ten kilometers generate large-scale eddies<br/>of several thousand kilometers in extent?  The transfer of energy<br/>from fast, small-scale motions to slow, large-scale motions in<br/>three-dimensional, wave-turbulence systems such as rotating and<br/>stratified flows has only recently been discovered, even though<br/>such transfer has been studied for decades in two-dimensional<br/>flows.

An emphasis is placed on methods that are<br/>robust to structural perturbations of the population equations<br/>and that apply to systems with nonlinear dynamics (e.g.,<br/>periodicity, quasiperiodicity, and chaos).  The methods involve<br/>the use and development of techniques from smooth ergodic theory.<br/>Application of these methods to models of host-parasitoid<br/>interactions and tritrophic food webs is pursued.  Two aspects of<br/>host-parasitoid interactions are examined.  First, because<br/>parasitoids experience egg limitation when released in systems<br/>with highly variable host densities (the typical situation when<br/>an exotic insect has reached pest status), a model of<br/>host-parasitoid interactions that incorporates this<br/>egg-limitation is considered.  As successful biological control<br/>only occurs after a parasitoid population has established itself,<br/>the proposed analysis of the model intends to determine how<br/>variability in the dynamics of the host population influences the<br/>invasion rate of the parasitoid population.  Second, previous work<br/>on the coevolution of patch selection strategies in<br/>host-parasitoid systems is extended to include two important<br/>biological factors, the sex-allocation strategies of parasitoids<br/>and plant dynamics.  The key issue is whether the manipulation of<br/>crop heterogeneity can lead to the coevolution of behavioral<br/>traits that simultaneously stabilize the system and increase crop<br/>yields.  Third, to better understand how ecological communities<br/>assemble due to invasions, this proposal undertakes the study of<br/>tritrophic systems with more than one species at each trophic<br/>level.  In these systems, three ecological forces (apparent<br/>competition, resource competition and intraguild predation) play<br/>an important role and can lead to successional intransitivites<br/>(e.g., a sequence of invasions that takes community A to<br/>community B, B to C and C back to A).  Emphasis is placed on the<br/>influence of habitat productivity and the timing of invasions on<br/>the community assembly process.  In addition, the project includes<br/>a program designed to stimulate undergraduate research.<br/>     Invading non-native species in the United States cause<br/>estimated economic losses of 138 billion dollars annually in<br/>agriculture, forestry and several other segments of the U.S.<br/>economy.  Exotic insect species alone are estimated to cause 13<br/>billion dollars in crop losses annually and approximately 42% of<br/>the species on the threatened or endangered species lists are at<br/>risk primarily because of nonnative species.  As biological<br/>invasions often involve nonlinear interactions between several<br/>species, mathematical models, as simple caricatures, allow one to<br/>inexpensively answer questions such as: What characteristics make<br/>a species a successful invader?  Which ecological communities are<br/>most susceptible to large long-term changes following an<br/>invasion?  How can crop heterogeneity be manipulated to minimize<br/>the economic impact of non-native pests?  The project proposes to<br/>develop analytical methods, and to apply these methods to models<br/>that address these and other questions of current interest to<br/>community ecology, restoration ecology, biological control, and<br/>evolutionary biology.<br/>"

The first problem is the reflection of weak shock waves, where there have been longstanding discrepancies between theory and experiment.  There are close relationships between this problem and transonic aerodynamics.  The second problem is the study of nonlinear effects on gravitational waves in the Einstein field equations of general relativity, an issue of fundamental scientific significance.  The third problem is the study of nonlocal, nonlinear equations for hyperbolic surface waves in elasticity and magnetohydrodynamics.  Such waves arise, for example, in surface acoustic wave devices used in signal processing.  The fourth problem is the study of the interaction of high frequency vorticity waves and mean flows in incompressible fluids.  This research will describe the nonlinear development of vorticity instabilities, and is relevant to the closure problem for turbulent flows.  The fifth problem is the propagation of fronts in a bistable oscillatory system of reaction-diffusion equation that provides a simplified model of the collective behavior of beta-cells in the pancreas, which produce insulin.  The sixth problem is the study of surfactant deposition by a spreading liquid drop.  This problem has industrial applications in the use of droplets for the deposition of surface films. <br/>Waves, such as sound waves, elastic waves, and gravitational waves, are an important feature of many physical and biological systems.  Large amplitude waves may behave nonlinearly, and this leads to new effects not seen in linear waves: for example, the generation of shock waves by an aircraft traveling at speeds close to or above the speed of sound.  A detailed analysis of the equations that describe nonlinear waves is often very difficult.  The aim of this research is an increased understanding of nonlinear waves in the context of a variety of applications that involve qualitatively interesting and poorly understood phenomena, and that are related to problems of current scientific and technological interest. <br/>"

The group will develop methods for the investigation of theoretical models of the main fiber optics technologies.  This includes the emerging techniques of dispersion compensation, distributed amplification, wavelength division multiplexing, and uses of the newly developed dispersion-profiled fiber.  Also to be investigated will be the influence of dispersion management on four-wave interactions and therefore on the stability of bit-patterns in multi-channel systems.  Each of these methods involves, in some way, the spatial management of dispersion and other physical effects.  In general, this leads to an inhomogeneous evolutionary partial differential equation with rapidly varying coefficients.  Much of the mathematical and computational theory will be aimed at a deeper understanding of these equations and their properties within the specific context of optical transmission.

The development of new mathematical and computational techniques is crucial for the both the formulation of new strategies and their initial evaluation.  This effort will take the methods of modern applied mathematics into the fiber optics engineering community.  It will pave the road for further interactions between applied mathematicians and electrical engineers and promises to make the field of optical communications even more vigorous.

Related difficulties appear in other methods of analysis, such as large deviation approximations. An alternative approach is to allow the routing/service decisions to be control variables. When properly formulated, the analogous approximations to these controlled stochastic networks frequently possess better qualitative properties than their fixed policy counterparts. In addition, many approximate models are simple enough that closed form (or nearly closed form) solutions are possible. The investigator will carry out research on several closely related areas that can take advantage of these features: risk-sensitive control and the control of rare events in queueing networks; robust optimal control of law of large number approximations (also known as fluid models); higher order corrections to the control of fluid models. At the heart of each of these topics is a variational problem for processes with constrained dynamics (calculus of variations or optimal control problems for large deviations and control of fluid models, differential games for the problems of robust control of fluid models or control of rare events). The investigator has recently shown how in certain cases one can convert a variational problem involving constrained and controlled dynamics and a relatively simple cost structure into an equivalent problem involving unconstrained dynamics and a different cost. The latter problem is then solved explicitly. The proposed research includes extending this technique to include problems of buffer overflow in large deviations and constrained differential games.<br/> One of the main concerns of applied probability today is the development of tractable approximations for stochastic networks. Stochastic networks are ubiquitous in modern computer, communication and manufacturing systems, but owing to their complexity and detail are very difficult to analyze. As a consequence, much effort is being put into the development of mathematical models that are faithful enough to ""real life"" that conclusions drawn from them can be used with confidence, and yet which can be solved by either analytical or numerical means. The purpose of this project is to develop such methods of approximation and also the techniques for their solution. A new feature is to allow decisions on routing and service (e.g., which data class should be served in a communication network and where the processed data should be sent) to be control variables that can be optimized. Two particular classes of network problems will be given special attention. The first is the control of rare events. In many networks there are events that do not occur very often, and yet which are nonetheless the main concern. An example is data loss in a communication network. The second class is the robust control of networks, which means the control of a network in which some aspects of the network are poorly modeled or otherwise imperfectly known."

The strain in the film is<br/>essential to these devices because it modifies the electronic band gap<br/>in the device to generate the desired electronic properties.  The<br/>strain in the film, however, is also responsible for the generation of<br/>instabilities during growth, resulting in nonplanar films with<br/>inhomogeneous microstructure, such as ""quantum dots"" and ""quantum<br/>wires"".  Because of the strain localization associated with the<br/>inhomogeneous microstructure, the resulting electronic properties can<br/>be enhanced due to quantum electronic effects.  Thus, there has been<br/>intense interest in natural ""self-assembly"" of quantum dot and quantum<br/>wire morphologies during the growth process.  The research of the PI<br/>will focus on the analysis of mathematical models for the development<br/>of such inhomogeneous microstructures in strained alloy films.  The<br/>theoretical description of morphological development in strained films<br/>is difficult because of the major role that elastic strain plays in<br/>the development of the morphology; the generic case is that of a free<br/>boundary or moving boundary elasticity problem.  While there has been<br/>a significant amount of progress made on the mathematical modeling of<br/>the growth of single-component strained films, models for the growth<br/>of alloy strained films are still in their infancy.  The proposed<br/>research will examine the microstructure generated from the new alloy<br/>film models as nonlinear solutions to the moving boundary elasticity<br/>problem using a combination of both analytical and numerical<br/>techniques.  The research will focus on three areas relating to the<br/>formation of microstructure in strained alloy films.  First, the<br/>possibility of generating a new type of microstructure based on<br/>self-assembled compositional modulations in thick films will be<br/>investigated by a bifurcation analysis of the nonlinear free boundary<br/>problem.  Second the growth of inhomogeneous alloy quantum dots will<br/>be described using a hybrid asymptotic and numerical approach, and the<br/>theoretical predictions will be compared to experiments carried out in<br/>parallel by a collaborator.  Finally the appropriate mathematical<br/>modeling of facet corners in strained alloy crystals will be examined<br/>through a model which incorporates atomic-scale behavior in a<br/>macroscopic model for film growth.  The overall goal of the research<br/>is to develop mathematical approaches that enable a comprehensive<br/>theoretical description of nanostructure formation in strained alloy<br/>films.<br/><br/>In nanoscale electronic devices, strained solid layers play an<br/>important role because of the improved electronic properties of the<br/>strained material.  While flat, planar strained films have been used<br/>successfully, they can be susceptible to instabilities during the<br/>growth process and develop nanoscale bumps (""dots"").  These nanoscale<br/>""quantum dots"" have been found to give superior electronic behavior<br/>because of quantum-physics electronic effects.  There is thus interest<br/>in growing quantum dots with a controlled size and spacing to give a<br/>material with specified or optimum electronic properties.  The<br/>research supported by this grant focuses on the development of<br/>mathematical models for describing the formation of quantum dots and<br/>other nanostructures from detailed modeling of the physics of the<br/>growth process.  In particular, the work will focus on the growth of<br/>alloy films, for which theoretical understanding not well developed.<br/>The goal of the theoretical work will be to evaluate the effect of<br/>different growth parameters to guide the development of ""optimum""<br/>quantum dot structures.  To solve the mathematical problem, advanced<br/>mathematical techniques will be developed and applied to determine the<br/>characteristics of the solutions and how they depend on the material<br/>properties and growth conditions.  In addition, the research will also<br/>address the difficult question of how to incorporate atomic-level<br/>behavior into a large scale model for strained film growth.  The<br/>theoretical predictions will be compared to experiments conducted in<br/>parallel by a collaborator here at the University at Buffalo.  The<br/>results of the work will be twofold.

This representation, which was recently discovered by LeJan and Sznitman in France, is clearly intrinsic to the structure of the Navier-Stokes equations. While this is not the first attempt to use stochastic methods in connection with the flows associated with the Navier-Stokes equations, it does represent an entirely new direction which has the potential to transcend much of existing theory. Specific problems considered in this proposal seek to provide a better understanding of the role of spatial dimensions, boundary conditions, multi-scaling exponents and singularities, viscosity, homogeneity, isotropy and rotational accelerations, stationary flows and long-time evolution.<br/> The Navier-Stokes equations describe the basic physics governing the motion of fluid in its various forms of air, water, oil, etc. As such these equations play a fundamental role in science and engineering through the modeling of all varieties of fluid flow, from atmospheric and oceanic circulation to the flow of water beneath the earth's surface. Improved understanding of these equations and their solutions is essential to applications which range from tracking climate change and dispersion of contaminants in the Earth's environment, to more stable aerospace and sea vessel designs. The nonlinearity inherent in these equations makes explicit solutions possible only for the simplest of flows. Consequently the development of a more complete understanding of these equations at all physical length scales ranks among the most important outstanding problems of contemporary mathematical physics. <br/>"

In many cases such perturbations are responsible for the creation of global bifurcations, and these in turn may introduce chaotic dynamics into the system.  Applications to a number of continuum systems will be worked out, focusing on the generation of burst-like behavior in hydrodynamical systems such as convection and the Faraday instability, and the dynamics of acoustically driven shape oscillations of drops and bubbles.<br/><br/>This project investigates how the patterns set up in various physical systems change as the parameters specifying the system vary, with emphasis on systems having various spatial and temporal symmetries.  The approach can identify new types of complex behavior and the mechanisms responsible for it.  Applications include, for example, the behavior of water waves in regions of different shapes.  The project investigates the effects of slight changes in the shape of the region, and seeks to identify which aspects of the behavior are insensitive to such perturbations, and which are due to them.  In many cases such perturbations are responsible for the introduction of chaotic dynamics into systems that would otherwise behave in a simple manner.

The relatively poor axial conductance of the branches<br/>is offset by the myriad of ion channels that perforate the cell<br/>membrane.  A nerve cell's salient physical, as opposed to<br/>geometrical, properties are then its axial conductance, its<br/>membrane's capacitance and permeability to one or more ionic<br/>species and the kinetics (rules that govern its open/closed<br/>state) of the underlying channels.  The predictive utility of a<br/>mathematical model of course hinges on the accuracy to which<br/>these physical properties are known.  Unfortunately, the<br/>experimental determination of each of these quantities is a<br/>formidable task that, in light of recent data suggesting that the<br/>permeabilities vary with position in the dendritic tree, requires<br/>great investment for all but the simplest geometries.  The<br/>investigator and his colleagues therefore determine the extent to<br/>which the neuron's physical properties may be inferred from more<br/>readily available indirect measurements.

Self-replicating pulses have recently been discovered as new chemical patterns, and a central role in self-replication is played by strong, nonlinear pulse interactions. Pulses, such as bumps, annular rings, and circular spots in one and two dimensions, are localized large-amplitude perturbations of globally stable homogeneous states in the governing coupled reaction-diffusion equations. Specific aims include locating the hierarchies of saddle-node (disappearance) bifurcations that govern splitting, for example, when a ring solution splits into two rings, two rings into four, etc., and determining the underlying splitting mechanisms in two dimensions. Another aspect of this research focuses on stability of these patterns. Control over the stabilization of pulses in physically important systems of coupled reaction-diffusion equations is achieved by varying the strength of the coupling of the slow inhibitor field to the faster activator field, and by exploiting a recently discovered zero-pole cancellation in the nonlocal eigenvalue problems. In chemical reaction theory, this project focuses on large-scale systems involving many species and reactions and on the development of reduction methods that decrease the number of effective species and reactions that need to be modeled. The project investigates iterative numerical methods to find low dimensional manifolds in systems of reaction-diffusion equations using geometric singular perturbation theory. Finally, the project develops and analyzes a fully nonlinear model of the interactions of gas bubbles in liquids.<br/><br/>The fields of chemistry and fluid mechanics have long had a strong influence on the development of mathematics; and in turn, mathematics has led to many useful developments in both chemistry and fluid mechanics. This research project uses mathematical theory, specifically applied nonlinear dynamical systems theory, to gain new insights and make quantitative predictions for fundamental problems in pattern formation and large-scale reaction systems in chemistry and for nonlinear interactions between gas bubbles in fluid mechanics. A nonlinear control mechanism for stabilizing patterns in which the concentrations of the<br/>reacting compounds are maintained at desirable levels in localized regions is under development. In addition, the project designs, implements, and tests reduction methods, known to be essential for modeling the large-scale systems of chemical reactions that arise in combustion, reacting flows, and other technologically important problems. Finally, the project carries out fundamental theoretical research on the nonlinear interaction of gas bubbles in liquids. Over the long term, this work will lead to deeper understanding of the complex problems of bubble clouds that generate noise behind submarines and damage turbine blades."

With this approach the outer <br/>problem of finding optimal values for the flow variables is a nonsmooth <br/>problem whose solution can be found efficiently via the techniques to be <br/>developed. The theoretical research is concerned with properly defining a <br/>class of functions which is special enough for the members to have <br/>U-Hessians and general enough to include functions from many <br/>applications.<br/><br/>The computational methods proposed for development are significant because <br/>they can be applied in many practical decision-making situations. These <br/>include the determination of values of parameters for fitting models to <br/>data such as in topographic or geophysical modeling. They also include <br/>application of decomposition techniques to large or complicated models such <br/>as those occurring in allocation of scarce resources, traffic assignment, <br/>manufacturing, structural engineering, logistics and strategic planning. <br/>The pipe network problem in the first paragraph is an important example <br/>occurring in civil infrastructure design. It illustrates the need to make <br/>trade-off decisions when considering conflicting design criteria such as <br/>simultaneously having high reliability and low cost. Another area of <br/>application is in power system planning subject to environmental protection <br/>constraints. These decision models will increase in importance as <br/>deregulation of the energy supply sector takes effect. These problems <br/>naturally decompose into higher level problems of deciding which types and <br/>sizes of power generation plants to build and lower level problems of <br/>deciding how best to operate the various units to meet daily energy demand. <br/>Additionally, this research fits in well with on-going efforts in <br/>high-performance computing, because its methods will utilize parallel <br/>processing for solving very large and/or very complex decision-making<br/>problems."
