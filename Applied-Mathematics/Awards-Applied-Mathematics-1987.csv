These problems deal with optimal designs of boundary impedance for              acoustic and optical scatterers, and boundary control of the plate              equation in adaptive optics.  The method of boundary integral                   equations and boundary elements will be used, and some recent                   global optimization techniques will be applied.  Proper modelling               will also be addressed to reflect the physics of the distributed                systems.  Substantial efforts will be directed toward calculations              on a supercomputer fully utilizing its parallelism and speed.                        This research is part of control theory and is aimed at                    improving computational design methods for optimal design of                    structures and systems."

These coefficients can be recovered by giving overposed boundary data,          that it prescribed Dirichlet   type data and a chosen curve lying on            the boundary region. The method consists of converting the inverse              problem into a fixed-point problem in which one has a mapping from the          unknown coefficients to the overposed data. The fixed point problem is          solved through an iteration scheme. The authors have been able to               demonstrate the convergence of that scheme in some cases. They propose          now a number of research questions to be investigated to  improve the           knowledge of the technique.                                                         The inverse problems arise in a number of applications where one            has observed data and the problem is to find the parameters of the              equation describing the phenomenon. Continuum mechanics,   mathematical         biology and chemical combustion theory are among potential applications         of this inverse method."

These models consist of                    minimizing an integral functional with an infinite upper limit.  The            admissible pairs of control functions and state functions must satisfy          a differential equation, state constraints and control constraints.             Given the admissible pair, the functional need not be finite, and as a          consequence, the traditional concept of minimum becomes meaningless.            To circumvent this difficulty, a variety of weaker notions of                   optimality have been introduced.                                                     The investigator has established the existence of these weaker             notions of optimality under minimal convexity hypotheses for ordinary           differential equation constraints.  He now proposes to generalize               these results for the class of differential equations with delays               called hereditary differential systems.  The difficulties encountered           there are greater than in the case of ordinary differential equations,          but the models of this type may be more realistic for problems                  involving resource management and economics.                                         Research in optimal control problems has been an essential part            of control theory, optimization and calculus of variations.  Results            of such research are often interesting for people interested in                 trajectory optimization for space vehicles and for scientists                   interested in resource management."

This includes               research on a new mixed finite element method for the equations of              anisotropic elasticity developed by the investigator and Professor              Douglas Arnold of the University of Maryland. The focus is mainly on the        computational effectivness of the method for pure traction and mixed            boundary conditions. The investigator has developed some a priori error         estimates for this difficult problem and now wants to check the                 effectiveness of the method on a computer for various choices of                boundary conditions. The most likely procedure that will be followed is         a simplified variational equation which reduces to a system of linear           algebraic equations with a positive definite matrix. To solve the system        efficiently, a preconditioned conjugate gradient method will be used.           Another project to be pursued involves finite element methods for the           first order scalar hyperbolic problem. The proposed research consists of        continued investigations on the use of nonconforming finite elements of         order higher than one (piecewise polynomials which are continuous at the        midpoints of triangles) including the derivation of a priori error              estimates and computational verification. The ideas of this research            will also be applied to the problem of identifying unknown functional           coefficients in a parabolic system of partial differential equations.           The work on this problem is relevant to underground oil reservoir               identification.                                                                     This research falls into the general area of numerical analysis and         computational mathematics. Its ultimate goal is to develop efficient            computational methods to be used in scientific problems involving               spatially distributed masses, energies, stresses and flows."

The first topic               concerns the analysis of ""acausal"" stochastic differential equations            driven by Brownian motion. Recently, Nualart and Pardoux used the               stochastic calculus of variations to develop a calculus for the                 Skorokhod integral, which is an integral with respect to Brownian               motion for integrands not necessarily adapted to the past of the                Brownian motion. This should allow one to study equations containing            ""acausal"" features, that is exhibiting dependence not only on the               past but also on the future. Professor Ocone intends to undertake               research in this direction. The second topic concerns the analysis              of the probability distributions of solutions of stochastic partial             differential equations. This study has implications for nonlinear               filtering theory. In this project the investigator wishes to                    continue the line of investigation that leads to a study of                     regularity of densities for linear functionals on solutions to                  stochastic partial differential equations. He will also study the               nonlinear filtering problem, and attempt to relate Wiener space                 gradients of conditional distributions of nonlinear filters to the              issue of finite dimensional computability of filters. This is a                 theoretical work where computability is characterized by the                    existence of certain finite dimensional stochastic differential                 equation that governs certain conditional expectations. There is  a             possibility that the investigator can relate computability to                   certain rank conditions for Frechet derivatives of certain maps.                    This research belongs to a larger research effort on stochastic             differential equations and filtering problems that is now an active             area in applied probability."

The vast majority of the work done on this problem                 thus far has concentrated on local decompositions. By                           decomposition one usually means a change of variables that                      produces an equivalent system that has at least two independent                 but interconnected parts. Decomposition is very important from a                practical point of view, because it simplifies the analysis of                  complex systems.

Extensions to analogous problems with time-dependent scatterers            will also be considered.                                                             Research of this type is aimed at solving the long standing                problem of reconstructing the shape of an obstacle from measurements            of reflected and scattered acoustic or electromagnetic waves."

The         common tie among these problems is that they all deal with diffusive            and/or convective transport, and interactive processes such as chemical         reactions.  There are many electrophoretic techniques commonly used to          separate charged particles in solution.  They all give rise to                  mathematical models in need of qualitative analysis.  The specific              projects proposed here have to do with the steady-state and transient           behavior of models in isotachophoresis and isoelectric focussing                (possibly also continuous flow electrophoresis).  In the study of the           statics and dynamics of two-phase continua, phase field models of               various kinds are emerging as physically suggestive and numerically             convenient approaches.  Part of the proposal is to extend the previous          analyses of these models, by the PI and Caginalp, in the directions of          (1) higher (than second) order models, which will be closer in some             sense to the underlying discrete lattice theories, (2) taking into              account the interaction of the material with boundaries, and (3)                stability considerations.  To fully understand and model combustion in          flames, the important chemical reactions should be known, as well as the        extent of their participation in the combustion process.  Along with            this , a knowledge of the concentrations of the reactants, hence of the         reaction rates and the ( at least approximate) flame speed, is                  desirable.  The PI has very recently developed a strategy for obtaining         this knowledge, using known reaction networks and rate constant data,           ans successfully  applied it to lean hydrogen-oxygen flames.  The method        needs further development and implementation with simple computer               routines.  It is proposed to investigate aspects of some nonstandard            problems.                                                                           This project falls into the general area of research on mathematical        theory of reaction - diffusion phenomena. This theory attempts to               explain in mathematical terms the phenomena of combustion,                      electrophoresis, flame propagation and diffusion of chemicals in a              solution.

There is a vast literature in physics concerning the                 behavior of statistical systems near critical points (phase                     transitions), but there are few models in which it is possible to               verify the conjectured behavior analytically.  The importance of                the Ising model is that it is a notable exception (in two                       dimensions).  There, one has sufficient knowledge of the spin                   correlations to examine some of the more detailed conjectures                   about critical phenomena.  This is of importance for statistical                mechanics, quantum field theory, and the mathematical theories                  upon which the analysis rests.

In prior work he introduced a family of                           lattice models which are mathematical generalizations of the                    Ising model. In the current project he proposes to prove scaling                hypotheses that rely upon prior work on infinite spin groups.                   He is also investigating the possibility of interpreting a certain              invariance in the Ising model as the manifestation of a gauge                   group acting of the determinant bundle associated with a family                 of finite difference operators.

They         are natural extensions into PDE's of forced damped pendulum, a problem          used as a prototype for studying chaos in ordinary differential                 equations. These equations have a natural choice of a basis, with which         the notion of a nonlinear power spectrum can be described explicitly for        the first time. The near integrability of these equations provides              sufficient analytical control to yield precise, detailed theoretical            information about the qualitative behavior. The far from integrable             systems include flows in finite geometries, turbulent wakes and boundary        layers.

This term refers to problems described           by differential equations in which there are two or more different              equations in which there are two or more different control variables,           one for each decision maker or ""player"".  For instance, competition             games on stock markets or pursuit-evasion games (encountered in aerial          combat) can be mathematically analyzed by using the theory of                   differential games.  The latter represents a mixture of more                    traditional game theory, control and various recent mathematical                theories about partial differential equations.                                       The theory of differential games developed by the principal                investigator will be used to develop methods for approximating the              solutions of differential games to an arbitrary degree of accuracy.             The first method to be used is that of approximating the continuous             time game by a sequence of multimove infinite games corresponding to            the discretization of the time interval.  It will be shown that the             solutions of these infinite multimove games converge to the solutions           of the original game.  Estimates of the rates of convergence of the             values of the n-th stage games to the value of the differential game            will be obtained.  If the Isaacs condition does not hold then mixed             strategies will be used.  Methods for solving multimove infinite games          will also be investigated, as the solutions of such games is an                 essential part of the program.  For the multimove games, methods based          on necessary conditions and direct backward recursions will be                  investigated.  Another method that will be developed is one based on            the numerical solution of the Isaacs equation.  Since the value                 function is a viscosity solution of this equation, the adaptability to          out problem of numerical techniques proposed in the literature will be          investigated.  The preceding program will first be applied to games of          fixed duration and then extended to games of generalized pursuit and            evasion and to games of survival.                                                    A question that arises in pursuit and evasion problems that is             different from the two person zero-sum game is that of determining              those initial points from which capture can be assured and those                initial points from which evasion can be assured.  We shall                     investigate this problem when both pursuer and evader are permitted to          choose their actions at each instant time, knowing the previous                 actions of both players.  This is in contrast to previous Soviet and            other work in which only one of the antagonists is allowed to choose            his action as play evolves.

Wave propagation is a means of moving                energy from one region to another.  When the wave amplitudes are                sufficiently small, as occurs in many problems, then the motion                 is  adequately described by a linearized theory of wave                         propagation.  Thus, the classical theories of wave propagation in               acoustics,optics, electromagnetics, elastic solids, etc.  are                   linearized theories.  When the geometry, material properties and                source structures are  simple it may then be possible to solve                  wave propagation problems explicitly.  However, for realistic                   situations and hence more complicated problems it is necessary to               employ  asymptotic, perturbation, numerical and other approximate               methods to solve wave  propagation problems.                                        The purposes of this research project are to develop and                    apply asymptotic, perturbation and numerical methods to wave                    propagation problems of scientific and engineering significance,                and to study specific physical problems that are basic to future                progress in  wave propagation.  Some of the present effort                      represents a continuation and elaboration on past work.                             Professor Reiss is a well known authority on wave propagation               and Professor Kriegsmann is his younger talented partner.

This research                    falls into the general area of asymptotic methods and                           perturbation theory in applied mathematics, which constitute an                 active and practical trend in applied mathematics research. Many                of the results obtained by these researchers have direct                        engineering applications in acoustics, radar, sonar and in the                  studies of electromagnetic wave propagation."

Jeff                  Cheeger plans to gain a deeper understanding of invariants                      associated with certain families of elliptic operators which have               recently been of some interest in Theoretical Physics.  He is                   also proposing extensive work toward obtaining further insight                  into the interaction of bounded geometries, collapsing, and                     characteristic numbers for complete Riemanian manifolds.  In                    addition, he will continue to expand his approximation theory for               curvature of smooth manifolds by piecewise linear ones.  Gromoll                expects further substantial progress in his efforts to establish                a global structure theory for complete Riemannian spaces of                     nonnegative Ricci curvature, in particular finiteness results and               the construction of additional classes of examples.  He also                    wants to proceed with his analysis of rigidity phenomena of                     metric foliations, i.e. locally everywhere equidistant                          partitions, in nonnegatively curved manifolds, which has turned                 out to be a crucial and delicate aspect of the global geometry of               such spaces.  In the area of submanifold theory he will work on                 various extensions  of recent global results concerning isometric               deformation of euclidean submanifolds, as well as explore the new               theory of minimal real Kaehler submanifolds, a special but ample                class of particularly interesting minimal submanifolds that                     surfaced in that context.  Ebin plans to work in three areas all                of which involve free boundary value problems.  The first is the                study of the motion of a thin membrane.  The second is the study                of dynamics of a liquid drop, and the third is the liquid drop                  model for a large nucleus.  The second and third areas are both                 studied as examples of dynamical systems constrained to                         submanifolds of function spaces.

In particular, the               investigation centers on value theory for games with a continuum                of players.                                                                         Theory of value for such games was developed by Aumann and                  Shapley in the period between 1964 and 1974. It has provided a                  mathematical model of perfect competition in productive economies               and in some exchange economies. The existence and uniqueness of                 values for various classes of games, characterized by                           mathematical properties such as atomic or non-atomic probability                measures, finite number of generators, or finite number of                      lattice operations from a finite set of measures, is of current                 vivid interest. Neyman and Dubey intend to prove that, for exact                market games, any continuous value is necessarily an element of                 the core, and to extend this investigation to more general market               games.                                                                              Complementary to this axiomatic approach is the asymptotic                  one, in which the model involves the approximations of a game                   with a continuum of players by finite games. The asymptotic value               is defined as a limit of the Shapley values of such finite games.               One of the central problems is the existence of the asymptotic                  value. Neyman has recently settled a long standing problem by                   proving that all games defined by a monotone continuous function                and a probabilty measure with a non-atomic part and possibly                    countably many atoms have asymptotic value. He and Dubey now                    propose to study the existence of asymptotic values for games                   with either positive or signed vector measures.                                     Another area of proposed study is the axiomatic theory of                   allocations and payoffs that would encompass economies with core                allocations, value allocations and Walrasian allocations. One                   goal is to explain the much remarked fact their solutions become                equivalent on the domain of smooth, perfectly competitive                       economies. Another goal is to pinpoint the differences that                     emerge between them on bigger domains. The approach taken in this               research is as follows: given a domain of economies and a                       solution, one lists properties that categorically determine the                 solution there. If these properties are shared by another                       solution on that domain, one deduces that they coincide there. On               the other hand, if a minor variant of the properties categorizes                the other solution, then this pinpoints the difference between                  them. The investigators intend to analyze the economies both with               and without perfect competition.                                                    Mathematical game theory of the type described here is a                    large research activity bridging economic theory and pure and                   applied mathematics. I relies on mathematical tools such as                     measure theory, multivalued maps, saddle point theorems and                     stochastic processes. The results of this and other                             investigations are aimed at interpreting the mechanisms governing               various economic models . They create a conceptual framework for                understanding of real economic systems."

Given is a differential or              integral or convolution operator with general boundary conditions.  The         preconditioner has particularly convenient domain and boundary                  conditions. After discretization it can be inverted by the Fast Fourier         Transform, or in the case of the Dirichlet problem by a Fast Sine               Transform.

A small             number of extreme eigenvalues is acceptable if all other eigenvalues are        clustered - that is what appeared in numerical experiments.  The                conjecture on clustering depends on establishing that the eigenvectors          decay exponentially, away from the boundary.  The analysis should               connect problems in operator theory to problems in numerical analysis,          and may give a new direction in the class of equations for which                preconditioning is essential.

The problem of numerical computations associated with Toeplitz matrices         arises in many problems of communications engineering and its solution          is of considerable importance."

The                    novelty of this approach lies in attempting to provide the                      subgradient formulas and normal cone formulas involving exact                   subdifferentials and exact normals.  Previous work by Treiman,                  and by the Russian school around Ioffe, Kruger and others has                   always used much less satisfactory approximate subderivatives.

In the first area, the general problem is one where money has              to be continuously invested or consumed so that the net benefit of              the total consumption is a maximum.  The investments can be divided             between a bond, with a fixed rate of return, and several risky                  stocks.  Variations such as borrowing and short selling (investing              negative amounts) are possible.  In some previous work the authors              have made some progress on the case where the various rates of                  return are random rather than fixed.  Also in a recent work, by                 means of measure change argument, they have linked the optimal                  consumption rate in feedback form to the functional inverse of the              derivative of the consumption function.  The authors propose                    extensions in infinite versions of the problem,  situations where               borrowing and short selling are restricted, and cases where a                   bankruptcy payment is involved.                                                      The second area, which is closely related to the first, deals              with a multiplicity of agents all pursuing their individually                   optimal consumption and investment policies.  The goal is to                    investigate the equilibrium situation where net investment, and                 creation of wealth are all zero etc. and show the existence of spot             prices.                                                                              The last area, which is slightly disjoint from the above deals             with the control of production in a manufacturing system producing n            commodities on m machines.  The goal is to minimize holding                     inventory costs and production systems so as to meet specified                  demands, even when machines are liable to failure.  The authors                 propose to investigate the case where the failure rate is                       proportional to machine utilization.  They also suggest an extension            where there is a continuum of machines, but this appears less                   convincing.

For example, one may cite Cormack's                  Nobel prize work in medical imaging.  Image reconstruction is a                 major scientific and engineering frontier for X-ray tomography,                 emission tomography, electron microscopy, radio astronomy, and                  nuclear magnetic resonance.  Its mathematical foundation in the                 Radon transform and its computational execution via algorithms                  form the subject matter of this proposal.                                               Professor Quinto is an expert in theoretical analysis of the            Radon transform, who holds to the scientific perspectve that                    theoretical progress must go hand in hand with computational                    implemention.

On the                     theoretical side, Professor Quinto will continue his                            investigation of support theorems for generalized Radon                         transforms.  He will consider such problems for transforms with                 real analytic measures on real analytic submanifolds, including                 limited data theorems for X-ray and k-plane transforms as well as               transforms coming from a double fibration and subgroup invariant                transforms.  In computational work, Professor Quinto will                       complete the implementation of his algorithm to invert the                      exterior Radon transform.

This research                     program addresses to an area of nonlinear analysis which has                    recently shown considerable progress:  nonlinear waves in                       hyperbolic systems and in coupled hyperbolic-elliptic systems.                  The investigators intend to develop computational methods which                 are based on this mathematical theory and to participate in the                 development of the mathematical theory of these waves.

Location and analysis of Hopf bifurcations in delay                          differential equations, and the general eigenvalue problem for                  these equations.  2.

The main problems investigated               are: smoothness of the optimal value function, behaviour of the                 optimal control, the asymptotic behavior of the system as the time              or noise parameters approach zero or infinity, and establishing a               class of explicitly solvable case examples.                                         A special case of the partially observed problem with a finite              parameter set has been solved in the investigator's previous work.              It is known under the name of the so-called Adaptive Control problem            formulated  as a  stochastic control Bayesian problem. Of interest              is now the extent to which these results can be established for the             continuous parameter case.  The general partially observed problem              is another topic of interest for this investigation. Recently, the              investigator has established the general equivalence of the                     partially observed problem and the so-called separated problem,                 which is a special infinite dimensional completely observed problem.            The next step in this research is the establishing of the Bellman               equation. The investigator intends to rely here on the recent                   results on viscosity solutions. Finally, he intends to establish a              general continuity result, i.e. to prove that the value function                depends continuously on the generators. Another topic of interest               that the investigator wants to pursue is the exit problem.                          Stochastic control and filtering is an area of active research              with potential applications to stock management, control of noisy               dynamical systems and filtering of signals."

It will be a               truly multidisciplinary event, involving applied mathematicians,                computer scientists and engineers.                                                      The local organizer INRIA expects to recover most of its                costs from conference registration fees.  The four sponsoring                   societies have agreed to seek the support of their respective                   governments to offset their own conference costs such as travel                 and per diem expenses of their respective invited speakers, other               contributing participants and program committee members, and                    other miscellaneous costs such as the preparation and                           distribution of conference materials to their own memberships.                          An important feature of this award are funds to support                 travel of fifteen young American scientists presenting papers at                the conference.  The selection of the scientists will be adminis-               tered by SIAM.                                                                          The award is split-funded by the following NSF programs:                Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, Special Projects,               Advanced Scientific Computing - Computational Science and                       Engineering Initiative, System Theory and Operations Research,                  Computer Integrated Engineering, and Automation and System                      Integration.

Three wave resonant interactions.                                    The first two topics are concerned with the study of some                       relationships among equations with the Painleve property, equations             solvable by the Inverse Scattering Transform method, the theory of              wave modulation and representation of solution                                  of partial differential equations by path integrals.

The central theme of this project is an operator of the form                   T + H*H where T is Toeplitz and H is Hankel. The motivation is                  two-fold. First, as previously shown by the principal                           investigator, the linear quadratic optimal control problem has a                T + H*H operator that reveals a lot of structure not identifiable               by conventional means. Secondly, as shown by the investigator,                  the H - infinity design problem alsdo involves a T + H*H                        operator, the largest eigenvalue of which provides the so called                achievable feedback performance, a critical parameter. As such,                 this operator reveals a strange connection between the linear                   quadratic problem and H - infinity problems. This connection will               be investigated along with its spectral and computational                       aspects.                                                                            This research is part of a larger effort conducted in this                  country by theoretical engineers and mathematicians to develop a                unified design methodology for linear control systems with                      robustness requirements on the design.

The primary objective of this research program is the development               of a new class of robust and very fast algorithms for the                       solution of these problems.  These algorithms are based on the                  use of fast numerical continuation techniques to follow smooth                  penalty paths to optimality.  The key to the development of these               algorithms is an expanded Lagrangian system of equations which                  contains the penalty path as a solution, is a perturbation of the               first order necessary conditions, and sometimes, but not always,                provides a basis for finding multiple optima.  The problem                      formulation and continuation methodology provide a natural                      framework for the development and application of Tikhonov                       regularization techniques to the solution of sensitive, ill-                    conditioned, or ill-constrained optimization problems arising                   from model error or uncertainty and for the investigation of the                parametric optimization problem.  Also, in this setting the                     traditional ill-conditioning associated with a sequential                       optimization algorithm is removed for three smooth penalty                      functions:  the quadratic penalty function for equality                         constraints and the logarithmic barrier and quadratic loss                      function for inequality constraints.  In linear programming one                 of the problem formulations and correspondence algorithms is very               similar to the Karmarkar algorithm with similar expectations in                 speed; however, these fast continuation-penalty path algorithms                 are also applicable to the aforementioned constrained                           optimization problems with similar expectations in speed.                            Research of this type aims at developing new computer                      software for optimization of functions of many variables with                   constraints in the most efficient and robust way.  Software of                  this type has a large number of potential applications, ranging                 from management of resources to airline scheduling and machine                  design."

The research in stochastic control proposed by Professor Fleming            is focused on the questions related to the existence and properties             of solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. One outstanding                   question is whether given the Hamiltonian function there is a                   corresponding stochastic control problem for diffusion processes                leading to this function. Recently, Fleming and Souganidis                      introduced a new formulation of a stochastic differential game,                 based on a new deterministic approach to differential games, which              leads to the solution of this problem by replacing the control                  problem by a game problem. Fleming also intends to work on a number             of open problems related to viscosity solutions for nonlinear first-            order partial differential equations. Among open problems to be                 considered are the theory of discontinuous viscosity solutions, and             the application of duality theorems of convex analysis to                       approximate the value function of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.                     The research in stochastic processes centers on the exit problem            of Freidlin-Wentsel theory. Fleming introduced the stochastic                   control approach to this problem and applied an asymptotic expansion            to the dynamic programming equation obtained after a logarythmic                transformation. This enables him to compute exit probabilities from             the expansion. These expansions are of interest for problems of rare            overloads in communications channels.                                               On the nonlinear filtering problem, Fleming proposes to use some            asymptotic techniques to describe analytically the structure of the             nonlinear filter for small intensities of noise in the output                   equation.                                                                           Stochastic control is a branch of applied mathematics and                   engineering system theory that deals with control of dynamical                  systems in situations involving random inputs and measurement noise.            The mathematical tools involved in this research are the theory of              stochastic processes, nonlinear partial differential equations,                 asymptotic methods and numerical methods."

Parameter estimates were obtained from experimental                     observations on one animal species (frogs), but properties of the               model are believed to be valid for many other species.

A feature common to many of these          systems is the existence of traveling wave solutions.  These                    correspond to solutions which appear to be traveling with constant shape        and velocity.  The objective of this project is to develop new                  techniques for proving the existence and stability of traveling wave            solutions.                                                                              There are two basic steps in the program outlined in this               project. The first consists of developing general methods for proving           the existence and stability of traveling wave solutions.  A basic               ingredient for these methods is the Conley index, a relatively recent           tool developed by the late Professor Charles Conley in 1977-1978.  The          second part consists of applications of the basic theory.  Specific             applications to be considered are the existence and stability of                traveling wave solutions arising from ecology and combustion, and the           existence of radially symmetric solutions of semilinear elliptic                systems.  This last problem is closely related to the question of the           existence of traveling wave solutions.                                                  The project presented by Professor Terman contains several sub-         projects related to various potential connections of this mathematical          theory to other scientific problems.  Professor Terman is a young               talented mathematician who has already established his leading                  position in this area of research."

In this project he           proposes to develop higher order conditions for optimality by applying a        new result called ""Nonsmooth Open Mapping Principle"".                                    The higher order necessary  conditions of optimality are used          to verify solutions obtained from the first order necessary conditions.         Sometimes the problem is mathematically degenerate and the first order          conditions provide no information on the nature of the optimal                  solutions.  In both cases, the second order conditions are useful.              Nonetheless, the development of general second order conditions is a            difficult mathematical problem.                                                          Professor Warga succeeded recently in developing such results          and intends to pursue this line of development.

First, he will translate earlier known results on the so called Hopf bifurcation (a change from non-periodic to periodic solutions due to a small change of a parameter) into new computational methods. The investigator has recently developed a technique to detect the existence of small periodic solutions which avoids the analysis of equations in the infinite dimensional state space. His method is based on the analysis of a scalar ""bifurcation function"", which can be computed in a very direct manner. He now proposes to extend the use of this technique to more general equations such as Volterra integral equations, functional differential equations of neutral type, and abstract functional differential equations. Second, the investigator will develop algorithms to locate numerically the values of parameters for which the Hopf bifurcation occurs. He will extend the existing methods to compute such bifurcation points by analyzing the characteristic equation of a linearized system, and by performing a numerical minimization of the norm of the left hand side. He will also use curve tracking procedures, similar to those developed for ordinary differential equations. He will also develop methods for computing the Floquet multipliers for the equations under study, by using collocation methods. Much of this work is technically difficult and requires substantial computational skill and resources. The investigator will use a Cray-2 supercomputer at the main campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Third, the investigator will study a number of concrete examples equations arising in applications, and will test his numerical methods on these examples. The results of this work are expected to provide new interpretations for dynamical phenomena encountered in a number of other disciplines. The University of Minnesota at Duluth is a primarily undergraduate institution which has good traditions of student involvment in research. In this project students will be employed to assist with programming and computations. Their involvment in this research will have a strong positive impact on their education, especially because of various possible interpretations of the results on the grounds of applications to other sciences. The project will be funded jointly with the Air Force Office of Scientific Research."
