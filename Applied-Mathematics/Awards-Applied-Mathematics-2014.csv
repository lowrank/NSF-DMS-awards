"1412598","Feedback Control Approaches to Uncertain Nonlinear Structured Population Models","DMS","APPLIED MATHEMATICS","09/01/2014","08/20/2014","Richard Rebarber","NE","University of Nebraska-Lincoln","Standard Grant","Victor Roytburd","08/31/2018","$142,429.00","","rrebarber1@unl.edu","2200 VINE ST BOX 830861","LINCOLN","NE","685032427","4024723171","MPS","1266","9150","$0.00","Like engineering systems, population systems often involve nonlinear feedback loops, parameter uncertainty, and external (often persistent) disturbances. For instance, in plant populations, seedling recruitment is often a nonlinear feedback of the structured population. As another example, populations coupled via dispersal are naturally described by a closed-loop feedback system. This project will develop techniques for the analysis and control of a class of nonlinear structured population models with uncertainties and disturbances. Any ecological system is subject to a wide range of natural disturbances and parameters uncertainties, and in population management it is critical to do a robustness analysis of the effect of these disturbances and uncertainties on the population. This research project aims to obtain new mathematical results about stability analysis, tracking controllers, and observers and observer-based controllers, and robustness for these systems. Optimal control, where a cost function is to be minimized, has also been used frequently in ecology. Proportional-integral-derivative controllers are feedbacks of observed measurements, and are known to have good robustness properties. This work introduces ideas from robust feedback control theory into management of plant and animal populations, with a particular emphasis on endangered plants. The results of this research project will have potential impact in environmental, economic, and social policy areas. <br/><br/>The concepts of robustness of feedback loops, small gains, absolute stability, and input-to-state stability are well suited to modeling and analysis of uncertain, structured, nonlinear population dynamics. Feedback control can be applied robustly without knowledge of the probability distributions of the uncertainties and disturbances, so that it can be applied to some models for which a stochastic analysis is not possible. We study the class of Lure systems, which can be described as a feedback interconnection between a linear system and a nonlinearity. We consider these systems in either discrete time or continuous time, and with either a finite dimensional state space or an infinite dimensional state space. We include uncertainties and disturbances in the model. We propose to develop mathematics that will extend systems theory techniques and concepts to Lure systems that describe structured populations. A key feature is the interplay between the linear part and nonlinear part, and will require a combination of classical engineering input-output techniques and mathematical state space analysis. Our key goals are: to determine the asymptotic stability structure of the uncontrolled continuous time system; to study the effect of a tracking controllers, which are feedback controllers that uses an observation of the system (instead of the whole state) as their input; and to construct and analyze an observer and observer-based controller for Lure systems. An observer is a dynamical system that takes the observation of the original system as its input, and asymptotically reconstructs the whole state of the original system. We will apply these results and techniques to population management problems."

This project is laying the groundwork both for the determination of these hidden structures and for analyzing specific situations arising in several applications. Among these is the embryonic development of the wing of a fruit fly and its newly discovered relation to current through potassium channels in the cell membrane.  Part of this project is to develop and use sophisticated mathematical techniques to understand that ionic current.  The fruit fly model has implications for mammalian development and may lead to an understanding of the cause of some serious birth defects. Applications of the abstract mathematical investigations also include understanding of other dynamical systems subject to random perturbations, including the density distribution in highly excited plasmas or the fine structure of an alloy and how defects are distributed and evolve in time.  <br/><br/>This project builds upon the past work of the principal investigators and others to establish the existence of coherent structures embedded in the phase space of complex dynamical systems, both finite- and infinite-dimensional and both deterministic or subject to random forcing.  The fundamental and abstract theory to be developed during the course of the project lies behind concrete and observed phenomena in the physical and biological sciences, particularly at the molecular, microscopic, or nano-scale.  Infinite-dimensional dynamical systems are required to represent the temporal and spatial fluctuations of quantities subject to physical laws or biochemical processes, such as the distribution of bone morphogenic protein in a developing embryonic fly wing, the current through an ion channel in a cell membrane, the density of a relativistic plasma, or the motion of microscopic defects in an alloy, to name just a few of the systems considered in this project.  Furthermore, as complex as these may be, stochastic perturbations must be considered due to thermal or other fluctuations in the environment and imprecise measurement of quantities at small scales.  While one cannot hope to give exact representations of all states subject to complex spatial and temporal interaction, one can sometimes glean information due to the presence of robust, but possibly hidden, structures such as invariant manifolds and their invariant foliations whose existence is implied by the laws governing the processes under investigation.  The goals of this project are to discover the conditions under which such structures exist, even when stochastically forced, and to examine the implications in the particular physical and biological systems underlying the equations."

One key property is called stability. Roughly speaking, a solution is stable if when it is perturbed it still returns back to the original behavior as time evolves. In the real world, one expects a system to experience frequent small perturbations, for example due to unpredictable external inputs or noise. If a particular state is unstable, such fluctuations will drive the system away from it, towards a stable state. Thus, it is only the stable solutions that one expects to be observable in the long run. Mathematical models can provide insight into which solutions of a given system are stable, and how that stability depends on system parameters. This can help scientists in other disciplines predict which parameter ranges may be of interest in order to observe certain behaviors, thus suggesting what to test in experimental settings. Moreover, the models can provide information as to which physical mechanism is of primary importance in determining stability. <br/><br/>The main goal of the project is to develop general mathematical techniques that are applicable to a variety of specific models, rather than to any one particular application. There are two types of stability that the principal investigator has focused on: (1) Asymptotic stability, meaning that the solution attracts nearby data as time evolves towards infinity; (2) Metastability, meaning that the solution attracts nearby data for large, but finite, times. The notion of asymptotic stability is relatively standard, and the fact that it allows for analysis in the limit as time tends towards infinity greatly simplifies the associated techniques. Nevertheless important open questions remain, such the stability of   time-periodic patterns known as defects and the potential use of the Maslov index in understanding stability in spatial dimensions greater than one, and they will be addressed in this project. Metastability is a more subtle phenomenon, with far fewer methods for its analysis, and so advances in this area are of fundamental importance. Whether asymptotic or metastable solutions are more important in determining the observed behavior of a given system is dependent on the associated timescales. For example, if the asymptotically stable states are approached only on exponentially long time scales, then one would not expect to wait long enough to observe them in practice. In that case, the metastable states, which then appear during the long, intermediate times, become more relevant. This occurs, for example, in the Navier-Stokes equations, an important model of fluid dynamics, and this project will develop methods for analyzing metastability in this context."

To understand the behavior of such approximations, this project explores similarities and differences in the dynamic behavior of the original model and what is obtained through numerical simulations. Understanding when the original model and numerical simulations yield similar dynamic behavior leads to greater confidence when making inferences from simulation results. In addition, stability analysis is useful in understanding the robustness of complex biological and physical phenomena. Of particular emphasis in this project is the application of these results to the dynamic behavior of models of climate dynamics. The techniques to be developed include approaches to dimension reduction and uncertainty quantification based upon Lyapunov exponent theory. The understanding of biological and physical processes will increase due to the computational techniques developed to address the dynamic behavior of detailed, microscopic models. <br/><br/>In many areas of science and engineering dynamical systems are employed as models of complex phenomena. The focus of this project is on approximation of solutions of nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular, the investigator and colleagues are interested in understanding the dynamics of the finite dimensional approximations and how they relate to the dynamics of the original dynamical system. The main research topics to be investigated are related to the application of time dependent orthogonal change of variables and in the dynamics of traveling waves under discretization. Specific interests include the use of Lyapunov vectors (analogues of eigenvectors in time dependent stability analysis) for dimensional reduction of dissipative nonlinear differential equations, robust stability for time dependent linear Hamiltonian systems, and techniques for analyzing time dependent stability of numerical time stepping techniques, stability of plane wave solutions to bistable reaction-diffusion equations in periodic media, the impact of time and space discretization on traveling waves, and non-planar traveling waves in discrete media. Techniques to investigate these systems combine numerical analysis and dynamical systems ideas to gain a better understanding of computational dynamics both qualitatively and quantitatively."

A primary goal of this research is to provide further insights into possible mechanisms that generate extremely high waves frequently observed in open seas and along coastlines. Important examples of such phenomena include tsunamis. Understanding the nature and dynamics of such extreme waves, particularly in oceans near highly populated coastal areas, is a significant and urgent task. The research activities will involve undergraduate and graduate students who will be trained in the field of applied mathematics and will gain first-hand research experience. It is further anticipated that the results from the proposed work would be useful in the study of similar nonlinear wave phenomena that occur in other physical problems including nonlinear optics, plasmas, and spin waves in magnetic thin films.<br/><br/>The nonlinear waves indicated above are closely described by the weakly dispersive, quasi-two-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation which admits a class of solitary wave solutions with complex two-dimensional web patterns.

Broadly speaking, this project has two main goals that are interrelated, namely, (1) to study solitary wave interactions observed in certain physical situations such as shallow water where the KP equation describes the leading order model, and (2) to investigate the detailed structure of the complex two-dimensional patterns of the KP web-solitons using geometric and combinatorial theories, which bring new techniques to the area of nonlinear waves. In particular, detailed analytical and numerical studies of the interactions, stability and initial value problem of the KP web-solitons will be conducted in this project. Furthermore, the project envisions collaboration with experimentalists in order to compare the obtained theoretical results with laboratory experiments performed in water wave tanks."

They will develop and implement numerical algorithms for large-scale location problems, some involving different types of distance metrics, etc. The methods being built will be used to study other non-smooth optimization models in computational geometry and machine learning.

Functions of this type, are intrinsically non-differentiable, and play an important role in the theory of variational analysis and its applications. In particular, the PI and his colleagues focus on two classes of optimal value functions: the minimal time function, which is a natural extension of the closest distance function, and the maximal time function, which is an extension of the farthest distance function. Generalized differentiation properties of the optimal value function are used to study necessary and sufficient conditions on initial data that guarantee different properties of the optimal value function such as continuity, Lipschitz continuity, and differentiability. Results obtained here contribute to development of numerical algorithms  for the solution of non-smooth optimization problems in facility location, computational geometry, and machine learning. Generalized differentiation properties of the optimal value function as well as advanced smoothing techniques and fast gradient methods are investigated in order to develop effective numerical algorithms for solving these problems."

Many of the most prominent devices, such as dye-sensitized and bulk-heterojunction solar cells, lithium ion batteries, and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, rely upon ionomer membranes with charge-selective transport properties that arise from nanoscale networks of charge-lined pores.  Progress in the improvement of these devices requires new materials based upon a fundamental understanding of the formation of these pore networks, which typically self-assemble during casting processes.  The investigator presents a mathematical framework that characterizes the evolution of network morphologies arising in blends of charged polymer (amphiphile) with solvent.  A better understanding of how these networks shape themselves can enable the development of better devices.  The framework is based upon an incorporation of the powerful descriptive properties of dynamical systems within a higher-order free energy landscape.  Students are trained in the course of the project. <br/><br/>The Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard (FCH) free energy unites the languages of dynamical systems and calculus of variations to produce a model of network self-assembly in amphiphilic polymers that play a central role in the cost-efficient self-assembly of materials with nano-structured interfacial morphology.  The investigator studies the mechanisms of geometric evolution and competition-induced bifurcation of network morphologies of binary and multicomponent amphiphilic systems within the framework of gradient flows of the FCH free energy.  For binary mixtures of amphiphilic polymer and solvent, the investigator analyzes the pearling bifurcation induced by competition between codimension one bilayer morphologies and codimension two pore morphologies.  Rigorous existence of pearled morphologies for curved codimension one interfaces are derived via spatial dynamics center manifold reduction, and rigorous sharp-interface reductions of FCH gradient flows to mass-preserving Willmore flows via renormalization group techniques are pursued.  End cap and line defects play a significant role in the evolution of network morphologies, and the investigators characterizes reduced representations for these defect structures and quantifies their impact on roll-up of bicelles (a bicelle is a flat bilayer with an end-cap boundary).  For multicomponent mixtures, the investigator follows three approaches to the bilayer existence problem: a novel billiard limit involving a piece-wise smooth potential with sharp transitions, a homomorphic reduction, and a singular perturbation limit.  Each approach permits explicit construction of coexisting symmetric and asymmetric bilayer morphologies, and an analysis of the resulting bifurcation structure.  The investigator derives a sharp-interface competitive geometric evolution for families of distinct, coexisting bilayer networks and a non-zero intrinsic curvature limit for asymmetric bilayers subject to non-gradient form perturbations."

Fluid flows exhibit high degree of complexity and can easily develop intense structures. Better fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of creation of intense features in fluid flows is very important for many applications in engineering, weather forecasting and other fields. The first direction of the proposal seeks to study classical equations of fluid mechanics focussing on situations where intense fluid motion can develop spontaneously. Recent novel results obtained by the PI in this direction provide hopes for an essential advance in understanding these complex and important phenomena. In the second direction, a study of most efficient ways of mixing in fluid flow is proposed. Efficient mixing is of critical importance in many applications, ranging from combustion in engines to ecology. In the third direction, the PI will study the role of chemical sensing and chemical attraction for enhancement of reactions in biology. One situation where it is relevant involves healing of the body, where infected or injured tissues releases special compounds which attract immune system cells to fight the infection.  Chemical attraction can also be an undesirable effect: some tumors are known to rely on this mechanism for their growth. The PI plans to develop new mathematical tools to analyze these more advanced and better predictive models. The project involves a training component, where junior researchers at all levels will be mentored as scholars and educators and will work on research projects under the guidance of the PI. <br/><br/>The first main focus of the proposal is on studying solutions of the classical equations of fluid mechanics, such as incompressible Euler, Navier-Stokes and 2D Boussinesq system. Recent numerical simulations of Hou and Luo suggest a new scenario for singularity formation for solutions of the 3D Euler equation. The scenario is axi-symmetric, and singularity formation happens at the boundary. The scenario also applies for the 2D inviscid Boussinesq system. Inspired by the geometry of the scenario, the PI (jointly with Vladimir Sverak) has constructed examples of solutions of 2D Euler equation with double exponential growth in vorticity gradient. Such growth is known to be sharp. The PI intends to use new insights obtained in the construction to approach more complex and long open questions for 2D Boussinesq system and 3D Euler equation. Methods employed will include functional analysis, Fourier analysis, PDE techniques and novel comparison principles. The second direction concerns efficiency of mixing in fluids given constraints on fluid velocity. Bounds on the mixing rates under various types of constraints and boundary conditions as well as insight into the nature of best mixing flows will be sought. This area lies at the intersection of dynamical systems, PDE and Fourier analysis. The third direction involves effects of chemical attraction between reacting species on the rates of reaction. Chemical attraction will be modeled by the Keller-Segel and related nonlinear terms. The PI proposes to obtain qualitative results about the behavior of solutions in such systems, and to derive precise bounds describing the strength of the effect and its dependence on various key parameters. Sharp bounds on convergence to equlibirum for Fokker-Planck operators with certain natural classes of potentials will also be obtained."

The first is the development of new methods for analysis of active scalar equations. These are nonlinear and nonlocal partial differential equations that, in particular, include classical two-dimensional Euler equation describing ideal fluid flow, and surface quasi-geostrophic equation arising in atmospheric science. Active scalars have been used to model a wide range of phenomena in nature, including formation of fronts in atmosphere, diffusion in porous medium and evolution of vortex sheets. Research will build on recent work of the principal investigator (PI) by finding more general maximum principles (bounds controlling solutions). A novel aspect of this research is that these bounds are nonlocal, which may be just the right fit for nonlocal equations like active scalars. New techniques are expected to provide progress on key questions in mathematical fluid mechanics involving structure of solutions to active scalar equations, their regularity and possible singularity formation. The second direction focuses on enhancement of diffusion by fluid flow. Numerous processes in nature and engineering, starting from nuclear burning in stars to combustion in engines to reactions in living organisms depend on this phenomenon. The goal is, building on the earlier research of the PI, to improve understanding of flows that are most efficient in speeding up diffusion and mixing. The problem is at the interface of partial differential equations, dynamical systems and Fourier analysis. The methods to be developed here will be relevant in a more general context. They apply in problems that involve convergence to equilibrium in systems that contain both dissipative and fast unitary parts of dynamics. The third direction, biomixing, is motivated by a problem of coral broadcast spawning that has been communicated to the PI by an oceanographer. It involves studying improvement of the efficiency of biological reactions by chemotaxis. A model is proposed that adds chemotaxis term to the previously studied models of the process. The effect chemotaxis has on fertilization rate is likely to be crucial for health of many biosystems. The goal of this direction of the project will be to better understand coral spawning process and quantify an important role chemotaxis plays in achieving the reproduction success.<br/><br/>The project focuses on several problems in fluid mechanics. In one direction, novel techniques are developed that will provide insight into behavior of solutions to equations modeling diverse phenomena from temperature evolution in the atmosphere to traffic flow dynamics. In other direction, the problem of mixing in fluid flow will be studied, and classes of flows that are most efficient mixers will be identified. The question of efficient mixing is of interest in many industries, including food processing and chemical engineering. Another direction of the project research improves reproduction models for a class of marine animals including corals. Coral atolls are important ecosystems that are under stress worldwide due to climate change and pollution. The models that will be developed in the project are important for better understanding of coral life cycle, and will be of interest in oceanography and ecology. The project has a significant and broad training component, and will involve a postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students working on problems related to the project research."

The present research  will seek advances in the understanding of solutions with large data, and error propagation in case when, as it happens in real-life situations, the initial conditions are not known with absolute precision.

In particular, these models will account for  the possible spill-back of queues along roads leading to a congested intersection. At a second stage, the PI will study traffic patterns arising as<br/>(i) global optima, where departures are scheduled by a central planner in order to minimize a global cost to all drivers, and  <br/>(ii) Nash equilibria,  where each driver selects a departure time and a route to destination, in order to minimize his/her own individual cost.<br/>In connection with recent technological advances in the collection of traffic data and the automatic driving of cars, developing efficient mathematical models will provide an important step toward the prediction and the optimal control of traffic flow. <br/><br/>The first  part of  the research aims at  fundamental advances in the  theory of  conservation laws and nonlinear wave equations. In particular, building upon recent progress, the PI will study the global existence of solutions with large total variation and  the appearance of vacuum in finite time, for isentropic gas dynamics. The research will rely on a number of new approaches.<br/>(i) In the study of gas dynamics, a priori estimates or examples of blow-up will first be studied within certain classes of approximate solutions, which are easier to describe and that capture the essential features of true solutions. <br/>(ii) In the analysis of error estimates,  geodesic distances will be used, whenever  the standard Sobolev norms do not yield useful information.  <br/>In some interesting cases, the specific form of these metrics is motivated by  optimal transportation problems.   <br/>(iii) For the new models of traffic flow at a junction of roads, a solution will be constructed as the fixed point of a contractive transformation, defined by a novel version of the Lax formula.<br/>The PI serves as Director of a new Center for Interdisciplinary Mathematics at Penn State.  Its primary goal is to foster scientific interactions, widening the use and appreciation of modern mathematical techniques as effective research tools in a variety of disciplines.   Some of the topics of the present proposal, such as traffic flow models, are naturally interdisciplinary and will be included in the activities of the Center."

One such example is ionic solutions in animals or humans. Biology and physiology has shown that understanding ionic solutions is essential in almost all biological activities. The mechanical and electrical interactions of molecular-scale microstructures with macroscopic flow in complex fluids can give rise to new phenomena not encountered in simple fluids or gases. New mathematical theories and techniques are needed to resolve the ever present fundamental issues such as the ensemble of micro-elements, the intermolecular and distortional elastic interactions, the coupling of hydrodynamic transport and the applied electric or magnetic fields. This project investigates the use of a very general energetic variational framework to derive and study the dynamics of complex fluids, and its applications to general viscoelastic fluids, the hydrodynamics of electrolytes and electro-rheological fluids, and the transport of ionic solutions in ion channels. The proposed research also provides the opportunity for students to have multidisciplinary experiences in mathematics, bioengineering, and neurophysiology.<br/><br/>This project aims at making several distinct mathematical advances and to integrate studies of these physical and biological complex fluids from different fields. The common feature of the systems that the PI proposes to study is the underlying energetic variational structure among all these materials and systems. The PI will focus on understanding the coupling and competing effects from different spatial or temporal scales, among them the microstructures and the macroscopic properties of the solutions, the kinetic transport and the induced elastic stresses in viscoelastic materials, the relative drags and interactions between different species in mixtures. Energetic variational methods have shown promise for the study of such multiscale multiphysics problems, for instance the transport of ionic solutions through biological environments. They deal naturally with systems with many components that flow between fixed and moving domains or boundaries, and with different interactions.  We will apply such variational methods to study the transport of biological plasma, ionic solutions of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, and their interaction with different environments and structures."

The aim is to provide an accurate, practical, detailed description of these coherent wave structures that is useful for applications in nanomagnetism and the fluid dynamics of dissipationless, dispersive media.  Motivated by recent experiments, time-periodic, localized solutions of a modified Landau-Lifshitz equation that incorporates a spin transfer torque forcing term to compensate damping will be computed and studied analytically using asymptotic methods.  These magnetic droplet solitons and their generalizations have potential for technological applications. Another research front will be developed involving modulated nonlinear wavetrains or dispersive shock waves (DSWs).  The generation of DSWs represents a universal mechanism to resolve hydrodynamic singularities in dispersive media such as water waves, plasma, optics, interfacial fluids, Bose-Einstein condensates, and two-phase, viscously deformable fluids.  Theoretical studies will focus upon central questions of modern DSW theory including loss of genuine nonlinearity/strict hyperbolicity in the modulation equations, multi-dimensional DSWs, and stability.  In collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students, the principal investigator will undertake experiments involving a viscous fluid conduit system in order to make quantitative measurements of DSW properties for comparison with theory.<br/><br/>When wave properties intrinsically depend upon the wave amplitude, novel physical behavior can arise.  With a view toward applications, this project encompasses two classes of these nonlinear waves: solitary waves in nanomagnetism and shock waves in dispersive media.  Spintronics encompasses the effort to develop information transport, processing, and storage using the electron's spin in addition to its charge, for example, to continue Moore's Law (the doubling of the number of transistors per unit area every eighteen months) beyond present technological limitations.  The spatially localized spin excitations in a nanomagnet to be studied in this project possess features that hold great promise for future spintronic applications.  Viscous shock waves that form when a projectile exceeds the speed of sound in air are commonly understood. The dispersive shock waves studied in this project are of a very different type, lacking dissipation and realized as expanding, oscillatory wavetrains.  A fluid experiment will be developed to carefully measure these shock properties while also being used as an educational, outreach, and demonstration tool, providing young mathematicians direct experience with nonlinear waves.  Presentations at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will provide the general public with exposure to this fascinating field."

Many practical error correcting codes are constructed via algebraic curves over finite fields. These codes have been extensively studied from both theoretical and practical point of views. However, many questions still remain open, particularly on code structures, code constructions and decoding complexity. This project will strive to study structural properties and decoding algorithms for codes from algebraic geometry with the aim of making these codes more amenable to applications. The project is multi-disciplinary lying at the crossroads of mathematics, computer science,and electronic engineering. It bridges pure mathematics, particularly discrete mathematics and algebraic geometry, with practical applications in digital communications. Any new result or any good algorithm for codes could be used to improve communication capability in practice. <br/><br/>Algebraic geometry (AG) codes have a tremendous amount of algebraic structure. Exploiting this algebraic structure enables construction of codes, efficient encoding, and efficient decoding. While many advances in decoding algorithms for AG codes has been made in the last decade, most of these apply only to one-point AG codes. Multipoint codes can have much better parameters than comparable one-point codes. This project will study how to realize this advantage in term of encoding and decoding algorithms. Another important issue relates to explicit constructions of bases for AG codes, especially those from curves in higher dimensional spaces (function field towers). This project studies both list decoding beyond half distance and fast unique decoding below half distance. Techniques include power series and Grobner bases. For many AG codes, even if decoding is only up to half distance, their error control capability is much higher than Reed-Solomon codes which are widely used in practice. To make AG codes more suitable for practical implementations, the project aims to reduce the decoding complexity and memory requirements via power series representations."

This equation may serve, for example, to describe both certain water waves and the propagation of light in optical fibers. However, the nonlinear nature of this equation is an obstacle that prevents the straightforward application of most existing general-purpose mathematical tools.  This project will use the special structure of this equation to examine in detail two features of its solutions, called modulational instability (MI) and supercontinuum generation (SCG). While the starting point of these investigations is based on the mathematical properties of the NLS equation, MI and SCG are important phenomena in the real world. For example, MI has been proposed as an important element in the formation of ""rogue waves"" in the ocean; these rare but relatively large and spontaneous waves may be quite dangerous. Furthermore, SCG is important in optical telecommunications systems and in optical coherence tomography, an imaging technique used in opthalmology to reveal detailed retinal structures. A better understanding of this mathematical phenomenon thus has the potential to influence the design and development of telecommunications systems and optical devices.<br/> <br/>This project's investigation of MI and SCG is based on the initial-value problem for the focusing NLS equation in the small-dispersion regime. In this regime, nonlinear effects are dominant, and solutions exhibit small-scale oscillations and violent transitions (nonlinear caustics) to even more complicated oscillatory patterns. Both MI and SCG figure prominently in this behavior. Indeed, in the limit of vanishing dispersion (also known as the semiclassical limit), MI suggests that a generic plane wave solution may be expected to break immediately into some other, presumably more disordered, form. However, recent results show that there do exist distinguished perturbations which do not excite the acute modulational instabilities known to be present in the small-dispersion regime. This project will incorporate such special perturbations into the broader theory of the zero-dispersion limit of the focusing NLS equation. As part of this effort, a scheme for classifying and describing these perturbations will be developed. Once this is done, the import of such special perturbations for applications can be assessed. Another component of this research will be to extend a non-standard method for computing the Fourier Power Spectrum of solutions to a broader class of initial data; once completed, this method will give a new, direct way to measure the impact of wave breaking (nonlinear caustics) on SCG."

Such situations are described by stochastic systems, where suitable assumptions are made about the stochastic nature of the unknown parameters and forcing in the system. Frequently, one is interested in controlling the system through control parameters or forcing with the goal of optimizing a given ""cost"" functional. For example, in the context of finance, the net worth is described by an stochastic differential equation, the controls are the shares placed in the various assets, and the goal is to optimize a functional of the net worth. The goal of this research is the study of optimal control and adaptive control of stochastic systems. The solutions of such problems require algorithms for parameter identification and the determination of explicit optimal controls.  The noise processes used in this project are empirically determined and belong to a class of fractional Brownian motions. In addition to the investigation of problems of stochastic optimal and adaptive control some problems of two-person zero-sum stochastic differential games will be studied.  These games can model many situations of two competing players or interest groups so they often arise.  These stochastic problems in control and differential games will be studied for both continuous and discrete time systems. The proposal will also engage undergraduate and graduate students, as well as high school students, in research on stochastic problems.<br/><br/>Stochastic optimal control problems for a variety of systems, cost functionals, and noise processes will be studied with the particular emphasis on obtaining explicit optimal controls.  The proposers have developed a method that does not require solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations or using a stochastic maximum principle and can be applied to systems with general noise processes that are not Markov or semimartingales.  The systems include both discrete and continuous time and linear and nonlinear systems.  Two person zero sum stochastic differential games will also be investigated for both linear and nonlinear equations to determine explicit optimal control strategies for the two players by a direct method.  Since stochastic systems often contain unknown parameters, the problems of adaptive control, which connote the simultaneous identification of parameters and the control of the system will be investigated for linear systems with ergodic (long run average) quadratic and exponential quadratic cost functionals and noise processes that are fractional Brownian motions or other processes with stationary increments.  The stochastic systems for control to be studied are both finite dimensional and infinite dimensional.  The infinite dimensional systems that evolve in Hilbert spaces can model both parabolic and hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations with fractional Brownian motion noise.  The control and the noise can be restricted to the boundary of the domain or to discrete points in the domain."

Stability of solitary waves is of paramount importance for the physical processes, with direct relevance to engineering applications. For example, transmission of a signal through an optical channel is feasible only if the shapes of the corresponding pulses do not deteriorate during the transmission, i.e., when they are stable. The workshop will provide a venue to stimulate exchange of ideas among the leading US and European mathematicians in the areas of stability of solitary waves.

However, the effects of these changes are two-fold.  On the one hand, they increase the competition and provide additional liquidity to the market, which, in particular, manifests itself in reduced bid-ask spreads.  On the other hand, the new technology introduces opportunities for the better-equipped participants (e.g. the high-frequency traders) to adjust their positions rapidly, in order to take advantage of the trading needs of other investors.  The latter may result in a sudden reduction of the market liquidity, which was well demonstrated by the so-called flash crash of 2010.  As financial processes affect all parts of modern life, it is crucial for society to be able to analyze and control the financial stability of markets.  The investigator develops tools for quantitative analysis of the tradeoff between the liquidity-providing role of strategic traders and the liquidity risk they generate.  Such tools can be used to predict and avoid future liquidity crises, as well as to test the potential effects of new financial regulation (e.g. a transaction tax or limits on trading frequency). <br/><br/>     The investigator develops a rigorous mathematical framework for modeling market microstructure and liquidity risk by analyzing the real-world system of market participants (agents) who interact with each other through trading.  The macroscopic properties of this system are described by the so-called limit order book, whose shape and dynamics arise endogenously from the actions of individual agents, rather than being taken as an input to the model.  The approach is based on the methods of mean-field games, which allow for the analytically tractable description of an equilibrium in stochastic games with a large number of interacting agents.  One of the challenges of the project is the complicated dependence structure between the dynamics of individual agents.  For example, any realistic model of the above system requires that the agents interact through their control values, rather than through their states.  This artifact introduces an additional constraint to the classical forward-backward system describing a mean-field game model, making the analysis more complicated.  Another mathematical challenge is due to the fact that the control process of each agent takes values in the space of measures, which represent the limit orders submitted by the agent.  As a result, the use of infinite-dimensional analysis is required to obtain an analytic characterization of the solutions to the associated optimization problems.  Finally, an important problem arising in this line of study is the convergence of the proposed discrete time mean-field games to the continuous time limit.  In particular, in order to address this problem, the investigator extends the existing results on discrete time approximation of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to the setting that allows for measure-valued controls.  The project provides a natural framework for quantifying the tradeoff between the liquidity-providing role of the strategic players (e.g. the high-frequency traders) and the liquidity risk they generate.  In particular, the resulting models can be used to obtain real-time predictions of the potential liquidity crises (e.g. flash crashes), as well as to test the implications of new financial regulation."

In contrast with fixed boundaries, free boundaries are determined by the dynamics of the problem itself, a typical toy example being the boundary of a piece of ice melting in a glass of water. Problems of fluid-vacuum interfaces arise in the study of dynamics of boundaries of stars in astrophysics or in multi-phase flows.  In multi-phase fluids (like blood) fluid-fluid interfaces problems arise. Frequently they involve the study of fluid-deformable structure interfaces such as in cell deformation.  Physical vacuum is a natural medium (or rather the lack of any medium) where fluids may spread, such as in the boundary motion of gaseous stars, or propagation of the interface between the gas or liquid and vacuum in flows through porous media. <br/><br/>This research project deals with vacuum free boundary problems for some systems of conservation laws in multi-dimensions arising in fluid dynamics and astrophysics. Some new analytic and geometric methods will be developed in this project to achieve the following goals: 1) to establish the long time well-posedness theory and understand long time dynamics for the vacuum free boundary problems for the three spatial dimensional Euler-Poisson and Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations of gaseous stars, capturing the physical vacuum singularity, 2) to establish the vanishing viscosity limit theory for the vacuum free boundary problems for the three spatial dimensional Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations of gaseous stars, capturing the physical vacuum singularity, 3) to elucidate the role of the heat conductivity to the dynamics of physical vacuum boundary of gaseous stars, 4) to establish the long time well-posedness theory for solutions to the vacuum free boundary problem for the three spatial dimensional compressible Euler equations with damping and understand the interface behavior of solutions related to the celebrated Barenblatt self-similar solutions to porous media equations. New ideas and techniques to be developed in this project will contribute to a general theory of degenerate hyperbolic, coupled hyperbolic-parabolic and hyperbolic-elliptic free boundary problems. This project will also provide training opportunities to some graduate and undergraduate students in applied mathematics."

Mathematics plays a vital role in the design of such circuits by providing applied scientists and engineers with predictive models that describe how to achieve desired design goals.  These predictive models must take into account the 'delay' that results from the synthesis of functional protein inside cells.  Recent high-resolution laboratory data and theoretical investigations have shown that this type of delay helps naturally-occurring organisms achieve biologically desirable results: it can accelerate signaling, stabilize biochemical networks, and create tunable oscillations.  The principal investigator and his colleagues develop the mathematical theory needed to help explain how delay shapes the dynamics of genetic circuits as well as study certain associated infinite-dimensional models.  Synthetic biologists use this theory to inform the design and implementation of synthetic genetic circuits for use in medicine and industry.<br/><br/>'Delay' is now recognized as an important component of genetic regulatory networks and biochemical networks  more generally.  Given the pace of technological innovation in synthetic biology and the availability of high-resolution biological data, there is need for a mathematical theory applicable to the dynamics of delay systems.  The principal investigator (PI) and his colleagues leverage and extend techniques from both probability theory and abstract ergodic theory to study the interplay between stochasticity and delay on multiple levels.  First, the PI and his colleagues study the rare events problem for delay stochastic processes.  Specific topics include large deviations rates, optimal transition paths, mean first passage times, numerical simulation, and importance sampling.  Further, the PI and his colleagues develop a method by which time series data may be used to estimate the distribution of biochemical delay.  Such a method is valuable because delay distributions are difficult to measure experimentally.  Second, the PI and his collaborators study the stochasticity that can arise after one takes thermodynamic limits of delay stochastic models.  Such stochasticity may be called 'statistical coherence.'  it arises from dynamical instabilities in the deterministic limits.  When one takes the thermodynamic limit of a delay stochastic differential equation, one obtains a delay differential equation (DDE).  From the ergodic-theoretic point of view, a DDE may be viewed as a functional differential equation (FDE) that generates a solution semigroup on a suitable Banach space of functions.  Similarly, certain evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) generate solution semigroups on suitable Banach spaces.  These solution semigroups are infinite-dimensional dynamical systems; the PI and his colleagues study statistical coherence in the FDE and PDE contexts. They do this by isolating specific geometric mechanisms that produce nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamics.  In this context new notions of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measure must be developed.  SRB measures form a cornerstone of statistical coherence because they govern the asymptotic distribution of large sets of orbits in the function space.  Crucially, checkable conditions that imply the existence of SRB measures for concrete FDEs and PDEs are developed.  Statistical properties such as central limit theorem behavior, decay of correlations, invariance principles, extreme value statistics, and stochastic stability are investigated.  This work informs the modeling, experimental study, and design of biochemical systems and introduces a large new class of physically relevant examples to the abstract dynamical systems community."

The work to be undertaken under this funding will do two things: (1) develop fundamental new mathematics to enhance our understanding of the structure and function of networks of all types, and (2) employ that mathematical foundation in the creation of new measures, metrics, and computer algorithms for practical application to real-world network problems.  The work will draw on mathematical methods from two areas in which the PI has worked extensively: Statistics (Bayesian inference) and spectral theory.  Using these tools the PI and his students and collaborators will develop techniques to tackle a range of network problems, including: the detection of communities of interacting nodes or individuals within larger networks; the identification of the most influential or core nodes with a network; the understanding and prediction of spreading processes on networks, including the spread of diseases over human contact networks; fast and scalable computer algorithms for the analysis of network data on the largest scales; and specific applications to a range of technological, social, and information networks.<br/><br/>This grant will fund a three-year research effort to develop fundamental mathematical tools for understanding large, real-world networks such as the Internet, the World Wide Web, biological networks, epidemiological contact networks, social networks, and others.

Recent work by the PI's group and others has produced significant advances, including a number of results revealing deep and previously unsuspected connections between spectral and inference methods. These advances have opened up substantial avenues for new research whose exploration is the primary goal of the proposed work.  Specific projects to be undertaken include the development of random matrix and free probability methods for computing spectra of complex networks within several widely used structural models; development of new inference algorithms for features such as core/periphery structure and centrality, particularly based on belief propagation methods; connections between inference and spectral methods, particularly via the Hashimoto operator which appears in the theory of graph zeta functions; spectral localization and the development of improved spectral centrality measures; applications to network processes such as percolation and disease transmission, which can be treated using belief propagation and hence connected to spectral properties of graphs; applications to spectral algorithms for multiway community detection and other large-scale structure detection problems; connections between spectral and inference methods derived from relaxations of the likelihood function; and model selection methods for network inference."

It is concerned with the theory and applications of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) type equations.  These equations are among the most fundamental nonlinear partial differential equations because they describe a wide range of phenomena in nature from phase transitions, superconductivity, and superfluidity to liquid crystals and motility in biosystems.  The project consists of two parts, with mathematics of GL type equations being the unifying theme.  The first part is primarily motivated by the quest for energy-efficient materials that comprise a foundation for a new generation of superconductivity-based microelectronics.  In practical applications the current passing through a superconductor creates magnetic vortices that move, dissipate the energy, and thus result in power loss.  This poses the problem of immobilizing the vortices, known as the problem of vortex pinning.  The second part is motivated by the problem of motility of eukaryotic cells on substrates.  The study of cell motility has been a classical subject in biology for several centuries, dating back to the celebrated discovery by van Leeuwenhoek.  Cell motility is an important ingredient of many biological processes, e.g., epithelial cells crawling across open wounds aid in their healing.  The investigator develops mathematical techniques to address these fundamental problems in physics and biology.  Graduate students are trained as part of this project. <br/><br/>     The project consists of two parts unified by the ideas and asymptotic methods of multiscale analysis applied to GL type PDEs.  First, the investigator studies pinning and vortex phase separation in superconductors, with focus on the study of a novel terraced vortex structure that appears due to the subtle interplay between extremal values of physical parameters (such as the magnitude of the magnetic field, size of pinning sites, and size of the superconducting sample).  A two-parameter asymptotic problem that models the vortex phase separation phenomenon in superconductors with a large number of very small columnar defects is considered.  Then the homogenization techniques of Gamma-convergence suitable for the interplay between the energy concentrations due to vortices and strong spatial variations due to defects is developed.  Second, the investigator studies in a rigorous asymptotic framework a phase field model with volume constraints that describes cell motility.  The phase field function solves a scalar GL PDE (Allen-Cahn) with an additional term that provides a gradient coupling of this field with another governing field that satisfies a vectorial parabolic PDE.  The sharp interface limit in the presence of volume conservation constraints is studied.  A feature of this system is the gradient coupling that leads to an equation of interface motion driven by curvature and a novel nonlinear term.  Due to this coupling, previously developed classical viscosity solution techniques and recent Gamma-convergence techniques for gradient flows cannot be applied, so new methods are developed."

This has proven exceptionally useful in aerodynamics. The PI will develop mathematical tools to study the validity of boundary layer simplifications of viscous flows, and thereby provide a deeper understanding of physical observations and laboratory experiments. The PI will also establish mathematical criteria, under which coherent structures in oscillatory media and equilibria of a plasma are well behaved under disturbances. The search for a stability criterion is important in practice, for instance, in helping engineers design stable devices, which could otherwise be damaged by unstable waves. <br/><br/>The research focuses on mathematical questions concerned with the dynamics of boundary layers in fluid dynamics, the stability of coherent structures in oscillatory media, and the magnetic confinement of a plasma. The mathematical equations to be considered include the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, general reaction-diffusion systems, and the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell systems. Generic boundary layers of the Navier-Stokes equations are analytically shown to be spectrally unstable for sufficiently large Reynolds numbers.

Kernel methods are valued for their ability to treat such unstructured data. They are also important examples of meshless methods, computational tools that function successfully without the need of accompanying structures like grids or triangulations. The principal investigator plans to study analytic and computational properties of scalable localized bases (a powerful new methodology for working with kernels) and to use these bases to address some fundamental challenges in kernel based approximation. The investigator expects to generate algorithms that will be of use to scientists and engineers who work with unstructured data and large-scale datasets. Throughout the project, the investigator will mentor graduate students by involving them in both the theoretical and the applied aspects of this research.<br/><br/>Unlike other computational tools (like wavelets, splines and piecewise polynomial finite elements), kernel methods do not explicitly involve a scaling operation: as data becomes more dense, the kernel is not required to be dilated. This allows kernels to produce approximates from complex geometrical configurations where a single scale is not apparent. However, it often leads to problems involving large, poorly conditioned linear systems, the solution of which is both slow and unstable. It has been demonstrated that in many cases the underlying function spaces possess stable, highly localized bases that can be constructed rapidly.  There is compelling evidence that near linear processing of many computational problems is possible, and fast algorithms may exist to treat many of the basic operations involving kernels. The proposed research seeks to generate scalable bases in new settings (i.e., for new kernels and on new manifolds), to understand and overcome fundamental problems stemming from boundary effects and highly non-uniform arrangements of data, and ultimately to implement parallelized, fast algorithms for kernel approximation with these bases."

However, almost everyone has to admit that this is rarely the case. In fact, more often than not, an optimal policy made at the beginning of a period will not stay optimal thereafter; this phenomenon is called time-inconsistency. Studies show that the two main reasons for time-inconsistency are people's time-preferences and risk-preferences. An example of the former is that if there is no enforced contract, people may find it difficult to keep their promises. An example of the latter is that different groups of people will have different subjective views on the risk inherent in a certain stock purchase. Mainly due to these two types of preferences, the 'optimal' plan cannot stay optimal as time goes by. The current project is to quantitatively study such a problem from an optimal control point of view. The goal is to obtain time-consistent equilibrium strategies, under certain conditions, for time-inconsistent problems. We expect that the results of the proposed theory will increase our understanding of the time-inconsistency issue, and ultimately help in the making of better time-consistent decisions. <br/><br/>Mathematically, classical optimal control problems are time-consistent in the sense that an optimal control found at a given initial pair of time and state will stay optimal thereafter for the corresponding initial pair.

To obtain time-consistent open-loop equilibrium strategies, we will use variational methods, together with theory of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. To obtain time-consistent closed-loop equilibrium strategies, we will modify dynamic programming principles, and adopt/introduce multi-person differential games.

Typical examples are gases and fluids, which are made out of many atoms, as well as granular media like sand. An important question for such systems is how to describe their behavior at large scales. For example, under what conditions is the collective dynamics of a large number of grains of sand similar to the behavior of a fluid, and when is it not? Questions like this are of considerable interest from a purely scientific point of view as well as for industrial applications ranging from coal processing to pharmaceutical and grain/food preparation lines.   The objective of this research project is to advance the mathematical understanding of how microscopic dynamics gives rise to macroscopic behavior. Necessarily this requires study of specialized models. In this project several such models suitable for rigorous mathematical analysis are under study. <br/><br/>Very popular mechanical models in the mathematical studies of classical statistical mechanics are collisions between scatters, in particular dispersing billiards. Recent advances have shown that such systems have very strong statistical properties. However, these results are limited to a very small number of degrees of freedom. The PI proposes to rigorously investigate statistical properties of specific models having many degrees of freedom. Since the rigorous analysis of purely mechanical models with many degrees of freedom is mathematically very challenging, many models in statistical physics introduce additional random elements. This project will also mathematically study the hydrodynamic limit of a special class of randomly interacting particle systems, which are in fact very closely related to the models under study. For this purpose the PI will extend the techniques that were recently developed to analyze of the hydrodynamic limit of the dissipative Boltzmann equation."

The first problem is related to signal reconstruction from magnitudes of a redundant linear representation (the so-called phase retrieval problem).  The second problem involves a geometric analysis of frames and connections to deep problems in mathematics (such as the Kadison-Singer problem).  This analysis leads to faster methods that offer better quality and resolution of the reconstructed signals in applications from X-ray crystallography, data communication on fiber optics, and speech processing.  Undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project are trained for a globally competitive STEM workforce by learning to develop new mathematical tools to solve real-world problems. <br/><br/>The investigator studies two problems, each exploiting redundancy of representations in mathematics and engineering.  The first leads to new methods to recover a signal from a nonlinear processing scheme.  Recently two far-reaching discoveries have been made that connect the nonlinear information (magnitudes of frame coefficients) to certain scalar products in larger embedding spaces.  This way the original problem of recovering a signal, which is fundamentally nonlinear, is recast into a linear reconstruction problem coupled with a rank-one approximation problem.  When the linear redundant representation is associated with a group representation (such as Weyl-Heisenberg, or windowed Fourier transform), then the relevant tensor operators inherit this invariance property.  Thus a fast (nonlinear) reconstruction algorithm is possible.  This approach suggests a new signal representation model, where signals are not represented simply by vectors in a Hilbert space, but rather by operators in a larger dimensional Hilbert-Schmidt-like space, similar to the quantum state theory.  The methods developed here borrow from a wide range of mathematical areas such as harmonic analysis, operator theory, and algebraic geometry.  In turn this approach allows for stable and efficient solutions relevant to areas of electrical engineering as diverse as array signal processing, speech processing, quantum computing, and X-ray crystallography.  The second problem expands the solution of the Kadison-Singer problem in a different direction in frame theory.  Specifically the issue is to ""thin out"" frames to subsets that remain frames and have density arbitrary close to one, the critical density associated to a Riesz basis.  Such a result belongs to a larger body of results describing the geometry of frame sets.  The unifying concept in all these problems is redundancy of representations and atomic decompositions."

When one wants to understand the time evolution of a complex system, a simplified model of the system, that can be analyzed, is usually a way forward. In this case one chooses a relatively small number of main 'factors' or variables which are guiding the evolution of the system while neglecting other factors that are relatively insignificant. On a short time interval, these small factors are not essential. However, on long time scales, the factors, which were considered as negligible, can become important and even critical for determining the system's behavior. The investigator and his colleagues are developing new models and methods for studying such problems. 'Problem' examples include climate change, biological evolution, and phase transitions in physical or economic systems as well as the appearance of 'stable' oscillations, equilibriums, and other patterns caused by small perturbations.<br/><br/>The investigator and his colleagues study deterministic and stochastic perturbations of various dynamical systems as well as semi-flows corresponding to the evolution of PDEs. A general approach to, at first glance, different problems is suggested. Metastability and stochastic resonance, which are manifestation of the large deviation theory, as well as the averaging principle and its modifications can be considered from this point of view. This general approach is based on the study of limiting slow evolution as a motion on the cone of invariant measures of the non-perturbed system. The approach underlines the importance of joint consideration of deterministic and stochastic perturbations. Perturbations of the generalized Landau-Lifshitz equation for multiple spins, incompressible flows in 3D having a conservation law, reaction-advection-diffusion equations in narrow channels arising in models of molecular motors can be studied using this approach. Various boundary problems for second order elliptic equations with a small parameter can be considered as well. Finally, the PI will also study the small mass asymptotics for the Langevin equation."

The reason for this requirement is that, according to the classical theory, image reconstruction from truncated CT data (the so-called ""interior problem"") is non-unique. As a consequence, many aspects of truncated data inversion have not been studied in literature. In this project the PIs will theoretically analyze the problem of image reconstruction from truncated data with minimal prior knowledge. Both transmission CT and emission tomography (SPECT) with constant attenuation will be addressed. The PIs will study the questions of stability of the reconstructions in 2D and 3D, characterize the null-space of an integral transform arising in the interior problem, and analyze eigenfunctions of certain singular Sturm-Liouville problems. The PIs will also develop efficient algorithms for numerical solution of the interior problem. These algorithms will be implemented and tested using both simulated and real data. <br/><br/>At present, interior tomography is at the cusp of being directly applicable in general medical imaging diagnostics. The confluence of theoretical, algorithmic, computational, and technological advances gives the PIs hope that interior tomography can move from the ""drawing boards"" to practical medical imaging in the not so distant future. While there are still some open research problems, the results obtained recently show that the problems can be solved with a fairly high degree of confidence. If successful, this study will provide theoretically justified and practically applicable two and three-dimensional reconstruction algorithms for imaging a region of interest inside an object (e.g., the patient) from truncated data. The broader impact of the proposed research lies in the promise it holds for improvements in the practice of clinical medicine and biomedical science generally, as well as for industrial non-destructive testing. The most direct benefit is the reduction in the x-ray dose to the patient; other benefits include less expensive scanners, improved temporal resolution, increased scanner throughput, capability of imaging larger objects, reduced system cost, etc."

These are macroscale observations, but recent advances in particle tracking techniques have shed light on fascinating dynamics that occur at the microscale as well. Accurately characterizing and understanding the behavior of foreign particles in complex fluids is vital for certain applications.  For example, learning why some particles penetrate biological fluids, while others do not, can be critical for the development of successful drug delivery techniques.

These systems typically consist of large numbers of individual oscillators, so their behavior can be extremely complicated and difficult to analyze.  But often the collective behavior of these complex networks is surprisingly simple; for example, the oscillators may synchronize, as happens in the heart pacemaker network or for certain species of fireflies that synchronize so as to flash in unison.  Other simple collective behaviors of oscillator networks include phase-locked configurations, in which all the oscillators converge to have the same period, or splay states, which are configurations in which the oscillators are uniformly distributed in phase.  Understanding the mathematical principles that underlie or facilitate such simple collective behaviors is a research problem of central importance in applied dynamical systems.  A persistent theme in this study is that the collective dynamics of coupled oscillator networks can often be reduced to that of low-dimensional systems, usually via the presence of hidden invariances or symmetries in the system.  Important examples are networks consisting of identical Kuramoto oscillators, which are simple oscillators governed by trigonometric functions.  Such networks are invariant under a three-dimensional group of symmetries called Mobius transformations, which play a key role in conformal hyperbolic geometry.  This invariance has been used to explain the stability properties of Kuramoto networks and to completely classify the stable long-term dynamics of networks of identical Kuramoto oscillators.  Low-dimensional reduction of oscillator networks can also be achieved through other techniques, such as complex-analytic continuation and residue methods, which have also been employed in reducing the classic Kuramoto model.  This research project will build on such powerful methods to extend and further clarify our understanding of collective behavior in oscillator networks.<br/><br/>This research project on collective behavior in oscillator networks has four parts.  Project 1 will use Mobius group, Riccati equation, and linear algebra techniques to study the general question of whether a multi-population Kuramoto oscillator network supports ""chimera states,"" in which a portion of the population synchronizes while the remainder is stably asynchronous.  Project 2 will use analytic techniques including Fokker-Planck methods and infinite-dimensional spectral analysis to study the stability of synchronized and splay states in more general types of oscillator networks, including integrate-and-fire networks, with the goal of better understanding the exceptional nature of Kuramoto oscillators.  Project 3 will apply the complex-analytic techniques of the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to study a model of coupled spins with random pinning and to understand the source of its low-dimensional behavior.  Finally, project 4 will investigate the design of Kuramoto networks in an experimental setting, to realize all the possible long-term stable dynamics predicted in the theoretical classification.  In particular, the investigators have established that there are four possible types of stable attractors for identical Kuramoto networks:  fully synchronized fixed points and limit cycles, and fixed points and limit cycles in which all but one of the oscillators are synchronized.  This project aims to observe these stable ""(N-1, 1)"" states in an experimental setting, as well as to explore the ramifications of such states in superconducting arrays for the development and stability of coherence in quantum computing.  These projects afford opportunities for interdisciplinary participation at the undergraduate and graduate level, ranging from numerical and experimental simulations to theoretical, analytic investigations.<br/><br/>This research is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematics through the Applied Mathematics program and the Division of Physics through the Physics of Living Systems program."

Its focus is on the development of new mathematical models and efficient numerical methods to study the manipulation by electric fields of the shape and position of cells, vesicles, and drops in electrolytic fluids.  These so-called  'electrokinetic techniques' are among the most common methods for manipulating particles and fluids in micro-scale devices and biological applications.  For example, electric fields are applied to induce shape changes in cells and vesicles, and this is used to infer membrane properties. Electric fields are also used to form transient pores in membranes, which is an important technique to load cells with molecules for drug delivery or gene therapy.  Impacts of the proposed research include the development of new mathematical models and numerical methods that will be of benefit to scientists and engineers studying electrokinetic phenomena in biology and engineering.  An additional impact of this project will be the education and involvement of graduate students. The interdisciplinary training they receive will be valuable preparation for a range of careers in mathematics and science.<br/><br/>During the interfacial flow of an ionic fluid that is driven by an electric field, a screening cloud of ions develops at the interface and forms an electrochemical double layer or 'Debye layer'. The electric field both acts on the ion cloud it induces and drives both it and the surrounding fluid into motion. This is known as 'induced-charge electrokinetic flow', and it is an important phenomenon in applications. We address a significant difficulty in the numerical computation of such flows in the practically important limit of thin double layers, by developing a fast and accurate hybrid or multiscale numerical method that incorporates an asymptotic analysis of the layer's dynamics into a novel boundary integral formulation of the interfacial free boundary problem.  A central theme of the current project is the development of a hybrid method for electrokinetic flow about a membrane. The algorithm will incorporate an analysis of the high-wavenumber or small-scale component of the elastic and electrostatic stresses on a membrane into a nonstiff method that is capable of handling the multiple time and space scales inherent in the problem. The method will be used to study canonical problems in the electrodeformation of drops, vesicles, and cells, and to examine vesicle manufacture by electroformation and coalescence by electrofusion. The numerical investigations will be complemented by analytical studies that will be used to justify existing reduced or 'lumped parameter' models for electrohydrodynamic flow, and to derive new models.  The investigators also propose to develop a hybrid method for problems with ionic surfactant, which combines features of both electrokinetic flow and soluble surfactant."

High-resolution data is acquired for example in medical imaging in the form of MRI or CT scans or confocal microscopy, and in defense-related imaging as hyperspectral satellite images.  The development of compressed sensing in applied mathematics has shown us that, surprisingly, randomly organized measurements provide a means to reduce the amount of data acquired by the sensor at the cost of invoking a nonlinear post-processing stage.  The randomization strategies from compressed sensing are also relevant for generating codes and check sums that permit the recovery from sparse errors when transmitting a digitized analog signal.  However, even at the level of state-of-the-art mathematical theory, random sensing and encoding precludes performance guarantees needed in critical situations.  This project provides an alternative to random choice: Frames, which describe the structure of the measurements obtained with a sensor, are built in a step-by-step, incremental fashion.  In order to realize provable performance guarantees, each step proceeds according to ""greedy"" optimization principles.  A main application of this measurement design is image recovery from limited acquisition in region-of-interest computed tomography.  The ability to perform accurate reconstruction of tissue density in a region of interest with limited scanning presents several potential advantages, including the reduction of radiation dose and the shortening of scanning time.  More generally, the efficient parsing of signals according to this strategy has potential relevance for microarray data processing, motion segmentation, and many other data-intensive applications.  The same greedy construction principles can be applied to the encoded transmission of digitized analog data, which is important for communication systems such as the internet.  The solution to near-optimal error suppression for data loss would impact the quality of streaming media sent across the internet, or of wireless audio or video communications in unreliable environments.  Parts of this project can be formulated at undergraduate or graduate-level research.  The investigator trains at least two graduate students and one undergraduate student in the course of this project.  The students are expected to gain valuable knowledge through the combination of theoretical work and the application to computed tomography. <br/><br/>     Compressed sensing has shown us how to reduce bandwidth by randomized sensing, which captures the essential part of a compressible signal directly, and by moving the burden of signal recovery from the sensor to a digital post-processing stage.  The same techniques are useful for model selection such as subspace clustering and for correcting sparse errors such as partial data loss in transmissions.  However, we still face challenging unresolved problems in signal acquisition and transmission.  The gap between the relevant dimensions required to give near-certain success of a random construction is often far removed from practical situations.  Moreover, there is no feasible known test that guarantees that a concrete outcome of a random construction is successful.  This project addresses the need for provable performance guarantees of data acquisition and transmission in the following settings: (1) If a source for random signals concentrates near a union of subspaces, how can these subspaces be identified efficiently and reliably from noisy samples of the source?  (2) If one expects communication failures when sending a digitized analog signal, resulting in a lost portion of the transmitted data, then how can the signal be encoded in order to suppress the impact of the data loss on the reconstructed analog signal in a near-optimal way?  The project involves elements from convex optimization theory, functional and numerical analysis, and frame theory.  A frame is an (over)complete family of vectors that provides stable expansions.  Frame theory is important for sensing and digitized communications because in contrast to orthonormal bases, frames can incorporate linear dependencies between frame vectors, which allows for flexibility in their design and provides a fundamental method of error correction.  Until recently, the state of the art of frame theoretic results relied on either randomized or group-representation constructions.  This project focuses on an incremental, step-by-step design of near-optimal frames by greedy construction principles that are inspired by a technique developed by Daniel Spielman in works with Nikhil Srivastava and Adam Marcus.  This technique has powerful applications, as shown in the recent simplified proof of the Bourgain-Tzafriri theorem and in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer problem.  The expected outcomes of the project include the construction of frames by greedy methods that provide (1) sparse expansions for signals with known statistics and (2) error-correction capabilities for encoded transmissions that match the performance of randomized constructions.  These construction methods are applied to region-of-interest computed tomography, an intentional data reduction strategy in which only X-rays are used that pass in the vicinity of an organ that is being imaged, thereby reducing the overall radiation dose.  The successful implementation of greedy methods in frame design is also expected to have a significant impact on all tasks that involve analog signals being transmitted or interpreted in the presence of noise.  The investigator trains at least two graduate students and one undergraduate student in the course of this project."

These are called high contrast media.  Because these materials are encountered in a wide range of application areas, such as subsurface flows, bioengineering, suspensions, and medical and geophysical imaging, they have received increased attention within the mathematical community in recent years.  The investigator studies high contrast composite materials that exhibit an additional feature, which is of geometric nature, namely, the heterogeneous domain either has highly concentrated inhomogeneities or contains multiple scales (that is, its inhomogeneities are very small compared to some length characteristic of the material).  Graduate and undergraduate students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     Mathematically, high contrast media are described by partial differential equations with coefficients that take on an extremely large range of values in the domain.  The investigator studies problems of this type that also have rapidly varying coefficients, meaning that they fluctuate on a length scale that is much smaller than the size of the domain occupied by the composite.  These problems require special efforts in establishing strategies for designing multiscale models.  Recent advances in the field have led to the development of many approaches that were designed mostly for problems with bounded oscillations in problem parameters.  However, problems whose coefficients have high aspect ratio pose additional challenges for developing both analytical and numerical solution methods.  One therefore seeks techniques that are robust with respect to problem parameters.  The investigator develops efficient analytical and numerical tools for describing strongly heterogeneous flows in media with large variations in material properties and complex geometry."

The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states, who may not otherwise have a chance to discuss mathematics together throughout the year. Structurally the symposium consists of 8 main lectures given by nationally recognized leaders in the field, and contributed sessions for advanced graduate students and participating researchers from regional universities, to present their work. This will provide graduate students with an opportunity to obtain feedback from senior faculty from other departments. The networking activities made possible by the Symposium will prove to be a valuable experience for young researchers. The Symposium encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics."

This five-day conference will feature David Colton of University of Delaware as the distinguished lecturer who will deliver ten lectures on inverse scattering theory for transmission eigenvalues. Prof. Colton will prepare an expository monograph based on his lectures for publication so that the research findings can be made available to the entire scientific community. The goal behind the inverse scattering problem is to extract information about an unknown object by probing it with waves at various energies and to determine its properties from the measurements on the scattered waves. The transmission eigenvalues correspond to those energies at which the scattering from the object is the same as the scattering as if the object is absent from the medium. The topic has important applications in electromagnetics, acoustics, medicine, and other areas. The conference will cover both the topic of determining transmission eigenvalues when the object properties are known as well as the topic of determining those properties when only the transmission eigenvalues are known. In addition to the mathematical theory, some applications will be considered such as medical imaging.<br/><br/>There will be about 30 participants supported, including both established researchers and interested qualified newcomers, and special efforts will be made to include postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, women, and traditionally underrepresented groups.  The broader impact of the proposed activity is to bring established researchers and newcomers together to an interactive environment, to promote interdisciplinary work and longtime collaborations, to include women and minorities in the research activities, and to stimulate the regional research activity.  This project is jointly supported by the Infrastructure and Applied Mathematics programs within the Division of Mathematical Sciences."

Under what conditions is such arbitrage possible over arbitrary time horizons, and what is the ""best possible"" such arbitrage under specific market structures?  The investigator and his collaborators study these issues and their connections to stochastic analysis and partial differential equations.  They also study stable competing particle systems, that is, multidimensional diffusions interacting through their ranks in a manner giving rise to invariant measures that are in broad agreement with stability properties observed in large equity markets over decades.  The stochastic analysis of such systems presents interesting challenges, such as the solvability of the stochastic equations that implement such diffusions; the study of multiple collisions, of their associated collision local times, of their invariant distributions, of time reversal; and the estimation of parameters in the resulting models for practical implementation.  Furthermore, they work on stochastic optimization problems of the control and stopping type in the presence of unobservable parameters, modeled in a Bayesian framework by means of random variables with known prior distributions and continuous updating.  This work has implications for the adaptive sequential detection of change-points, for signal processing, for finance, and for other fields of application where learning about unknown parameters, and dynamic system optimization, have to take place simultaneously and in real time. <br/><br/>The investigator studies problems in stochastic controls, portfolios, and competing particle systems.

The precipitous losses of summer Arctic sea ice observed in the past few decades have a significant impact on Earth's climate system, and have far outpaced the projections of most global climate models. One of the fundamental challenges of climate science is to develop more rigorous representations of sea ice in climate models, and incorporate important small scale processes and structures into these large scale models. The research funded by this grant will address this central issue. The investigators will use the mathematics of composite materials and statistical physics to develop methods of rigorously calculating the effective or homogenized properties of the sea ice pack which are necessary for improving projections of the fate of Earth's ice packs, and how polar ecosystems may respond. The effects of planetary warming are far reaching, and a better understanding of sea ice and its role in climate will improve our ability to predict changes in storm tracks, precipitation and temperature patterns, etc., affecting large populations. Moreover, this work will advance our understanding of the properties of composite materials and their use in industrial, engineering, and medical applications.<br/> <br/>The research topics in this grant encompass a range of key problems which will not only advance how sea ice can be represented in climate models, but will the push the boundaries of the mathematics of composite materials. The marginal ice zone (MIZ) is the outer region of the ice pack where dense pack ice transitions to open ocean, and its ""width"" is an important climatic length scale. Recent advances in objectively identifying MIZ width and geometry have led to the discovery of striking trends as the climate has warmed, which are based on an idealized concentration field satisfying Laplace's equation. Here we will generalize this analysis to include an inhomogeneous, effective diffusivity in the multiscale transport equation, which can, through inversion schemes, capture the actual satellite-derived concentration field. We will investigate how this effective coefficient is then related to smaller scale information about floe geometry and configurations. This approach will provide a basis for analytical investigation of MIZ dynamics including its susceptibility to deformation. In related work, we will explore representations for ice pack rheology similar to a recently obtained polydisc integral formula for the effective elasticity of two phase composites. Such representations involve spectral measures on the torus whose moments are related to microstructural statistics, and we will investigate the structure of the spectral measures and their dependence on composite microgeometry."

The goal of this project is to develop new methods that allow simple but effective control of performance of complex symmetric networks of oscillators.

Natural symmetries of real life systems lead to multiple periodic regimes and complicate the stabilization problem. The objective of this research is to develop methods for stabilization of unstable periodic regimes in symmetric systems by a combination of delayed feedback control and linear proportional control. The focus of the project will be on two types of symmetric systems with memory, namely systems with hysteresis and with delay. The method of stabilization of unstable periodic orbits (UPO) by non-invasive delayed feedback control (due to Pyragas) has been successfully tested against different types of models of chaotic systems. During the last two years, the co-PIs have been developing computerized symbolic numerical tools and supporting theoretical framework for localization and classification of UPOs in models of systems admitting large symmetry groups. The efficiency of these methods is based on development of the equivariant degree theory and its applications. This project will combine these new methods with a properly adapted version of Pyragas' control to achieve stabilization of UPOs in systems with complex symmetries. It is expected that these methods will be instrumental in navigating the system to various oscillation patterns (related to different spatio-temporal symmetries of UPOs) of practical interest. The application component of the project includes stabilization of UPOs in models of networks of electronic circuits, networks of hysteretic oscillators, and symmetrically coupled semiconductor lasers."

The principal methods of this work come from the soliton theory. Solitons are very special solitary waves (""bumps"") of water that move with constant speed without any deterioration in their shape. The first soliton siting was described in 1834 by the Scottish naval architect John Scott Russell, who noticed this wave in a channel and pursued it on his horse for quite a while. The soliton theory was originated in the mid-1960s from the fundamental Gardner-Greene-Kruskal-Miura discovery of the inverse scattering transform (IST) for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for shallow water waves (this equation happens to describe the channel phenomenon that Russell observed). Soon thereafter different versions of IST were found for many other physically important nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) referred to as completely integrable systems. Being conceptually similar to the Fourier transform, the IST has yielded a tremendous amount of information about completely integrable systems, far beyond what standard PDE techniques may offer. Soliton theory is regarded as a major achievement of the 20th century science connecting different branches of pure mathematics and theoretical physics with numerous applications ranging from hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. Much of work in soliton theory has been done on the propagation of waves initiated by rapidly decaying or periodic initial data (the so-called classical data). The corresponding solutions have a relatively simple and well understood wave structure of running solitons accompanied by radiation of decaying waves, or periodic wave-trains and their modulations. However any deviation from classical data meets principal difficulties that are yet to be surmounted. The project will focus on soliton theory for initial profiles that are much broader than classical. We expect new types of solutions with much more complicated wave structure and far-reaching practical applications. It is expected that the results could be used for understanding rogue waves, soliton propagation on different backgrounds (including noisy), tidal waves, certain meteorological phenomena (e.g. morning glory), or for the study of propagation of coherent structures in noisy media in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma, astrophysics, etc.<br/>  <br/>In the context of the KdV equation the principal investigator has reformulated the classical IST in terms of Hankel operators and Titchmarsh-Weyl m-functions that let one extend the IST to a surprisingly broad class of initial data. This was achieved by employing some subtle properties of the m-function and deep results from the theory of Hankel operators. The principal investigator  plans to use powerful methods of Hankel operators to identify the broadest possible class of initial profiles for which a suitable analog of the IST exists. Another objective is asymptotic analysis of the underlying solutions. The well-known powerful machinery of the classical Riemann-Hilbert problem breaks down on such initial profiles in a number of serious ways. The main thrust will be put on understanding how to make the Riemann-Hilbert problem work far outside of the realm of classical problems. The results are expected to be instrumental for various applications.  The accompanying mathematical problems are also very important to the theory of the Schrodinger operator, the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, and the theory of Hankel and Toeplitz operators, fundamental objects of operator theory. Uncovering connections between soliton theory and Hankel operators theory is of great independent interest and could potentially have a profound influence on both theories.  The project will have a very large educational component. The principal investigator is committed to continuing his research experience for undergraduates program on nonlinear wave phenomena to identify and mentor young scholars in the field of applied mathematics. It is his intent to attract a diverse (gender, ethnicity, disability) group of talented undergraduates into the program to broaden the participation of underrepresented in the mathematical sciences groups."

More recently, applications on a much smaller scale have come into focus. In particular, hierarchical materials like ceramic or metallic foams, percolation networks and carbon and grapheme nano-tubes have attracted much attention. Quantum graphs arise as natural models of various phenomena in chemistry (free-electron theory of conjugated molecules), biology (genetic networks, dendritic trees), geophysics, environmental science, decease control, and are even relevant in connection with the  Internet (Internet or network tomography). Control and inverse theories for quantum graphs constitute an important part of the rapidly developing area of applied mathematics --- analysis on graphs. They are tremendously important for all aforementioned applications.

We will focus on inverse problems for differential equations that are important for applications in science and engineering. Along with unknown coefficients of the equations on the edges, the topology of the graph and geometrical parameters (the lengths of the edges and, in relevant cases, the angles between neighboring edges) will be recovered. Exact controllability of the corresponding dynamical systems on graphs with cycles will also be established. The leaf-peeling method is based on the Boundary Control method for inverse problems of mathematical physics. The characteristic feature of these methods is their locality: recovering the topology and other parameters of a subgraph requires only the data related to that subgraph. This property gives the leaf-peeling method an advantage over other methods and allows to extend our approach to graphs with cycles."

A common aggregation modeling framework is conservation-type nonlocal PDE, which are analytically and computationally challenging. Degenerate Cahn-Hilliard approximations of a class of canonical models will be investigated with linear analysis, numerical simulation, phase plane analysis of equilibria, and a variational analysis of minimizers in order to evaluate the success of the local model in approximating the nonlocal one. Based on this understanding, the investigator will develop a model of phase polyphenic locusts interacting with the environment and use it to develop strategies that suppress destructive locust swarms. Stability analysis and numerical simulation will reveal environmental conditions likely to suppress a hysteretic bifurcation to a dangerous locust swarm. Finally, the investigator will characterize aggregation dynamics using topological data analysis. Data sets arising from numerical simulations and biological experiments will be analyzed with topological barcodes describing their persistent homology.

This system is essentially a three-dimensional porous medium characterized by an extremely high ratio between the horizontal and vertical length of the fractures, and respectively, their width. In this investigation, main hydrodynamic features, observed in real life by reservoir engineers, will be modeled by using different sets of nonlinear partial differential equations in the porous regions and in the fractures. These systems of equations have not been studied before. The flow in the fractures does not follow the classical law (linear Darcy), and the inertial forces can no longer be neglected. Moreover, the dissipative effects due to the interaction between the fluid flows in the different regions must be taken into account. The proposal is focused on the combination of novel ideas in multigrid and domain decomposition algorithms, oriented to parallel architectures with the aim of achieving the best computational performance. In order to improve the retrieval of hydrocarbon resources, the proposal will also address the solution of optimization problems."

The physical basis for morphogenesis can be presented in terms of a simple principle: differential growth in a body leads to residual strains that generically result in changes of its shape.  Eventually, the growth patterns are expected to be, in turn, regulated by these strains, so that this principle might well be the basis for the physical self-organization of biological tissues.  Such topics lie at the interface of biology, chemistry and physics, with practical questions of engineering design and others.  Residually stressed laminae are present in science and technology in a variety of situations; from atomically thin grapheme (of thickness 1 nm, with a lateral span of a few cm), to the earth's crust (of thickness 10 km, which spans thousands of km laterally).  On the everyday scale, there has been much work on trying to understand the mechanics of these laminae when they are actuated, as in a growing leaf, a swelling or shrinking sheet of gel, a plastically strained sheet, etc.  Understanding of the laws governing the equilibria and the evolution of such structures has many potential applications.  The investigator studies mathematical problems related to the development of the shapes of these low-dimensional structures due to the interplay between growth patterns of the structures and residual strains in the material.  Students are trained in the course of the project. <br/><br/>Questions about the development of shapes fundamentally have also a deeply geometric and analytical character.  Indeed, they may be seen as a variation on a classical theme in differential geometry -- that of embedding a shape with a given metric in a space of possibly different dimension.  In this project the investigator aims not only to state the conditions when this embedding might be done (or not), but also to: 1) constructively determine the shapes resulting from minimizing the energy that measures the overall discrepancy between the imposed metric and the metric realized by the deformed shape, 2) determine the shapes as above in terms of an appropriate mechanical theory, and 3) investigate the separation of scales that arises naturally in slender structures and induces the constraints associated with the prescription of growth laws."

This project is laying the groundwork both for the determination of these hidden structures and for analyzing specific situations arising in several applications. Among these is the embryonic development of the wing of a fruit fly and its newly discovered relation to current through potassium channels in the cell membrane.  Part of this project is to develop and use sophisticated mathematical techniques to understand that ionic current.  The fruit fly model has implications for mammalian development and may lead to an understanding of the cause of some serious birth defects. Applications of the abstract mathematical investigations also include understanding of other dynamical systems subject to random perturbations, including the density distribution in highly excited plasmas or the fine structure of an alloy and how defects are distributed and evolve in time.  <br/><br/>This project builds upon the past work of the principal investigators and others to establish the existence of coherent structures embedded in the phase space of complex dynamical systems, both finite- and infinite-dimensional and both deterministic or subject to random forcing.  The fundamental and abstract theory to be developed during the course of the project lies behind concrete and observed phenomena in the physical and biological sciences, particularly at the molecular, microscopic, or nano-scale.  Infinite-dimensional dynamical systems are required to represent the temporal and spatial fluctuations of quantities subject to physical laws or biochemical processes, such as the distribution of bone morphogenic protein in a developing embryonic fly wing, the current through an ion channel in a cell membrane, the density of a relativistic plasma, or the motion of microscopic defects in an alloy, to name just a few of the systems considered in this project.  Furthermore, as complex as these may be, stochastic perturbations must be considered due to thermal or other fluctuations in the environment and imprecise measurement of quantities at small scales.  While one cannot hope to give exact representations of all states subject to complex spatial and temporal interaction, one can sometimes glean information due to the presence of robust, but possibly hidden, structures such as invariant manifolds and their invariant foliations whose existence is implied by the laws governing the processes under investigation.  The goals of this project are to discover the conditions under which such structures exist, even when stochastically forced, and to examine the implications in the particular physical and biological systems underlying the equations."

Specifically, the first project includes a mathematical study of the events that occur before a liquid droplet splashes on either solid or liquid substrates. This is a problem of immense technological importance, with applications ranging from the design of ink jet printers to the entrainment of carbon dioxide at the ocean surface. Nonetheless, basic features of the process are still not understood, and our mathematical models aim to resolve the critical issue. The second topic is a mathematical study of shadow lithography, an emerging method for creating arrays of small nanoscopic structures and new optical materials. We aim to develop a complete mathematical description of patterns that can form using this method, leading to a logical dictionary of structures that can be made. The third project aims to better understand the development of biofilms, bacterial colonies which strongly adhere to surfaces. These have been implicated as the cause of infection and decay both in medicine and technology. The biological transitions that lead to biofilm development are not well understood. We will develop a mathematical model of these transitions in a model organism. This has the potential to lead to new fundamental insights into biofilm development and how to control it. The broader impact centers on both personnel development of graduate students and postdocs, and the development of educational materials for teaching science and mathematics through cooking. Our teaching initiatives on science and cooking have reached nearly 100,000 people through an online class, and we aim to extend the reach and content to secondary education. <br/><br/>The study of the splashing of droplets will start from a description of incompressible potential flow in the liquid, coupled to the compressible dynamics in the surrounding air. The dynamics in the air is well captured by a lubrication approximation. Previous work has modeled the initial dynamics in the liquid phase using potential flow. However, both theoretical estimates and experiments indicate that viscous forces become important in the liquid in the later stages; we will extend the mathematical description to include this, using a boundary layer description of the viscous effects in the liquid. The study of shadow lithography uses methods in geometry to completely characterize the shadows made by the array of spheres. Mathematical characterization of structures will be made with both two-dimensional masks of spheres and will also extend current experimental methods to three dimensional masks of opaque spheres in a transparent matrix. The latter could lead to new method for fabrication complex devices. The study of biofilms use a new experimental method for whole film imaging of gene expression in Bacillus subtilis, which gives an unprecedented look at the spatiotemporal dynamics of how changes occur in a biofilm. The project will construct mathematical models of the nutrient field in the experiment and then investigate whether the nutrient field itself is sufficient to explain the transitions, or whether signaling molecules are also required. Predictions will be tested in experiments and may lead to understanding of how development unfolds in Bacillus."

For example, collapse may occur when a powerful laser beam enters a transparent medium, such as usual glass. Interaction of the medium with the laser beam results in self-focusing when the intense light creates an effective lens inside the medium and amplifies itself during propagation until the singularity of the light amplitude is reached. Mathematically a singularity means that the corresponding mathematical solution approaches infinity.  Qualitatively similar collapse phenomena occur in hydrodynamics as well as in the bacterial growth (for example, for E. Coli). In the latter case, communications between bacteria (through a chemical substance called chemoattractant) cause spontaneous aggregation of the bacterial colony to a very high (almost singular) bacterial density. Solutions of the corresponding nonlinear systems of partial differential equations that model phenomena with collapse experience spontaneous formation of singularities in finite time (blow-up).  Blow-up is often accompanied by a dramatic contraction of the spatial extent of a solution, hence the term ""collapse."" Near the singularity point there is a qualitative change in underlying nonlinear phenomena; the initial mathematical models lose their applicability and other mechanisms become more important, such as optical breakdown and formation of plasma in optical media, or bacterial crowding and formation of multicellular organisms from the bacterial colony.<br/><br/>This research will focus on phenomena of collapse in the Nonlinear Schrdinger equation (NLSE), Keller-Segel equation (KSE) and Davey-Stewartson equation (DSE) which are archetypal equations to study finite time singularities in the critical dimension two. These equations are among most universal and widespread equations in nonlinear science with numerous applications in nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics and biology. The need in understanding collapse became especially pressing since the advent of lasers in early 60s. More than 50 years of research produced well-established collapse theories for NLSE and KSE. However, until recently it remained a puzzle why these theoretical results were never confirmed by either direct simulations or in experiments. The explanation is that the existing theories required unrealistically large amplitudes for their applicability. This project will develop a detailed theory of collapse scaling and collapse regularization in NLSE and KSE for the realistic amplitudes. The principal investigator will also develop a DSE collapse scaling theory, which has been lacking for many years. The effort will be made to make the theory a practical tool for applications. Both perturbative and nonperturbative approaches will be used, as well as matched asymptotic techniques and extensive supercomputing. Diverse applications of NLSE, KSE and DSE will promote cross-fertilization of ideas across the fields of nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics, Bose-Einstein condensation and biology."

The primary goal of the conference is to facilitate cooperation between researchers working in various areas of inverse problems and spectral theory, and in applications of these techniques in physics, biomedicine, and engineering.  The majority of the award funds are reserved to support the participation of junior mathematicians, graduate students, and women and other members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Both inverse problems and spectral theory have been rapidly developing during the last several decades, with a number of deep connections emerging between these areas of mathematics.  Inverse Problems are problems in which causes for a desired or an observed effect are to be determined.  They play an ever increasing role in medicine and biology, in search for oil and mineral deposits, in studying the earth's substructure and creating astrophysical images from telescope data, in finding cracks and interfaces within materials, and in homeland security applications.  Spectral theory has been in the mainstream of mathematical development for a long time. It has led to fascinating developments in various areas of science and engineering and the research in this field is still in an extremely active phase. The interaction between the two fields have given rise to a special subclass of problems, the inverse spectral problems.  However, those are only one aspect of the deep connection between inverse problems and spectral theory and spectral-theoretical methods find many applications in seemingly unrelated inverse problems. For example, significant progress in studying some of the emerging multi-physics modalities of medical imaging was achieved through the study of the spectral properties of the operators governing the wave propagation in the living tissue.  The supported conference will feature invited lectures from leading specialists in Inverse Problems and Spectral Theory, with special emphasis on the interaction of the two fields.<br/><br/>Conference web site:  www.math.tamu.edu/~berko/ipst/"

In many circumstances, the energy of a particle is ""quantized"", i.e. can assume only special discrete values.  These values depend on the parameters of the problem, such as the electric and magnetic potentials present.  Each special value corresponds to a solution (an eigenfunction), which describes the probability amplitude of finding the particle in any given location in space.  In particular, the zero set of an eigenfunction is a set of positions that the particle avoids completely.  In some important applications, such as crystal structures, the energy is no longer discrete, but is a function (called the dispersion relation) of the direction of the particle's motion.  The goal of the project is to investigate possible connections among the following three questions: (a) effect of the magnetic field on the energy levels of Schroedinger equation, (b) properties of the zero sets of eigenfunctions, and (c) existence and stability of conical inclusions (""Dirac points"") in the surface of the dispersion relation. In addition to all three being active areas of theoretical research in mathematical physics, the latter question has direct implications to the study of novel materials, such as graphenes and carbon nanotubes, and to design of new materials with desired physical properties, which are often governed by the presence of the Dirac points.  The existence of any connection between area (b) on one hand and areas (a) and (c) on the other was not known until few years ago. Each of the three areas is expected to benefit from an improved understanding of the other two.<br/><br/>The project focuses on spectral analysis of Schroedinger-type operators on manifolds and graphs (both discrete and quantum).  Among the particular aims of the project are the following: describe the spatial configuration of the magnetic field that reduces the energy of the n-th eigenstate of a quantum particle and relate it to the zero set of the n-th eigenfunction; investigate the ""optimal"" placement of an Aharonov-Bohm flux-line on a manifold; investigate the properties of the (generalized) eigenfunctions calculated at the edges of the energy bands of periodic structures; formulate the conditions for the persistence of the Dirac points in graphene-like structures under perturbations reducing the symmetry; design a constructive method for predicting the location of Dirac points and of extremal points of energy bands; investigate the connection between the number of singularities in the dispersion surface and the number of zeros of eigenfunctions calculated at special points of the surface."

It is both an area of pure mathematics and a subject that lies at the crossroads of multiple scientific disciplines. As an area of pure mathematics, it seeks to develop rigorous theories and techniques that are applicable to general processes, addressing foundational issues of stability and chaos. As a partner with the sciences, it offers qualitative theories and viewpoints, and can be a powerful tool when used in conjunction with numerical computations. While both aspects of dynamical systems are worthy in their own right, there often is a gap that lies between theory and applications. The proposed research has both purely theoretical and application oriented components, one of its goals being the cross-fertilization of ideas. This research will: (1) lead to significant broadening of the scope of dynamical systems theory, (2) strengthen connections between dynamical systems and other areas of mathematics, such as probability and partial differential equations, and (3) build connections between mathematics and statistical physics and theoretical neuroscience. <br/><br/>In this proposal there are four specific research projects are presented. One proposes to extend hyperbolic theory (or the theory of chaotic dynamical systems) from finite to infinite dimensions, so that an enlarged theory will be applicable not just to ordinary differential equations but also to large classes of partial differential equations. A second project proposes to extend current techniques for analyzing chaotic dynamics, which often exhibit Gaussian type fluctuations, to systems that produce heavy-tailed statistics. Though well recognized as  a hallmark of complex processes, few analytical studies of such dynamical processes have been carried out. A third project seeks to provide rigorous justification for certain fundamental phenomenology in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, such as the idea of local thermal equilibrium in steady states dynamics. The fourth and final project proposes numerical and analytical studies of phenomena identified in previous computational models of neuroscience, specifically in models of visual cortex. Providing scientific training for young researchers is a very important part of the proposed activity. The principal investigator has a strong and well documented history of mentoring students and junior colleagues, and she fully expects to continue to do so using projects in the current grant."

Understanding the bio-mechanical advance of the disease and developing quantitative mathematical techniques for its monitoring is the first step towards efficient treatment and prevention. Diagnostics based on QUT is relatively inexpensive and, unlike X-ray densitometry, it does not ionize the tissue. The strength of cancellous bone plays an essential role in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. The proposed work aims at developing mathematical tools for determining various parameters that describe the strength of porous-elastic materials, by probing the materials with mechanical waves such as ultrasound. The educational component emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research in several STEM fields. Through joint work with the PI's collaborators in mechanical and biomedical engineering, facilitated by the Center for Biomedical Engineering Research at the University of Delaware, a new interdisciplinary educational initiative linking biomedical engineering and mathematics for undergraduate and graduate student training is planned. The results from this project will be of interest to researchers who conduct laboratory experiments to study the relation between bone strength and bone micro-architecture and will open an avenue for a more accurate and reliable ultrasound devices for measuring properties of porous-elastic materials. <br/><br/>The goal of the research is to utilize the dehomogenization techniques to study the mathematical characterization of effective parameters relevant to mechanical properties of poroelastic materials and the governing equations of wave propagation in these materials. Poroelastic composites are two-phase composite materials consisting of elastic solid frames with fluid-saturated pore space, e.g. fluid saturated rocks, sea ice, and cancellous bone. The study of poroelasticity plays an important role in biomechanics, seismology, and geophysics. The physical properties of these composites depend not only on the constituent materials but also on the microstructure of pore space and how the viscous pore fluid interacts with the solid frame. The bulk properties are described by various 'effective parameters' that appear as coefficients of the integro-differential equations governing wave propagation through poroelastic materials when the wavelength is much larger than the scale of the microstructure. Retrieval of effective parameters through a non-destructive test using waves is essential in monitoring the health of these composites. In the course of this project, a numerical paradigm for simulating wave propagation in poroelastic composites and the inverse problem of the parameter retrieval will be developed, analyzed, and implemented. By utilizing the fact that all the effective properties in the poroelastic wave equations for a given bone sample are underpinned by the same microstructure, the computational model will be constructed from micro-CT scans in a mathematically consistent way."

This principle lies behind lasers, filters, antennas, and light-emitting diodes, as well as devices whose components operate at the nanoscale.  The investigator studies efficient and robust ways to exploit the phenomena of resonance in device design and how to control variations in device performance resulting from inevitable manufacturing imperfections.  The theory of resonance has deep mathematical roots, which are developed to gain a better working understanding of new physical phenomena for the design of modern-day devices.  The project trains graduate and undergraduate students to develop skills at the interfaces of mathematics, physics, and engineering, paying special attention to bridging communication gaps between the disciplines.  Undergraduate students are involved in creating an online computational tool for virtual experimentation and design of optical structures.<br/><br/>     Four problems of resonance are studied.  (1) An electromagnetic resonance of a doubly periodic waveguide is associated with a complex eigenvalue of the Maxwell equations, which encodes the frequency and spectral width of the resonance.  The investigator considers new waveguide structures that allow both characteristics of a resonance to be tuned by varying the angle of incidence of a source wave.  This ability to tune is precluded in existing constructions of resonant waveguide modes due to the symmetry that they utilize.  This symmetry is broken by exploiting non-reciprocal materials, special geometries, and bifurcations of symmetric guided modes into antisymmetric modes, to construct asymmetric tunable waveguide resonances.  (2) Embedded eigenvalues in locally perturbed periodic quantum graphs are responsible for resonance phenomena in two-dimensional molecular structures such as bi-layer graphene.  Building on a recent result of his on embedded eigenvalues, the investigator employs asymmetry to control resonant scattering characteristics in quantum graphs.  (3) Even in materials with small coefficients of nonlinearity, field amplification due to resonance causes strongly nonlinear effects, such as bistability and hysteresis.  The investigator quantifies these effects in a tractable model in which a photon transmission line is coupled to a local exciton field, producing a nonlinear field of photon-exciton quasiparticles known as polaritons.  (4) Random fluctuations of a waveguide's material properties and geometry introduce variability into features of resonance, such as their central frequency and spectral width.  The investigator calculates this variability using perturbation analysis of the scattering matrix where the perturbative parameters are random variables."

A theoretical understanding of these problems and solvers will lead to improved performance and reliability of the solvers and the simulators which use those solvers. The PI will apply his findings to problems in physics and chemistry basic to the design of materials. <br/><br/>This project addresses some unresolved algorithmic questions in numerical analysis theory.

The work is particularly timely in view of Monte Carlo methods robustness and resiliency in a massively parallel environment. Progress in this topic will lead to better understanding of how to couple existing solvers to Monte Carlo models. The research on Anderson acceleration will explore a class of Jacobian-free solvers which are very important when Jacobians or Jacobian vector products are unavailable. Anderson is already widely used in electronic structure computations which, in turn, are core components in computational chemistry software and the design of materials. While there is wide literature on the use and operation of Anderson acceleration, including cases where it fails to converge, there is very little theory.  The object of this part of the project is to develop that theory."

Our ability to predict epileptic seizures, to effectively control a power grid, or to coordinate a group of robots rely on our understanding of the principles underlying collective behavior in coupled dynamical systems. Many natural and man-made networks around us feature extraordinary richness and complexity of interconnections. Mathematical modeling of such networks poses new challenges for nonlinear science and requires new approaches incorporating combinatorial and probabilistic methods into dynamical analysis of complex systems. Graph Theory holds an extraordinary potential to inspire new powerful techniques for extended dynamical systems and applications to technological, social, economic, and biological networks. In this research, the Principal Investigator (PI) combines state-of-the-art techniques of Graph Theory with analytical methods for Dynamical Systems to develop an effective set of tools for studying coupled dynamical systems and their applications in neuroscience. The results of this research will be integrated into graduate courses in Dynamical Systems and Mathematical Neuroscience. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI develops a unified approach for studying dynamical networks as evolution equations on three types of spatial domains: Caley graphs, quasirandom graphs, and graph limits. For problems in each class, analytical and algebraic techniques, which mesh well with the underlying spatial structures, are identified. These techniques are used to study stability of spatial patterns in systems of coupled phase oscillators on Caley graphs, synchronization in systems of coupled chaotic maps, and differential equations on different random graphs including small-world and graphs that exhibit power law behavior, as well as those that exhibit temporally structured stable patterns in a neural network model of learning. The PI seeks systematic ways for describing the role of network connectivity in shaping the dynamics in coupled systems. This work is aimed toward development of a theory for interacting dynamical systems on regular and random graphs."

Describing in an idealized fashion what may be observed in an ocean or a lake, water waves are a perfect specimen of applied mathematics. They host a wealth of wave phenomena, ranging in length scale from ripples driven by surface tension to tsunamis and to rogue waves. They provide source and inspiration to several branches of mathematics. Furthermore they impact outside of mathematics, from hydraulics to weather prediction. The water wave problem, notwithstanding, presents profound and subtle difficulties for rigorous analysis, modeling and numerical simulations. For one thing, the interface between the water and the air is a priori unknown and to be determined as part of the solution, namely a free boundary. Incidentally, free boundaries are mathematically challenging in their own right and they occur in numerous situations such as the melting of ice and the stretching of a flexible membrane over an obstacle. To make things worse, boundary conditions at the free surface are severely nonlinear.  This project will develop new tools to advance understanding of these challenging problems."

The heterogeneity can be artificial, or man-made, as in composite materials, or it can be created spontaneously by nature as in shape memory alloys or in some of the buckling patterns of cylindrical shells.  In the former case the dependence of the macroscopic properties of materials on their microstructure is the subject of this study, where the goal is to uncover all instances where exact formulas can be established between the properties of constituent materials and the composite, regardless of the microstructure.  Undergraduate research is an essential part of this project.  In the latter case the creation of microstructure is caused by instabilities that are explained by the principle of minimum energy.  Mathematically rigorous determination of whether it is possible to lower the energy of a configuration is an important question, especially when the configuration is already heterogeneous.  Another important example of instability is buckling of cylindrical shells.  These structures are especially interesting because theoretically predicted buckling compression can be up to five times higher than the experimentally observed one due to high sensitivity to initial imperfections.  A newly developed theory of buckling, of which the investigator is a coauthor, shows promise in giving a new explanation of extreme sensitivity of the buckling load to imperfections. <br/><br/>The few exact relations that are known for fiber-reinforced elastic composites are scattered across the literature.  The goal of this project is the creation of a complete list of all exact relations and links, providing a useful resource for mechanical engineers involved in the study and design of composite materials.  Exact relations can be used as benchmarks for measuring the discrepancies between actual and ideal composites' properties, since they do not depend on the microstructure -- the least controllable variable in any composite.  Another goal of this project is understanding of elastic instabilities in materials capable of undergoing martensitic phase transitions.  In the presence of phase boundaries the problem of understanding the interplay between the global condition of positivity of second variation and local quasiconvexity conditions in the bulk requires new insights.  Proposed examples of energy density functions with a large number of weak local minimizers can be used to understand the logical hierarchy of necessary conditions for strong local minima.  Buckling of slender bodies represents a universal failure of weak local stability under compression.  Axially compressed cylindrical shells are of special interest, since the classical heuristic asymptotic analysis of buckling predicts not only the value of the critical load that is some five times higher than experimentally observed, it also predicts incorrect scaling of the buckling load as a function of shell's thickness.  This project examines a newly discovered mode-switching phenomenon, whereby small imperfections activate ""latent"" buckling modes with different scaling laws."

The WCMF series promotes the community of researchers from Western U.S. who work in the areas of financial mathematics, insurance, and statistics.  A key mission of WCMF is to help in the training of young faculty and stimulate the careers of the next generation of scientists.  The conference features 12 plenary talks by senior researchers and 10 presentations by invited junior participants, gathering a total of sixty researchers and graduate students.  The meeting encourages and supports participation by students, early-career researchers, and members of under-represented groups.<br/><br/>     The objective of the Conference is to address cutting-edge topics in stochastic perturbation methods, which have emerged as a powerful tool in wide ranging areas of probability, applied mathematics, operations research, and materials science.  The applications that are discussed include analysis of waves in random media, large deviations and rare event computation, systems of interacting agents, large-scale stochastic games, and multi-scale stochastic processes.  A special focus is placed on novel applications of perturbation techniques within financial mathematics, such as pricing short-maturity financial derivatives (e.g. options or credit default swaps), in studying systemic risk in the inter-bank asset flows and credit relationships, and for investigating multi-scale models of asset dynamics (such as stochastic volatility or market microstructure in high-frequency trading).  All of these areas have experienced very rapid developments in the past several years, opening up entire new directions of research in the field.  The conference assembles an international and multi-disciplinary group of experts to encourage new interactions and draw new researchers to these topics.

Analyzing and simulating such equations numerically allows us to make predictions pertaining to the corresponding application. For example, it would be desirable to address the following questions arising in applications: Will signals in optical devices, used for the transmission and storage of data, be stable, or how is energy transferred in turbulent systems?  This project will advance our knowledge in two ways.  First, it will seek to prove, in a mathematically rigorous sense, properties of the equations, an example of which is the stability of optical pulses.  Second, it will develop and justify numerical algorithms for simulating the equations on computers.  Systematic analysis of the algorithms ensures that the computer simulations truly reflect the equations.  Finally, both the analysis and simulation of the equations will determine the regime of validity of these equations as models for the physical applications.  A supplemental benefit of this research is that the numerical algorithms it develops will be applicable to a broad class of equations and physical problems. <br/> <br/>The equations under investigation in this project are of the nonlinear Schrdinger type, including the derivative nonlinear Schrdinger equation and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.  Major analytical questions this work will address include the existence and stability of singular solutions and nonlinear bound states.  These problems will be addressed through asymptotic analysis, variational methods, and spectral theory.  Singularity formation will also be investigated through simulation, using adaptive meshing methodology, such as iterative grid redistribution.  Numerical algorithms for simulating the time dependent problems will be implemented by operator splitting methods, treating the nonlinear and linear dispersive parts of the equation separately.  This numerical analysis will be pursued with the intention of constructing efficient energy preserving methods suitable for long time simulation.  An algorithm for computing nonlinear bound states will be studied in a semi-discrete form, so as to be insensitive to spatial discretization.  The bound state algorithms will assist in the construction of initial conditions, which can then be studied using the time dependent algorithms."

By sending electromagnetic sources from probes in boreholes and reading back resulting potentials, for instance, one can in principle infer the location of oil deposits, which have different electromagnetic properties than the surrounding ground. Brute-force computational approaches, however, are often cumbersome or even intractable for large scale non-linear problems. In the proposed research, mathematical methods will be developed where we find explicit formulas for the dependence of the data on electromagnetic parameters, leading to fast algorithms fine-tuned to specific geometries and having clear physical interpretations. Several students will be trained in the course of the project, including a full time PhD student. The project will also provide undergraduate students the opportunity to spend six months delving deeply into a research problem, and may increase the likelihood they will pursue a higher degree in mathematics or a related field.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to solve several nonlinear spectral problems and related inverse problems in electromagnetics by developing novel asymptotic formulas based on material property perturbations. The project will involve five main components: (i) Asymptotic formulas for resonance values in the presence of linear and nonlinear small volume electromagnetic scatters. The asymptotics will be based on perturbations of simplified limiting problems whose solutions are easily computed. (ii) A dimensionally reduced formulation for the electric field and resonances in the presence of thin high contrast materials. This formulation will provide a high contrast Born approximation which we can invert. (iii) Explicit calculations of the perturbations of transmission eigenvalues for varying material properties. This will include small inhomogeneities, voids, or holes in the materials, and periodic microstructures. The formulas will reveal what material properties can be recovered from reading transmission eigenvalues in the far field. (iv) The development of a fast nonlinear inversion technique and a theory of uniqueness and stability in ultrasound modulated optical tomography, a novel hybrid imaging modality which provides nonlinear internal data for the recovery of optical parameters. (v) An inverse spectral method for nonlinear strings, a project for Drexel undergraduate students.

The investigator  is pursuing the following aims directly related to reaction networks: (1) determining how the combinatorial geometry of a given reaction network informs the long-term dynamics of the resulting dynamical system, (2) classifying and analyzing multistationary reaction networks, and (3) parametrizing multistationarity in post-translational modification systems (important signaling motifs in biology) using techniques from real algebraic geometry such as real root counting.

This requires the so-called Markov structure of the problem, namely, the object depends only on the current value of a certain underlying process.  In many applications, for example in many financial models, the problem may be non-Markovian, namely, the object depends on the whole history of the underlying process.  The investigator and his colleagues study what are called path-dependent partial differential equations, which would enable them to apply standard ideas and techniques to a much larger class of applied problems.  The major difficulty, however, is that in such a non-Markovian framework the object process is typically not smooth and thus cannot be understood as the solution to the equation in a classical sense.  The main aim of this project is to study certain weak solutions, called viscosity solutions, for such equations.  The investigator considers conditions that ensure the existence, uniqueness, and stability of these solutions, and develops numerical methods to compute them.  He also studies time-inconsistent problems via stochastic differential equations.  Such problems arise naturally in many economic and financial applications such as prospect theory and contract theory.  Graduate students will be trained in the course of the project. <br/><br/>The theory of path-dependent partial differential equations considers paths to be a variable; notable examples including path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and Isaacs equations.  It provides a convenient framework for stochastic optimization problems with diffusion control and economic or financial models with volatility uncertainty in a non-Markovian setting.  The investigator and his colleagues have previously developed a theory of viscosity solutions for problems in which the state space is not locally compact and the dominated convergence theorem fails.  In this project he develops the theory further in three directions, mainly motivated by various applications: (i) extending the convex analysis used in standard viscosity theory for partial differential equations to the path-dependent setting and providing a new proof for the comparison principle under weaker conditions;  (ii) investigating the regularity of viscosity solutions; and (iii) proposing feasible numerical methods.  The investigator also considers time-inconsistent problems.  There are typically two types of strategies for such problems: pre-commitment and consistent planning.  Most studies of continuous time models focus on the latter one.  A novel approach for the former one is proposed, by using multidimensional controlled backward stochastic differential equations.  The main innovation is to relate the time inconsistency to a comparison principle and to introduce a new order for comparison.  The approach may also provide new insights for some open problems on multidimensional backward stochastic differential equations, which lack a standard comparison principle."

The associated research, ranging from pure to applied, is extremely broad, with many active groups in the U.S. and abroad. The summer school will treat key topics related to the theory and application of stochastic differential equations, in particular, to turbulent flow simulations: Malliavin calculus,  Monte Carlo methods, multiscale models, molecular dynamics, stochastic methods for turbulent flows, porous media, weather prediction, and uncertainty quantification.

The physics of how these materials behave in applied electric fields or boundary treatments is still being worked out through experiments and simulations.  An important challenge in this area is that the small-scale structure of these materials inevitably contains defects that make their responses even more complex.  Physicists have proposed mathematical models to explain this behavior.  It is important to investigate the nature of solutions in these models to better understand their structure under outside influences, to obtain greater predictability of their behavior, and to develop effective applications for them.  That is the goal of this project.  The project includes the training and participation of graduate students. <br/><br/>The investigator and his colleagues study the formation of defects in soft matter systems, including liquid crystal materials and layered superconductors.  Physicists describe stable states of these materials using vector fields and scalar or tensor-valued order parameters that minimize a free energy.  Pattern formations under external influences, as well as defects and other topological characteristics, are studied using the calculus of variations and nonlinear partial differential equations associated with the free energy.  In nematic liquid crystals, the Landau-de Gennes and Maier-Saupe Q-tensor models form the basis of the investigation.  Of special interest is the nature of configurations obtained in the limit of vanishing elasticity.  Geometric influences, such as flat or curved, thick or thin liquid crystal materials, are considered.  In layered high-temperature superconductors, the Lawrence-Doniach model is the basis for this investigation.  The nature of defects and behavior of solutions in applied magnetic fields of various intensities and orientations is investigated.

Fully nonlinear models accounting for both in-plane and out-of-plane motion in the structure, as well as nonlinear fluids, are considered. Moreover, recent stability analyses will be extended to the intermediary ""transonic"" flow regime and the piston-theoretic, hypersonic regime. Beyond well-posedness of these models, time convergence properties (i.e., attractors) of the dynamics will be considered to determine the sensitivity of non-transient behavior of the system to the plate's boundary conditions and external loading. The current proposal can be viewed as an analysis of models arising in aeroelasticity by providing a comparison between qualitative properties of well-posed PDEs to experimentally observed and/or numerically approximated behaviors."

However, the trouble of growing crystals for macromolecules has become the main bottleneck in crystallography.  An alternative technology called X-ray coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) has the potential of determining noncrystalline structures of single macromolecules.  An essential part of CDI is to solve the mathematical problem called phase retrieval for noncrystalline structures, in order to recover the phase information destroyed by the photon detection process.  The investigator studies the random mask method as a way to recover this information.  Because detection and reconstruction of an optical signal after it has propagated some distance is a basic procedure in optical communication and information processing, effective and efficient phase retrieval for noncrystalline structures can affect not only the development of CDI but also progress on some of the National Research Council Grand Challenge Questions raised in the 2012 report ""Optics and Photonics: Essential Technologies for Our Nation.""  Graduate students are trained in the course of this project.  <br/><br/>     This project focuses on developing the mathematical foundation and numerical schemes for the random mask method (RMM) to enhance the performance of current CDI.  RMM is a quantitative coded-aperture imaging technique that employs a random mask in photon detection and exploits the mask effect in reconstruction.  The investigator and his colleagues study RMM's potential for significant performance gains in the following aspects: accurate reconstruction, efficient computation, improved data quality, and reduction of demand for data and prior knowledge, all of central importance to the ultimate impact of CDI."

The project proposes to analyze the influence of the statistical properties of these coefficients on the quantities of interest in many applied areas such as the uncertainty quantifications in climate predictions, the study of geological basins, and the manufacturing of composite materials. Novel methods in medical imaging often referred to as coupled-physics imaging modalities (such as Elastography or Photo-Acoustic tomography) have the potential to strongly enhance our capabilities to detect unhealthy tissues at a very early stage. The proposal will further the mathematical understanding of such problems and in close collaboration with medical physicists and bio-engineers provide robust reconstruction procedures for such modalities.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the theoretical and mathematical understanding of: (i) the propagation of uncertainty from heterogeneous coefficients to the solutions of differential equations; and (ii) coupled-physics inverse problems, which find applications in novel modalities in medical and geophysical imaging. The latter inverse problem aims to understand the coefficients that can or cannot be reconstructed in a given experimental environment, and the limitations in the accuracy with which such reconstructions are possible based on a given noise level. The former problem aims, among other things, to propose physics-based models for the statistical properties of the measurement noise that limit the reconstruction's accuracy of many inverse problems."

Network structures in complex systems have close relations to phase transitions, materials science, and mathematical biology.  He develops methods to model and analyze the development of structures in amphiphilic mixtures and their properties.  Such systems include biological membranes and polymer materials like polymer electrolyte membranes.  Biological membranes play critical roles in biological processes such as protein transportation, drug encapsulation and delivery.  Polymer electrolyte membranes are key ingredients of fuel cells that are able to efficiently produce clean energy and are a promising replacement for traditional batteries.  Their effectiveness is directly related to their fine structures.  In the course of this project, a graduate student and an undergraduate student are trained.<br/><br/>The principal investigator concentrates on the influence of degenerate diffusion on the dynamics of complex amphiphilic structures, the variational properties of the functionalized Cahn-Hilliard energy, and their relation to amphiphilic structures.  He formulates bilayers, filamentous pores, micelles, and defect structures such as open edges, end caps, and triple junctions, as minimizers of the FCH energy, and relates them to variational properties of the FCH energy under various geometric constraints.  By building degenerate diffusion into the FCH equation, he is able to model biologically significant phenomena such as the co-existence of bilayer vesicles of various sizes and shapes, the diffusion of lipid molecules along lipid bilayer membranes, and the impermeability of bilayers.  He studies the evolution of the defects and the sensitivity of their energies to parametric variation, and identifies the energetic cost for the defects to form.  The tools developed in this project have wide applications in the modeling of other physical and biological systems, and in the study of other problems in applied mathematics related to nonlinear PDEs."

The first two problems concern propagation of waves in non-homogeneous media and optical fibers. The results can be used for detection of hidden objects, nondestructive testing and estimation of the quality of signal transmission in the noisy environment. Further, a mathematical model will be developed for molecular motors used by biophysicists to describe processes in living cells. The model will justify certain hypotheses in the area and will describe quantitatively the parameters for which the hypotheses hold. The last problem concerns the mathematical analysis of modern models of population dynamics aiming to explain the mechanism for non-local and fast propagation of new species. The existence of stable populations with competition between species will be also explained.<br/><br/>On a more technical level, the project includes problems in homogenization, spectral theory of non-standard Hamiltonians, and singularly perturbed partial differential equations needed to address the applied problems mentioned above.  In particular, the following results will be obtained. The Weyl law for the counting function of eigenvalues of (non-self-adjoint) interior transmission problem will be established. Localization theorem will be proved for waveguides with randomly perturbed surfaces. The homogenization principle will be justified for molecular motors. Front propagation will be studied for general contact processes."

Specifically, the PI and co-PI will study systems in which collective behavior manifests non-trivial co-dimension. The mathematics of such particle systems pervades many disciplines, ranging from physics, chemistry and biology to control theory and engineering. Modern applications in these areas include protein folding, colloid stability and the self-assembly of nanoparticles into supramolecular structures. In biology, similar mathematical models help explain the complex phenomena observed in viral capsids, locust swarms and colonies of bacteria. The first phase of this project will apply and expand recently developed mathematical tools to identifiy various physical and chemical interactions that will naturally produce co-dimension one structures. This has a direct application to the study of processes, such as the self-assembly of Polyoxometalate (POM) molecular clusters into spherical supramolecular structures, in which experimental evidence is overwhelming but a theoretical understanding of the underlying formation mechanisms is lacking. The PI, co-PI and their collaborators have made numerous important developments in the mathematical theory of such mechanisms when the interaction is isotropic. This part of the project aims to further develop this theory in a manner that will prove useful to a broad set of researchers in other disciplines. The proposed research project is fundamentally interdisciplinary in that it derives mathematical problems from unexplained phenomena in diverse fields such as chemistry, biology and engineering. The PI and co-PI will apply a broad set of mathematical tools drawing from dynamical systems, partial differential equations, mathematical modeling and computational methods to solve several problems that are subject to active research in these fields, including the so-called 'designer potential problem' in nano self-assembly. By clarifying which physical forces drive POM self-assembly and other related phenomena, such as viral capsid formation, we will provide rigorous solutions to the question of how to design sub-units that form into these importantstructures. <br/><br/>One of the demonstrated career goals of the PI is to further the inclusion of underrepresented groups in the field of mathematics. The PI has the personal experience and critical perspective necessary to serve as a mentor for the diverse student body at University of San Francisco. Exposing these students from underrepresented groups to cuttingedge mathematical research, coupled with faculty mentoring, will inspire many of them to pursue graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences. The student research supported by this grant will prove indispensible to the project's recruitment efforts given USF's high proportion of low-income students who are compelled to work part-time while they pursue full-time academic degree programs. The PI has a proven track record of recruiting talented students from underrepresented groups into mathematics and this grant would allow these activities to continue and expand."
