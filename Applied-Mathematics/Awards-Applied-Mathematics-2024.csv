These clouds exhibit intriguing, organized patterns at various scales, influencing Earth's climate significantly. Their ability to shade vast areas from sunlight creates a cooling effect, with magnitude heavily dependent on the cloud's organization. This project delves into the nonlinear dynamics governing this cloud organization. By understanding this dynamics, the Principal Investigators (PIs) aim to improve predictions regarding the clouds' response to human activities (anthropogenic forcing) and potential abrupt, critical transitions (climate tipping points) as suggested by prior studies. To achieve this, the project will utilize a novel class of spatially extended models specifically designed for cloud dynamics that are computationally more attractive than those currently relying on large-eddy simulations and that will be data-driven and stochastically-driven to reach accuracy. In that respect, these models will leverage insights from previous studies that employed networks of stochastic nonlinear oscillators to understand pattern formation in complex systems. The methods, ideas and outcomes of this project are general and flexible. They hold promise for broad applications in nonlinear sciences, encompassing atmospheric sciences, and the study of complex systems. In addition. this project offers opportunities for student involvement in research projects and has the potential to become a valuable teaching resource due to its innovative approach.<br/><br/>This project will explore the mathematical underpinnings and phenomenological behaviors of these models using a nonlinear dynamics perspective. The project will focus on a new class of partial differential equations called pseudoparabolic Ginzburg-Landau equations (PGLEs), obtained as formal limit of the aforementioned networks. These equations support a wealth of patterns that are not only consistent with cloud organization but also relevant to atmospheric dispersive relations. To account for the crucial effects of turbulence, aerosols, and other microphysical processes on cloud formation, the project will employ modern techniques of state-dependent stochastic parameterizations. These parameterizations will be integrated into the PGLE models, enhancing the variability of solutions in space and time. The PIs will then utilize advanced rare event algorithms to analyze the landscape of possible stochastic patterns. In parallel, the PIs aim to develop high-resolution data-driven PGLE models (1 km resolution), whose coefficients and parameterizations will be trained using high-resolution satellite datasets of clouds. The new equations and parameterizations that are proposed to be analyzed in this project have high interdisciplinary scientific values at the crossroads of data-driven modeling, stochastic analysis, partial differential equation theory, and nonlinear dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, there has been great effort to assemble colloids into new functional materials with designer architecture using electric and magnetic fields. Of particular interest are colloids that spin (rotors), because in such systems the flows stirred by the rotating particles add to the electrostatic interactions, thereby vastly expanding the possible structures. This project will theoretically study the dynamics of colloids placed between two planar electrodes in order to understand the mechanisms of the field-driven particle assembly. The project integrates knowledge across the fields of applied mathematics, fluid mechanics and soft matter, which will be very beneficial for the training of the students associated with the project. Visually appealing experiments will help educate the public about mathematics and fluid dynamics. <br/> <br/>This project is concerned with a theoretical investigation of motile particles in confinement. The focus is on particles driven to either roll or rotate by the Quincke instability in a uniform electric field between two electrodes. Quincke-driven particles are a popular model of active matter, which are systems composed of entities harvesting energy from the environment and converting it into motion. A fascinating feature of active matter is the emergence of macroscopic structures or coherent motions on scales much larger than the individual unit. Agent-based models are often employed to describe the collective dynamics of motile individuals. A key challenge is the choice of rules for the interaction between the agents. In the case of Quincke-driven particles, demonstrating the importance of physics-informed mathematical models has been a major thrust in the research conducted by the investigators. Current models of the particle dynamics are unable to explain the experiments due to inadequate description of the boundary effects. To fill this void, the investigators develop mathematical models, analytical solutions, and accurate and efficient computational solutions of the electrohydrodynamics of many particles between two walls, which are mathematically challenging multiphase and multibody problems. The mathematical advances are many and include analytical solutions of single particle dynamics between electrodes, detailed analysis of the pair-wise particle interactions in confinement, and integration of these analytical results into an algorithm based on multipole expansions for many particles. Experiments integrated with the mathematical research inform and test the mathematical models and to ensure that the research has impact both in and beyond the applied mathematics community. Educational impact includes bringing direct experimental experience in fluid dynamics and soft matter research to applied mathematics undergraduate and graduate students at Northwestern University. The emergent behavior of the Quincke rotors will likely open new research directions across various fields, e.g., non-equilibrium soft matter, materials engineering, and fluid dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists and engineers apply these equations to model various phenomena, including weather patterns, ocean currents, flows around vehicles, aircraft, and ships, as well as blood flow. Mathematicians and physicists believe that understanding the solutions to these equations can lead to an explanation for turbulence. Despite their wide range of applications, there is no theoretical guarantee that smooth solutions to these equations can exist for all time. Mathematically, proving whether smooth solutions to these equations without external forces exist for all time or can break down in finite time has been a longstanding open problem. The potential breakdown mechanism also remains elusive for several related equations with a wide range of applications. The goal of this research is to investigate the potential breakdown mechanism for various equations and develop analytic and numeric tools that provide a theoretical understanding of these mechanisms. This award will also provide opportunities for students to be involved in the latest developments from this research through topics courses and research projects.<br/><br/>The project aims to understand whether the incompressible 3D Euler equations and related equations could develop a finite time singularity from a smooth initial condition with finite energy. Our approach builds on PI's recent works on singularity formation in incompressible fluids and the self-similar method for finite time blowup, which consists of the following three steps. Firstly, we construct an approximate blowup profile, which can be obtained either analytically or numerically. Secondly, we impose suitable normalization conditions and prove the nonlinear stability of the approximate blowup profile. Thirdly, we choose a suitable perturbation to construct initial data with desired property and obtain finite time blowup using a rescaling relation. Additionally, the project seeks to develop a novel approach for the stability analysis in the self-similar variables that is robust enough to be applied to study a larger class of nonlinear partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first part of the project addresses fundamental challenges of ray optics and mathematical billiards that model mechanical systems with elastic collision, such as the ideal gas. Geometrical optics provide a good approximation for many applications, such as trapping rays of light and storing solar energy, invisibility, and laser beam shaping. The second part addresses vehicle kinematics, studied both theoretically and via computer experiments.  Applications include control of tractors with many trailers, preventing driving hazard, motion planning for robots, flotation theory, such as the stability of floating bodies, and modeling of the Josephson effect that plays an essential role in constructing quantum-mechanical circuits. This project will also contribute to the training of graduate researchers.<br/><br/>The mathematical scope of this project is closely related with the theory of completely integrable systems. The billiard (optical) reflection is a symplectic transformation of the space of oriented lines (rays of light), making it possible to use methods of Hamiltonian dynamics and symplectic topology in the study of billiards. For example, the known designs of optical traps for parallel beams of light make use of the complete integrability of the billiard systems inside quadratic surfaces. The second part of the project concerning models of vehicle motion involves methods of sub-Riemannian geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics. A relation with the theory of completely integrable systems is manifested in the fact that the optimal vehicle trajectories, and also the sections of the cylindrical bodies that float in equilibrium in all positions, have the shape of solitons of the filament equation, a well-studied completely integrable system that models the motion of fluid and gas vortices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This framework is ubiquitous across various scientific and technological disciplines, encompassing fields such as medical imaging, atmospheric remote sensing, geophysics, and non-destructive evaluation. In many practical scenarios, medium parameters exhibit anisotropy, meaning they depend not only on position but also on direction. Examples include conductivity in muscle tissue in human bodies, electromagnetic parameters in crystals, composite materials like fiber-reinforced polymers, and seismic wave propagation in the Earth. The project aims to develop novel mathematical methods for investigating inverse problems related to the recovery of anisotropic medium parameters from measurements taken at the exterior or boundary. A particular focus of the project is on determining parameters in models involving long-range interactions, prevalent in phenomena from anomalous diffusion to random processes with jumps, with broad applications spanning image processing, fluid dynamics, biophysics, network science, epidemiology, and finance. Additionally, the project places significant emphasis on providing educational training for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project leverages nonlocality, nonlinearity, and high frequencies as powerful tools to tackle significant and challenging inverse problems in anisotropic media. It is organized around four pivotal research topics. The first topic concerns inverse problems for elliptic partial differential operators at a large but fixed frequency. The goal is to solve important inverse problems for both linear and nonlinear elliptic operators at a large but fixed frequency in a geometric setting where the corresponding inverse problems at zero frequency are wide open and seem difficult to reach. The second topic focuses on inverse problems for nonlocal elliptic operators, with a particular emphasis on the fractional counterpart of the Calderon problem. The aim is to recover the coefficients of nonlocal operators based on measurements taken in exterior regions. The inherent nonlocality of these operators renders inverse problems more tractable than their local counterparts. The third topic deals with inverse problems for significant nonlinear hyperbolic and elliptic partial differential equations, encountered in physical models. The primary objective is to recover the leading terms that govern the underlying geometry. Finally, the fourth topic addresses inverse problems for both linear and nonlinear perturbations of biharmonic operators, with applications ranging from elasticity theory to conformal geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main mathematical difficulty in these problems lies in understanding the interplay between the dynamics of the fluid and the geometry of the interface. The aim of this project is to develop tools for the study of these problems and to deepen our knowledge of how these interfaces influence the dynamics of fluid models. This award will also provide opportunities for the involvement of undergraduate students in the research projects.  <br/><br/>This award will develop new mathematical tools to tackle problems involving free-surface fluid flows. The first project concerns the study of plasmas in the laboratory setting and is connected with the problem of ""magnetic confinement fusion"", which seeks to control a hot plasma by using powerful magnetic fields for the purposes of harnessing fusion reactions in the core. The mathematical challenge is to identify and construct magnetic fields which are effective at confining hot plasmas. The difficulty is that generic plasma configurations can possess a complicated mixture of invariant surfaces and chaotic regions. The second project concerns the long-time dynamics of self-gravitating fluids. One major obstruction to understanding the long-time behavior of these objects is the existence of a large and complicated family of periodic solutions.

Crumples in a sheet of paper, wrinkles in curtains, defects in liquid crystals or superconductors share at least one thing in common - they are the results of a certain energy minimization. Hence, this project is aimed at creating novel energy minimizing models, in particular, in metallic alloys, which would be capable of capturing and explaining certain experimentally observable effects. The investigator is developing new mathematical techniques that address the mechanism behind the optimality of these models. Furthermore, these techniques have the potential to be used in other areas of materials science, such as the location of defects in superconductors or the analysis of random porous media, which are also addressed in the project. The project has both scientific and educational components. The importance of this work is not only that it introduces novel variational problems in materials science and develops new methods to analyze them, but it also advances the discovery and understanding of new phenomena and contributes to the development of new materials, such as shape memory alloys. The educational component of the project involves development of special topics courses at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) as well as mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups. As a part of this project, an applied mathematics seminar series is being held at VCU by bringing national and international experts to interact with faculty and students.<br/><br/>The common aim of the project is understanding the structures, formed in a variety of physical systems of practical interest. The first part of the project is devoted to the patterns in martensitic phase transitions, or thermal material transformations, leading to shape memory effect. The investigator is obtaining a theoretical insight on certain experimentally observed phenomena in shape memory alloys, induced by bending and described in the physical literature. The investigator also addresses the effects of anisotropy and develops a novel approach to show that the experimentally observed patterns are energy minimizing. The second part of the project deals with the patterns in the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity.  The investigator considers the variational problem, related to the minimization of Ginzburg-Landau functional with certain (semi-stiff) boundary conditions, and shows that this problem has solutions with defects (vortices) near the domain boundary. The technique of matching upper and lower bounds is used to predict the precise location of these defects. Finally, the third part of the project deals with optimal control problems for porous media equations with stochastic forcing. Optimal control problems have a vast range of applications, ranging from economics to engineering. In this project the investigator considers the porous medium equation, subject to additional stochastic influence, and extends the classic techniques of homogenization theory to the stochastically perturbed optimal control case.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applied and computational mathematics combined with mathematical modeling can provide the necessary tools to accomplish these goals and to uncover knowledge that will be generally useful for hydromechanical applications.

The investigations will also educate students and train researchers, thereby contributing to a workforce that is well prepared to tackle these and related problems.<br/><br/>This project combines experiments, simulations, mathematical modeling, and analysis to investigate the coupled dynamics of fluid-solid systems with mass and momentum flux. The work will be conducted in the context of auto-rotating devices that respond to the injection or withdrawal of fluid, notably the Feynman sprinkler problem and related applications. The efforts will aim to develop appropriate methods for determining how forces and motions can be generated and controlled for open structures whose complex geometries interact with the flows produced by sources and sinks. The research will progress from targeted investigations of the sprinkler problem to more general inquiries into flux-based forces and the roles played by geometry and the driving strength. Experiments will involve the development and application of laboratory systems capable of sensitively resolving motions, forces, and flow fields.

The precision of this effect is so remarkable (accurate to one part in a billion) that it underpins the modern metrological definitions of the kilogram and the ampere. The project aims to bridge a crucial gap in the current understanding of the QHE, specifically the lack of microscopic mathematical theory explaining 'anyons' in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Developing such a theory could advance efforts to construct and operate topological quantum computers. Furthermore, the investigator commits to training a new generation of scientists by involving graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research in quantum information and engineering, promoting educational advancement and diversity in STEM fields. Through these efforts, the project not only advances scientific knowledge but also helps maintain a skilled workforce. <br/><br/>The project focuses on the theory of integer and fractional QHE. While our understanding of integer QHE is quite robust, there remain several profound mathematical problems that have yet to be answered. Conversely, our comprehension of fractional QHE is limited, and there is no microscopic theory of anyons in the fractional quantum Hall effect - such a theory is highly relevant for applications in topological quantum computation. This project aims to advance our understanding of the fractional case and address open problems in the integer case. The project comprises two parts: (A) fractions in QHE and (B) frustration-free models of QHE. A significant problem in the theory of fractional QHE is explaining which fractions are admissible. Notably, a fractional Hall conductance of one half is not experimentally observed (is not admissible), while one third is. Numerous competing theories attempt to explain admissible fractions, but even within the realm of theoretical physics, there is no definitive answer to this problem. At a mathematical level of rigor, nothing is known. The investigator will study a new, symmetry-based explanation and further aims to make this explanation mathematically rigorous. The idea is to relate admissible fractions to symmetry constraints on a modular tensor category that describes anyonic excitations of the system. All exactly solvable models of anyons are frustration-free; however, none of these models describe the QHE. In (B), the goal is to demonstrate that this is not a coincidence and that all frustration-free models have zero Hall conductance. The investigator aims to establish a connection to the theory of frames and use this connection to prove the conjecture. The investigator will employ a diverse combination of mentoring activities to guide mentees' individual research processes and provide them with opportunities to participate in more advanced work.

This fact stems from two key observations: a) these equations can capture various physical phenomena that cannot be described by simpler models, and b) these equations allow for various classes of solutions that can be calculated in explicit form. For example, the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation (NLS), is widely used to model wave propagation in weakly nonlinear dispersive media (fiber optics, deep water gravity waves) when dissipation can be neglected. It was observed that solitons, which are the most celebrated explicit solutions of integrable systems, can be viewed as ?""quasi particles"" of complex statistical objects called soliton gases. The main idea of this project is to model random nonlinear waves, which are frequently encountered in natural phenomena, with large random ensembles of solitons. Ultimately, the project aims to enhance our ability to predict and, in some cases, to control random nonlinear waves, as well as to derive their statistical characteristics. Being by nature a mixture of pure and applied mathematics and also leading to new lab experiments, the work on the project could benefit by cross pollination of ideas and methods originating from different parts of nonlinear waves research community. The project is expected to advance our general knowledge of random nonlinear waves, including the rogue waves (RW), and to improve methods of prediction of the latter. In the fiber optics, the results of the project may help to model and, perhaps, to control the evolution of noise in NLS governed nonlinear fibers. The project will also serve as a vehicle for training graduate and undergraduate students, including minorities, as well as postdocs.<br/> <br/>The main goals of this project are a) development of a rigorous spectral theory for soliton gases for integrable equations (KdV, fNLS, sine-Gordon, etc.), and b) statistical characterization of such soliton gases. The work in part a) requires rigorous derivation and analysis of the nonlinear dispersion relations (NDR), which describe spectral characteristics of the gases, as well as construction of explicit families of solutions to NDR (condensates, periodic gases, etc.) that can be of special interest in applications. The recent observation by the principal investigator (PI) that the NDR can be considered as a large genus (``thermodynamic"") limit of Riemann Bilinear Identities on some special sequences of Riemann surfaces reveals a deep and intriguing connections between the algebraic geometry and the spectral theory of soliton gases for integrable equations, which the PI is interested in understanding and analyzing. This approach requires some new potential theory methods for solving minimization problems on Riemann surfaces.

Such examples are abundant in biology, dynamics of human crowds, social networking, and even in technology (coordinated fight of an escort of UAVs or satellite navigation). Although the laws that describe the average may not be given explicitly, most adhere to a few basic principles. First, agents react more to the closest neighbors, and second, the density of the swarm plays a constructive role in defining particular communication rules. Such rules give rise to what is called ""environmental averaging"".   Large swarms regulated by environmental averaging are governed by models similar to those we use to study motion of a liquid like water or gas.  Thanks to this connection a new trend emerged in the studies of collective behavior which looks at these phenomena from the point of view of hydrodynamic modeling. This project proposes to analyze hydrodynamic collective models aiming at understanding their fundamental mathematical properties and with a view towards their applications to collective phenomena. In parallel with the research effort, the project will involve students and researchers through a working group seminar on the mathematics of collective behavior at the University of Illinois at Chicago. <br/><br/>Central to the project will be the development of a general methodology that unifies numerous models. Focus will be placed on justification of a class hydrodynamic models called Euler Alignment System and its kinetic counterpart the Fokker-Planck-Alignment model.  We aim to provide a justification for such systems going from particle dynamics through the mean-field limit and into macroscopic description through various hydrodynamic limits. It will be possible to obtain new barotropic pressure laws which have proved to be useful in real life modeling. Exploiting parallels with the classical theory of fluids we plan to study collective outcomes described by natural thermodynamic equilibria of the system, and to bring the regularity theory of such systems to the level usable in the studies of long-time behavior of the system.

These phases, such as ""high temperature"" superconductivity, hold exciting potential for technological applications such as creating a scalable quantum computer. Recently discovered ""moiré"" materials, formed by stacking 2D materials with a relative twist, hold unique promise as platforms for investigation of such phases. The investigator is tackling open mathematical problems with direct relevance to understanding the emergence and properties of strongly correlated electronic phases in moiré materials. By tackling these problems, the investigator is helping to advance novel technologies and strengthening connections between mathematics, physics and engineering. The investigator is training University of Minnesota graduate students in core techniques in applied mathematics and expanding awareness of exciting modern topics in applied mathematics through outreach to middle and high school students in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.<br/><br/>In preliminary work, the investigator justified the Bistritzer-MacDonald continuum PDE model for the wave-function of an electron in twisted bilayer graphene. The importance of this model is that, even though the underlying atomic-scale model is aperiodic, the continuum model has moiré-periodic coefficients, allowing the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene to be studied using Bloch theory. The research project is building on this work, with the ultimate goal of developing mathematical methods for predicting moiré materials' strongly correlated electronic phases. In the near term, the project will build directly on the investigator's preliminary work. First, generalizing it to more realistic models incorporating atomic relaxation, and to models of other moiré materials. Second, analytically investigating important properties of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model such as Dirac point degeneracies and band topology. Over the medium term, the project will build on the insights gained from earlier work to develop and justify more accurate models of mechanical properties of moiré materials such as atomic relaxation and vibration (phonons). Two approaches will be investigated: a phenomenological continuum approach, and an atomic-scale approach where ions interact through interatomic potentials. Over the long term, the project will again build on earlier insights to develop models of electrons interacting in moiré materials. In the first of these, electrons will interact directly through the Coulomb force. In the second, the electron-electron interaction will be mediated by a phonon. Mathematically, the project involves rigorous asymptotic analysis and perturbation theory, PDE theory, spectral theory, calculus of variations, and ergodic theory.

Immersed filaments play an essential role in biological phenomena such as sperm motility, blood perfusion, and so-called bacterial turbulence. Many important mathematical models have been developed over the past 70 years to describe fluid-filament interaction across multiple scales, but most of our understanding of these models has come from numerical simulation and formal asymptotics. Often, trying to justify or understand these models from the perspective of rigorous PDEs gives rise to fascinating new analysis questions and potentially new biophysical insights. The goal of this project is to address some of the fundamental PDE questions inspired by these models of immersed fibers. The broader impacts of this project include course development and research mentoring. The PI plans to develop a new graduate-level course covering aspects of both the computational methods and PDE analysis of the models appearing in this project. In addition, this project involves training opportunities for students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The PI will continue to promote inclusivity in the math community through the EDGE program (Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education), a network of women (especially from underrepresented groups) in math. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI will address PDE questions inspired by immersed filament models at two scales: (1) dynamics of a single filament, and (2) collective dynamics of many filaments. At scale (1), the PI aims to make mathematical sense of a curve evolution model that is popular in numerics yet remains difficult to justify analytically. To address this, the PI will develop the PDE theory for a novel type of free boundary problem coupling quasi-1D filament dynamics with a 3D fluid background. Analysis of this free boundary problem will provide a more complete mathematical foundation for the many computational results on immersed filament dynamics based on slender body theory. The analytical framework developed to study this problem can be applied more broadly to tackle questions for models of swimming and blood flow. At scale (2), the PI aims to develop a detailed understanding of the dynamics of a kinetic model of a suspension of motile filaments that is fundamental in the active matter community. A particular focus is on quantifying how motility affects mixing and transport in the suspension both near and far from equilibrium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its appeal, this complexity and flexibility also often makes its mathematical analysis intractable. In cases when the game is played by a large number of identical agents, mean field paradigm widely employed in physics offers a simplifying approach without compromising its modeling potential.  This new perspective has been actively studied over the past decade and proved to be effectively applicable across various fields.  Additionally, as in the mean field regime the players have small impact on the macro behavior of the system, it becomes feasible to coordinate their actions through a central planner providing equilibria that are beneficial to all. This project is centered around these models that are centrally controlled.  While in some cases this is the natural setting, games that have potential structure are also intrinsically connected to these mean field control problems. This project also provides opportunities for the involvement of students in the research.<br/><br/>Technically, the main feature of mean field type optimization is the dependence of its evolution and cost, not only on the position of the state, but also on its probability distribution, making the set of distributions its state space. Thus, the dynamic programming approach results in nonlinear partial differential equations set in the spaces of probability measures. For games these are coupled Hamilton-Jacobi and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov systems. For mean field control however, the differential equations characterizing the minimal value are naturally set in the Wasserstein space of probability measures with finite second moments, and they are not expected to admit classical solutions.  Towards the central goal of building an efficient theory for these equations, this project aims to develop a complete theory for the associated dynamic programming equation for mean field control, to study the potential games in detail, and to establish efficient numerical approaches using modern optimization packages with theoretical guarantees based on tools from statistical machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will contribute theoretical and computational approaches for understanding the dynamics of such reaction-diffusion systems.  One theme of this research is understanding how complexities in the spatial coupling of components affect the dynamics of these systems.  This complexity could take the form of network-based interactions of components or it could consist of understanding the role of spatial barriers for which the rate of diffusion or reaction is different from that of the bulk of the domain.  Outcomes will include mathematical results validating certain reduced systems, modeling and analysis of several applied problems, as well as the development of rigorous computational methods for the study of traveling interfaces.   The project will also contribute to the training of PhD and undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>Three specific project areas are to be considered.  The first revolves around the analysis of reaction-diffusion equations defined on networks.  When the number of components is large, it is often convenient to pass to a mean-field limit where the discrete graph is replaced by a more tractable nonlocal equation.  The goal of this project is to contribute theoretical results relating the nonlocal equation and the discrete system thereby validating the use of the nonlocal equation.  The second project involves the development of validated numerical techniques for the study of fronts propagating into unstable states.  The primary challenge in this analysis is the appearance of repeated eigenvalues and resonances in the linearization of the traveling wave equation near the unstable state.

Well-known, and perhaps familiar, examples include the Stefan problem for melting and freezing of ice in water and the capillary problem describing the shapes of water droplets on a car window or a leaf.  In these problems it is very important to understand the effects of heterogenous media. Microscopic structure plays a major role in determining the macroscopic physics, for example whether a water droplet will ""stick"" to a surface (due to contact angle hysteresis) or roll off (low hysteresis and/or superhydrophobicity). In mathematical terms such interface problems lie at the intersection of several fields: partial differential equations (PDE), geometry, and probability / statistical physics. This project aims to advance the theory of phase interfaces in heterogeneous media by developing new techniques which make connections between these distinct mathematical fields.  The project will contribute to the development of STEM workforce and STEM education through training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>This project will study free boundary problems in heterogeneous media at micro and macro scales, especially as related to problems of capillarity and wetting.   The two main goals are: (1) to develop a theory of large-scale regularity for one- and two-phase free boundary problems and obstacle problems in periodic and random media, (2) to derive and study models for the rate independent evolution of capillary drops under the effects of contact angle hysteresis.  Quantitative results in homogenization and hydrodynamic limits enable more efficient computations which can be rigorously validated.  The large-scale regularization properties of elliptic and parabolic PDE in periodic and random media is central in the study of quantitative homogenization.  Much less is known in the context of phase interfaces or free boundaries.  This project will advance the quantitative homogenization theory of free boundaries and interfaces by studying several important model problems. In the theory of wetting on a rough surface, a rigorous mathematical formulation in terms of calculus of variations and homogenization theory can clarify the meaning of ambiguous physical models for computing effective contact angles.

Developing effective methods for testing complex materials to detect structural defects or identify unknown targets efficiently and with minimal a priori information is highly desirable. This need is particularly pronounced for materials exhibiting directional properties, multi-periodicities with non-commensurable periods, nonlinear interactions with probing waves, or peculiar geometric structures, all prevalent in modern applications across the mentioned domains. This project involves the development of novel techniques in inverse scattering theory to address contemporary imaging challenges, aiming for reliable target signatures or useful information about examined objects in computationally efficient ways. The objective is to reduce reliance on a priori information describing the physics and geometry of targets, as well as on mathematical and computational complexities arising from complex background environments.  Graduate students will be trained and participate in this research. <br/><br/>This project will investigate a non-iterative approach for solving inverse scattering problems for both linear and nonlinear inhomogeneous media.   The generalized linear sampling method and interior eigenvalues form the unified mathematical framework for four interconnected projects. 1) Imaging of Inhomogeneous Media with Interior Eigenvalues: Motivated by the theory of transmission eigenvalues, the investigator and collaborators have developed a framework for modifying the scattering data, leading to new eigenvalue problems related to injectivity of the relative scattering operator. These eigenvalues are determined from scattering data and show versatile potential to image changes/faults in the media. The goal of this project is to address mathematical and computational questions in this framework to broaden the applicability of these techniques to anisotropic/absorbing/dispersive media, meta-surfaces, and clusters of defects. 2) Transmission Eigenvalues and Non-scattering Phenomena: A fundamental challenge in scattering theory is whether incoming time harmonic waves at a particular wave number are not scattered by a given inhomogeneity. The investigator will address mathematical questions on this topic involving non-selfadjoint spectral theory and free boundary regularity. These questions are important in applications since at a non-scattering wave number, the scattering operator is not injective. 3) Qualitative and Spectral Imaging Approach for Nonlinear Media: This project aims to establish mathematical foundations of inverse scattering for second-order harmonic generation in nonlinear optics as well as to develop the generalized linear sampling method and related spectral imaging for this model. This approach is promising for nonlinear models since it does not require solving the nonlinear partial differential equations. 4) Scattering by Almost-periodic Layers and Imaging of Local Defects: Periodicity plays an important role in the engineering of exotic materials in contemporary applications. Mathematically, almost periodic coefficients in the equations that govern wave propagation are viewed as traces along a hyperplane with an irrational normal of higher-dimensional periodic functions. This leads to a degenerate augmented principal differential operator in the model. Having understood the direct scattering problem, the investigator plans to extend the generalized linear sampling method to reconstruct local perturbation within an almost periodic layer without knowing a priori the almost periodic coefficients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this, the project will utilize a novel class of spatially extended models specifically designed for cloud dynamics that are computationally more attractive than those currently relying on large-eddy simulations and that will be data-driven and stochastically-driven to reach accuracy. In that respect, these models will leverage insights from previous studies that employed networks of stochastic nonlinear oscillators to understand pattern formation in complex systems. The methods, ideas and outcomes of this project are general and flexible. They hold promise for broad applications in nonlinear sciences, encompassing atmospheric sciences, and the study of complex systems. In addition. this project offers opportunities for student involvement in research projects and has the potential to become a valuable teaching resource due to its innovative approach.<br/><br/>This project will explore the mathematical underpinnings and phenomenological behaviors of these models using a nonlinear dynamics perspective. The project will focus on a new class of partial differential equations called pseudoparabolic Ginzburg-Landau equations (PGLEs), obtained as formal limit of the aforementioned networks. These equations support a wealth of patterns that are not only consistent with cloud organization but also relevant to atmospheric dispersive relations. To account for the crucial effects of turbulence, aerosols, and other microphysical processes on cloud formation, the project will employ modern techniques of state-dependent stochastic parameterizations. These parameterizations will be integrated into the PGLE models, enhancing the variability of solutions in space and time. The PIs will then utilize advanced rare event algorithms to analyze the landscape of possible stochastic patterns. In parallel, the PIs aim to develop high-resolution data-driven PGLE models (1 km resolution), whose coefficients and parameterizations will be trained using high-resolution satellite datasets of clouds. The new equations and parameterizations that are proposed to be analyzed in this project have high interdisciplinary scientific values at the crossroads of data-driven modeling, stochastic analysis, partial differential equation theory, and nonlinear dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past 50 years, a large body of knowledge has been accumulated on the nonlinear wave equations known as ?integrable systems?, which are used to model a wide variety of physically interesting phenomena, ranging from fluid dynamics and nonlinear optics, to low temperature physics and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Several integrable systems are studied as part of the project: scalar and multicomponent nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) type equations, Maxwell-Bloch equations describing the interaction of light with an active optical medium, discrete integrable and non-integral lattices such as the Ablowitz-Ladik equations, the discrete NLS, the Salerno model, etc. The project has concrete applications in nonlinear optics and BEC, and the investigator also collaborates with physicists to seek experimental validation of the results of obtained by the principal investigator (PI). It is therefore anticipated that the outcomes of the project will also provide practical information that will help scientists and engineers more broadly, thus potentially benefiting the society at large. As part of the project, the investigator is involved in the organization of several conferences and special sessions at larger professional meetings in the US and abroad, e.g., a 4 week-long program on ?Emergent Phenomena in Nonlinear Dispersive Waves?, to be held at Northumbria University, Newcastle, UK, in July-August 2024.

The key feature of active matter is the presence of ""active agents"" that convert energy from the environment into mechanical motion, e.g., a bacterium ""eats"" and converts chemical energy into mechanical motion. The research on active matter addresses the complex behavior of both biological systems and bio-inspired manufactured materials. Two areas of active matter will be studied: active gels and suspensions of active swimmers in fluids. In the first area, the focus will be on active gels such as the cytoskeleton gel that drives the motion of a living cell. Understanding this motion is important because of its role in wound healing, immune response, and cancer metastasis. The key challenge of the proposed mathematical models is the presence of a moving deformable boundary (""free boundary"") of the domain where the equations of motion of the active gel are defined. The project will address fundamental mathematical questions concerning the stability of solutions to differential equations in domains with a free boundary. In the second area, the focus will be on the collective motion of bacteria in anisotropic biofluids. The aim here is to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the behavior of complex biological systems such as dense bacterial colonies. The proposed work in both areas will result in the development of novel mathematical techniques that can be applied to various problems in biophysics and materials science. This award will provide opportunities for involvement of students in the research projects.<br/><br/>The proposed work is aimed at the rigorous analysis of recently developed free boundary and homogenization PDE models of active matter. The project will investigate two areas of active matter: (A) crawling cell motion on a substrate and (B) collective motion of microswimmers in anisotropic fluids. The goal of the proposed work is two-fold: to develop novel mathematical techniques for the analysis of active systems that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and to provide a better understanding of the biophysical phenomena in areas (A) and (B). In area (A), novel asymptotic techniques for spectral analysis of non-self-adjoint operators will be developed to rigorously prove bistability, i.e., the coexistence of two stable states of the cell: motile and sessile states. Due to the nonlinearity and non-self-adjointness of the free boundary problem that models cell motion, new techniques for both linear and nonlinear stability analysis will need to be developed. In area (B), the PI will develop novel stochastic homogenization techniques to obtain explicit asymptotic formulas for the effective rheological properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concerning a): Certain materials, often made up of rod-like or disc-like molecules, display a range of ""liquid crystalline phases"" at suitable temperature/concentration ranges; these phases lie between the traditional (disordered) liquid and (ordered) crystalline phase, and thus possess varying degrees of order. Liquid crystals and their suspensions have revolutionized the industry of ultra-thin display devices and are showing promise in a number of other applications such as drug delivery, active matter and the orientation of carbon nanotubes. Concerning b): The photonic devices studied in this project include certain novel kinds of resonators, waveguides, and antennas. Particular focus is on devices made from epsilon near zero materials: these are materials whose dielectric permittivity is close to zero at the frequency of device operation. These novel devices find applications in efforts to enhance light-matter interactions. Common to both scientific threads of the proposed research is that their mathematical modeling leads to unconventional questions in partial differential equations and the calculus of variations that require new analytical tools that this project will develop. The scientific broader impact of this research is that its findings are expected to shed valuable insights on specific models used in application areas. These insights are expected to explain the results of direct numerical simulation (DNS) when this is possible, and more importantly, provide qualitative and (sometimes) quantitative information when DNS becomes formidable or even prohibitive. The project will also include a significant component on human resource development: a number of the projects in this award will be carried out in collaboration with graduate students and postdocs at the University of Utah. The trainees will learn, use, and develop tools in the calculus of variations, partial differential equations, geometric measure theory and homogenization theory.<br/><br/>Concerning liquid crystals, at the heart of their role in the aforementioned applications are both their anisotropic properties leading to their ordered phases on the one hand, and the rich phase transitions they can undergo between phases displaying varying degrees of order. This project will elucidate these effects through mathematical modeling and analysis and explain how they robustly result in a description of the shapes of the phase boundaries between the ordered nematic and disordered isotropic phase. A different goal of the research thread on liquid crystals is the justification of the widely used ""electrostatic"" description of the many-particle interactions in out-of-equilibrium liquid crystal colloids. Such a description is invaluable, because without it the modeling of liquid crystal colloids consists of a highly nonconvex, nonlinear problem in a domain exterior to the colloidal particles (coupled with other multi-physics aspects of the specific application). Concerning photonic devices: The mathematical problems addressed will involve either the Maxwell system (in 3D) or the scalar Helmholtz equation (in 2D) but with piecewise constant, complex coefficients; often such systems interact in interesting ways with geometric features such as corners, producing resonance effects. This project is aimed at understanding these effects, and some novel shape optimization problems arising from these physical situations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concept of emergence will be explored in the context of dynamic and stochastic, multiscale dispersive wave phenomena described by nonlinear partial differential equations.  This program will host approximately 35 long-term, residential visitors at any given time and 60 or more participants in a one-week workshop. The diverse, international roster of participants includes leading researchers in the applied mathematical sciences. This National Science Foundation award provides travel support for early career applied mathematicians from the United States to participate in the workshop and the program. Traditionally underrepresented groups in applied mathematics will be encouraged to apply. This support enables sustained opportunities to interact with leading researchers from around the world. Such interactions and contacts are invaluable to beginning researchers, both to inspire research, and for professional development, thereby helping to cultivate the very best young researchers. These researchers will be the next generation of applied mathematicians who advance this and other applied mathematical fields of research.<br/><br/>Emergence is a powerful concept that plays a fundamental role in many areas of theoretical and mathematical physics. In a system composed of a very large number of elementary constituents, e.g. classical or quantum particles, the observable macroscopic behavior can be highly nontrivial.

The investigator aims to develop a general method to overcome high dimensionality of these PDEs via developing an iterative solver that combines the advantages of tensor-network, Monte Carlo, and convex optimization methods. The main idea is to solve for only a small number of descriptors of the solution (e.g., the statistical moments of the solution) and then recover a compressed representation of the solution through these descriptors. An improved solution procedure will contribute to the Material Genome Initiative by developing new computational tools for physical and chemical simulations. The proposed education plan aims to train graduate students for quantitative research at the intersection of mathematical and physical sciences, fostering a new generation of researchers well-equipped to tackle problems of national interest in scientific computing, machine learning, and quantum computing. Through research advising, a summer mentoring program, and the development of a summer school for quantum mechanics, the proposal aims to encourage the participation of underrepresented students in scientific research and higher education. <br/> <br/>Currently, Monte Carlo methods have been widely successful in many practical physical and chemical simulation tools due to their flexibility, despite potential drawbacks such as slow mixing time and high variance. An alternative approach to characterizing chemical/physical systems is to deterministically solve for the solution of a PDE over the entire space, which can work only for small (and consequently low-dimensional) problems. The proposed research attempts to address the limitations of sampling-based and PDE approaches through the development of an iterative solver. It involves fast iterations achieved by alternating between short-time Monte Carlo simulations and estimating a tensor-network ansatz. It relies on the initialization strategy underpinned by convex optimization in order to reduce the number of iterations. Monte Carlo variance of traditional sampling methods is significantly reduced since only a small number of tensor-network parameters need to be estimated. On the other hand, it significantly extends the flexibility of tensor-network methods by allowing stochastic operations. To this end, a novel tensor-network-based generative model is proposed where density can be learned from empirical samples without the use of any optimization. It would impact statistics by providing new density estimators and analysis without the curse of dimensionality. Further, a new moment method based on convex optimization is proposed for solving high-dimensional PDEs.

These systems have found applications in diverse fields, including ecology, engineering, and social sciences, yet their high-dimensional nature makes them challenging to study. This often leads to significant theoretical and computational difficulties, known as the ?curse of dimensionality.? Recent advances in applied mathematics have shed light on these complexities, revealing that complex NetID patterns can arise from low dimensional interactions. Building on these insights, this project is dedicated to developing a theoretical and computational framework to address the estimation problems within these models by exploiting the underlying low dimensional structures. The overarching goal is to create efficient, physically interpretable surrogate models that bridge the gap between qualitative analysis and quantitative data-driven applications, ranging from sensor network optimization to modeling the environmental and climate impacts on fish migration. This research program will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, featuring a graduate summer school at the intersection of NetIDs and machine learning. There will be a particular focus on engaging female and underrepresented minority students in this vibrant field, blending machine learning with differential equations. The project's findings will also enrich mathematical data science course materials for both undergraduate and graduate education.<br/><br/>This project aims to make fundamental mathematical, statistical, and computational advances for solving NetIDs' estimation problems. The research will focus on three primary areas: (1) Developing innovative sampling strategies for optimal data recovery in NetIDs with linear interactions by exploiting their inherent low-dimensionality in terms of sparsity, smoothness, low-rankness. (2) Establishing robust statistical estimation of NetIDs with nonlinear time-varying interactions by combining machine learning, numerical analysis, and functional data analysis to create physically consistent estimators that bypass the ?curse of dimensionality,? while exploring the identifiability and convergence as sample sizes increase. (3) Investigating the statistical predictive properties of Graph Neural Differential Equations, aiming to derive upper bounds for their transferability and generalization error. The results of this project are expected to address the computational challenges of large-scale Graph Neural Networks and bridge theory and practice in NetIDs research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will contribute to the design and analysis of implementable and computationally efficient algorithms for optimization, sampling and filtering from the perspective of interacting particle systems. It directly addresses the practical matter of how, for a given error threshold and computational budget, to choose the algorithm, its parameters, and its initial conditions such that one obtains an output at a desired accuracy. The methodologies developed as part of this project will be used for modeling cytoskeletal networks, a challenging bio-engineering problem, that will not only help shed light on cellular processes but could also be useful in developing programmable active matter devices. This project also incorporates multi-faceted education and outreach plans, including graduate and undergraduate student research supervisions, course development, and two workshops on data science and applied mathematics education which are focused on responsible use of data and AI as well as how to achieve high-quality data science and applied mathematics education in low-resource environments.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to build a unified theory for a large class of derivative-free optimization, sampling and filtering algorithms using discrete-to-continuum connections. Derivative-free approaches are particularly important in application settings using black-box procedures, or where gradients are too costly to obtain. Central to this project is the strategy to reformulate these optimization, sampling and filtering algorithms from the perspective of interacting particle systems, integrating them into a new, unified mathematical framework. This perspective provides ways for leveraging tools from partial differential equations for the analysis of the probabilities associated with the interacting particles driving these algorithms. The project is divided into three different, but interrelated, research directions: (1) consensus-based approaches for optimization and sampling, (2) ensemble Kalman methods for inverse problems and filtering, and (3) self-organization in cytoskeletal networks. These methodologies lie at the interface of model-driven and data-driven approaches. The proposed work sits at the intersection of the theory of partial differential equations, propagation of chaos, stochastic analysis, kinetic theory, optimization, data assimilation, mathematical modeling and bio-engineering with inherent methodology transfer between these fields and new contributions to all of them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, our mathematical understanding of these algorithms is still far beyond their practical development and widespread adoption. Put simply, in many cases we do not know how or why machine learning algorithms work so well, which in turn limits our ability to safely deploy them in safety critical engineering and scientific scenarios. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical formalism and understanding of problems at the intersection of machine learning and science (i.e., scientific machine learning) using rigorous mathematics, leading to novel algorithms and computational methodologies that are interpretable, supported by rigorous theory, and aware of uncertainties.<br/><br/>The project is focused on the development of novel Gaussian Process (GP) based computational frameworks for scientific machine learning that are provably well-posed, robust, and stable, thereby meeting the high standards of scientific computing. The developed methodologies will be capable of rigorous uncertainty quantification and inherit the desirable properties of machine learning algorithms such as flexibility, generalizability, and applicability in high-dimensions. The efforts of the project are directed in three primary directions: (1) GPs for solving nonlinear, high-dimensional and parametric PDEs; (2) GPs for operator learning, emulation, and physics discovery; and (3) GPs for high-dimensional sampling, inference, and generative modeling. Each research direction focuses on the development of algorithms, foundational theory, and concrete applications in engineering and science.

This is the 8th edition of an annual conference series co-organized by faculty from the University of Kansas (KU), the University of Missouri (MU), the University of Nebraska (NU) and, more recently, Iowa State University (ISU).  Nearly all physical phenomena are governed by fundamental laws and design principles that directly relate rates of change of the various quantities involved to one another. This powerful underlying concept leads naturally to differential equations, which are widely used as models in mathematical physics and have applications to a wide range of fields including Bose-Einstein condensates, fluid dynamics, pattern formation, gas dynamics, and fiber optical communications. This conference will bring together researchers from the broader geographic region around Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa to report new results and exchange ideas on differential equations and their applications. Building on the success of the prior seven conferences in this conference series, the conference will provide a venue for regional junior and senior researchers, as well as graduate students, to discuss recent advances and challenges in their respective fields. Additionally, early-career researchers will be given the opportunity to present their work and to gain insight into state-of-the-art results and associated techniques through interactions with senior experts in the field.<br/><br/>Complex nonlinear systems abound in science and engineering, and their behavior is often modeled by systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE). Any progress towards understanding the behavior of the solutions to PDE is of paramount importance for a variety of practical applications, including fluid flow, flame front propagation and fiber optical communications. Many PDE can be conveniently described as infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, allowing for the use of tools and methodologies from the theory of dynamical systems to make qualitative and quantitative predictions about the solutions of these systems. Objects like invariant manifolds have been a great aid in understanding the behavior of finite-dimensional dynamical systems, but identifying the connections between nonlinear PDE and dynamical systems is still a very active direction of current research. In the last few decades, collaborations between researchers in these fields, as well as with those working in their applications, have provided tremendous progress in our understanding of the dynamical behavior, stability, and robustness of coherent structures in such nonlinear PDE.  The themes of this conference include (i) fluid dynamics, water waves and dispersive PDE, (ii) existence, dynamics, and stability of nonlinear waves in dissipative systems, and (iii) completely integrable systems and their applications. These themes are well represented by the regional experts as well as the invited plenary speakers.

This project will develop algorithms to solve such problems in big data and engineering, which include uncertainty quantification in AI safety problems, control robotics motions, and image processing. The second part focuses on the stochastic models in mathematical finance and algorithm designs in option/asset pricing.

This project will provide support and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The stochastic systems in this project possess degenerate, mean-field, or non-Markovian properties. In the first part, the PI will study the ""hypocoercivity"" (i.e., convergence to equilibrium) for highly degenerate and mean-field stochastic dynamical systems and their applications to algorithms design in machine learning. One of the proposed topics will focus on the (non)-asymptotic analysis of the general degenerate/mean-field system and its exponential convergence rate to the equilibrium (e.g., Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations; Langevin dynamics on higher order nilpotent Lie groups).

The forces that determine the time-evolution of these systems are complex, making their analysis subtle and technical.  Two fundamental questions of interest are the qualitative behavior of these systems, e.g., whether solutions have large fluctuations, and their long-time behavior, e.g., by quantifying the speed with which an invasive species overruns a new environment.  These questions are interdependent, with the latter relying on an understanding of the former.  Our ability to understand the long-time behavior of PDE, including identifying the key quantities on which each long-time outcome depends, allows us to predict the behavior of real-world systems in a way that cannot be captured purely by numerical simulation, which, by necessity, is restricted to finite time scales.  This project will develop novel methods for these goals.  Graduate and undergraduate research will be integrated into the project, training the next generation of applied mathematicians and scientists. The project also involves a summer boot camp for entering applied mathematics PhD students transitioning from adjacent, but nonmathematical, fields that shore up their mathematical reasoning (logical thinking) and technical writing skills.  Their training is impactful because these students have diverse interests (mathematical biology, machine learning, data science, PDE and numerical analysis, etc.) and go on to careers in industry, academia, and national labs.<br/><br/>This project focuses on advances in reaction-diffusion equations and collisional kinetic equations.  In the former, the project will develop a novel ""Stein's method"" approach to PDE that is based on the observation that monotonic steady states of a given PDE satisfy first order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODE) and that, to show convergence of a generic solution of the PDE to such a steady state, it is enough to show that the generic solution converges to a solution of the ODE.  The research will leverage new functional inequalities and ideas in the calculus of variations.  In the latter, the project will import techniques from parabolic theory and stochastic analysis to characterize when blow-up occurs in generic domains (both with and without boundaries).  This requires the precise and quantitative understanding of the regularity of solutions near the boundary in physical space and the decay of solutions at ""large"" velocities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
