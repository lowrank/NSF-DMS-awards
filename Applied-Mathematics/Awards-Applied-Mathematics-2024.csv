This framework is ubiquitous across various scientific and technological disciplines, encompassing fields such as medical imaging, atmospheric remote sensing, geophysics, and non-destructive evaluation. In many practical scenarios, medium parameters exhibit anisotropy, meaning they depend not only on position but also on direction. Examples include conductivity in muscle tissue in human bodies, electromagnetic parameters in crystals, composite materials like fiber-reinforced polymers, and seismic wave propagation in the Earth. The project aims to develop novel mathematical methods for investigating inverse problems related to the recovery of anisotropic medium parameters from measurements taken at the exterior or boundary. A particular focus of the project is on determining parameters in models involving long-range interactions, prevalent in phenomena from anomalous diffusion to random processes with jumps, with broad applications spanning image processing, fluid dynamics, biophysics, network science, epidemiology, and finance. Additionally, the project places significant emphasis on providing educational training for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project leverages nonlocality, nonlinearity, and high frequencies as powerful tools to tackle significant and challenging inverse problems in anisotropic media. It is organized around four pivotal research topics. The first topic concerns inverse problems for elliptic partial differential operators at a large but fixed frequency. The goal is to solve important inverse problems for both linear and nonlinear elliptic operators at a large but fixed frequency in a geometric setting where the corresponding inverse problems at zero frequency are wide open and seem difficult to reach. The second topic focuses on inverse problems for nonlocal elliptic operators, with a particular emphasis on the fractional counterpart of the Calderon problem. The aim is to recover the coefficients of nonlocal operators based on measurements taken in exterior regions. The inherent nonlocality of these operators renders inverse problems more tractable than their local counterparts. The third topic deals with inverse problems for significant nonlinear hyperbolic and elliptic partial differential equations, encountered in physical models. The primary objective is to recover the leading terms that govern the underlying geometry. Finally, the fourth topic addresses inverse problems for both linear and nonlinear perturbations of biharmonic operators, with applications ranging from elasticity theory to conformal geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main mathematical difficulty in these problems lies in understanding the interplay between the dynamics of the fluid and the geometry of the interface. The aim of this project is to develop tools for the study of these problems and to deepen our knowledge of how these interfaces influence the dynamics of fluid models. This award will also provide opportunities for the involvement of undergraduate students in the research projects.  <br/><br/>This award will develop new mathematical tools to tackle problems involving free-surface fluid flows. The first project concerns the study of plasmas in the laboratory setting and is connected with the problem of ""magnetic confinement fusion"", which seeks to control a hot plasma by using powerful magnetic fields for the purposes of harnessing fusion reactions in the core. The mathematical challenge is to identify and construct magnetic fields which are effective at confining hot plasmas. The difficulty is that generic plasma configurations can possess a complicated mixture of invariant surfaces and chaotic regions. The second project concerns the long-time dynamics of self-gravitating fluids. One major obstruction to understanding the long-time behavior of these objects is the existence of a large and complicated family of periodic solutions. The PI will study the stability of these objects as the next step towards understanding the long-time behavior of liquids with free boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Well-known, and perhaps familiar, examples include the Stefan problem for melting and freezing of ice in water and the capillary problem describing the shapes of water droplets on a car window or a leaf.  In these problems it is very important to understand the effects of heterogenous media. Microscopic structure plays a major role in determining the macroscopic physics, for example whether a water droplet will ""stick"" to a surface (due to contact angle hysteresis) or roll off (low hysteresis and/or superhydrophobicity). In mathematical terms such interface problems lie at the intersection of several fields: partial differential equations (PDE), geometry, and probability / statistical physics. This project aims to advance the theory of phase interfaces in heterogeneous media by developing new techniques which make connections between these distinct mathematical fields.  The project will contribute to the development of STEM workforce and STEM education through training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>This project will study free boundary problems in heterogeneous media at micro and macro scales, especially as related to problems of capillarity and wetting.   The two main goals are: (1) to develop a theory of large-scale regularity for one- and two-phase free boundary problems and obstacle problems in periodic and random media, (2) to derive and study models for the rate independent evolution of capillary drops under the effects of contact angle hysteresis.  Quantitative results in homogenization and hydrodynamic limits enable more efficient computations which can be rigorously validated.  The large-scale regularization properties of elliptic and parabolic PDE in periodic and random media is central in the study of quantitative homogenization.  Much less is known in the context of phase interfaces or free boundaries.  This project will advance the quantitative homogenization theory of free boundaries and interfaces by studying several important model problems. In the theory of wetting on a rough surface, a rigorous mathematical formulation in terms of calculus of variations and homogenization theory can clarify the meaning of ambiguous physical models for computing effective contact angles. This project will enhance the understanding of these models both from a theoretical and computational perspective.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing effective methods for testing complex materials to detect structural defects or identify unknown targets efficiently and with minimal a priori information is highly desirable. This need is particularly pronounced for materials exhibiting directional properties, multi-periodicities with non-commensurable periods, nonlinear interactions with probing waves, or peculiar geometric structures, all prevalent in modern applications across the mentioned domains. This project involves the development of novel techniques in inverse scattering theory to address contemporary imaging challenges, aiming for reliable target signatures or useful information about examined objects in computationally efficient ways. The objective is to reduce reliance on a priori information describing the physics and geometry of targets, as well as on mathematical and computational complexities arising from complex background environments.  Graduate students will be trained and participate in this research. <br/><br/>This project will investigate a non-iterative approach for solving inverse scattering problems for both linear and nonlinear inhomogeneous media.   The generalized linear sampling method and interior eigenvalues form the unified mathematical framework for four interconnected projects. 1) Imaging of Inhomogeneous Media with Interior Eigenvalues: Motivated by the theory of transmission eigenvalues, the investigator and collaborators have developed a framework for modifying the scattering data, leading to new eigenvalue problems related to injectivity of the relative scattering operator. These eigenvalues are determined from scattering data and show versatile potential to image changes/faults in the media. The goal of this project is to address mathematical and computational questions in this framework to broaden the applicability of these techniques to anisotropic/absorbing/dispersive media, meta-surfaces, and clusters of defects. 2) Transmission Eigenvalues and Non-scattering Phenomena: A fundamental challenge in scattering theory is whether incoming time harmonic waves at a particular wave number are not scattered by a given inhomogeneity. The investigator will address mathematical questions on this topic involving non-selfadjoint spectral theory and free boundary regularity. These questions are important in applications since at a non-scattering wave number, the scattering operator is not injective. 3) Qualitative and Spectral Imaging Approach for Nonlinear Media: This project aims to establish mathematical foundations of inverse scattering for second-order harmonic generation in nonlinear optics as well as to develop the generalized linear sampling method and related spectral imaging for this model. This approach is promising for nonlinear models since it does not require solving the nonlinear partial differential equations. 4) Scattering by Almost-periodic Layers and Imaging of Local Defects: Periodicity plays an important role in the engineering of exotic materials in contemporary applications. Mathematically, almost periodic coefficients in the equations that govern wave propagation are viewed as traces along a hyperplane with an irrational normal of higher-dimensional periodic functions. This leads to a degenerate augmented principal differential operator in the model. Having understood the direct scattering problem, the investigator plans to extend the generalized linear sampling method to reconstruct local perturbation within an almost periodic layer without knowing a priori the almost periodic coefficients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first part of this project concerns changes in salinity or chlorofluorocarbon on the surface of the ocean. Oceanic vortices may dramatically change mixing rates of various chemical compounds. The aim of this project is to estimate these rates using simpler mathematical models to illuminate the mechanisms present in the full system. The second goal of this project is related to speeding up Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are a major approach in machine learning, statistical methods, and scientific computing.

The first project concentrates on the effect of long-range correlations. This represents a novel direction in the theory of propagation in random media, as approximate models of propagation in slowly decorrelating media have not yet been developed. The goal is to explain how long-range correlations lead to time-scale separation of various phenomena.

In many regimes of interest, fluids and plasmas exhibit extremely small scales; two key examples, which are relevant to this project, are the eddies which comprise a turbulent flow and the shock wave created by an aircraft as it breaks the sound barrier. This tendency toward small scales makes both theoretical and computational questions about fluids, plasmas, and the PDEs which model them highly challenging. In particular, traditional expectations about the predictive power of the standard PDEs can be violated in these regimes: In fluids, the most standard equations support significant non-uniqueness, while in gases and plasmas, they are not strictly valid inside a shock. This project will develop a mathematical theory to understand and overcome these challenges. This project will also provide opportunities for the integration of students into the research.<br/><br/>This project will carry out two programs in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs): (1) understanding non-uniqueness phenomena as an extreme form of instability in nonlinear PDEs, especially those arising in incompressible fluid mechanics, and (2) a rigorous PDE investigation of shock structure based on collisional kinetic theory. Regarding (1), the current non-uniqueness theory comes with caveats, e.g., the non-unique Navier-Stokes solutions are either forced or conjectural with supporting numerical evidence. The project will study problems of non-uniqueness and selection principle, without these caveats, in the Allen-Cahn and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Concerning (2), the project will investigate weak kinetic shock profiles for fundamental PDEs of plasma dynamics and advance the topological approach to constructing strong kinetic shock profiles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These immense systems can be analyzed on two scales: the microscopic scale, where first principles such as Newton's laws or the Schrödinger equation is employed to track the position and velocity of each individual particle, or the macroscopic scale, where statistical laws such as fluid mechanics and thermodynamics are utilized to predict the collective behavior of averaged properties like pressure and temperature. Kinetic theory serves as a bridge between these two approaches, utilizing probabilistic tools within the position-velocity space, also known as the phase space, to establish a mesoscopic description. The probability density of particles present in the phase space satisfies the Boltzmann-type or the Landau-type equations, which are evolutionary nonlinear partial differential equations. The broader impacts of the project consist of mentoring both graduate and undergraduate students, courses development, and running a summer school.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the asymptotic problems in kinetic equations, emphasizing the rigorous analysis to connect the aforementioned three scales of descriptions, and to quantitatively determine the scope of their applicability. The goal is to develop novel mathematical tools to characterize the multi-scale behaviors of these particle systems in applications such as medical imaging, gas dynamics, and nuclear fusion. Specifically, this project concentrates on the theory of hydrodynamic limits, a key step to tackle the so-called ""Hilbert's Sixth Problem"" to treat physics in an axiomatic manner. Novel techniques will be developed to study the asymptotic behavior of kinetic equations when the Knudsen number or Strouhal number, which measures the spatial or temporal scaling between particles collisions, shrinks to zero. The investigator will develop new nonlinear energy method, regularization, and remainder splitting techniques to tackle the non-classical boundary layer effects and the ?ghost? effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key feature of active matter is the presence of ""active agents"" that convert energy from the environment into mechanical motion, e.g., a bacterium ""eats"" and converts chemical energy into mechanical motion. The research on active matter addresses the complex behavior of both biological systems and bio-inspired manufactured materials. Two areas of active matter will be studied: active gels and suspensions of active swimmers in fluids. In the first area, the focus will be on active gels such as the cytoskeleton gel that drives the motion of a living cell. Understanding this motion is important because of its role in wound healing, immune response, and cancer metastasis. The key challenge of the proposed mathematical models is the presence of a moving deformable boundary (""free boundary"") of the domain where the equations of motion of the active gel are defined. The project will address fundamental mathematical questions concerning the stability of solutions to differential equations in domains with a free boundary. In the second area, the focus will be on the collective motion of bacteria in anisotropic biofluids. The aim here is to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the behavior of complex biological systems such as dense bacterial colonies. The proposed work in both areas will result in the development of novel mathematical techniques that can be applied to various problems in biophysics and materials science.

The goal of the proposed work is two-fold: to develop novel mathematical techniques for the analysis of active systems that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and to provide a better understanding of the biophysical phenomena in areas (A) and (B). In area (A), novel asymptotic techniques for spectral analysis of non-self-adjoint operators will be developed to rigorously prove bistability, i.e., the coexistence of two stable states of the cell: motile and sessile states. Due to the nonlinearity and non-self-adjointness of the free boundary problem that models cell motion, new techniques for both linear and nonlinear stability analysis will need to be developed. In area (B), the PI will develop novel stochastic homogenization techniques to obtain explicit asymptotic formulas for the effective rheological properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concerning a): Certain materials, often made up of rod-like or disc-like molecules, display a range of ""liquid crystalline phases"" at suitable temperature/concentration ranges; these phases lie between the traditional (disordered) liquid and (ordered) crystalline phase, and thus possess varying degrees of order. Liquid crystals and their suspensions have revolutionized the industry of ultra-thin display devices and are showing promise in a number of other applications such as drug delivery, active matter and the orientation of carbon nanotubes. Concerning b): The photonic devices studied in this project include certain novel kinds of resonators, waveguides, and antennas. Particular focus is on devices made from epsilon near zero materials: these are materials whose dielectric permittivity is close to zero at the frequency of device operation. These novel devices find applications in efforts to enhance light-matter interactions. Common to both scientific threads of the proposed research is that their mathematical modeling leads to unconventional questions in partial differential equations and the calculus of variations that require new analytical tools that this project will develop. The scientific broader impact of this research is that its findings are expected to shed valuable insights on specific models used in application areas. These insights are expected to explain the results of direct numerical simulation (DNS) when this is possible, and more importantly, provide qualitative and (sometimes) quantitative information when DNS becomes formidable or even prohibitive. The project will also include a significant component on human resource development: a number of the projects in this award will be carried out in collaboration with graduate students and postdocs at the University of Utah. The trainees will learn, use, and develop tools in the calculus of variations, partial differential equations, geometric measure theory and homogenization theory.<br/><br/>Concerning liquid crystals, at the heart of their role in the aforementioned applications are both their anisotropic properties leading to their ordered phases on the one hand, and the rich phase transitions they can undergo between phases displaying varying degrees of order. This project will elucidate these effects through mathematical modeling and analysis and explain how they robustly result in a description of the shapes of the phase boundaries between the ordered nematic and disordered isotropic phase. A different goal of the research thread on liquid crystals is the justification of the widely used ""electrostatic"" description of the many-particle interactions in out-of-equilibrium liquid crystal colloids. Such a description is invaluable, because without it the modeling of liquid crystal colloids consists of a highly nonconvex, nonlinear problem in a domain exterior to the colloidal particles (coupled with other multi-physics aspects of the specific application). Concerning photonic devices: The mathematical problems addressed will involve either the Maxwell system (in 3D) or the scalar Helmholtz equation (in 2D) but with piecewise constant, complex coefficients; often such systems interact in interesting ways with geometric features such as corners, producing resonance effects. This project is aimed at understanding these effects, and some novel shape optimization problems arising from these physical situations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditionally underrepresented groups in applied mathematics will be encouraged to apply. This support enables sustained opportunities to interact with leading researchers from around the world. Such interactions and contacts are invaluable to beginning researchers, both to inspire research, and for professional development, thereby helping to cultivate the very best young researchers.

The investigator aims to develop a general method to overcome high dimensionality of these PDEs via developing an iterative solver that combines the advantages of tensor-network, Monte Carlo, and convex optimization methods. The main idea is to solve for only a small number of descriptors of the solution (e.g., the statistical moments of the solution) and then recover a compressed representation of the solution through these descriptors. An improved solution procedure will contribute to the Material Genome Initiative by developing new computational tools for physical and chemical simulations. The proposed education plan aims to train graduate students for quantitative research at the intersection of mathematical and physical sciences, fostering a new generation of researchers well-equipped to tackle problems of national interest in scientific computing, machine learning, and quantum computing. Through research advising, a summer mentoring program, and the development of a summer school for quantum mechanics, the proposal aims to encourage the participation of underrepresented students in scientific research and higher education. <br/> <br/>Currently, Monte Carlo methods have been widely successful in many practical physical and chemical simulation tools due to their flexibility, despite potential drawbacks such as slow mixing time and high variance. An alternative approach to characterizing chemical/physical systems is to deterministically solve for the solution of a PDE over the entire space, which can work only for small (and consequently low-dimensional) problems. The proposed research attempts to address the limitations of sampling-based and PDE approaches through the development of an iterative solver. It involves fast iterations achieved by alternating between short-time Monte Carlo simulations and estimating a tensor-network ansatz. It relies on the initialization strategy underpinned by convex optimization in order to reduce the number of iterations. Monte Carlo variance of traditional sampling methods is significantly reduced since only a small number of tensor-network parameters need to be estimated. On the other hand, it significantly extends the flexibility of tensor-network methods by allowing stochastic operations. To this end, a novel tensor-network-based generative model is proposed where density can be learned from empirical samples without the use of any optimization. It would impact statistics by providing new density estimators and analysis without the curse of dimensionality. Further, a new moment method based on convex optimization is proposed for solving high-dimensional PDEs. This would develop mathematical programming, a tool traditionally used in operations research, into an effective tool for physics simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Novel frameworks developed in this research are designed to have flexible model assumptions, be able to learn from incomplete information, and accommodate heterogeneous risk preferences as well as information asymmetry. This research will involve both undergraduate and graduate students, emphasizing cross-disciplinary training in mathematics and machine learning. Additionally, an outreach program will be established to engage underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>This project places at its core the mathematical advancement of machine learning theory for stochastic systems with many interacting agents, known as ?mean-field games?. The first goal is to develop new mathematical models and learning algorithms for mean-field games under structural properties such as graphon interactions or additional summary statistics of the population distribution. This development relies on new approximation schemes and stability analyses based on the local propagation of flows. The second goal focuses on principal-agent problems, where agents have diverse risk preferences or the capability to acquire new information. These topics pose significant challenges  in a dynamic setting, leading to a novel class of stochastic partial differential equations that require new developments for well-definedness and regularity theory. The final goal focuses on constructing generative models (simulators) with interactive mean-field agents, addressing the scalability issue in agent-based simulator literature. To leverage the computational power of neural networks, a key objective is to establish a universal approximation theorem in the distributional sense and the convergence of an iterative deep-learning scheme to train the simulator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main subject of the conference is theoretical quantum information science, underpinning future technologies that rely on quantum computers and devices. The conference brings together scientists from both classical and quantum information science with the aim of communicating exciting research trends to the quantum workforce and igniting compelling new research directions. Following the tradition of previous installments, this conference consists of a careful balance of cutting-edge, high-impact research talks and time slots for academic discussions and collaborations. This format has been highly successful as it produced a substantive body of work acknowledging progress achieved during previous Beyond IID conferences. A particular focus of the conference is on support, active engagement, and career development of junior researchers (i.e. graduate students and postdocs) from all backgrounds. Several events aimed at these participants have been planned, including a career panel and poster session helping to train the next generation of quantum scientists and connect them with the larger research community. In addition, having the event at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign highlights the robust and dynamic quantum ecosystem within the state of Illinois, including the on-campus Illinois Quantum Information and Science Center (IQUIST), the Chicago Quantum Exchange (CQE), and others. Notably, the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area was recently chosen as a quantum Regional Technology and Innovation Hub by the US Economic Development Administration. Finally, Beyond IID is the only conference of its size and focus in North America in 2024, providing a unique opportunity for many researchers on this continent to learn about the current results in this field.<br/><br/>The scientific content of the Beyond IID conference series covers the information-theoretic and mathematical aspects of quantum information science, and its connections to classical information theory and mathematical physics. Core topics discussed in previous Beyond IID conferences include one-shot and finite-blocklength information theory, quantum Shannon theory, cryptography, generalized resource theories, entropy inequalities and matrix analysis. The conference aims to provide a venue for classical and quantum information theorists to report recent progress, identify open problems, and advance current research in quantum information. The latter two objectives are facilitated by an open problems session, an integral part of the conference that continues to drive research in the above areas.  Each day will start with an hour-long invited talk giving a broad overview of selected topics by prominent researchers. This year, two of the invited talks are dedicated to the memory of Christopher King and Mary Beth Ruskai, whose work had an immense impact on quantum information theory.  The invited talks are followed by contributed talks on exceptional recent results rigorously selected by a program committee.

Understanding stability of black holes has been central to the mathematical endeavor of confirming their relevance as realistic physical objects. If stable, black holes perturbed with gravitational or other form of radiation, after a temporary change, would eventually return to their initial state. The investigator aims to advance the current knowledge of perturbations dynamics by including interaction of electromagnetic radiation with gravitational waves. This interaction is significant as astrophysical black holes are thought to be surrounded by an accretion disk of matter which, in particular, contains electromagnetic waves. The results of this work are shared with the mathematical and physical communities through peer-reviewed publications and seminars and disseminated to the general public through media articles, public lectures and outreach events in schools. The research of the investigator is integrated with educational activities that increase representation of women in mathematics and promote engagement in mathematics among students. Graduate students and postdocs are also to be involved in this research.<br/> <br/>The project is focused on building a comprehensive approach to analyze interactions between gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation on rotating and charged black holes. The investigator incorporates new techniques to obtain precise decay for the gravitational and electromagnetic waves on charged black holes by developing a universal method involving a combined energy-momentum tensor for coupled system of wave equations. The goal of the project is to prove the non-linear stability of the most general charged and rotating black hole family and extend the investigator?s collaborative work on the resolution for the Kerr family. In addition, the investigator aims to obtain conservation laws for charged black holes in connection with their canonical energy while allowing control of the gravitational and electromagnetic energy radiated at infinity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is aimed at developing a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the role of neural network models used for numerical analysis and scientific computing, particularly when compared with more classic tools. This is essential in enabling neural network models to be widely deployed in sensitive fields across engineering domains. Graduate students will be trained as part of this project, modern tools from data science and deep learning will be incorporated into graduate curricula, and outreach activities are planned to attract undergraduates as well as underrepresented groups in STEM into this research area.<br/><br/>The focus of this work is on the use of neural network models in numerical algorithms used in models based on the calculus of variations, targeting two case studies. The first is related to functionals that exhibit the Lavrentiev gap phenomena, where an energy gap between the lowest energy achievable by shallow neural networks and more general functions is considered. The second is the Allen-Cahn equation, where the solution strategy of physics-inspired neural networks is analyzed. In the second problem, the adaptivity of neural networks to low-dimensional moving interfaces plays a key role when comparing to e.g. fixed mesh finite element methods. The theoretical results are intended to better understand two fundamental challenges. The first is whether the adaptivity of neural networks can be harnessed for the numerical approximation of spatially very inhomogeneous variational problems.

These systems have found applications in diverse fields, including ecology, engineering, and social sciences, yet their high-dimensional nature makes them challenging to study. This often leads to significant theoretical and computational difficulties, known as the ?curse of dimensionality.? Recent advances in applied mathematics have shed light on these complexities, revealing that complex NetID patterns can arise from low dimensional interactions. Building on these insights, this project is dedicated to developing a theoretical and computational framework to address the estimation problems within these models by exploiting the underlying low dimensional structures. The overarching goal is to create efficient, physically interpretable surrogate models that bridge the gap between qualitative analysis and quantitative data-driven applications, ranging from sensor network optimization to modeling the environmental and climate impacts on fish migration. This research program will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, featuring a graduate summer school at the intersection of NetIDs and machine learning. There will be a particular focus on engaging female and underrepresented minority students in this vibrant field, blending machine learning with differential equations. The project's findings will also enrich mathematical data science course materials for both undergraduate and graduate education.<br/><br/>This project aims to make fundamental mathematical, statistical, and computational advances for solving NetIDs' estimation problems. The research will focus on three primary areas: (1) Developing innovative sampling strategies for optimal data recovery in NetIDs with linear interactions by exploiting their inherent low-dimensionality in terms of sparsity, smoothness, low-rankness. (2) Establishing robust statistical estimation of NetIDs with nonlinear time-varying interactions by combining machine learning, numerical analysis, and functional data analysis to create physically consistent estimators that bypass the ?curse of dimensionality,? while exploring the identifiability and convergence as sample sizes increase.

This project will contribute to the design and analysis of implementable and computationally efficient algorithms for optimization, sampling and filtering from the perspective of interacting particle systems. It directly addresses the practical matter of how, for a given error threshold and computational budget, to choose the algorithm, its parameters, and its initial conditions such that one obtains an output at a desired accuracy. The methodologies developed as part of this project will be used for modeling cytoskeletal networks, a challenging bio-engineering problem, that will not only help shed light on cellular processes but could also be useful in developing programmable active matter devices. This project also incorporates multi-faceted education and outreach plans, including graduate and undergraduate student research supervisions, course development, and two workshops on data science and applied mathematics education which are focused on responsible use of data and AI as well as how to achieve high-quality data science and applied mathematics education in low-resource environments.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to build a unified theory for a large class of derivative-free optimization, sampling and filtering algorithms using discrete-to-continuum connections. Derivative-free approaches are particularly important in application settings using black-box procedures, or where gradients are too costly to obtain. Central to this project is the strategy to reformulate these optimization, sampling and filtering algorithms from the perspective of interacting particle systems, integrating them into a new, unified mathematical framework. This perspective provides ways for leveraging tools from partial differential equations for the analysis of the probabilities associated with the interacting particles driving these algorithms. The project is divided into three different, but interrelated, research directions: (1) consensus-based approaches for optimization and sampling, (2) ensemble Kalman methods for inverse problems and filtering, and (3) self-organization in cytoskeletal networks. These methodologies lie at the interface of model-driven and data-driven approaches. The proposed work sits at the intersection of the theory of partial differential equations, propagation of chaos, stochastic analysis, kinetic theory, optimization, data assimilation, mathematical modeling and bio-engineering with inherent methodology transfer between these fields and new contributions to all of them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Put simply, in many cases we do not know how or why machine learning algorithms work so well, which in turn limits our ability to safely deploy them in safety critical engineering and scientific scenarios.

This is the 8th edition of an annual conference series co-organized by faculty from the University of Kansas (KU), the University of Missouri (MU), the University of Nebraska (NU) and, more recently, Iowa State University (ISU).  Nearly all physical phenomena are governed by fundamental laws and design principles that directly relate rates of change of the various quantities involved to one another. This powerful underlying concept leads naturally to differential equations, which are widely used as models in mathematical physics and have applications to a wide range of fields including Bose-Einstein condensates, fluid dynamics, pattern formation, gas dynamics, and fiber optical communications. This conference will bring together researchers from the broader geographic region around Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa to report new results and exchange ideas on differential equations and their applications. Building on the success of the prior seven conferences in this conference series, the conference will provide a venue for regional junior and senior researchers, as well as graduate students, to discuss recent advances and challenges in their respective fields. Additionally, early-career researchers will be given the opportunity to present their work and to gain insight into state-of-the-art results and associated techniques through interactions with senior experts in the field.<br/><br/>Complex nonlinear systems abound in science and engineering, and their behavior is often modeled by systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE). Any progress towards understanding the behavior of the solutions to PDE is of paramount importance for a variety of practical applications, including fluid flow, flame front propagation and fiber optical communications. Many PDE can be conveniently described as infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, allowing for the use of tools and methodologies from the theory of dynamical systems to make qualitative and quantitative predictions about the solutions of these systems. Objects like invariant manifolds have been a great aid in understanding the behavior of finite-dimensional dynamical systems, but identifying the connections between nonlinear PDE and dynamical systems is still a very active direction of current research. In the last few decades, collaborations between researchers in these fields, as well as with those working in their applications, have provided tremendous progress in our understanding of the dynamical behavior, stability, and robustness of coherent structures in such nonlinear PDE.  The themes of this conference include (i) fluid dynamics, water waves and dispersive PDE, (ii) existence, dynamics, and stability of nonlinear waves in dissipative systems, and (iii) completely integrable systems and their applications. These themes are well represented by the regional experts as well as the invited plenary speakers.

The forces that determine the time-evolution of these systems are complex, making their analysis subtle and technical.  Two fundamental questions of interest are the qualitative behavior of these systems, e.g., whether solutions have large fluctuations, and their long-time behavior, e.g., by quantifying the speed with which an invasive species overruns a new environment.  These questions are interdependent, with the latter relying on an understanding of the former.  Our ability to understand the long-time behavior of PDE, including identifying the key quantities on which each long-time outcome depends, allows us to predict the behavior of real-world systems in a way that cannot be captured purely by numerical simulation, which, by necessity, is restricted to finite time scales.  This project will develop novel methods for these goals.  Graduate and undergraduate research will be integrated into the project, training the next generation of applied mathematicians and scientists. The project also involves a summer boot camp for entering applied mathematics PhD students transitioning from adjacent, but nonmathematical, fields that shore up their mathematical reasoning (logical thinking) and technical writing skills.  Their training is impactful because these students have diverse interests (mathematical biology, machine learning, data science, PDE and numerical analysis, etc.) and go on to careers in industry, academia, and national labs.<br/><br/>This project focuses on advances in reaction-diffusion equations and collisional kinetic equations.  In the former, the project will develop a novel ""Stein's method"" approach to PDE that is based on the observation that monotonic steady states of a given PDE satisfy first order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODE) and that, to show convergence of a generic solution of the PDE to such a steady state, it is enough to show that the generic solution converges to a solution of the ODE.  The research will leverage new functional inequalities and ideas in the calculus of variations.  In the latter, the project will import techniques from parabolic theory and stochastic analysis to characterize when blow-up occurs in generic domains (both with and without boundaries).  This requires the precise and quantitative understanding of the regularity of solutions near the boundary in physical space and the decay of solutions at ""large"" velocities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This meeting will be the second event in a sequence of annual JAF DE-DS conferences alternating between Auburn, UAB, FIU and FSU campuses that was inaugurated on May 13, 2023, at Auburn University.  This conference will bring together a diverse group of researchers in the geographic area near the States of Alabama and Florida which encompasses numerous universities. The conference will allow experts specializing in nonlinear partial differential equations and applied dynamical systems to exchange ideas, forge new collaborations, and disseminate their recent results. The award funds will help cover travel and local expenses of the participants with no current Federal support. Priority for financial support will be given to graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early career researchers, and scientists from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>Thematically, the conference will cover a wide spectrum of topics in the general area of applied mathematics with a focus on partial differential equations, integrable Hamiltonian dynamical systems and applications in the physical and biological sciences. In the past few decades, novel ideas and methods were developed to tackle complex problems related to existence, stability, and computation of solutions to various model equations arising in fluid mechanics, photonics, Bose-Einstein condensation, and biological systems. Motivated by this progress, the scientific program of the conference will revolve around similar topics including inverse scattering and integrable systems, existence, and long-time asymptotics of nonlinear waves and coherent structures for the nonlinear Schrödinger, Navier-Stokes, and reaction diffusion equations. Making progress in this direction will improve our theoretical knowledge and provide new insights into future research problems related to linear and nonlinear wave propagation in random and complex media.<br/><br/> More information can be found on the conference website: <br/>https://www.math.fsu.edu/~musliman/Second_Alabama_Florida_Conference/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
