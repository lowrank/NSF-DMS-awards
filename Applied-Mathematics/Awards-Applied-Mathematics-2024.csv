The goal of this project is to create a broad program for both research and pedagogical activities centered around the study of singularities in fluids. The award will provide research opportunities and training for postdoctoral scholars and will  leverage its research elements to design projects suitable for undergraduate students. The project will also aim at producing a foundational graduate textbook on shock waves in compressible fluids.<br/><br/>The research component is split into three projects: formation and development of shock waves, radial implosions from smooth initial data, and self-similar blow-up via neural networks. Building on previous work of the PI and his collaborators, the aim of the first project will be to provide the first full description of shock wave formation and development for the multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations. The second project involves further developing prior work on self-similar imploding solutions for isentropic compressible flows to investigate the possibility of new types of singularities. The third project involves utilizing physically informed neural networks to search for new forms of singularities in fluid, whose existence will be made rigorous through the aid of computer assisted proofs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concept of emergence will be explored in the context of dynamic and stochastic, multiscale dispersive wave phenomena described by nonlinear partial differential equations.  This program will host approximately 35 long-term, residential visitors at any given time and 60 or more participants in a one-week workshop. The diverse, international roster of participants includes leading researchers in the applied mathematical sciences. This National Science Foundation award provides travel support for early career applied mathematicians from the United States to participate in the workshop and the program. Traditionally underrepresented groups in applied mathematics will be encouraged to apply. This support enables sustained opportunities to interact with leading researchers from around the world. Such interactions and contacts are invaluable to beginning researchers, both to inspire research, and for professional development, thereby helping to cultivate the very best young researchers. These researchers will be the next generation of applied mathematicians who advance this and other applied mathematical fields of research.<br/><br/>Emergence is a powerful concept that plays a fundamental role in many areas of theoretical and mathematical physics. In a system composed of a very large number of elementary constituents, e.g. classical or quantum particles, the observable macroscopic behavior can be highly nontrivial. This transition from short-to-large scales is at the heart of hydrodynamic theories for inhomogeneous, dynamic many-body states. A very different kind of hydrodynamics arises when the microscopic constituents are waves. The subject of dispersive hydrodynamics?the theory of multiscale phenomena in nonlinear dispersive waves?has attracted much attention recently and was the focus of the 2022 ""Dispersive Hydrodynamics"" (HYD2) program held at the Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK. The satellite PDW program aims to capitalize on the successful HYD2 program to explore new frontiers of dispersive hydrodynamics in relation to the overarching theme of emergent phenomena in nonlinear waves. In particular, PDW will focus on three highly synergistic themes: (i) emergent hydrodynamics in integrable and nonintegrable systems; (ii) stability of nonlinear dispersive waves and emergent phenomena in unstable wave systems; (iii) soliton gas, generalized hydrodynamics and statistical mechanics of integrable systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator aims to develop a general method to overcome high dimensionality of these PDEs via developing an iterative solver that combines the advantages of tensor-network, Monte Carlo, and convex optimization methods. The main idea is to solve for only a small number of descriptors of the solution (e.g., the statistical moments of the solution) and then recover a compressed representation of the solution through these descriptors. An improved solution procedure will contribute to the Material Genome Initiative by developing new computational tools for physical and chemical simulations. The proposed education plan aims to train graduate students for quantitative research at the intersection of mathematical and physical sciences, fostering a new generation of researchers well-equipped to tackle problems of national interest in scientific computing, machine learning, and quantum computing. Through research advising, a summer mentoring program, and the development of a summer school for quantum mechanics, the proposal aims to encourage the participation of underrepresented students in scientific research and higher education. <br/> <br/>Currently, Monte Carlo methods have been widely successful in many practical physical and chemical simulation tools due to their flexibility, despite potential drawbacks such as slow mixing time and high variance. An alternative approach to characterizing chemical/physical systems is to deterministically solve for the solution of a PDE over the entire space, which can work only for small (and consequently low-dimensional) problems. The proposed research attempts to address the limitations of sampling-based and PDE approaches through the development of an iterative solver. It involves fast iterations achieved by alternating between short-time Monte Carlo simulations and estimating a tensor-network ansatz. It relies on the initialization strategy underpinned by convex optimization in order to reduce the number of iterations. Monte Carlo variance of traditional sampling methods is significantly reduced since only a small number of tensor-network parameters need to be estimated. On the other hand, it significantly extends the flexibility of tensor-network methods by allowing stochastic operations. To this end, a novel tensor-network-based generative model is proposed where density can be learned from empirical samples without the use of any optimization. It would impact statistics by providing new density estimators and analysis without the curse of dimensionality. Further, a new moment method based on convex optimization is proposed for solving high-dimensional PDEs. This would develop mathematical programming, a tool traditionally used in operations research, into an effective tool for physics simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Novel frameworks developed in this research are designed to have flexible model assumptions, be able to learn from incomplete information, and accommodate heterogeneous risk preferences as well as information asymmetry.

The first goal is to develop new mathematical models and learning algorithms for mean-field games under structural properties such as graphon interactions or additional summary statistics of the population distribution. This development relies on new approximation schemes and stability analyses based on the local propagation of flows. The second goal focuses on principal-agent problems, where agents have diverse risk preferences or the capability to acquire new information. These topics pose significant challenges  in a dynamic setting, leading to a novel class of stochastic partial differential equations that require new developments for well-definedness and regularity theory. The final goal focuses on constructing generative models (simulators) with interactive mean-field agents, addressing the scalability issue in agent-based simulator literature. To leverage the computational power of neural networks, a key objective is to establish a universal approximation theorem in the distributional sense and the convergence of an iterative deep-learning scheme to train the simulator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main subject of the conference is theoretical quantum information science, underpinning future technologies that rely on quantum computers and devices. The conference brings together scientists from both classical and quantum information science with the aim of communicating exciting research trends to the quantum workforce and igniting compelling new research directions. Following the tradition of previous installments, this conference consists of a careful balance of cutting-edge, high-impact research talks and time slots for academic discussions and collaborations. This format has been highly successful as it produced a substantive body of work acknowledging progress achieved during previous Beyond IID conferences. A particular focus of the conference is on support, active engagement, and career development of junior researchers (i.e. graduate students and postdocs) from all backgrounds. Several events aimed at these participants have been planned, including a career panel and poster session helping to train the next generation of quantum scientists and connect them with the larger research community. In addition, having the event at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign highlights the robust and dynamic quantum ecosystem within the state of Illinois, including the on-campus Illinois Quantum Information and Science Center (IQUIST), the Chicago Quantum Exchange (CQE), and others. Notably, the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area was recently chosen as a quantum Regional Technology and Innovation Hub by the US Economic Development Administration. Finally, Beyond IID is the only conference of its size and focus in North America in 2024, providing a unique opportunity for many researchers on this continent to learn about the current results in this field.<br/><br/>The scientific content of the Beyond IID conference series covers the information-theoretic and mathematical aspects of quantum information science, and its connections to classical information theory and mathematical physics. Core topics discussed in previous Beyond IID conferences include one-shot and finite-blocklength information theory, quantum Shannon theory, cryptography, generalized resource theories, entropy inequalities and matrix analysis. The conference aims to provide a venue for classical and quantum information theorists to report recent progress, identify open problems, and advance current research in quantum information. The latter two objectives are facilitated by an open problems session, an integral part of the conference that continues to drive research in the above areas.  Each day will start with an hour-long invited talk giving a broad overview of selected topics by prominent researchers. This year, two of the invited talks are dedicated to the memory of Christopher King and Mary Beth Ruskai, whose work had an immense impact on quantum information theory.

Understanding stability of black holes has been central to the mathematical endeavor of confirming their relevance as realistic physical objects. If stable, black holes perturbed with gravitational or other form of radiation, after a temporary change, would eventually return to their initial state. The investigator aims to advance the current knowledge of perturbations dynamics by including interaction of electromagnetic radiation with gravitational waves. This interaction is significant as astrophysical black holes are thought to be surrounded by an accretion disk of matter which, in particular, contains electromagnetic waves. The results of this work are shared with the mathematical and physical communities through peer-reviewed publications and seminars and disseminated to the general public through media articles, public lectures and outreach events in schools. The research of the investigator is integrated with educational activities that increase representation of women in mathematics and promote engagement in mathematics among students. Graduate students and postdocs are also to be involved in this research.<br/> <br/>The project is focused on building a comprehensive approach to analyze interactions between gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation on rotating and charged black holes. The investigator incorporates new techniques to obtain precise decay for the gravitational and electromagnetic waves on charged black holes by developing a universal method involving a combined energy-momentum tensor for coupled system of wave equations. The goal of the project is to prove the non-linear stability of the most general charged and rotating black hole family and extend the investigator?s collaborative work on the resolution for the Kerr family. In addition, the investigator aims to obtain conservation laws for charged black holes in connection with their canonical energy while allowing control of the gravitational and electromagnetic energy radiated at infinity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is essential in enabling neural network models to be widely deployed in sensitive fields across engineering domains. Graduate students will be trained as part of this project, modern tools from data science and deep learning will be incorporated into graduate curricula, and outreach activities are planned to attract undergraduates as well as underrepresented groups in STEM into this research area.<br/><br/>The focus of this work is on the use of neural network models in numerical algorithms used in models based on the calculus of variations, targeting two case studies. The first is related to functionals that exhibit the Lavrentiev gap phenomena, where an energy gap between the lowest energy achievable by shallow neural networks and more general functions is considered. The second is the Allen-Cahn equation, where the solution strategy of physics-inspired neural networks is analyzed. In the second problem, the adaptivity of neural networks to low-dimensional moving interfaces plays a key role when comparing to e.g. fixed mesh finite element methods. The theoretical results are intended to better understand two fundamental challenges. The first is whether the adaptivity of neural networks can be harnessed for the numerical approximation of spatially very inhomogeneous variational problems.

These systems have found applications in diverse fields, including ecology, engineering, and social sciences, yet their high-dimensional nature makes them challenging to study. This often leads to significant theoretical and computational difficulties, known as the ?curse of dimensionality.? Recent advances in applied mathematics have shed light on these complexities, revealing that complex NetID patterns can arise from low dimensional interactions. Building on these insights, this project is dedicated to developing a theoretical and computational framework to address the estimation problems within these models by exploiting the underlying low dimensional structures. The overarching goal is to create efficient, physically interpretable surrogate models that bridge the gap between qualitative analysis and quantitative data-driven applications, ranging from sensor network optimization to modeling the environmental and climate impacts on fish migration. This research program will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, featuring a graduate summer school at the intersection of NetIDs and machine learning.

The research will focus on three primary areas: (1) Developing innovative sampling strategies for optimal data recovery in NetIDs with linear interactions by exploiting their inherent low-dimensionality in terms of sparsity, smoothness, low-rankness. (2) Establishing robust statistical estimation of NetIDs with nonlinear time-varying interactions by combining machine learning, numerical analysis, and functional data analysis to create physically consistent estimators that bypass the ?curse of dimensionality,? while exploring the identifiability and convergence as sample sizes increase. (3) Investigating the statistical predictive properties of Graph Neural Differential Equations, aiming to derive upper bounds for their transferability and generalization error.

It directly addresses the practical matter of how, for a given error threshold and computational budget, to choose the algorithm, its parameters, and its initial conditions such that one obtains an output at a desired accuracy. The methodologies developed as part of this project will be used for modeling cytoskeletal networks, a challenging bio-engineering problem, that will not only help shed light on cellular processes but could also be useful in developing programmable active matter devices. This project also incorporates multi-faceted education and outreach plans, including graduate and undergraduate student research supervisions, course development, and two workshops on data science and applied mathematics education which are focused on responsible use of data and AI as well as how to achieve high-quality data science and applied mathematics education in low-resource environments.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to build a unified theory for a large class of derivative-free optimization, sampling and filtering algorithms using discrete-to-continuum connections. Derivative-free approaches are particularly important in application settings using black-box procedures, or where gradients are too costly to obtain. Central to this project is the strategy to reformulate these optimization, sampling and filtering algorithms from the perspective of interacting particle systems, integrating them into a new, unified mathematical framework. This perspective provides ways for leveraging tools from partial differential equations for the analysis of the probabilities associated with the interacting particles driving these algorithms. The project is divided into three different, but interrelated, research directions: (1) consensus-based approaches for optimization and sampling, (2) ensemble Kalman methods for inverse problems and filtering, and (3) self-organization in cytoskeletal networks. These methodologies lie at the interface of model-driven and data-driven approaches.

This is the 8th edition of an annual conference series co-organized by faculty from the University of Kansas (KU), the University of Missouri (MU), the University of Nebraska (NU) and, more recently, Iowa State University (ISU).  Nearly all physical phenomena are governed by fundamental laws and design principles that directly relate rates of change of the various quantities involved to one another. This powerful underlying concept leads naturally to differential equations, which are widely used as models in mathematical physics and have applications to a wide range of fields including Bose-Einstein condensates, fluid dynamics, pattern formation, gas dynamics, and fiber optical communications.

Building on the success of the prior seven conferences in this conference series, the conference will provide a venue for regional junior and senior researchers, as well as graduate students, to discuss recent advances and challenges in their respective fields. Additionally, early-career researchers will be given the opportunity to present their work and to gain insight into state-of-the-art results and associated techniques through interactions with senior experts in the field.<br/><br/>Complex nonlinear systems abound in science and engineering, and their behavior is often modeled by systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE). Any progress towards understanding the behavior of the solutions to PDE is of paramount importance for a variety of practical applications, including fluid flow, flame front propagation and fiber optical communications. Many PDE can be conveniently described as infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, allowing for the use of tools and methodologies from the theory of dynamical systems to make qualitative and quantitative predictions about the solutions of these systems. Objects like invariant manifolds have been a great aid in understanding the behavior of finite-dimensional dynamical systems, but identifying the connections between nonlinear PDE and dynamical systems is still a very active direction of current research. In the last few decades, collaborations between researchers in these fields, as well as with those working in their applications, have provided tremendous progress in our understanding of the dynamical behavior, stability, and robustness of coherent structures in such nonlinear PDE.  The themes of this conference include (i) fluid dynamics, water waves and dispersive PDE, (ii) existence, dynamics, and stability of nonlinear waves in dissipative systems, and (iii) completely integrable systems and their applications.

This theory is focused on the fundamental concept that when in a given physical system a large number of interacting waves are present, the description of an individual wave is neither possible nor relevant.  What becomes important and practical is the description of the density and the statistics of the interacting waves. Arguably the most recognizable and fundamental objects within this theory are the wave kinetic equations. These equations, their solutions and their approximations have been used to study a variety of phenomena:  water surface gravity and capillary waves,  inertial waves due to rotation and internal waves on density stratifications, which are important in the study of planetary atmospheres and oceans; Alfvén wave turbulence in solar wind; planetary Rossby waves, which are important for the study of weather and climate evolutions; waves in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and in nonlinear optics; waves in plasmas of fusion devices; and many others.

This is certainly the case when one studies wave turbulence theory. This theory is focused on the fundamental concept that when in a given physical system a large number of interacting waves are present, the description of an individual wave is neither possible nor relevant.  What becomes important and practical is the description of the density and the statistics of the interacting waves. Arguably the most recognizable and fundamental objects within this theory are the wave kinetic equations. These equations, their solutions and their approximations have been used to study a variety of phenomena:  water surface gravity and capillary waves,  inertial waves due to rotation and internal waves on density stratifications, which are important in the study of planetary atmospheres and oceans; Alfvén wave turbulence in solar wind; planetary Rossby waves, which are important for the study of weather and climate evolutions; waves in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and in nonlinear optics; waves in plasmas of fusion devices; and many others. This project will tackle foundational questions in wave turbulence theory through rigorous mathematical analysis. In addition, the project will promote collaborations, facilitate the dissemination of interdisciplinary research, and provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to work on a multifaceted and forward-looking line of mathematical research.<br/><br/>This project tackles challenging problems at the intersection of the physics and the mathematical analysis of nonlinear interactions of waves that are central in the study of wave turbulence theory. These problems include the rigorous derivation of wave kinetic equations, the analysis of the 4-wave kinetic equation for the Fermi- Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) chain and the well-posedness of a geometric wave equation via Feynman diagrams in the energy regime. The research proposed will not just address important open problems but will contribute to the interdisciplinary development of several new and complex tools both in mathematics and physics.

The first part focuses on the foundations of machine learning/data science, which guarantees the theoretical convergence of numerical algorithms (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, Markov Chain Monte Carlo) in non-convex optimization and multi-modal distribution sampling. This project will develop algorithms to solve such problems in big data and engineering, which include uncertainty quantification in AI safety problems, control robotics motions, and image processing. The second part focuses on the stochastic models in mathematical finance and algorithm designs in option/asset pricing. The applications in this part target efficient algorithms for path-dependent option pricing with rough volatilities, which are expected to significantly impact some computation-oriented financial instruments, such as model-based algorithm trading involving rough volatility and high-frequency data. This project will provide support and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The stochastic systems in this project possess degenerate, mean-field, or non-Markovian properties. In the first part, the PI will study the ""hypocoercivity"" (i.e., convergence to equilibrium) for highly degenerate and mean-field stochastic dynamical systems and their applications to algorithms design in machine learning. One of the proposed topics will focus on the (non)-asymptotic analysis of the general degenerate/mean-field system and its exponential convergence rate to the equilibrium (e.g., Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations; Langevin dynamics on higher order nilpotent Lie groups). As applications of the convergence of such dynamics, the PI will design algorithms focusing on non-convex optimizations and distribution samplings in machine learning. In the second part, the PI will study non-Markovian stochastic dynamical systems capturing path-dependent and mean-field features of the financial market. The topics include path-dependent PDEs, stochastic Volterra integral equations, conditional mean-field SDEs, and the Volterra signatures. The PI focuses on addressing the fundamental issues, including the density for the rough volatility model and conditional mean-field SDEs and the structure of Volterra signatures. Furthermore, the PI focuses on designing efficient numerical algorithms using the Volterra signature and deep neural networks. These algorithms target solving path-dependent PDEs, path-dependent option pricing, and optimal stopping/switching problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The forces that determine the time-evolution of these systems are complex, making their analysis subtle and technical.  Two fundamental questions of interest are the qualitative behavior of these systems, e.g., whether solutions have large fluctuations, and their long-time behavior, e.g., by quantifying the speed with which an invasive species overruns a new environment.  These questions are interdependent, with the latter relying on an understanding of the former.  Our ability to understand the long-time behavior of PDE, including identifying the key quantities on which each long-time outcome depends, allows us to predict the behavior of real-world systems in a way that cannot be captured purely by numerical simulation, which, by necessity, is restricted to finite time scales.  This project will develop novel methods for these goals.  Graduate and undergraduate research will be integrated into the project, training the next generation of applied mathematicians and scientists. The project also involves a summer boot camp for entering applied mathematics PhD students transitioning from adjacent, but nonmathematical, fields that shore up their mathematical reasoning (logical thinking) and technical writing skills.  Their training is impactful because these students have diverse interests (mathematical biology, machine learning, data science, PDE and numerical analysis, etc.) and go on to careers in industry, academia, and national labs.<br/><br/>This project focuses on advances in reaction-diffusion equations and collisional kinetic equations.  In the former, the project will develop a novel ""Stein's method"" approach to PDE that is based on the observation that monotonic steady states of a given PDE satisfy first order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODE) and that, to show convergence of a generic solution of the PDE to such a steady state, it is enough to show that the generic solution converges to a solution of the ODE.  The research will leverage new functional inequalities and ideas in the calculus of variations.  In the latter, the project will import techniques from parabolic theory and stochastic analysis to characterize when blow-up occurs in generic domains (both with and without boundaries).  This requires the precise and quantitative understanding of the regularity of solutions near the boundary in physical space and the decay of solutions at ""large"" velocities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This meeting will be the second event in a sequence of annual JAF DE-DS conferences alternating between Auburn, UAB, FIU and FSU campuses that was inaugurated on May 13, 2023, at Auburn University.  This conference will bring together a diverse group of researchers in the geographic area near the States of Alabama and Florida which encompasses numerous universities. The conference will allow experts specializing in nonlinear partial differential equations and applied dynamical systems to exchange ideas, forge new collaborations, and disseminate their recent results. The award funds will help cover travel and local expenses of the participants with no current Federal support. Priority for financial support will be given to graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early career researchers, and scientists from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>Thematically, the conference will cover a wide spectrum of topics in the general area of applied mathematics with a focus on partial differential equations, integrable Hamiltonian dynamical systems and applications in the physical and biological sciences. In the past few decades, novel ideas and methods were developed to tackle complex problems related to existence, stability, and computation of solutions to various model equations arising in fluid mechanics, photonics, Bose-Einstein condensation, and biological systems. Motivated by this progress, the scientific program of the conference will revolve around similar topics including inverse scattering and integrable systems, existence, and long-time asymptotics of nonlinear waves and coherent structures for the nonlinear Schrödinger, Navier-Stokes, and reaction diffusion equations. Making progress in this direction will improve our theoretical knowledge and provide new insights into future research problems related to linear and nonlinear wave propagation in random and complex media.<br/><br/> More information can be found on the conference website: <br/>https://www.math.fsu.edu/~musliman/Second_Alabama_Florida_Conference/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
