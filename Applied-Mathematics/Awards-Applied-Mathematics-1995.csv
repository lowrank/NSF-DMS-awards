The first area is to  establish a unified   scheme for constructing wavelets based only on nested sequences  of   subspaces but not on any two-scale relation.  The second area is  the study of   multivariate wavelets and frames with matrix dilations.  The  third area is on   representation of discrete data by radial basis functions  (RBF's).  The fourth   area is the investigation of adaptive wavelets, based on spline  techniques.  A   particular interest is in modeling by spline and radial basis  functions and in   constructing and analyzing the corresponding wavelets.  In view  of the fact   that most modeling functions, including all the interesting  standard radial   basis functions, do not satisfy a two-scale (or refinement)  relation, a unified   scheme for the construction of wavelets that does not rely on  such a relation   is developed.  This constitutes the first area of the proposed  research.  The   second area is centered around multivariate wavelets, where the  main   concern is matrix dilation.  For instance, the boundedness of the  affine   operator and that of the corresponding Littlewood-Paley energy  functions,   for a finite family of square-integrable functions with zero  mean, will be   investigated and sufficient conditions that guarantee lower  bounds will be   established.  The third area is centered on the study of  localized cosine   Riesz bases and their corresponding duals.  The duals, or  bi-orthogonal   bases, must facilitate computational efficiency.  For this and  other reasons,   spline techniques, such as knot insertion and knot removal, will  be   investigated.  The final area concerns the  modeling of discrete  data.  For   high dimensions, radial basis functions seem to be the most  efficient tool,   and the emphasis will be on various linear and  nonlinear  problems   involving these functions.    The central theme of this rese arch proposal is the development of    mathematical  tools for analysis and synthesis of discrete data  in one or   higher dimensions, in an Euclidean space or on a closed manifold  such as   the unit ball.  This proposed research is a unified approach to  represent any   discrete data set in an effective way so that ""wavelet"" analysis  can be   readily performed. Both spline and radial basis functions will be  used for   data representation.  It is well known that spline functions  provide a very   powerful tool for data modeling due to their most desirable  properties such   as flexibility for adaptive implementation, computational  efficiency, and   localization capability.  On the other hand, radial basis  functions are more   powerful for handling higher-dimensional data sets, particularly  when the   data information is taken randomly.  Wavelets will be constructed   and   wavelet algorithms will be developed by using both spline  functions and   radial basis functions.  In addition, for analyzing nonstationary  data that   change in shape, the investigators will look into the use of  localized cosine   transforms by using splines or radial basis functions as  envelopes (or   windows).  Adaptive algorithms will also be developed.  One of  the main   reasons for wavelets to be considered as a very powerful tool for  data   analysis is their fast algorithms.  The research will be focused  on   constructing wavelets using both spline and radial basis  functions for   effective implementation and fast computation.  Software  development will   be  carried out concurrently, and one of the main goals is to  ensure that the   algorithms can also be implemented in hardware. Industrial  standards in the   hardware prototype development will also be kept in mind."

However, since we have additional unknowns in the  model,  these introduce unknown parameters in the equations that have to  be  additionally solved for by means of further measurements.

Such problems are of major importance  in many   grand challenge scientific and engineering applications:  structural dynamics   and buckling, ocean modeling, quantum chemistry, and    magnetohydrodynamics. They arise typically from the  discretization of   continuous models, described by systems of partial differential  equations.   Matrices may be so large that the standard numerical methods  become   unsatisfactory and cannot be implemented even on the most  powerful   modern supercomputers as they are too slow or require too much  memory.    Preconditioned iterative methods were specially designed for  problems of   that kind and now they are well understood for solving large  ill-conditioned   linear algebraic systems of equations. For eigenproblems the  theory is still   poor, and these methods are rarely used. Ideally, the methods  would   compute well-separated clusters of eigenvalues and corresponding   eigenspaces at the same order of computational cost as that for  solution of   the corresponding linear algebraic system. Such processes can be  effective   and  parallelizable. Domain decomposition and iterative  substructuring   methods are  particularly promising.    The ultimate goal of the research is to develop a complete theory  of the   preconditioned methods now known for symmetric eigenproblems and  to   find new fast, accurate, and robust iterative methods. This would  provide a   basis for the development of advanced software and algorithms on  high   performance parallel computing systems.

The  three main areas of the study, bound together by a common theme, are:  interacting structures and related  smart materials , modeled by systems of  coupled partial differential equations, typically of different types, with possible  couplings of state variables at the boundary; analysis and control theory of  linear and nonlinear models of certain elastic shells, such as a spherical caps,  but also shells having other geometries; and analysis and control theory of  elastic models which exhibit high internal damping and which are acted on by  certain boundary controls.

At the core of these issues lies the notion of  optimization, in accordance with some pre-selected quantitative criterion, of  the evolution of some physical system.

The first is to address the question of controllability of  a Kirchhoff plate model with nonconstant coefficients in the principal part of the  differential operator and with control acting as a moment on the boundary.  Because of  the close relationship between the Kirchhoff plate and a time-dependent Schroedinger  equation with potential, as a first step, a general technique which relies on local  smoothing properties of the solution is used to establish exact boundary controllability  the Schroedinger equation with continuous coefficients.  These results will then be  utilized to establish exact boundary controllability of the Kirchhoff plate equation.  The  second major goal is to resolve the issue of controllability for the equations of three-  dimensional linear elasticity, an issue which naturally arises when moving from two-  dimensional plate models to mathematical models of general three-dimensional elastic  bodies.  Results currently available assume very strict geometric conditions on the  domain even when the control is acting on the entire boundary.  To examine the  boundary controllability problem for the fully coupled system while eliminating these  stringent geometric restrictions, an approach based on energy estimates and microlocal  analysis techniques will be used.  Derivation of trace regularity estimates for the solution  of the system of linear elasticity will be a critical step in the process.    Extensions of boundary controllability results from linear, constant coefficient distributed  parameter systems to systems with nonconstant coefficients are mf great importance  both mathematically and physically.  Accurate mathematical modeling of many important  physical systems requires that spatial inhomogeneities be admitted into the model and  that the physical parameters in the model be permitted to vary with time. For this  reason, it  is important to develop a control theory based on these more accurate models  of the physical world.  In particular, a control theory for such models based on boundary  sensors and actuators is sought, since one of the most important applications of such  a theory is to the problem of controlling large flexible structures, where the natural  locations for both measurements and controls are the joints and outer edges of the  structure.  Because both elastic plate models and equations of linear elasticity may be  used to model components, such as airfoils and solar panels, of many structures,  understanding how such elements can be controlled is a significant step to the  development of a comprehensive control strategy for complex systems.  ***"

While  ordinary differential equations techniques have been effective for  the basic models, effects such as diffusion and transport require  system of reaction diffusion equations.  The basic techniques are  those of monotone dynamical systems on infinite dimensional  spaces.  The effect of delays (for example the cell cycle) can also  be described in such a context.  General techniques for competitive  systems on products of ordered Banach spaces, developed in  previous work, seem to be applicable.  Plasmids are often used in  the manufacture of products by genetically altered organisms.  Because the plasmid can be lost in reproduction and because the  plasmid-free organism is often a better competitor, coding for  antibiotic resistance is often included on the plasmid and an  antibiotic used in the feed bottle.  The differential equation  models describing chemostats with inhibitors and plasmids are no  longer monotone.  The project undertakes the mathematical analysis  of such models.       The chemostat is a basic piece of laboratory apparatus that  models a bio-reactor.  The mathematical description of such models  takes the form of systems of ordinary differential equations.  If  the basic assumption of well mixing is removed from the model  (there is evidence that it is not satisfied in general) more  complicated equations result.  The project undertakes the analysis  of such model equations using the modern techniques of dynamical  systems.  The general view is to use the mathematics to point the  way to biological (or chemical engineering) experiments with the  hope of building better bio-reactors."

The primary effect of source  terms is  that the leading approximation in the multiple scale  expansion  is complicated; in general, it involves an integral   representation that has to be analyzed asymptotically for large  time  before one can derive the appropriate evolution equations.   Extensions of previous work to include the effects of variable   coefficients, leading order diffusion, and resonant wave  interactions  are outlined. In particular, it is proposed to  study wave propagation  problems with axial or radial symmetry  where radial dependence  occurs in the source terms. A second  phase of the research involves a  class of problems where the  usual Ginzburg-Landau technique does  not apply because the  linearly most unstable wave number equals  zero. Problems with  three or more dependent variables involve a  further comlication,  the possibility of resonant interactions between  waves. The  combined effect of source terms snd resonant  interactions has  not been studied, and is one of the main goals of the  proposed  research.   This proposal outlines research in the approximate  analytic solution  of conservation laws when the desired solution  is close to one that is  known exactly. Conservation laws that  model physical or biological  processes typically involve source  terms as well as diffusive terms.  Source terms usually arise  when reactions are present, whereas  diffusive terms often  account for dissipation. The effect of small  diffusion is  benign; as in many fluid dynamics problems, small  diffusion  corresponds to small viscosity and acts to ""smooth out"" the   solution in a thin layer centerd around a shock wave. If,  however,  diffusion occurs to leading order, as in many  biological applications,   the structure of the solution is  fundamentally altered. This proposal  identifies a class of  problems involving diffusion to leading order for  which the  standard approaches do not apply. It is also proposed to  study  the effect of source terms in systms that have three or more   interacting waves, as in gas dynamics for reacting flows. Here,  the  primary focus is to clarify the role of source terms in the  process that  governs the resonant interaction of these waves."

Cells of many types, when seeded on Matrigel,  form aggregates due solely to traction forces.  The traction  mechanically deforms the gel, creating fiber tracks between  aggregates.  The fiber tracks induce cells to elongate and migrate  along them by contact guidance.  The pattern formation occurs  sufficiently quickly that there are no complications of cell  proliferation or secretion or degradation of the matrix, affording  a unique opportunity to study pattern formation by traction forces  in isolation.  The investigator and his colleague develop and  analyze a mathematical model of the cellular tractions and the  resultant mechanical response of the Matrigel, incorporating a  description of the essential material and behavioral anisotropy  which develops in response to traction.  Analysis consists of  linear bifurcation analysis, nonlinear analysis where appropriate,  and a strong component of numerical analysis.  The latter entails  development of algorithms to simulate the nonlinear conservation  and evolution equations in two spatial dimensions.  The study aims  at a deeper understanding of biological traction and the mechanics  of extracellular matrix, and ultimately to a greater understanding  of morphogenesis and remodeling in general.       The investigators develop and analyze a mathematical model of  a particular case of cellular pattern formation with the aim of a  better, more fundamental understanding of (1) the mechanical  interaction by traction forces between cells and their growth  medium (natural or artificial), (2) the subtle anisotropic  mechanics of the extracellular matrix that forms a large part of  the human body, (3) later restructuring such as wound healing and  tumor growth, (4) human embryonic development, and (5) biological  pattern formation in general.  The technique of mathematical  modeling allows a logical construction of biological theories to  test, and a method o f testing those theories with ""mathematical  experiments."" Furthermore, the analysis of the mathematical model  leads to predictions which may then be confirmed or refuted by  appropriate laboratory experiments.

Basic theoretical research goals include the classification of the Lie transformation groups in three-dimensional space, their differential invariants, and the associated Lie algebra cohomology. The applications of these results fall into three broad categories. In computer vision, a new paradigm of image processing based on differential geometric diffusion equations relies on classifying the differential invariant signatures of visual symmetry groups. In quantum mechanics, the analysis of quasi-exactly solvable Schrodinger operators continues to produce significant new developments in the study of Lie algebras of differential operators, including the remarkable phenomenon known as ""quantization of cohomology""; in the present project, the concentration will shift to real planar quantum operators, as well as extensions to a fully three-dimensional theory. In continuum mechanics, the application of equivalence methods and exterior differential systems to the classification of variational problems will be further analyzed with a view to providing canonical forms, geometric invariants, and conservation laws for nonlinear variational problems arising in elasticity.   The goals of this research project are to further our understanding of the mathematical theory of symmetry and invariants in three-dimensional space, motivated by several key physical applications, of importance in physics, engineering and medicine. In computer vision, new methods of image processing promise to have an immediate practical impact in medical imaging, such as the ultrasound detection of breast tumors. In elasticity, the classification of simple forms and symmetries of general materials should have significant consequences in the study of crack propagation and waves. In quantum mechanics, new types of problems some of whose  fundamental states are classified by algebraic tools have known applications to molecular spectroscopy and scattering theory."

A typical example is the electrical spot welding of metal sheets in the  manufacturing of such products as automobile bodies, tanks, and armored  vehicles. The mathematical modeling of such processes often leads to systems  of degenerate partial differential equations with diffusive and convective  couplings. The study of these systems leads to deep and intriguing questions  in nonlinear analysis. In these considerations, the presence of strong  nonlinearities and degeneracy gives rise to very rich structures of solutions.  Our recent research findings indicate that solutions of these systems display  new phenomena that cannot be incorporated into the classical variational  formulation, and a new notion of a capacity solution is, therefore, introduced  to study these systems. In this proposal, we propose to study the finer  properties of capacity solutions, such as regularity, partial regularity,  large time behavior, and other related questions.  The proposed research is  important from the point of view of industrial applications. The mathematical  results we wish to obtain can lead to a more efficient production line, a new  or better product. For example, in the welding of metal sheets, one of our  objectives is to find out how the welding time is related to the material  properties and the current applied. This information is critical to the  automation of the welding procedure."

A major  emphasis will be on the  modeling of   thin structures (plates and shells). Specifically, an innovative  new finite   element method recently proposed by a team of computational  engineers for   plate bending will be analyzed and a new approach the  investigator   introduced in collaboration with Brezzi to develop and analyze  new finite   element methods for modeling the deformation of elastic shells  will be   pursued.  This latter approach has produced the best theoretical  results to   date for avoiding the phenomenon known as membrane locking which  has   plagued shell computations.  In addition to studying numerical  methods and   the errors they introduce, the investigator will consider the  errors introduced   by mathematical models of thin structures.  Specifically, a new  technique of   analysis to study the convergence of two-dimensional models of  thin plates   will be used.  This technique gives the possibility of obtaining  sharp   convergence estimates for plate modeling errors both globally and  away   from the lateral boundary (where convergence may be higher).  It  is hoped   that this research will clarify in what situations the  Reissner-Mindlin plate   model affords better approximation than the classical Kirchhoff  model, an   important question that eluded resolution for decades.  A second  area of   emphasis will be on the  development, implementation, validation,  and   dissemination of a finite element code to simulate the collision  of black   holes.  This problem involves the solution of the Einstein field  equations on   an unbounded domain in four dimensional space-time and is  extremely   demanding computationally.  Work will focus, at least initially,  on the   solution of the initial data problem for black hole collisions,  i.e., the   determination of physical ly consistent and meaningful initial  data. The   initial data problem is a nonlinear elliptic system posed on an  unbounded   three-dimensional domain.  For this problem the computer code to  be   produced will involve a variety of sophisticated modern  techniques that   have not yet been applied in  computational relativity, including  adaptive   tetrahedral mesh generation and multigrid preconditioning.    The investigator's work is directly related to several critical  technological   issues.  It is generally agreed by practitioners that the current  state of the art   of numerical modeling of shells is inadequate, and this has been  implicated   in the failure of engineering structures such as stadium roofs  and airplane   fuselages.  The investigator's work in both the area of the  development and   analysis of finite element methods for plates and shells, and on  plate   modeling errors is directed at overcoming these problems.  The  work on the   simulation of black hole collisions is directly motivated by the  ongoing   construction of the LIGO gravitational wave observatory.  LIGO is  expected   to be able to detect radiation from black hole collisions early  in the next   decade.  Massive numerical simulations are needed to identify the    cosmological events which are the sources for the detected  radiation. It is   clear that these simulations push the limits of available  hardware and   software technology.  The investigator's work is directed at  improving the   speed and accuracy of these  simulations by employing and  adapting recent   advances in numerical algorithms.  The resulting computer codes  will be   adapted to parallel computer architectures and will provide an  excellent   opportunity for the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows  working   under the supervision of the investigator to learn high  performance   computing techniques."

The importance of the proposed research lies in the following  observations: 1) The foundations of quantum theory, the most  fundamental of all physical theories, continue to be mired in  confusion and incoherence some sixty-five years after its  inception. 2) Bohmian mechanics is the natural embedding of  Schroedinger's equation, which is the mathematical core of almost  all interpretations of quantum theory, into a clear, precise  physical theory. It emerges if one merely insists that this  equation be directly relevant to the motion of particles. In  other words, Bohmian mechanics arises, roughly speaking, from  Schroedinger's equation when (perhaps naively) we insist upon the  simplest ontology---particles described by their positions---and  seek a natural law of motion for this ontology. 3) All the  mysteries of quantum theory find a compelling explanation in  Bohmian mechanics---in effect, in the obvious ontology evolving  in the obvious way! 4) An appreciation of Bohmian mechanics can  be the source of enormous flexibility and clarity when one  attempts to apply quantum theory in new directions---for example,  to understand the implications of macroscopic interference  effects---and to new domains, such as quantum cosmology. 5) The  underlying principle behind the value of Bohmian mechanics is  that it really does help to formulate physical theories with  sufficient clarity that they can genuinely be understood."

It has recently  become clear that  additional constitutive information is required to  close this  system of equations and to describe phenomena like  nucleation,  kinetics of phase boundaries, reconnection of phase  boundaries  and formation of finite scale microstructures. We propose  three  alternative ways to regularize the classical elastodynamics for   materials supporting seteral phases in order to derive rather  than  postulate the missing conditions. The regularization  involves high  derivatives, additional variables and/ or  consideration of discrete  system.   Large strains observed in  smart materials are produced by the  coordinated migration of the  glissile interfaces in processes such as  martensitic phase  transformations, deformation twinning or  electromagnetic domain  switching. A knowledge of the evolution of  the mobile  microstructure, and the way in which it can influence   macroscopic properties, forms the basis of any attempt to control   mechanical properties through materials selection and  metallurgical  processing.

The main  target is systems of reaction-diffusion equations.  Such problems  are important in practical terms because they occur as  mathematical models in applied science and engineering, including  applications in genetics, material science, chemistry, and  biology, among others.  The challenge is to compute accurate  approximations of solutions that generically include multiple  scales in their space and time behavior and whose behavior depends  strongly on parameters prescribed as part of the model.  Moreover,  using computation as a scientific tool requires an estimate of the  accuracy of the approximation.  The approach to these problems is  based on developing a posteriori error estimates that bound the  error in terms of computable information obtained from the  approximation once a computation is completed.  The analysis takes  into account both the difficulty of solving the differential  equation over a small interval and the global accumulation of  errors.  In particular, the stability properties of the solution  being approximated are measured by auxilary computations performed  during the approximation.  The result is robust and reliable  computational error estimates.  In addition, the investigator  examines the dynamical properties of numerical schemes in the  context of obtaining schemes with improved accuracy for a  specified problem and obtaining more accurate error estimates for  such schemes.  The third component of the project is the  development and implementation into code of adaptive error control  algorithms based on the a posteriori error estimates.  The ultimate  goal of this project is the public release of a parallel code that  can solve systems of reaction-diffusion equations in two and three  dimensions reliably and efficiently.       Mathematical models in applied science, including genetic s,  material science, chemistry, and biology, are often expressed as  nonlinear reaction-diffusion differential equations that contain  source terms balanced against terms that diffuse energy.  The goal  of such modelling is to describe the physical situation in terms  of the solution of the differential equation.  However, the  nonlinear nature of most models makes it impossible to solve the  equations explicitly; consequently numerical approximation is an  important tool in science.  This approach has its own difficulties.  The balance between reaction and diffusion is usually delicate and  difficult to handle accurately.  Moreover, solutions of such  problems typically evolve on several scales, i.e. some interesting  behavior occurs in very localized regions in space and time while  other behavior evolves over long times or over larger regions in  space.  The use of a uniform numerical discretization for a real  application results in huge computations that tax even the largest  computers.  The investigator aims to produce numerical schemes that  adapt themselves to the localized behavior of the target solution  so as to make the computations both as accurate as desired and as  efficient as possible.  Another benefit is that the estimate of the  accuracy can then be reported, which increases the scientific  level of numerical analysis.  The mathematical approach is develop  estimates of the error that use information obtained from the  approximation, which can then be used to adapt the discretization,  that is make the computations self-governing.  The investigator  also is implementing this theory in a code for parallel computers  that can solve very general problems with minimum user input.  The  intent is to make the code publicly available, yielding a  scientific tool that benefits the engineering and scientific  infrastructure."

Lyapunov exponents measure the average rates of linear  expansion or contraction of a dynamical system in different  directions; a system with N positive Lyapunov exponents is  expanding in N linearly independent directions, thus an attractor  of the system should be at least N-dimensional. However,  attractors and Lyapunov exponents can be very sensitive to  parameter changes, leading to ""windows"" in parameter space for  which the system exhibits lower-dimensional behavior. Also, the  fluctuations over time of the number of positive finite-time  Lyapunov exponents in some systems leads to important questions  about the shadowing properties of numerical trajectories. We will  study these and other fundamental aspects of dynamics systems  with multiple positive Lyapunov exponents.  Higher dimensional  chaos can occur in models of many engineering devices and in  meteorological models and climate models. This research will tell  us if mathematical models can suddenly get trapped in artificial  windows of regular behavior. These windows would be artificial in  that any realistic level of noise would disrupt the regular  behavior. Our research will also shed light on the reliability of  numerical trajectories for higher dimensional models. This study  is critical to realistic modeling."

Basic biological  research has increasing relevance to national priorities such as   health care and environmental protection, and powerful new  experimental techniques have made it possible to observe  previously inaccessible mechanisms in physiology, genetics, and  ecology.  Expanded access to powerful computers has enabled  researchers to simulate complex and realistic models of ecological  and physiological systems, establishing modeling and computation  as a new mode of experimentation in the life sciences.  Unfortunately, the training of most biologists and mathematicians  fails to prepare them for this type of research.  The Special Year  in Mathematical Biology prepares young researchers at the pre- and  junior post-doctoral level for these new demands.  The speakers and  researchers invited to this Special Year have established records  of successfully collaborating with both mathematicians and life  scientists.  The program focuses on three active areas of research  in the life sciences: ecology and evolution, physiology and cell  biology, and cardiovascular physiology and biological fluid  dynamics.  These areas have been fertile ground for successful  collaboration and modeling in the past.

We have found  that there is a well defined intermediate situation between weak  and strong turbulence which we call {\it semi-strong turbulence}.  In this situation the turbulence represents the dynamics of a  system of weakly interacting waves, but the wave kinetic equation  is inapplicable, no matter how small the wave amplitudes are  (this happens, for example, when the waves are non-dispersive,  like acoustic waves).

The entropy control can be reinterpreted as a nonlinear stability estimate in terms of the so-called modified entropy function.   Preliminary results include a practical verification of the proposed ideas, using the Taylor-Galerkin discretization in time method combined with an artificial viscosity model proposed by Hughes and Johnson, all in the context of h-adaptive linear finite elements. The obtained numerical results confirm that the entropy control indeed may provide a basis for the careful  balance between stability and higher-order resolution in FE discretizations.

Possible applications include modeling of flows around a complete aircraft or part of it, and internal  flows related  mostly to combustion problems (engines).  The described research should contribute to a  better understanding of the fundamental role of the entropy function in global and local stability of  compressible gas simulations.

Of interest are  both the dynamics of a single organism and the relationship of its  morphology to its motility properties, and the collective  hydrodynamic interactions of groups of swimmers with each other  and their environment.  Applications studied include bacterial  chemotaxis in micropores, spermatozoa motility in the reproductive  tract, and the coupling of active and passive tissue properties to  the external swimming mechanics of a leech.  Bacterial chemotaxis  in micropores is of special interest, because the transport  behavior of microorganisms through porous media is important in  studying the contamination of groundwater supplies.  Although  bioremediation, the process by which microbes degrade  contaminants, has field scale implications, the detailed study of  pore-level behavior of the coupled fluid-contaminant-microbial  system is essential.  The project's computational model includes  the detailed analysis of hydrodynamics, contaminant reaction,  diffusion and convection, and the chemotactic responses of the  swimming microbes.  This allows the systematic study of the  influence of different parameters, such as swimming speed,  diffusion rates, microbial uptake rates, as well as stochastic  parameters relating to the likelihood with which microbes change  their swimming direction in response to the evolving contaminant  field.  This is difficult, if not impossible, to examine in a  laboratory environment.       The project studies the way organisms swim, using  computational models.  The organisms studied vary in size from  bacteria to leeches.  Of paramount importance in the study of  bacterial transport in micropores is the growth of biofilms.  Under  certain physical and chemical conditions, microbes adhere to each  other and the local pore structure.  This biofilm growth affects  and is affe cted by the local flow characteristics and contaminant  transport.  The computational model has the ability to model  complex, dynamic fluid-structure interactions.  Agglomeration is  modeled by exerting appropriate binding stresses between discrete  representations of organisms, that may hold them together, or, if  fluid stresses are large, may yield and release the organisms.  The  model is a powerful tool for understanding biofilm processes at a  micropore level.  This has important consequences for environmental  problems."

Aggregation leads to  spatial complexity through feedback.  The feedback is nonlinear  when the cues individuals use to aggregate depend on the number of  individuals.  In a population model that allows for movement,  aggregative feedback causes nonlinear self-focussing, the  organization or `focussing' of population groups on small scales.  Decreases in the scale of spatial correlation make the dispersal  pattern more complex, leading to complicated spatial structure.  Mathematically, issues of pattern formation are related to the  structure of invasion waves or `fronts' between ecological states.  When the structure is known, stability analyses of states behind  the front or along the front determine how complexity is  generated.  A body of mathematical work has focussed on predicting  the speed and shape of invasion waves in biological problems.  Unfortunately, known techniques only address the invasion problem  in systems of low dimensionality (one or two dependent variables),  and do not lend themselves to general ecological application.  Techniques to predict front propagation in systems of many  variables are therefore at the center of the research.  Front  solutions, or waves of invasion, are the basis for stability  analyses at invasion boundaries, which predict how curvature  instabilities produce complexity at the invasion boundaries.  Results of these mathematical efforts are used to understand  complexity generation in the mountain pine beetle/pine system.  Results from the mathematical model are compared with data on  size, shape, and structure of known infestations.       In short, the idea is to determine how much focussing, or  clumping, of a species determines the natural formation of  patterns in ecosystems.  Aggregation, or clumping, of spec ies  occurs naturally, and can be predicted mathematically.  The  researchers examine how this mechanism creates complexity in  ecosystems, and study how to determine how much of ecological  complexity is self-generating, as opposed to being generated by  the complexity of the environment.  The Mountain Pine  Beetle/Lodgepole Pine ecosystem is studied because elements of the  spatial pattern (attacked and killed trees) are distinctive and  easy to measure.  Moreover, understanding the predictable aspects  of the course of pine beetle infestations is important to  understanding the role this pest plays in western forests,  including the relationship between beetle-killed pines and forest  fire."

Current and planned experiments include: (a) constitutive tests using a biaxial apparatus with the capability of measuring the speed of sound and of continuously monitoring the deformation with x-rays, (b) further study of porosity waves, (c) experiments directed toward isolating the causes of the instabilities of shaken granular material, and (d) experiments probing various aspects of fluctuations in granular flow, including stress chains and 1/f noise.  Based on the fact that the governing PDE of nonassociative plasticity become ill-posed at moderate strains, current analytical work seeks (a) to generalize previous one-dimensional work, driven by both mathematical considerations and the need to establish a sound theoretical framework for numerical simulations of two-and-three-dimensional phenomena and (b) to relate ill-posedness to various experimental phenomena such as porosity waves and shear banding.  Related problems in metal plasticity are also being studied analytically.  Numerical work includes both (a) continuum and (b) molecular-dynamics (MD) computations.  The key effort in the former is to complete a code for simulating shear-band formation and propagation, especially in the biaxial test; this code includes front tracking and mesh refinement at the shear band.  MD computations have the immediate goal of gathering quantitative information about fluctuations in granular flow, particularly the variation of such fluctuations with length scale.  In the long range, it is planned to develop a hybrid code that solves continuum equations in regions where the solution is smooth and invokes MD in regions of rapid change.         Many areas of applied engineer ing stand to benefit from progress on the fundamental questions addressed in this project, including (1) particle handling and transport, (2) soil mechanics, (3) materials forming, and (4) geotechnical engineering.  The following elaborates on area (1).  An estimated 40%, or $61 billion, of the value added by the chemical industry is linked to particle technology.  A study by the Rand Corporation found that, because of inability to accurately predict powder behavior, solids-producing manufacturing plants performed on average at 63% of design capacity, compared to 84% for liquids-producing plants.  In economic terms, this difference is staggering.  (Regarding future competitiveness, the U.S. should note that Germany and Japan lead the world in particle-technology research.)  Fundamental understanding of the flow of granular materials would help (a) in finding ways to control industrial problems and (b) in developing new, more efficient industrial processes.  To illustrate (a): one of the difficulties of granular flow is that quite different behavior may result from apparently identical circumstances, especially when scale-up is involved (e.g., from laboratory-scale experiments to an industrial silo).  Most existing theories attempt to describe the flow only in term of average quantities, ignoring deviations from these averages.  The focus in this project on fluctuations and length scales offers the possibility of being able to predict, and design for, the full range of behavior of real materials-handling systems.  To illustrate (b): the experiments in this project with shaken granular material have led to ideas for two planned applications for patents, one in obtaining uniform mixing of multi-sized particles and the other in exposing a large surface area to the surrounding gas (as in a fluidized bed but not requiring fluid flow).  These applications are being explored in concert with researchers in industry."

The  phenomena involve the interaction between two different space-time scales. The  small scale consists of strongly nonlinear single or multiple traveling waves  with wave parameters that vary in the large scale. The waves, that eventually  spread over large space regions are generated at points where the dispersive  nature of the system smoothens the shocks produced by the nonlinearity. An  oscillatory microstructure will thus typically arise out of non-oscillatory  initial data.  The proposed projects are relevant to physical applications  that involve nonlinearity and dispersion.

The project will focus on the  specific questions of asymptotic and exponential stability of the balanced  systems and the boundedness properties of the system operators. A further  important point which will be addressed is the issue of whether general  Trotter-Kato type convergence results can be proved for the balanced  approximation scheme.        Many engineering systems, such as highly flexible mechanical systems,  inherently contain infinitely many degrees of freedom and therefore any  accurate mathematical description of such a system must necessarily be  infinite dimensional. This project is concerned with so-called balanced  realizations for infinite dimensional linear systems. One of the important  uses of balanced realizations of linear systems is as a tool in achieving  model reductions of complex systems, which is a very important consideration  at a practical and computational level. There already exists an extensive,  elegant and important (from the point of view of applications) body of results  concerning balanced realizations and their role in model reduction for finite  dimensional systems. However, extensions of existing theory to infinite  dimensional systems is extremely complex at both the conceptual and technical  levels.

In general these  problems exhibit one of two distinct traits; either the solutions  take on the character of a free boundary problem where the unknown  boundary separates the phases, or the phases are finely  interspersed.  The former are modeled by degenerate parabolic  equations.  While the theory for these equations is well developed,  this is not the case with the discrete theory for their numerical  approximation.  For example, the investigator in collaboration with  J. Rulla has only recently established optimal rates of  convergence of the classical Stefan problem in a dual Sobolev  space; however, rates of convergence of the energy in the space of  integrable functions is still an open question.  Even less is known  about approximations of the mean curvature equation that arises,  for example, when the interface between the phases has more  structure.  The investigator also studies the approximation of  problems that exhibit fine phase mixtures.  Because these problems  involve structures that are much finer than any feasible mesh, the  investigator utilizes the recent theory of Young measures to  characterize the fine scale behavior.  This theory shows that the  fine scale behavior is far from random and in many cases can be  characterized by a the (macroscopic) Young measure.  The  investigator studies and analyzes algorithms that approximate the  Young measure.       In this project, the investigator develops efficient ways to  computationally model problems arising in the environmental and  material sciences.  One interesting feature of these problems is  that they often exhibit interfaces where different materials meet.  For example, when modeling the spread of pollutants, the single  most important quantity is the location and motion of the  interface between the pollutant and the clean environment.  Problems in the material sciences often involve very fine scal e  phenomena involving interfaces between different phases of the  same material.  This phenomenon is ubiquitous, being observable,  for example, in most metals.  However, the fine scales also present  many obstacles when analyzing such materials.  The investigator  develops the computational tools to circumvent these problems,  providing another step towards the automation of the design and  development of modern (and traditional) materials."

It has been known for some time that the standard problem of H-infinity control can be converted to a Nevanlinna- Pick interpolation problem.  Recent work has illuminated a far-reaching analogue of point evaluation and a whole theory for associated analogues of Nevanlinna-Pick  interpolation for time-varying systems. This investigation will pursue further elaboration of these ideas, in particular, the parametrization of a system in terms of zero and pole data for the time-variant case, and the connections of Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation for time-variant systems with Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation for time-invariant systems having  infinite -dimensional input-output and state spaces.  In addition, the PI will continue work on nonlinear systems and nonlinear H-infinity control. In particular, the construction of an inner-outer factorization for a nonlinear plant is a basic requirement in a number of important applications but is well-understood only in special situations.  Finally, work on various interpolation problems involving meromorphic matrix functions on closed Riemann surfaces will be carried out.  Zero-pole interpolation problems are closely related to classical Riemann-Hilbert problems and Wiener-Hopf factorization as well as to the classification of holomorphic vector bundles over the surface. In addition, such zero-pole interpolation ideas provide a new tool for completely understanding of work done in the 1970's on Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation for functions analytic on a finitely connected planar domain. A basic tool is the realization theory for meromorphic bundle maps on an algebraic curve with determinantal representation as the transfer function of a 2-dimensional linear system.   A basic paradigm in control theory is what is now called H-infinity control.  This approach provides a way to formulate control objectives mathematically in a way which guarantees reliable results when the mathematical model of the physical system under  consideration is not a completely accurate representation of the true system. The discrepancies may be  caused by uncertainty in certain physical parameters, or  the effect of outside disturbances not taken  into account in the mathematical model.  One of the earliest solution procedures for the simplest H-  infinity control problems was through the classical mathematical theory of Nevanlinna-Pick  interpolation.  Spurred by the needs of the emerging H-infinity theory, various researchers improved,  extended and made this classical theory computationally practical.  The PI has been instrumental in  extending this approach to time-variant systems and nonlinear systems (where the basic physical law s  no longer satisfy a superposition principle).  Although it has now known how to unify time-variant  theory conceptually with the time-invariant case, further work is needed to obtain a better  understanding of decomposability and robust stability properties for eventually time-invariant linear  systems and for nonlinear systems.  Applications to which this research is expected to contribute  include airplane flight control, improvements in automobile suspension systems and compact disk  players, and chemical process control, to mention just a few.   Research on interpolation problems for  functions defined on topologically more complicated surfaces called Riemann surfaces will also be  carried out.  This work is expected be useful in applications to control systems involving transfer  functions having algebraic singularities."

The transfer of information between  neuronal networks is studied using population decoding methods.  Questions to be addressed include: How is the information encoded  in a sensory network transferred to a motor network in a task like  visually guided reaching toward an object?  How do the invariant  representations needed to identify and locate an object  independent of translations, rotations, and scaling changes arise?  It is widely believed that synaptic modification is the basic  neuronal mechanism underlying memory and learning.  Population  decoding methods allow for an interpretation of the effects of  synaptic modification with direct behavioral relevance.  In  preliminary decoding studies it has been found that the temporal  properties of long-term potentiation naturally cause a population  of neurons to predict a coded quantity after training.  This  suggests a novel mechanism for learning and generating sequences  of motor actions that is explored.       Reaching for an object, turning toward a visual or auditory  cue, and a variety of other tasks require motor responses that are  accurately guided by sensory information.  In addition, previous  experience can play an important role in shaping these responses.  Experiments have provided important information about how sensory  information is represented in the brain and how experience can  modify neural circuits.  Mathematical decoding techniques allow us  to relate motor responses, such as reaching, to the activity of  neurons in the motor cortex of the brain.  The goal of the project  is to construct a theoretical framework, based on these data, for  understanding sensory-guid ed motor tasks, including mechanisms for  learning and generating accurate responses and modifying them on  the basis of experience.  This work should provide new insights  into how we generate basic motor behaviors and may have  interesting applications to robotics."

The first   problem addresses the diffraction of weak shock waves, where   an apparent contradiction, known as the von Neumann paradox,   has been puzzling physicists and mathematicians for almost   five decades. The paradox concerns the ubiquitous occurrence   of three-shock intersections in a regime where, in principle,   they are not allowed.  It is proposed to study this problem within   the context of a simplified asymptotic model. The results so far   suggest that the solution to the paradox may involve an additional   singularity arising at the triple-point. The second problem   regards the long-scale behavior of winds, concentrating on the   formation of fronts between warm and cold air masses in the   atmosphere. The mathematical structure of this problem is   surprisingly similar to the one associated with the question of   formation of singularities in three-dimensional incompressible   fluids.  Both problems involve a combination of physical modeling,   asymptotic analysis and analytical and numerical solution of   partial differential equations.     Both proposed problems have practical as well as theoretical   significance. Shock diffraction occurs in a variety of scenarios,   such as supersonic flight, flood waves and even medical   applications, when focusing sound waves are used to destroy   kidney stones. A better understanding of the diffraction process   would therefore impact not only our knowledge of waves in nature,   but also our capacity for predicting wave intensity amplification   due to focusing and reflection in engineering devices. The   formation of sharp fronts between air masses in the atmosphere,   on the other hand, is an important and ubiquitous phenomenon.   Understanding its mechanics would enhance our ability to   predict weather and climate changes. The surprising relationship   between this problem and the question of singularity for mation in   incompressible fluids, on the other hand, provides a promising   alternative way to study a mechanism which may play a fundamental   role in turbulent intermittency."

While  these techniques are obviously successful, they have shortcomings;  one can only approximate orbits over finite time intervals and  these methods have difficulty detecting orbits which are unstable  in the sense of dynamics.  These unstable orbits can be extremely  important since they define the boundaries of basins of  attraction, and hence, determine the global dynamics of the  system.  In addition, there are many problems where the objects of  interest are precisely the unstable bounded orbits, e.g. traveling  waves.  In the second case, one needs to know a priori what types  of solutions should be looked for and in what regions of phase  space one should look for the solutions.  The investigator develops  complimentary methods for studying the global dynamics of ordinary  differential equations.  The theoretical basis for the project is  Conley's theory of dynamical systems.  The work is separated into  four tasks. (1) Given as an input an ordinary differential  equation and a region in phase space, develop efficient numerical  schemes to determine isolating neighborhoods and compute their  Conley indices. (2) Given a potential isolating neighborhood,  develop more efficient mechanisms for obtaining computer assisted  proofs to verify that the neighborhood is an isolating  neighborhood and to rigorously compute the Conley index of the  associated isolated invariant set. (3) Extend the abstract Conley  index theory, which allows one to draw conclusions concerning the  structure of the dynamics from knowledge of the index and the  isolating neighborhood. (4) Apply these techniques to ordinary  differential equations  for which the global dynamics is poorly  understood.  It should be emphasized that the end goal of these  four steps is to obtain a rough understanding of the global  dynamics of the ordinary differential equation.  In particular,  these procedures provide information about both the type and  structure of dynamics that occur, and the region of phase space in  which these dynamics take place.  A finer understanding of these  dynamics can then be more efficiently investigated using the more  classical methods mentioned at the beginning.       It is clear that most phenomena, whether physical, chemical  or biological in nature, need to be described by nonlinear models.  Thus, to describe the dynamics of these phenomena one is required  to solve problems in global analysis.  In practice, this usually  requires numerical computations, since our theoretical analytic  techniques are not yet adequate.  With the advent of high  performance computing considerable progress has been made in  understanding the behavior of a wide variety of nonlinear  dynamical systems.  However, there are many drawbacks to most  current numerical and computational techniques at our disposal.  This project is aimed at two of them.  The first arises from the  fact that the classical numerical techniques often provide bad  approximations over long time intervals (i.e. they are unreliable  for long range predictions) and also they have difficulty  detecting unstable dynamic structures (these unstable structures  determine the path by which the object being modelled reaches its  asymptotic state).  The second problem involves difficulty in  understanding the tremendous amounts of numerical data which the  computers are capable of generating.  Typically this problem is  overcome by graphically displaying the data.  Unfortunately, most  models involve more than three variables, and hence visualizing  the numerical results becomes a difficult task.  This project  develops theoretical techniques and efficient numerical methods  for  describing the global dynamics arising from nonlinear ordinary  differential equations, and then applies these techniques to a  wide range of biological and physical problems.  The theoretical  aspect involves translating algebraic information into dynamics  and the numerical side involves computing these algebraic  invariants by approximating the differential equations.  The  algebraic information works equally well for stable or unstable  dynamics and, of course, being algebraic, does not need to be  visualized in order to be understood."

The  curved shell is an elastic waveguide whose properties change  slowly with wavelength, these changes being caused by the varying  radii of curvature and thickness, while its two surfaces form  weakly coupled surface-wave waveguides. The propagation is  studied by asymptotically expanding the wavefields in inverse  powers of the radii of curvature with each term subsequently  expanded in the Rayleigh-Lamb modes. The beating over the  propagation path of the two lowest Rayleigh-Lamb modes gives rise  to a surface wave that couples back and forth between the two  surfaces. The scattering that a surface wave experiences when it  strikes a compact discontinuity near one of the surfaces or  encounters a region of roughness along one of them is also  studied. The compact scatterer is modeled by assigning it  reflection and transmission coefficients determined from a local  analysis of the wavefields near the discontinuity. The roughness  is modeled by working out the attenuation to the surface wave.  The results of this work will be compared to existing data at the  Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State University.    Turbine blades rotated at high speeds and pipelines used to carry  oil or natural gas are among the common curved structures  ultrasonically inspected for damage such as fatigue cracking or  corrosion. Fatigue cracks in a turbine blade often occur at its  root, a location not always visually accessible. Corrosion to a  pipeline can begin at its interior supface where it cannot be  detected unless a section of the line is shut down. This work  investigates how these curved, elastic shell structures can be  inspected using surface waves that propagate first over the  exterior surface, then over the interior surface, ultimately  returning to the exterior surface where they are picked up. Th ese  waves detect damage to an interior surface and carry that  information to the exterior. Ultrasonic inspections must also  give an estimate of the seriousness of the damage. By modeling  scattering from a small surface crack or attenuation caused by a  patch of corrosion, this work enables the information carried by  a surface wave from one surface to another to be interpreted to  give quantitative estimates of the damage."

Many physical problems are most naturally initially described by a DAE.  DAEs arise in a variety of  physical problems including flight control, robotics, chemical process control, and contact or  constrained problems in mechanics.  In addition, DAEs occur in the solution of partial differential  equations by the method of lines and in many circuit models. Computer generated mathematical models  for physical processes are often DAEs.  Existing numerical codes, while very useful, require special  problem structure and do not handle many problems of interest.  In addition, many of these methods  require the  potential user not only to recognize the mathematical structure of the problem, but also  to explicitly exploit this structure.   This restricts both the number of users and the complexity of  the problems  that can be solved. This project will develop numerical methods for general  nonlinear  DAEs. Theoretical analysis, computational   implementation, and applications will all be  considered.  The long range goal of the proposed research is for scientists and engineers to be able to work  directly with the original implicit model thus reducing design and simulation time as well as  facilitating the consideration of more complex problems.  The building of physical prototypes is  time  consuming, expensive, and restricts the number of ideas that can be tried out.  Computer simulation is  becoming increasingly essential for both design and evaluation.  In  many areas of technology, the  equations that the computer must solve are most easily set up as a mixture of differential and  algebraic equations or a DAE.  DAEs are not the kinds of equations that classical numerical methods  and mathematical theory were designed for.  Converting a DAE into another type of mathematical problem is often difficult and time consuming.  Sometimes this conversion requires considering a simpler  mathematical equation which does not do as good a job of predicting what the real physical system will  do.  This has led to a world wide effort to develop numerical methods for solving DAEs.  There have  been notable successes and some of this effort has resulted in software, such as DASSL, that is used  in many industries and laboratories.  However, many important classes of DAEs are still difficult, or  impossible, to solve directly with existing software.  This project will develop numerical methods  that can be used to solve important additional types of DAEs.

These  include (i)  questions of optimization, hedging and pricing of contingent claims in   markets with transaction costs, as well as in markets in which the prices can  depend in a nonlinear fashion on the investment strategy and wealth of the agent;  (ii) nonstandard models for asset prices. Mathematical questions related to (i)  include existence and uniqueness of certain forward-backward stochastic  differential equations, viscosity solutions to certain partial differential equations and  variational inequalities, as well as a non-standard  stochastic control problem in  which the terminal loss function has a random component.  With regard to (ii), it is   expected that a new kind of stochastic calculus will have to be developed,  one  which goes beyond the semimartingales framework.        One of the reasons for the present gap between the theory of finance and  the reality of the stock market is the prevailing assumption in theoretical work that  the market is perfect in the sense that every financial contract can be priced by  calculating exactly its present value. This is, however, not the case in reality due to  different types of market  friction"" such as transaction costs, different interest  rates, presence of large investors who can influence the asset prices, and so forth  Thus, it is very important to develop new methods for pricing financial instruments  in imperfect markets, some of which will be the focus of this research.  In a similar   vein, the risk one undertakes when buying or selling financial instruments is  typically much larger than predicted by the perfect-market theory (as recent  scandals involving the trading of options confirm).   This project will develop a   theory of risk-hedging in imperfect markets that is more general and at the same  time  more applicable to realistic financial markets than current theory.  ***"

In such cases, a  study of algorithms for the limiting infinite-dimensional programs can predict the  behavior of standard computational schemes that are actually implemented in  approximating finite-dimensional spaces, and can also suggest new algorithms that  have no counterparts in the standard methodology for finite-dimensional  mathematical programs. In particular, recent studies have shown that standard  nonlinear programming algorithms are best suited to optimal control problems with  Hamiltonians that are uniformly convex in the control input vector, while other  optimal control problems may require strong variation methods based on the  inherently infinite-dimensional necessary condition of Pontryagin. The proposed  investigation has the following immediate objectives: (i) to establish the  convergence properties of Newtonian projection methods in Chebychev norm  neighborhoods and root-mean-square neighborhoods of control functions that  satisfy recently developed local optimality sufficient conditions for nonconvex  nonquadratic constrained input regulator problems; (ii) to extend the analysis in (i)  to hybrid algorithms that employ Newtonian projection and Lagrangian  augmentation techniques for regulator problems with control variable and state  variable constraints; (iii) to establish the convergence properties of strong variation  methods in root-mean-square neighborhoods of control functions satisfying sharp  local optimality sufficient conditions in the root-mean-square norm for optimal  control problems with Hamiltonians that are not convex in the control input vector;  (iv) to corroborate the predictions of the infinite dimensional convergence analyses  in (i)--(iii) for approximate finite dimensional computations on fixed and nested  grids.     Optimal control problems arise in aircraft and spacecraft trajectory calcula tions,  nuclear and chemical reactor control, structural and aerodynamic design,  management of ecological systems, and many other applications. In the generic  optimal control problem, a large number of control variables (forces, voltages,  temperatures, etc.) are chosen at various points in time and space to bring some  physical system into a desired state, and to accomplish this at the lowest possible  cost (manuever duration, fuel or power consumption, etc.). Control and state  variable values are also typically constrained by hardware or safety considerations,  and state transitions are often governed by complicated systems of ordinary or  partial differential equations. The associated optimization task is therefore  demanding, and requires algorithms that effectively exploit control problem  structure in the computation of their successive approximations, and also exhibit  good global and local convergence characteristics for the problems in question. In  broad terms, the goal of the proposed investigation is to understand which  algorithm types are most effective for a given problem structure in the context of  optimal control.  ***"

The equations of linear   elasticity are of special importance and interest.  The significance of a-  posteriori error estimates for these problems is balanced by the need for   deeper a-priori error estimates.  The difficulty in obtaining a-priori error   estimates stems from the explicit appearance of the divergence operator in   these problems.  Similar difficulties appear in the study of numerical   methods for the Stokes equations.      There are many important practical problems which arise in fluid flow and   elasticity which lead to problems which must be solved on the computer.    The solutions of these problems are then approximations to solutions of   elliptic boundary value problems.  Most of the research in this area has   emphasized finding a computer problem whose solution is indeed a very   good approximation to the solution of the elliptic problem.  Having done   that, one must still find efficient and relatively cheap methods to solve the   computer problem.  This last, very practical problem, is the focus of the   research in this project."

It is expected that this course will provide the textual material   necessary to support a substantial modeling course.  The second part will be   a sequence that will introduce students to contemporary biomathematical   modeling.  It is expected that this course will cover quantitative topics that   will help life science students deal with the numerical and technical   information they will encounter.  Regular meetings with undergraduate   course directors and other interdisciplinary faculty members will be an   important part of this mission.

In the SDE method, the surface of the region  traversed by an   object moving through space (the swept volume of the object) is   characterized in terms of a differential equation (the SDE). A  major goal of   the project is to obtain a generalization of the SDE -  incorporating the   geometry of the object - that has the property that its  trajectories foliate   most of the boundary of the swept volume. This leads to a  reduction of one   dimension in the set that generates the swept volume, and it  promises to   yield an order of magnitude decrease in the computational  complexity of   algorithms based on this new method. Algorithms based on this new  method   shall be developed, and the unique features of the approach shall  be   exploited to obtain  approximate numerical and graphical  representations of   swept volumes. In particular, the foliation of the boundary  surface shall be   incorporated into new interpolation procedures, and a natural  functional   criterion for trimming (or excluding) points not belonging to the  swept   volume boundary shall be employed. The algorithms shall be used  to   develop computer programs for automatic verification and  generation of   numerically  controlled (NC) machining programs and robot motion   planning problems.    The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration between  an applied   mathematician and a mechanical engineer aimed at developing new  theory   that is to be implemented for practical manufacturing related  problems,   thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in advanced manufacturing.  A   primary objective is to develop new tech niques that enable one to    characterize swept volumes essentially by a curve on the boundary  surface   of an object in its initial position - with the swept volume  being generated   by solutions of a differential equation. This innovation is to be  used to   develop accurate computer-aided methods for obtaining numerical  and   graphical representations of configurations swept out by objects  moving   through space. The algorithms based upon this theoretical   framework have   the potential to reduce the computations of existing algorithms  by at least an   order of magnitude. As swept volume plays an important role in  such   diverse areas of automated manufacturing as NC machining, robot  motion   planning and computer-aided design, the applications of the  research in this   project should have a significant impact on modern manufacturing  theory   and practice."

Of primary concern will be flames whose characteristic   dimension is much larger than their thermal thickness so that the flame can   be viewed as a hydrodynamic discontinuity.  Such flames have taken on   new significance in recent years due to their role in modeling turbulent   combustion.  In one phase of the project, hydrodynamic flame models will   be used to study the dynamics and extinction characteristics of premixed   flames in unsteady environments. The investigator also proposes to extend   existing flame models that have employed one-step-chemistry   approximations by considering a two-step mechanism that better captures   the branching-recombination nature of flames.  The methods that will be   used include asymptotic and perturbation techniques together with   numerical computations. This work will provide a better understanding of   flame-flow interactions which are an important feature of turbulent   combustion.    Nearly all combustion devices of practical importance operate in a turbulent   combustion regime.  This includes spark-ignition engines, incinerators,   rockets, forest fires, etc.  The complexities inherent in each of these systems   have prevented a deep understanding of turbulent combustion.  However, a   partial understanding of this topic can be achieved by first comprehending   various fundamental aspects that are common in many of these systems.    For example, a turbulent flow field is characterized by random spatial and   temporal variations, and a flame situated in such a flow will get stretched   and distorted.  In addition, the heat released by the combustion process will   affect the flow field.  In this work the investigator proposes to study these   interactions theoretically. There are two main themes: (i) to examine flame   response in unsteady (time-dependent) flows; and (ii) to extend existing   flame models to include additional eff ects due to chemical reaction.  This   work will provide a better understanding of flame-flow interactions which   are an important feature of turbulent combustion."

The Hamiltonian structure of corresponding dynamical systems and its relation to the problems of constraint mechanics will be studied. The dependence of qualitative properties of dynamical systems on the choice of barrier functions will also be considered.  Various approaches to the construction of algorithms based on dynamical systems are compared.  New approaches to semidefinite problems, optimization problems in spaces of measures, and infinite-dimensional quadratic problems will be suggested.  As a result of the project, it is expected that substantial progress will be made toward construction of interior-point algorithms for the above mentioned classes of problems. More im portantly, the combination of interior-point techniques and sequential quadratic programming approaches will lead to efficient algorithms for solving broad classes of optimal control problems with both state space and control inequality constraints.  Control theory has numerous applications to practical problems ranging from missile guidance to laser CD tuning.  It is quite natural to expect that the choice of control  strategy is  determined by the available resources and the performance index.  This is the main  paradigm of so-called optimal control theory. Until very recently only few optimal control problems  could be solved in real time. The very fast development of so-called interior-point algorithms  completely changes the situation. It is now quite possible to address optimal control and other  infinite-dimensional problems involving inequality constraints. Robotics (including  motion planning,  dexterous grasping force optimization) and control of quantum processes (important for the development  of new materials) are good examples of problems where such techniques can be used. The exciting aspect  of interior-point algorithms is that their efficiency grows with the size of the problem.  In this  proposal, a program of development interior-point algorithms is suggested which would unable one to  apply this methodology to a broad class of optimal control problems.  Ways are outlined to generalize  interior-point algorithms while keeping their efficiency (measured by complexity estimates).

Compared to the case of one variable, zeros of polynomials in several variables and high dimensional quadrature formulae are much more difficult and the results have been scattered. Recently the a new approach was used to study the topic and showed that positive high dimensional quadrature formulae can be characterized through the existence of real common zeros of certain set of quasi-orthogonal polynomials; necessary  and sufficient conditions for the existence of such zeros were also obtained, which are given in terms of certain nonlinear matrix equations.  The project will involve the continuation of this study and will use this approach to conduct a systematic study of this topic. It is very likely that the approach will enable one to tackle several fundamental questions, such as the  connection to moment problems in several variables which may lead to an analytic characterization of common zeros, structure of minimal and ``near'' minimal cubature formulae, and construction of new efficient numerical integration formulae. The goal is to establish a unified theory for high dimensional numerical  integration formulae based on the common zeros of quasi-orthogonal polynomials.    The outcome of the project will help in understanding the structure of high dimensional numerical integration formulae and the structure of the common zeros of polynomials. The information will be very useful in finding new formulae for practical evaluation of high dimensional integrals, which is one of the essential questions in numerical analysis and is often taken as a test problem in high speed computing; it can also be very useful in  constructing formulae with special properties, for example, the equal-weight formulae on spheres, which have applications in coding theory. The project is also motivated by the potential a pplications of the outcome in other areas of numerical mathematics, such as orthogonal polynomials in several variables and interpolation by polynomials which are basic tools for data fitting and surface reconstruction."

The main  goal is to capture invariant   structures in the phase space with a strong impact on the general evolution of the system.   Ideal candidates for such structures are hyperbolic  partially slow manifolds that arise in   many resonance problems and carry physically important motions with different time   scales.

This proposal deals with the detection of such   transitions in the important and frequent case when the solution surfaces are composed of   solutions with several different time scales.

Two areas will be addressed: multi-pulse homoclinic orbits in   low-dimensional systems, and regular and irregular dynamics of the   Maxwell-Bloch integro-partial differential equations that describe ring-  cavity laser optics. The proposed research in the area of multi-pulse   homoclinic orbits is a  continuation of the author's previous work on   unstable resonant systems.

The research component   of this project involves intended research that addresses both regular,   mainly time-periodic, and irregular, or chaotic, behavior in two classes of   physical systems in mechanics and laser optics.  The work will focus on   mathematical models that are near-integrable, that is, models whose degree   of approximation is a small step away from making them explicitly   solvable.  By neglecting certain small quantities, these models do become   explicitly solvable, or integrable.  The explicit solutions obtained in this   way may be used to approximate the solutions of the more complicated   near-integrable systems.  The proposed work will thus develop a   mathematical description of the mechanisms behind certain types of   behavior of the physical systems under investigation, such as the irregular   beats in the amplitudes of coupled pendula, and some of the regular and   chaotic  operation regimes of lasers.  Numerical computations will be used   to motivate the  analytical investigations and confirm their findings, as well   as to extend their results to mathematical models that are less simplified and   thus not amenable to either explicit or approximate solution, but are more   phys ically accurate.  Comparisons with realistic physical and engineering   applications and experiments are also proposed.

Shock-waves are modeled by discontinuous solutions in  inviscid equations, and shock-waves are what introduce  time-irreversibility, decay, loss of information, dissipation and  increase of entropy into the dynamics of solutions. The author's  recent construction of a shock wave solution of the Einstein  equations takes advantage of the fact that the gravitational  metric is continuous across a shock, even though the fluid  variables are discontinuous. This allows for solutions that are  weaker than shock wave, and the proposal explores the organizing  effect that the gravitational metric has on the geometry of shock  wave propagation. In the nonlinear theory of sound waves, the  authors address the open problem of explaining the stability of  periodic solutions. Their idea is to treat Lie bracket errors in  wave interactions as virtual waves, and thereby they can identify  and study a nonlinear cancellation mechanism that explains why  the dissipation due to increasing entropy defeats the  amplification of waves due to nonlinear interaction in the long  time.  The proposal involves the analysis and interpretation of  the author's recent construction of a new shock wave solution of  the Einstein equations of general relativity. This exact solution  resolves a problem that was first posed in a famous 1939 paper by  J. Robert Oppenheimer and his student H. Snyder. The new shock  wave solution of the Einstein equations of general relativity  provides a model in which the universe begins with a shock wave  explosion instead of the well established ``Big Bang'' scenario  (in which the entire universe burst from a single point).

The differential  equations typically contain parameters whose values correspond to  physical properties of the system. Such a system generates a  dynamical  system in an appropriate phase space. To understand a dynamical  system  we should determine its compact invariant sets, which  contain  the  non-transient solutions such as equilibria, periodic solutions,  or ones  of greater complexity. It is important also to determine the  behavior  of the transient solutions with respect to the non-transients.  Finally,  one should know how all of this depends upon the parameters. For  example,  a parameter change may induce a stable or hyperbolic equilibrium  state  to bifurcate into one or more time-periodic solutions, or ones  with a  more complex time structure. The Conley homotopy index theory  contains  concepts and methods that can be used to prove existence, and  determine  the properties, of compact isolated invariant sets in a dynamical  system.  Like topological degree the index is locally constant, and if the  index  changes as a parameter crosses a value, a bifurcation is implied.  A  major part of this project is the application of Conley homotopy  index  methods to study bifurcation in systems of reaction-diffusion  equations.  The investigators will: (I) Continue investigations of continua  of  full bounded solutions bifurcating from trivial solutions in  infinite  dimensional dynamical systems, especially in nonlinear reaction-  diffusion systems. Using Conley homotopy index methods Ward  recently  demonstrated conditions for the existence of such bifurcating  continua.  Two of the main goals of this project are to fully describe the  global  aspects of these continua, and to apply the results to the study  of  global bifurcation of equilibria in gradient systems. (II) Study  bifurcation and persistence in reaction-diffusion models arising  in  population biology an d chemistry. Physically meaningful solutions  must  have non-negative components. In this connection the  investigators  propose the development of a homotopy index bifurcation theory  for  nonlinear ordinary and parabolic partial differential systems  which  have an invariant non-negative cone. (III) Build on their earlier  work  on nonautonomous differential equations. In particular, they will  continue the development of a homotopy index based theory for  nonlinear  time-dependent ordinary and parabolic partial differential  systems. In  this case a dynamical system is not generated in the space of  initial  values, but one can associate a skew-product flow and use the  Conley  theory to study its invariant sets. From this one can derive  information regarding the original system. The investigators will  focus  on existence, dynamics, and bifurcation phenomena. (IV) Study  related  problems for semilinear parabolic partial differential equations  with  nonlinear boundary conditions, such the existence and asymptotic  stability of periodic solutions, and the effect of interactions  between  the spectrum of the linear part of such equations with the  nonlinearities.  %%%   Differential equations model physical phenomena such as  mechanical  systems, chemical reactions, and the spread of disease.  An  initial state  (e.g., initial number of infected individuals) then evolves over  time  according to the laws of the system expressed by its equations.  This  constitutes a dynamical system. A goal of dynamical systems  theory is to  describe how the states of the system evolve. Thus, the number of  fish  of a given species in a lake might tend toward a steady, fixed  population,  while the number of  individuals infected at any given time with  a  transmittable disease, such as  chicken pox,  may exhibit a  periodic  behavior, peaking every six or seven years. To understand a  complex  dynamical system one should determine the non-transient or  long-term  phenomena such as equilibria, time-periodic  regimes, and others  perhaps  of a more complex nature, the relation between the transient  solutions  and the non-transients, and how this all depends on system  parameters.  Mathematical models depend upon certain parameters fom the  physical system,  such as the volume of a lake in a study of its fish population or  diffusion  rates in a chemical reaction. The nature of the long-term  behavior of a  system may depend upon its parameter values. If the parameters  change,  the number or structure of the non-transient solutions can  change.  Such a parameter dependent change is a bifurcation. Another kind  of  bifurcation occurs when the behavior of the transients changes,  as when  an equilibrium point (a non-transient) loses stablity with a  parameter  change. Non-transient solutions correspond to invariant sets in  the  dynamical system. The homotopy index theory was developed by  Charles  Conley and others to analyze the existence and properties of  isolated  invariant sets in dynamical systems. It also can be used to show  that  bifurcations must take place at certain parameter values. A main  part  of this project involves the application of Conley homotopy index  methods to bifurcation phenomena in systems of reaction-diffusion  equations. Reaction-diffusion systems of partial differential  equations  relate diffusion phenomena, such as diffusion of a chemical in a  medium,  with reaction rates, as in a chemical reaction. They serve as the  mathematical models of  a great many phenomena, including  chemical  reactions, population densities, and climate.  The investigators will: (I) Continue investigations of continua  (families of solutions joined together) of bounded solutions  bifurcating  from equilibrium solutions in nonlinear reaction-diffusion  systems.  By using Conley homotopy index methods Ward recently found  conditions  for the existence of such bifurcating continua. Two of the main  goals  of this project are to fully describe the global aspects of these  families of bifurcat ing solutions, and to apply these results to  study  global bifurcation of equilibria in gradient systems (systems  which,  in the long run, will reach an equilibrium state). (II) Study  bifurcation and persistence in reaction-diffusion models arising  in  population biology and chemistry. (III) Build on their  earlier  work  on time-varying systems of differential equations. Such systems  exhibit  phenomena different from the time-independent systems discussed  above.  The investigators will continue to develop a homotopy index based  theory  for nonlinear time-dependent ordinary and parabolic partial  differential  systems.  ***"

Though this   technology has progressed very rapidly, advances continue to be made in   the design of these systems.  Areas of current research in the field, which   hold great interest and challenge for mathematicians, involve physical   phenomena and processes that exploit the nonlinear effects in optical   materials.  These physical phenomena and processes include optical   solitons, optical pulse compression, and optical switching.  This project will   involve goals and planning activities that include developing and analyzing   mathematical models of these nonlinear phenomena and processes in order   to improve the design of optical communications systems.    The National Science Foundation's mandate to ensure the vitality of the   Nation's scientific enterprise includes concern for the quality, composition,   distribution and effectiveness of the human resou rce base in science and   engineering.

Generally, an  inverse problem  consists in finding a coefficient of source term in a partial  differential equa  tion from an additional boundary or scattering data. Also of  interest are cer-  tain unknown domains entering a boundary value problem. Elliptic,  parabolic, an  d hyperbolic equations will be studied. Accordingly we focus on  the inverse  conductivity problem, inverse scattering and seismic problems.

A special attention  will be paid to  use of local boundary data, finite number of scattering  frequencies, and to  identification of non-linear equations. The powerful methods of  PDE and Complex  Variables are supposed to be used which include potential theory,  Carleman type  estimates, complex geometrical optics, and Fourier Integral  Operators.

The theoretical approach employs displacement based Finite  Element Analysis (FEA), a well-established technique for obtaining  solutions to engineering problems in nonlinear solid mechanics.  FEA is used to describe closed DNAs containing multiple coplanar  bends that are in-phase; containing bends that do not lie in the  same plane; and containing bends are distributed both  symmetrically and asymmetrically.  It is predicted that the twist  distribution is uniform throughout the regions between the bends;  that the fraction of the linking number change (DLk) converted  into writhe increases with the number of bends; and that the  regional contribution to the writhe increases if the bends are  clustered in that region.  Methods are devised for solving the  problem of avoidance of passage of the DNA strand through itself  as DLk becomes greater than 12.  This includes a novel approach,  the use of special contact elements (gap elements).  These have the  property that when the gap distance reduces to some specified  value, nodal motion constraints are relaxed if the nodes  subsequently tend to separate.  Finally, methods are developed for  decomposing changes in DLk into changes in writhe and twist.  Biologically, closed circular DNA is one of the most important  structural forms of DNA.  This includes not only free DNA  molecules, such as the plasmids used in all genetic engineering  experiments, but chromatin as well, which is now known to be  divided into domains of supercoiling.  Bent regions in DNA appear  to be significant in regulating the initiating of transcription.  This project provides the physical basis for understanding the  combined effects of these two structures.       DNA is not only a repository for genetic information but also  is involved in many aspects of the expression of this information.  For example, it is often necessary to bring together portions of  the DNA molecule that lie at considerable  distances from each  other along the DNA contour.  This juxtaposition of distant genetic  elements makes possible the expression of biological information  that is not otherwise possible.  This process is accomplished by  forming a loop, in which the two elements that are to be brought  together interact at the site of loop closure.  The bringing  together of these distant genes depends in a sensitive way upon  the length of the DNA piece that separates them and upon the  helical periodicity.  This project shows how the presence of  internal bends in DNA within the loop fundamentally changes how  distant segments are brought together.  The distribution of these  internal bends can thus have profound biological consequences."

It involves the development and application of high order finite differences and finite element schemes as well as Spectral methods. The methods to be developed and applied are suitable for problems in several space dimensions with complicated geometries. A major consideration in developing and assessing high order methods for long term integrations is their scalability. Based on the experience gained already in parallelizing ENO codes, a further effort to parallelize spectral and finite element based ENO codes is proposed. The research has two components, theory and applications, those components are linked together.  The theory is motivated by the type of applications under investigation and the applications use the theoretical developments.  It has been shown that in order to numerically simulate complicated flows that change in time, high order methods are necessary. However those methods, because of their high accuracy, are less robust. The proposed research deals with the issue of the successful implementations of high order methods.  This involved theoretical issues (as solving the 100 years old Gibbs Phenomenon) as well as more applied issues. On the applied side, the problem of mixing enhancement by interactions of Shock waves and hydrogen jets will be studied. This entails the simulation of an air shock passing through an hydrogen jet in high Mach numbers. High order methods are mandatory here since the process of interest is the mixing and combustion inside the jets. The current codes, Spectral and ENO are to be modified to handle more general cases.  Parallel versions of ENO and spectral methods are being applied now and will be further modified."

McLaughlin and the investigator have shown that  the potential in a Schroedinger equation on a rectangular domain  can be uniquely determined (up to an additive constant) by the  nodal lines, i.e. the set of points where the eigenfunctions  vanish.  The present proof assumes that the potential is constant  near the boundaries of the rectangle.  This assumption excludes a  large class of potentials and one goal is to remove this  restrictive assumption.  In the field of Fluid Mechanics Buttke has  recently proposed a very interesting method for solving Euler's  equations for two and three dimensional flows.  Using a new  interpretation of the computed velocity kernels, the investigator  aims to establish the convergence of the method.       The properties of elastic materials (such as beams or plates)  can be described by elastic parameters.  In many problems the  elastic parameters are not available for direct observation.  For  example, one cannot see on the surface of the earth that the  density changes at the depth of two miles due to the presence of  oil.  Similarly, a crack deep inside a piece of metal may not be  observable on the outside.  In such cases one may probe the  material by sending waves through it, and study either the  reflections of the waves or the vibrations of the material.  One  important goal of the theory of inverse problems is to show that  the property of the elastic material can be inferred from the data  thus observed, and to develop efficient algorithms for estimating  the material properties.  In engineering, meteorology, and medicine  it is important to be able to compute the movement of a fluid  accurately.  Examples are: (1) water running through pipes, (2) the  movement of air in weather prediction, and (3) the flow of blood  through an artificial heart.  At present calculations of  two-dimensional flows are done routinely, but it is still a  challenge to calculate the mo vement of water in three dimensions,  especially when the water is turbulent.  It is a question of having  sufficiently powerful computers, and a very efficient way of  describing the flows.  The work of the investigator is focused on  numerical methods that are specially suited for studying the  movements of very complicated flows."

Applications are made to  Stochastic Approximations, Game Theory, Mathematical Economics of  sustainable resources, Numerical Algorithms, and Neural Learning  Algorithms.

(1) In Economic Theory, markets are often modeled as  a game played repeatedly between competitors who continually adapt  their strategies (e.g., prices, production) in the light of  experience.  It is of great importance to determine whether this  leads to a stable, predictable situation.  This project studies how  questions of this kind can be solved by translating them into  mathematical problems in the seemingly different but well  understood field of dynamical systems theory.  This application  builds directly on work by the recent Nobel Laureates in  Economics, Nash and Harsanyi.  The investigator is also  collaborating with economists on applications of the same  mathematical results to models of sustainable resources.  (2) In  many areas of science en gineering it is important to whether  particular systems are ""chaotic,"" i.e. inherently unpredictable in  the long run.  This project provides new means for determining  chaotic dynamics.  (3) The newly emerging field of Neural  Computation involves dynamics in many ways.  Some of the same  mathematical ideas used in the other parts of this project are  directly relevant.  In collaboration with biophysicists, the  investigator applies dynamical systems theory to new neural  network systems that can efficiently ""learn"" to do a variety of  useful tasks, such as robot control."

The basic issue involved is that of preservation of stability under  finite dimensional approximation of the system.  This is a very important  question since every computational scheme for a system of partial differential  equations or other infinite dimensional system involves a finite dimensional  approximation of one sort or another, and it is well-known that certain  approximation schemes will destroy stability or change the so-called stability  margin.  A recently developed method of approximation, called the  method of   equivalent inner products,  that is known to preserve the  stability margin of  the original infinite dimensional system, will be studied.  The method is known  to be useful for approximation of bounded operators (systems of ordinary  differential equations, for example).  In additions to establishing convergence  properties of the method in the context of the equations under consideration,  reliable computer algorithms based on the method will be developed.        The mathematical equations governing the motion of vibrating flexible   elastic structures are used to model such diverse physical systems as robot   arms, large antennae, buildings (vibrating in an earthquake, for example),  airplane wings, and so forth. Computer algorithms are often used to simulate  these equations in order to solve complex problems in these applications. With  the advent of new technologies, such as advanced actuators and materials, and  enhanced performance requirements, together with the need to better  understand and influence the motion of these systems, there is a necessity for  more sophisticated mathematical models and theoretically sound, reliable  numerical algorithms for model simulation and approximation. This project will  focus on a new approximation method which has shown significant promise for  imp acting exactly these types of problems.  Basic convergence properties of  the method will be developed, as well as associated software based on the  method.  ***"

First, the investigator proposes to apply new results in sampling theory to do high-resolution signal processing by combining several low-resolution versions of a given signal. It was observed by Berenstein and others that a mathematical model of this problem (called multisensor deconvolution) is uniquely solvable but ill- posed, and difficult to solve numerically. The investigator has found Shannon-type sampling formulas on unions of regular lattices with incommensurate densities, which provide simple solutions to the multichannel deconvolution problem in special cases. The following applications are envisioned: 1) Sharpening measurements taken by CT scanners by combining measurements from several low-resolution detectors. This could ultimately lead to inexpensive measuring devices with resolution comparable to expensive high-resolution machines. 2) A recently proposed scheme to increase resolution in an industrial tomography problem involves sampling on unions of regular grids of incommensurate size. The investigator's sampling results could lead to a complete solution to this problem. 3) New techniques are required to do ""superresolution"" in electronic imaging since the theoretical limit of pixel resolution is rapidly being reached. Deconvolution at high-resolution of several low-resolution images is a natural approach to this problem. Second, the investigator and others have successfully shown that wavelets are a natural tool for recovering edge features of an image from local Radon transform data. The investigator proposes to develop these local algorithms with the following goals envisioned: 1) Find ways to recover locally density as well as edge features of an image, and develop an algorithm competitive with existing local tomography algorithms and 2) Identify the wavefront set of an image using wavelets, and ultimately apply the techniques to the at tenuated Radon transform. The first part of the project is concerned with increasing the resolution of remote sensing devices such as electronic cameras. Suppose, for example, that a CCD camera has a resolution of 1 millimeter, that is, it can distinguish features of a scene that are at least 1 mm on a side. Features smaller than that are blurred into their surroundings. Berenstein and others observed that some classical mathematics led to a possible way to increase resolution without designing an expensive high-resolution device. If one took several images of the scene with cameras identical to the first but which had slightly poorer resolutions than the first (this could also be achieved by repositioning the same camera), then in theory one could recover features of the original scene to arbitrary resolution. In practice, arbitrary resolution is not possible, but it seems that real increases in resolution can be achieved. The investigator has formulated an approach to this problem from the point of view of sampling theory. Using this approach, the investigator has been able to produce numerically stable twenty-fold increases in resolution in a one-dimensional model problem. More work is required, but the following applications are envisioned: 1) Producing high-resolution measurements from CT scanners by combining the measurements from several low-resolution scanners and 2) Increasing the resolution in a specific industrial tomography problem by a direct application of the investigator's new sampling results. The second part of the project is concerned with ""local"" CT scans. In existing CT scanners, an entire slice of a patient's body must be exposed to radiation even if the doctor is interested in looking at only a small region. The investigator proposes to use a new and powerful signal processing technique called wavelets to find efficient algorithms for obtaining an image of a small area of a patient's body while only exposing the area of interest to radiation. It is hoped that these techniques will be competitive with existing so-called local tomography algorithms."
