A comprehensive characterization of the solitary waves resulting from such phenomena is an important problem, which is far from complete. Therefore an objective of this research project is to conduct an extensive study of the nonlinear equations describing such localized wave-forms and wave-patterns by analyzing the underlying mathematical structures of the relevant solution spaces. Since the theory is shared by various physical systems, it is anticipated that the results from the proposed work would provide insights into other areas such as light waves in nonlinear optics, and spin waves in magnetic thin films. A second objective is to apply the theoretical results of this project to investigate possible mechanisms generating ""rogue"" waves of extremely high elevations frequently observed in open seas, and surface wave patterns in shallow water. Understanding the nature and dynamics of such extreme waves, and ultimately predicting such wave phenomena in oceans near highly populated coastal areas or at harbor entrances with heavy shipping traffic, are extremely important tasks. The proposed research activities will involve several undergraduate students over the course of this project since it will be carried out in an undergraduate institution. The students will gain firsthand research experience in applied mathematics, which may motivate them to pursue graduate studies or other career opportunities in mathematical sciences."

Very recently, the<br/>investigators Ward and Narcowich and a collaborator introduced a<br/>new tool for fitting a divergence-free vector field tangent to a<br/>2D orientable surface contained in 3D to samples of such a field<br/>taken at scattered sites on the surface.  The method, which<br/>involves a kernel constructed from radial basis functions (RBFs),<br/>has applications to problems in geophysics -- for instance, the<br/>nonlinear flow of an incompressible fluid in a single hydrostatic<br/>atmospheric layer.  Mathematically, incompressibility translates<br/>to the velocity having vanishing surface divergence.  Fitting<br/>divergence-free tangent vector fields to data taken in these<br/>cases would help in modeling the incompressible velocity fields<br/>involved.  In addition to handling scattered data, it has the<br/>advantage of avoiding special treatment for the poles.  The<br/>investigators study the approximation properties of this tool,<br/>with a view towards estimates on its data-fitting errors as well<br/>how robust it is.  For certain cases, numerical experiments<br/>suggest both a good fit of data and robustness.  In addition,<br/>unstructured scattered data -- i.e., clumped, or clustered, or<br/>nonuniformly distributed data -- present problems for any method,<br/>including the traditional RBF-type algorithms based on translates<br/>of one conditionally positive definite function.  These clustered<br/>data occur naturally in learning theory, neural nets, meshless<br/>methods, and other situations.  To deal with clustered data, the<br/>investigators initiate the study of the construction of new<br/>bases, preconditioners, and in general a new RBF-type paradigm. <br/><br/>     Problems that involve analyzing data taken from scattered<br/>sites -- that is, irregularly placed sites -- in space or on the<br/>surface of the earth arise frequently in diverse fields:<br/>computer-aided design graphics, data mining, medical imaging,<br/>learning networks, and geoscience, in addition to many other<br/>areas.  Such problems present difficulties for traditional<br/>methods, which are based on collecting data at uniformly placed<br/>sites.  For example, weather prediction is based on a<br/>mathematical model where the earth's surface is assumed to be a<br/>surface of a sphere.  The investigators develop new methods and<br/>tools to help in analyzing such phenomena via so-called radial<br/>basis function methods. <br/>"

In Part 1, the<br/>objective is to develop a group-theoretic method by which<br/>explicit expressions that delineate the effects of<br/>crystallographic texture on material tensors of weakly-textured<br/>polycrystalline materials can be derived systematically.  A<br/>representation theorem is proved that reduces the problem to that<br/>of finding irreducible tensor bases of the rotation group.  A<br/>method is developed to generate irreducible tensor bases for a<br/>given tensor space.  The method delivers representation formulas<br/>at once applicable to all texture and crystal symmetries. <br/>Specific instances important for applications in<br/>acoustoelasticity and plasticity are fully worked out.  Part 2<br/>concerns nondestructive inspection of subsurface residual stress<br/>by ultrasonic measurements.  The material body in question is<br/>modeled as a vertically heterogeneous, prestressed, anisotropic<br/>half-space.  An extension of the Stroh formalism is developed to<br/>relate the dispersion of the Rayleigh wave to the vertical<br/>heterogeneity of stress and/or texture.  In Part 3 a<br/>phenomenological theory is developed for the interpretation of<br/>resonance shifts and line shapes in ultrasound resonance<br/>spectroscopy of sheet metals.  The sheet metal in question is<br/>modeled as a textured, largely elastic material with a small<br/>power-law viscosity.  An attempt is made to draw information on<br/>resonance shifts, line shapes, and frequency dependence of<br/>attenuation through analysis of the basic initial-boundary-value<br/>problem. <br/><br/>     The crystal grains that constitute polycrystalline materials<br/>(e.g., wrought and cast metallic alloys) often carry preferred<br/>orientations (or crystallographic texture) that strongly affect<br/>mechanical behavior of the aggregate material (e.g., the<br/>formability of sheet metals).  Part 1 of this project delivers<br/>formulas that describe quantitatively how crystallographic<br/>texture affects the behavior of a polycrystalline material in<br/>elastic and plastic deformations.  Part 2 arises from the<br/>industrial need for a nondestructive measurement technique that<br/>allows monitoring of the retention of subsurface residual stress<br/>induced by surface conditioning treatments on metal parts for<br/>lifetime enhancement against fatigue failure and stress corrosion<br/>cracking.  The availability of such nondestructive technique<br/>also allows emerging surface-enhancement technologies (e.g.,<br/>laser-peening, low plasticity burnishing) to be more cost<br/>effective and improves quality control of surface conditioning<br/>processes.  Part 3 helps lay the mathematical foundations for the<br/>development of an ultrasonic technique for monitoring of texture<br/>and material microstructures in sheet metals (and hence of their<br/>formability) on the production line."

It is used by virtually all mathematicians and by statisticians, physicists, biologists, computer scientists, engineers, and social scientists. Just as the basic idea of first semester differential calculus (approximating the graph of a function by its tangent line) provides information about the function, the process of linearization often allows difficult problems to be approximated by more manageable linear ones. This can provide insight into, and, thanks to ever-more-powerful computers, approximate solutions of the original problem.  The fundamental nature of linear algebra and its many applications make this an ideal theme for a summer program for graduate students.<br/><br/>The 2008 Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) Participating Institutions  Summer Graduate Program on ``Linear Algebra and Applications'' will be held Iowa State University June 29 - July 26, 2008.   The IMA will pay all costs for the principal speakers  and all expenses for up to two students from each of the 40 IMA participating institutions to this Summer Graduate Program.  This project will provide support for an 12 additional graduate students from non-IMA US institutions, and salary for a post-doctoral associate who will serve as a mentor to the graduate students.   Applications will be taken through the Linear Algebra and Applications Graduate Summer School website http://www.ima.umn.edu/2007-2008/PISG6.30-7.25.08/<br/><br/>The program organizers are Leslie Hogben, Wolfgang Kliemann and <br/>Yiu-Tung Poon.

To circumvent the computational challenge for directly solving the Boltzmann equation, we will utilize the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) as a reduced kinetic system, and allow systematic increase in its complexity and ability to model higher Knudsen number (Kn) flows by increasing the number of discrete velocities and augmenting the complexity of the collision model with multiple relaxation times.  To overcome a deficiency in kinetic theory for gas flows in nano-scale confinements, i.e., its inability to include the van der Waals interactions between the gas and surface molecules, and other surface physics effects, we propose to develop a molecular dynamics (MD) method for gas flows that will reduce the computational cost by about three orders of magnitude. The MD method will also be used to extract mean-field potentials for gas-surface interactions to be included in the LBE models for micro-flows.  To achieve our<br/>objective, we propose kinetic-theory based mesoscopic models which include consistent mean-field potentials extracted from MD for gas-surface interactions. We do not believe it is a viable approach to stitch together, in an ad hoc fashion, models which are valid in different physical regimes of disparately different scales, such as the Navier-Stokes equations for macroscopic continua and molecular dynamics for microscopic systems.  We expect the proposed method to properly model both the nonequilibrium effects due to non-zero Kn and the surface effects due to gas-surface interactions, which are crucial in micro- and nano-flows.<br/><br/><br/>The success of the proposed research will have broad and significant impact on modeling and simulation of micro- and nano-flows, which have important and wide range of applications in micro-fluidics for bio-medical and other applications. Practical examples are micro-inertial sensors or micro-mirror arrays. Our research will also train graduate students to become qualified workforce for our nation in fast growing areas of engineering and science, which are crucial to our national economy and security."

The fundamental task of science is to probe the world around us. The most powerful method to do this is to send waves to an object and measure the response. Inverse Problems consist in determining properties of the object being probed from these observations. These problems arise in all fields of science and applications where causes for a desired or observed effect are to be determined. The proposed research considers fundamental questions in the mathematical theory of inverse problems which are motivated by applications to medical imaging, geophysics, and remote sensing among others. Development of mathematical techniques to address these difficult questions will undoubtedly have real world applications in the future that will benefit mankind.  The mathematics of X-ray tomography has, for instance, contributed to the development of CT scans and other medical imaging techniques that help save lives everyday. The proposed research will also involve graduate students as part of their course work and PhD theses, and also postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>Specifically, the proposer plans four major topics of research. The first one is Electric Impedance Tomography. In this inverse method one attempts to determine the conductivity of a medium by making voltage and current measurements at the boundary.  This inverse method has been proposed as a valuable diagnostic tool in medicine for the early detection of breast cancer. The second is on the subject on how to ""cloak"" objects, that is how to make them invisible to electromagnetic waves and other type of waves, a subject that has received a lot of attention in recent years. The third is Travel Time Tomography that arises in determining the inner structure of the Earth by measuring the travel times of seismic waves produced by earthquakes.  The final topic is inverse scattering that involves far field measurements and arises, for instance, in remote sensing, sonar and radar."

This is particularly interesting in the context of financial mathematics in which one is interested in the behavior of the stock price in a short time. For instance, this will be relevant to option prices at short maturities, or probabilities to reach a default level in a short time. Multi-factor stochastic volatility models have been studied intensively in the past years, and  they have been found very useful to describe the observed smile/skew of implied volatilities. At short maturities the rate functions appearing in the large deviation estimates will usually not be given in closed form, and will depend on some details of the models like volatility of volatility. On the other hand it has been shown that multiscale stochastic volatility models and their asymptotics are very useful to obtain accurate approximations of option prices and hedging strategies which can be efficiently computed with only a few group parameters easy to calibrate to data. It is then natural to study asymptotic expansions of the rate function in the regime of separation of volatility time scales. In particular, the regime in which the maturity is small but large compared to the mean-reversion time of the stochastic volatility factor turns out to be very interesting and challenging. The research supported by this award is about deriving and fully justifying such asymptotic expansion. The problem will be formulated as logarithmic asymptotic for exponential moments of certain functionals of diffusion processes, which in turn is connected with homogenization/averaging theory for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.  The collaborative nature of the  research combines expertise in the area of multiscale stochastic volatility modeling, in the areas of large deviation theory, and viscosity solution and homogenization/averaging for HJB equations. <br/><br/>This award will support a multidisciplinary research effort. It concerns very practical modeling issues in the area of financial mathematics as well as theoretical convergence results in the theories of large deviations for diffusion processes and homogenization of nonlinear partial differential equations. It is expected that the results obtained on small default probabilities will be very helpful in understanding default mechanisms in credit markets. This research therefore is very timely. The senior PI at UCSB is actively involved in organizing conferences, workshops and special sessions which promote interaction between academic researchers and practitioners. The research will be given full exposure in the activities of the newly created Center for Research in Financial Mathematics and Statistics (CRFMS) at UCSB. The collaborative project will also serve as a training tool for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at both institutions, UCSB and KU.<br/>"

Atomistic simulations have predicted new materials with higher energy density, but the physical limit has nearly been reached.  However, power density (charge/discharge rate per unit mass) and cycle life must improve drastically for new applications such as electric vehicles. These properties are governed by dynamical processes occurring on larger length and time scales, better suited for continuum or statistical models, which have not been developed. Breakthrough advances towards the next generation of rechargeable batteries will require new fundamental understanding of such processes, and the field is ripe for contributions from applied mathematics.  To meet this need, we plan a collaboration consisting of experts on atomistic simulations of batteries (Ceder), microstructural simulations (Thornton), and mathematical modeling of electrochemical systems (Golovin and Bazant).

A great deal of multi-scale physical phenomena can be suitably modeled by singularly perturbed systems. Turning points, if present in the problem, increase dramatically the level of complexity of the global dynamics. They allow a seemingly simple system to support very rich and, sometime, surprising behaviors. The investigator proposes to continue his research on turning point problems, particularly on the collective effects of multi-family turning points. A class of problems to be investigated concerns multi-family turning points without spectral gaps. Along with this investigation, motivated by the success of geometric singular perturbation theory for zero-order approximations, the investigator will extend the theory for higher-order approximations which are crucial for both qualitative and quantitative purposes in applications. Another major component of this proposal concerns PNP systems. PNP systems serve as fundamental models for ion transport in semi-conductors and through ion channels. They are nonlinear electro-diffusion systems that possess multiple time and space scales. In addition to their significant application values, PNP systems provide a rich source for a variety of challenging mathematical questions concerning the basic well-posedness problem, the existence and multiplicity of steady-state solutions, the complexity of their asymptotic behavior, et cetera. The investigator and his collaborators have obtained a number of important results for PNP systems. The success depends heavily on the discovery of the intrinsic structure of PNP systems. The investigator proposes to conduct a systematic study of PNP systems. This activity will enhance the theoretical understanding of this important class of multi-scale systems.<br/><br/>The proposed study on Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) systems is motivated by direct applications to transmembrane ion channels of cells. Understanding the biological function of ion channels is critical to human health. In fact, specific defects of relative channels are the underlying causes of many health problems, and a large fraction of all drugs work directly on ion channels. The validity of PNP systems for modeling ion channel properties has been carefully examined. PNP systems have been studied numerically to a great extent, and the results have demonstrated excellent agreement with experimental data in many cases. There is, however, a serious need for a better understanding of PNP systems through mathematical analysis. The investigator and his collaborators will focus on biologically relevant mathematical problems of PNP systems; for example, the current-voltage relations from which the permeation and selectivity of channels can be extracted, the ""gating"" phenomena that are critical for auto-controlling of biological signal propagation, and the effect of mutating permanent charges on channel properties. The study of PNP systems will ultimately advance our knowledge of ion channels, suggest effective and efficient lab designs, and provide fundamental mechanisms for producing better drugs.<br/>"

Since the available results for the solutions of stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motions are very limited, the investigation of explicit solutions of multidimensional bilinear equations and the existence and uniqueness of solutions of nonlinear equations is proposed. The explicit solutions for bilinear equations requires a combination of Lie theory and stochastic analysis and the explicit solutions provide an important method for solving various stochastic problems for bilinear equations. These stochastic differential equations should provide useful models for many physical phenomena. The stochastic optimal control of multidimensional linear systems driven by fractional Brownian motions and a quadratic cost functional for a finite time interval is proposed. Furthermore this controlled system with an ergodic cost is also proposed for study. In both cases the optimal control uses a prediction of the increments of a fractional Brownian motion. The ergodic control problem is the natural setting for an adaptive control problem for these linear systems. The adaptive control problem requires the identification of the unknown parameters of the linear system and the construction of a self-optimizing adaptive control. Some parameter identification schemes are proposed such as a weighted pseudo least squares algorithm to obtain strongly consistent estimators of the parameters.<br/><br/>The proposal describes the investigation of some stochastic models that use a family of stochastic processes called fractional Brownian motions which arose empirically in a model for the rainfall along the Nile River. The potential usage of these processes has been demonstrated for economic data, telecommunications, device noise, and medicine. To have useful stochastic models with fractional Brownian motions it is necessary to have information about the solutions of the equations. This is one goal of the proposal. Many stochastic models are also controlled and with a cost criterion an optimal control is sought. In the research some control problems for linear systems with a quadratic cost functional will be studied. Often some parameters of the system are unknown and it is also required to control the system. These problems require that the parameters are identified and a control is determined based on the estimates of the parameters. Such problems with controlled linear systems and fractional Brownian motion will be investigated.<br/>"

In fact, modern society's need for analysis of temporal evolution of complex spatial systems far outpaces the technological, engineering and mathematical advances made so far. Spatial structures encountered in actual practice are often nontrivial due to long memory, or due to presence of ""rough"" geometrical constraints, and the existing analytical tools fail to describe spatio-temporal evolution of such systems, making solution of necessary parameter estimation and prediction problems very challenging. This project addresses some of these challenges and focuses on the analysis of continuous stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures. More specifically, the research will deal with the following major areas: 1. Analysis of multiparameter Volterra random fields (this includes construction of strong/weak martingale transforms generating the same natural filtration as the Volterra field, study of integrated Volterra kernels with respect to non-Gaussian martingales, analysis of Volterra random fields with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces, development of efficient simulation techniques for Volterra multiparameter fields); 2. Development of stochastic calculus with respect to Volterra random fields and the study of local time for Volterra processes; 3. <br/>Analysis of stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields (including the study of parabolic SPDEs perturbed by Volterra-type noise, analysis of stochastic evolution equations arising in nonlinear filtering of random fields when the observation noise has Volterra structure, representations and construction of suboptimal filters in that setting, development of numerical techniques for ``denoising"" of images with long-memory spatial structure. Stochastic evolution equations arising from systems of interacting randomly moving particles, which are subject to Volterra-type noises, will also be studied. 4. Inference for evolution equations driven by Volterra fields (estimation of coefficients when the Volterra kernel is known, plus estimation of parameters of the Volterra kernel itself). The results are expected to be useful in a wide variety of complex spatial systems, as they evolve in time. The project has a substantial nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of settings where image/video ``denoising"" is important. These range from tracking hurricanes via satellites to medical procedures involving analysis of spatial data streams that are recorded and transmitted by various devices.<br/><br/>Everyday we are surrounded by complex systems and are awash in spatial data. The importance of analysis and modelling of spatial phenomena is growing with the increasing use of remote-sensing images and video-streams arising in such diverse areas as geological and astrophysical sciences, climatology, biomedical applications and studies of population dynamics. Specific applications include Mobile-commerce industry (location based services), NASA's study of climatological effects of El Nino, land-use classification and global warming using satellite imagery, analysis of evolution of stars and galaxies via remote and Earth-based telescopes, studies by National Institute of Health on predicting spread of disease and epidemic control, not to mention ``routine"" analysis of traffic and infrastructure trends on the basis of specialized maps, which represent noisy ``snapshots"" of the state of complex spatial dynamical system taken at particular points in time. The use of random fields, which allow to take into account spatial interactions among variables in complex systems, is an increasingly important tool used in numerous problems of statistical mechanics, spatial statistics, neural network modelling, and others. At the same time many of the above real-life applications lack mathematically convenient Markov and martingale (spatial) structures, making the majority of available analytical tools inadequate. This project aims to address these challenges and to develop a theory of stochastic evolution equations driven by a large class of random fields, called Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures and allow for a wide range of (both, long and short) memory and pathwise properties. The project also has a significant nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of scientific and commercial settings where spatial filtering and image and video denoising are important. The research results emanating from this grant aim to advance the current state-of-the-art in stochastic analysis and will promote use of probabilistic methods among scientists in other areas. This encourages interaction between researchers with varying backgrounds and ultimately leads to new ideas, techniques and conclusions in each of those fields. For example, complex media, with its important applications and underlying microscopic processes, is typically linked to long-term memory, long-range interactions and non-Markovian kinetics. Some of the examples of the latter include processes in systems of many coupled elements, colloidal aggregates and chemical reaction medium, porous media, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, plasma physics, magnetosphere and many other fields. The project also has a substantial educational component."

Indeed, the motivating problem of the semiclassical limit of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation with general smooth but nonanalytic initial data remains one of the most important open problems in applied analysis, and the tools developed as part of this project will directly address this problem and other similar ones.  Furthermore, while the basic aim of the project is the development of methods of analysis, the methods will also be applied to several specific integrable equations and also to open problems beyond the field of nonlinear waves.  For example, we intend to apply specialized asymptotic methods developed in the context of nonlinear wave theory to the problem of the asymptotic analysis (in the bulk scaling limit) of the correlation functions of the normal random matrix model, with its coincident connections to the theory of Laplacian growth (also known as Hele-Shaw flow) and conformal mapping.  Many of the problems addressed as part of this project have a universal character, arising in the modeling of diverse physical phenomena, and it follows that analytical techniques applicable to these problems have far-reaching consequences.

The second project will look at the resilience of networks to the failure of network nodes, a topic that has direct applications in communications networks such as the Internet as well as in the theory of the spread of disease through social networks.  The project will look in particular at the resilience created by the existence of multiple independent paths in networks and the related graph theoretical concept of k-components.  The third project will focus on the development of exploratory analysis methods for discovering structure in large network data sets in an unsupervised fashion, making use of machine learning and statistical techniques.

The Internet, the World Wide Web, online social networks, and the biological networks that power living cells are just a few of the examples that have grabbed headlines in the last few years.  The research funded under this grant focuses on the development of both fundamental new mathematics and practical computer methods for understanding and analyzing the wealth of network data that is becoming available to scientists.  A significant problem with our current understanding of networks is created by the sheer size of many of the networks we are faced with.  The web, for example, has nodes numbering in the billions, and a complete visualization of the entire network is impossible with current resources (and probably wouldn't be very useful even if it were possible).  The techniques to be developed here focus on answering the question of what a network ""looks like,"" even when we can't look at it directly.  One project will focus on ""modules"" in networks -- groups of tightly connected nodes, which may correspond to cliques or communities in a social network or functional modules in a biological network -- and will develop computer methods for automatically discovering these modules, allowing the experimenter to uncover the large-scale structure of a network.  Another project will look at resilience of networks to the failure of their nodes, an issue that is of prime importance for the maintenance of functioning communication networks and is also related to the development of efficient vaccination strategies to prevent the spread of disease over social networks.  A third project will develop automated methods for revealing hitherto unseen regularities in the connection patterns between nodes, allowing scientists to extract useful information from network data even in emerging areas where our current understanding is very incomplete.<br/>"

The specific problems are motivated by several key issues in astrophysics, in particular, the analysis of the dynamics of dark matter halos, galactic bulges, and extra-solar planetary systems. At the same time, this project will undertake new research directions concerning several classic problems of current interest in applied mathematics, including the analysis of the stochastically forced Hill's equation, analysis of the asymptotics of the eigenvalues of random matrices, and the dynamics of particles in non-Newtonian potentials.  The proposal consists of three interrelated parts. The first pertains to the analysis of orbital instabilities that arise in the dynamics of test particles in extended mass distributions such as dark matter halos.  Our analysis leads to a stochastically forced Hill's equation which can be studied by analyzing infinite products of random matrices. The second part discusses the role of turbulence in extra-solar planetary systems and leads to the study of stochastic pendulum problems. The long term dynamics of these systems can also be described by a discrete map with random parameters.  The final part considers the phenomenon of tidal stripping in dark matter halos. This work involves the study of orbits of small halos as they fall into larger ones, including dynamical friction and its effects on orbital dynamics. Here, the overarching goal is to understand the nearly universal form found for the matter density profiles, and in particular how they are affected by smaller halos being assimilated into larger structures.<br/><br/>The field of astrophysics has experienced an unprecedented number of observational discoveries and theoretical breakthroughs in the past decade. These discoveries include super-massive black holes in galactic centers, the accelerating universe, measurement of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, extra-solar planets, and brown dwarfs.  The observational progress has been made possible through technological innovations, including detectors, telescopes, and spacecraft. Much of the theoretical progress has taken place through numerical simulations, which in turn have benefited from the ever-growing capabilities of computers.  Unfortunately, however, the third pillar of this science --- the analytic understanding of these newly discovered astronomical objects and physical phenomena --- is lagging behind. One of the difficulties associated with analytic work in this area is the enormous complexity of the astrophysical systems under study. In particular, chaotic dynamics and sensitive dependence on initial conditions arise in many contexts and render it difficult to make progress through the traditional analytic methods used by astrophysicists. However, the development and application of new mathematical tools, as proposed herein, will facilitate progress on these astrophysical issues, and will be useful in many additional applications.  This project will have educational impacts on several fronts, including the training of graduate students, the education of graduates and undergraduates, and reaching out to the general population through public lectures.<br/>"

Such equations describe wave propagation in situations when signals travel at finite speed, e.g. acoustics, electromagnetism, compressible fluids, ... etc. The first set of problems concerns nonlinear internal layers. Such layers represent waves which have wave fronts occupying a very thin region about a smooth surface in space time. The wave front separates regions where the values of the solution are quite different. The examples of propagating flame fronts and reaction fronts give the idea. The mathematical results will lead to algorithms for approximations whose error tends to zero as the width decreases. The problem proposed is the behavior of planar layers at times which are large relative to the reciprocal of the width. One expects to see diffractive effects and there are virtually no known mathematical results for this type for layers. It is likely that there will be analogous results for weakly dissipative boundary layers. The second problems concern Berenger?s perfectly matched layer algorithms for the computation of wave propagation in unbounded domains. Careful analysis indicates that the layers are not perfectly matched. The detailed analysis of this phenomenon and its consequences is important given the wide use of these methods. The third family of problems concern situations where stability estimates are derived with the aid of pseudodifferential operators. Such operators spread supports which makes them seemingly inappropriate for the study of supports. The project proposes the study of sharp finite speed and uniqueness of the Cauchy problem at space like hypersurfaces for symmetrizable hyperbolic systems. Finally the propagation of short wavelength waves through perturbed periodic media will be studied when the period and wavelength are of comparable size. The interest is in propagation for long distances on which diffractive effects are expected to take place.<br/><br/>This research project addresses questions that arise in mathematical models for wave propagation phenomena, i.e. physical situations in which signals can travel at finite speed and interact with one another and with the medium that they traverse. Such signals can take the form of wave fronts (such as the spherical light flash from a camera, sound waves made by clapping hands, or a flame front in a combustion engine) or of rays (as in optics), among others. There is a common class of mathematical models for such phenomena that has been employed very successfully in applications as diverse as chemical engineering, the design and use of radar equipment and ultrasound transceivers, computer graphics, and fiber optics. There are four parts to this project. The first will add to the understanding of models for wave fronts that interact. The second part will examine a very widely used computational method for wave phenomena in unbounded spatial regions (e.g. radar signals bouncing off a plane) and try to explain some anomalies that make this method less reliable than is generally assumed. In the third part, the proposer will establish that a wide class of models does indeed exhibit the finite signal speed in all possible situations.

The main principle of CT is based on transmitting a cone beam of x-rays through the patient from various directions. This is achieved by moving the x-ray source along some trajectory. For each source position a detector measures the intensity of the beam as it exits the patient. Then the data are inverted according to a mathematical algorithm. Prime examples of cone beam CT are helical and C-arm scanning. At present, cardiac imaging is arguably the most important challenge facing CT. Mathematically the difficulty of image reconstruction in this case comes from the fact that the object being scanned changes with time. Thus, for each source position the projection data corresponds to a different object. In this project the PI plans to concentrate on the following three directions: 1) Development of exact and efficient reconstruction algorithms for multi-source helical CT; 2) Development of exact and efficient reconstruction algorithms for the types of source trajectories used in C-arms; and 3) Development of local tomography algorithms for dynamic and motion compensated CT. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity will be the development of new reconstruction algorithms for cone beam CT and deeper understanding of the mathematics involved in reconstructing objects that change during the scan. It is expected that the broader impacts will include improved quality of cardiac imaging, potentially resulting in replacing an invasive diagnostic tool with a non-invasive one. The obtained results can also be used in other medical applications, such as nuclear medicine and Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy. <br/>"

In particular, we will study three general problems: (i) Direct problems of partially polarized light in tissues,<br/>(ii) Inverse problems for reflectance optical tomography, and (iii) Parameter identification and estimation for reflectance optical spectroscopy. These three problems involve a broad variety of mathematics research in numerical analysis and scientific computing, asymptotic analysis, and inverse problems.

The first part of the project is a study of fluid-fluid interfaces which, on small scales, are dominated by surface tension. Such flows are relevant to the dynamics of emulsions, bubbles, drops and micro-fluidic devices. Highly accurate numerical simulations will be employed to describe the dynamics of drops merging or forced through micro-pipes. A novel approach to direct simulations of spatially varying surface tension will be presented. The simulations will be used to explore the potential of Marangoni flows to generate mixing in micro-drops. The second part of the project is concerned with interactions between small solid particles and their surrounding fluid, which are determinant in a variety of natural systems such as rivers, oceans, and the atmosphere. Numerical simulations will explore the mechanism by which particulate matter is eroded by an overlying fluid.  The capacity of settling particles to transport heat in an advective rather than diffusive manner, without generating large scale fluid motion, will also be examined.  The overall goal is to develop tools to investigate these complex physical systems and extract a fundamental understanding of basic phenomena at play in multiphase flows.<br/><br/><br/>The research described in this proposal will be conducted at Merced, the newest campus (opened in 2005) of the University of California. It is the only research university of the Central Valley, and the student body is both diverse and traditionally under-represented at the university level. This project will provide research opportunities to both undergraduate and graduate students.  The first topic studied involves the interaction of liquids and gases with other liquids, as is the case in drops and bubbles. Special emphasis will be placed on obtaining an understanding of the behavior of drops in the presence of temperature variations in ?lab-on-a- chip? systems, which allow controlled reactions to be studied on the micron scale. A second field of study will be the interaction of fluids with small solid particles, such as sand and sediments. The mechanism by which fluid flow can erode deposited particles, and the capacity of settling particles to affect heat transport will be investigated in detail. Broadly applicable new techniques will be developed to simulated these systems accurately and efficiently.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The principal investigator recently developed a consistent formulation of electromagnetic theory, incorporating intrinsic spin of particles, that is consistent at both classical and quantum levels. The current project investigates possible singularity formation in this theory.  Another part of this work examines finite-time collapse in the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell model.  Such collapse would provide a novel mechanism for the formation of very small celestial bodies whose gravitational self-attraction is too weak to aid in their formation.

The optical phenomenon in this case is well described by geometrical optics. The second problem arises in the design of optical devices that exploit photonic bandgap phenomena. In this problem, the wavelength of light is about the same size as the structure, and calls for modeling of the light's propagation using Maxwell's equation. In both cases, the design problem may be posed as an inverse problem where the desired performance can be viewed as data and the design parameters as unknowns.  The aim of this research is to use analytical tools to guide in the development of effective computational methods to solve these inverse problems.<br/><br/>Many people over 45 years old suffer a condition called presbyopia, which is the loss of the ability of the eye to focus on near objects. Progressive lenses, which correct for seeing both far and near objects, are often prescribed to presbyopia patients. The design of such lenses, taking into account the patient's need and the comfort, is a mathematical problem that involves optics, differential geometry, and optimization. The dream of creating optical computers that have the capability of high processing speeds requires the development of optical devices that are counterparts of electronic devices. The design of optical devices requires modeling of light propagation in complex nanostructures, which can be described by partial differential equations.  In order to create devices that perform certain functions, it is necessary to solve a mathematical problem of optimal design. The unifying theme in the design of these two optical devices is the mathematics of inverse problems. The research to be carried out will help create lenses of unprecedented performance and optical computing subsystems for future optical computers.<br/>"

Turing-like patterns are spatially periodic and stationary structures that emerge in a self-organized fashion. Typical contexts are reaction-diffusion settings, but also various convection experiments, or nonlinear optical feedback systems. We propose a systematic investigation of perturbations of Turing patterns, bifurcations from Turing patterns, and defects embedded in Turing patterns. We will aim at model-independent descriptions whenever possible, emphasizing topological and geometric intersection theory rather than explicit solutions. Some specific problems are the existence of dislocations in Turing patterns, symmetry-breaking bifurcations from Turing patterns, inhomogeneities and parameter ramps, and connections with Liesegang structures.<br/><br/>Self-organized, regular patterns are striking when they appear in nature, in sand dunes, and on animal coats. They also carry great technological potential when exploited in manufacturing processes at nanoscales. In both cases, one would like to understand when and how regular structures form, and at which characteristic scale. We plan to study those questions using geometric and topological tools in the analysis. Those tools can shed light on the role of inhomogeneities and defects in the selection of patterns in situations where precise models and parameter values are unavailable. Ultimately, we would like to understand those self-organized pattern formation processes from macroscopic, universal principles that are largely independent of the underlying detailed microscopic processes."

Of interest are collapse events, that is, spatial contractions of solutions to single points in finite time. Individual collapse events are now well understood, and this work will study collapse turbulence, that is, solutions that exhibit random distributions of collapse events. For this purpose, the equation has to be regularized, since solutions cannot be continued beyond a complete collapse. One of the issues to be studied then is the dependence of solutions on the choice of regularization. It is conjectured that this regularization will only have a moderate effect on collapse turbulence, and this conjecture will be studied in this project. There is a general framework for the statistical study of turbulence in the context of the equations of fluid dynamics that goes back to Kolmogorov, and this work will place collapse turbulence of solutions of the NLS in this general framework. The topic is very suitable for graduate training, and students will be supported and exposed to work done by research groups at other universities and at national laboratories.<br/><br/>The nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS), which describes the nonlinear interaction of waves over time, is a universal model in nonlinear science. It occurs in the description of laser fusion, in fiber optics, and in models for rogue waves in oceanography. Stable moving waves (such as rogue waves or light pulses) are called solitons, and the spontaneous emergence of individual solitons in solutions of the NLS is now well understood. This work will study situations where such solitons appear randomly and unpredictably, but still following statistical patterns. The work done with this award will contribute to the understanding of these statistical patterns. This phenomenon is similar to turbulent fluid flow, which is also characterized by unpredictability that occurs with a statistical pattern.

In short, a frame is an (over)complete set of vectors<br/>that gives stable expansions.  Previous works have measured the<br/>error correction capabilities of frames with means derived from<br/>geometric or functional analytic formulations.

The project focuses in particular on the ways oscillatory and other complex dynamical behavior, such as heteroclinic cycles and chaotic dynamics, can be forced by the network architecture. Many physical, electrical and biological systems can be modeled by networks of interacting differential equations and maps. Models of this type, which can involve a mix of continuous and discrete dynamical systems, possibly with time delays and filters, are called hybrid systems. A high priority of the project is the development of a mathematical theory of hybrid systems, with a special focus on engineering and computer applications. The project will use mathematical techniques originally developed for the study of symmetric dynamical systems, work on statistical and stochastic properties of dynamical systems, and develop new methods for the construction of relatively simple dynamical systems (modules) which satisfy specified dynamical and structural properties.<br/><br/>Systems of coupled differential equations are used as models in a wide range of physical applications such as neuronal networks, speciation, gene dynamics, arrays of Josephson junctions, and mechanical, electrical and computer systems.

The theory of multi-dimensional conservation laws is in its infancy, and this analysis of Riemann problems is a first step that will indicate the types of singularities that arise in multi-dimensional systems.  Recent numerical simulations have presented evidence of unexpectedly singular behavior at the formation points of Mach stems.  These studies call for analytical confirmation, and insight will be gained from simple prototype examples.  In the self-similar approach, the systems change type -- hyperbolic far from the origin (""supersonic flow"") and of mixed hyperbolic-elliptic type near the origin (""subsonic region"").  Analysis of the subsonic solution gives rise to free boundary problems in mixed-type partial differential equations with mixed boundary conditions (Dirichlet and oblique derivative).  Earlier work solved such free boundary problems locally near shock reflection points, but only for one simple interaction (regular reflection) and only for simplified systems (where the elliptic equation decoupled from the hyperbolic system).  The current project will develop new techniques for the more complicated problems that arise when the boundary condition is not uniformly oblique, and when the equations in the subsonic system do not decouple.  Finally, study of a prototype example of diverging rarefactions problems will shed light on singular Mach stem formation points.  <br/><br/>Conservation laws model fundamental problems in aerodynamics and continuum mechanics.  Better understanding has consequences in real world applications.  For example, the large-scale numerical simulations that form the basis of weather and climate prediction and of nuclear reactor safety analysis are based on partial differential equations in the form of conservation laws.  Theoretical advances, particularly in the analysis of singular behavior, will find their way into making numerical codes more efficient and more reliable.  In carrying out this research, the investigators will build on success in introducing beginning researchers, including members of groups underrepresented in mathematics, to the theory of conservation laws, and in expanding their career horizons.<br/>"

This information is needed for the development of good algorithms for the computation of these fields or flows -- and should have wide applicability for the numerical modeling of devices and equipment.<br/><br/>Mathematically, these div-curl systems are over-determined systems of equations that only have solutions when certain compatibility conditions hold -- and often require extra data in addition to standard boundary conditions.

They sometimes are known to experts on these subjects, but their statements have previously only been vaguely stated, since the precise versions require considerable geometrical and analytical detail. They have been carefully described in recent papers of the PI and his collaborators. This proposal is to support the implementation, and further development, of these results in some models that arise in applications. The proposed research will use the variational characterization of the solutions to obtain sharp results about the finite energy solutions of these systems in a number of important geometrical situations. We also intend to investigate the development of good methods for the numerical approximation of the solutions in various different geometrical configurations. A particular interest will be the analysis of the solution of certain models of ferromagnetic bodies and electrostatic discharges.<br/>"

While the list of molecular systems that exhibit oscillations is growing, the grasp of the common principles is challenged by the variety of underlying network structures. The presence of negative feedback is the only feature shared by all oscillatory networks; beyond this each system seems to be unique.  The goal is to formulate a common principle that is shared by all oscillatory networks.  It is expressed in terms of broad tendencies of the dynamics, rather then the detailed structure of the supporting networks.  Cells constantly communicate with their environment and their neighbors.  This mutual communication often results in synchronization of their behavior.  A theory will be developed to explain synchronization of periodic signals in cell communities.  The synchronization of biochemical oscillators will be studied via the nearest neighbor coupling, and the coupling with a communally produced and sensed molecule.<br/><br/>A recent unprecedented explosion in our knowledge of structure and function of genetic regulatory networks promises revolutionary changes in how human disease is viewed and treated.  Many biological processes ranging from the cell cycle to the human 24 hour circadian rhythm are periodic in time. This periodicity is driven by oscillations in the concentration of chemicals in individual cells.  In many cases these signals synchronize across populations and the periodic signal can be detected on a macroscopic level.  The regulatory networks that are responsible for production and maintenance of these rhythms are being discovered every day.  While the structures of these networks vary, they often produce similar periodic signals.  This project will study the underlying broad dynamics principles behind the oscillations, emphasizing the function of the network over its implementation.  Further, it will study synchronization of the periodic rhythms in population of cells.  The lack of synchronization in the population can result in developmental and functional defects.  This project will develop a theory that will be able to predict collective dynamics, as well as suggest repair mechanisms in the case of failure.<br/>"

Investigations of small-scale structures are important because they are inextricably related to the asymptotic behavior of the system -- a central theme in the theory of dynamical systems with numerous important applications. We plan to investigate numerically and theoretically the global organization among the scaling exponents for different transitions to complex behavior -- a new phenomenon noticed recently in the numerical studies of the PI and his collaborators. We propose a theoretical explanation of some of these phenomena that is based on the renormalization group description. While most research on applications of renormalization to dynamical systems focuses on the asymptotic behavior of the renormalization operator around a particular fixed point, we believe that the methodology proposed by the PI and his collaborators will lead to new insights about the global behavior of the renormalization operator. Other projects that we propose to pursue are related to quasiperiodically forced systems (in particular, the classical and quantum effects in resonators with moving boundaries) and small-scale properties of some physical systems and critical dynamical objects.<br/><br/>This is a proposal for research in mathematical physics and applied mathematics that focuses on small-scale structures in dynamical systems. The proposed research will deepen our understanding of the dynamics of the renormalization operator and may spur new research in areas where renormalization group description plays an important role -- dynamical systems, statistical physics, fluid dynamics, field theory, solid state physics. The project will further our knowledge about some physical phenomena and the general properties of critical dynamical systems. The project is truly interdisciplinary -- it will employ methods of applied analysis, techniques for high-accuracy numerical computations, and methods of theoretical physics, and will stimulate the interaction between experts in different areas of mathematics and science. It will involve undergraduate and graduate students majoring in mathematics and physics, offering them opportunities to gain knowledge and skills useful in their career paths, whether within or outside of academia."

The methods to be used will combine harmonic analysis tools and classical techaniques for the Navier-Stokes equations. In addition, it is planned to study  global attractors of the 3D NSE and related models, such as the dyadic (a.k.a. shell) models of turbulence. The study of the structure of the global attractor is essential for a better understanding of turbulent phenomena. Due to the lack of a uniqueness proof, it is not known whether the 3D NSE possesses a semigroup of solution operators, and consequently a classical theory of semiflows cannot be used for this system. It is proposed to continue developing a theory of global attractors for an evolutionary system, which is a generalization of a dynamical system that can be applied in this situation.<br/><br/>This award will support research on some fundamental open questions concerning the equations of fluid motion. The equations were introduced almost two centuries ago but are still not well understood mathematically. Even though the equations are broadly used by physicists and engineers for real-life applications, the existence and uniqueness of (classical) solutions is still not known. An answer to this question is expected to shed light on fundamental issues related to turbulence.  Turbulence, often referred to as the last unsolved problem in classical physics, is a fundamental phenomenon occurring in fluid flows around airplane bodies, vehicles, ships, and blades of turbines. A better mathematical understanding of turbulence will result in improvements in the design of these objects."

The weak nonlinearity allows one to obtain a natural closure of the BBGKY hierarchy of the Fourier space moment equations which includes a kinetic equation which describes how the wavenumber density is redistributed throughout the spectrum by resonances. These equations have especially relevant finite flux solutions (Kolmogorov-Zakharov or KZ) which capture how conserved densities such as energy flow from sources to sinks. What makes Wave Turbulence an open problem is that these KZ solutions are almost never uniformly valid at all scales and so one is left with the challenge of finding out what happens in the regions of wavenumber space where they break down. The work in this proposal continues the authors' efforts to fill in these missing gaps and to make the theory complete. This is not an easy task because once breakdown occurs, the new states may contain strongly nonlinear coherent structures. In particular, we are working on the problem of condensation and whitecap formation. <br/><br/>Wave turbulence is about understanding the statistics of systems of waves. Imagine the sea surface after a storm. There are waves of all wavelengths, travelling in all directions. It is absolutely remarkable that one can, over a large range of scales, say what the longtime energy spectrum looks like. The energy spectrum is a graph showing how much energy there is in waves of different lengths and different directions. Even though the initial graph may reflect how the sea is first excited, the sea, because of resonances between waves of different wavelengths and directions, relaxes to a statistically steady universal state called the Kolmogorov-Zakharov or KZ spectrum. But not quite. If the storm is strong enough, at the smaller scales, the statistics of the sea surface is not described by the KZ spectrum. In fact, an observer will see that the more stormy the sea is, the higher the density of whitecaps (locally breaking waves which combine air and water into a frothy emulsion). The challenge is to find out what replaces the KZ spectrum at these small scales. We are developing a new theory of this behavior. In connection with this work, we are also interested in a phenomenon which has been known by mariners for centuries but which only now is being studied, the sudden emergence of freak waves in an otherwise relatively placid sea<br/>"

In particular the PI seeks to characterize the classes of defects that appear when one is far above the parameter threshold at which patterns emerge. These issues are studied through a non-convex variational problem known as the regularized Cross-Newell (RCN) model. Unlike similar models that have been studied recently, RCN incorporates features of non-trivial twist which enable the existence of a richer ?taxonomy? of defects (in particular, concave and convex disclinations). Such features are indeed seen in experiments and numerical simulations of the underlying microscopic physical equations. The issue has been to determine whether or not the variational model can capture these defects. In a recent work the PI has demonstrated that the minimizers of a variational model with twist must necessarily differ from those without twist. The main projects of this proposal are centered on establishing a precise analytical characterization of the competition between microstructure formation and overall topologically induced energetic stress in versions of the RCN model having some geometric symmetry. <br/><br/>The study of pattern forming systems is a fundamental area of scientific investigation in which the tools of modern mathematical analysis can be brought to bear on the modeling of physical systems especially near a critical transition in the behavior of the system. For the projects studied in this proposal one is principally interested in patterns that arise when a continuous translational symmetry is reduced, at a critical threshold, to a discrete periodic symmetry resulting in what is often referred to as a ""striped"" pattern. Such patterns are for instance generic in Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC) which is a principal theoretical model for the formation of weather patterns. In RBC the striped pattern corresponds to the formation, at a critical temperature, of periodic ""convection rolls"" of a uniform characteristic width. A major goal of this research is to study not just the patterns that form at a critical threshold but to characterize the types of defects that arise in these patterns when one is far from threshold. This work will make definite predictions on defect formation that can be tested in the laboratory. This will have relevance for modeling defect structure in liquid crystals, in animal coat patterns (including fingerprints) and in the evolution of plant patterns. <br/>"

The investigator will incorporate topological tools, such as algebraic topology and Conley index theory, in computations on the finite representation to detect and prove the existence of dynamics for the original system.<br/><br/><br/>Dynamical systems models are being used throughout society.  Some examples include weather models used for hurricane prediction and population models used to study environmental effects on population size and persistence.  Currently, many researchers study dynamical systems like these using high powered computer simulations and statistical techniques.  On the other end of the spectrum, mathematicians have been able to decipher highly complicated dynamics in more abstract mathematical models.  The work described in this proposal aims to serve as a bridge between these two approaches.  More specifically, the investigator and her collaborators focus on the development of computational techniques that use sophisticated mathematical tools and yield mathematically rigorous results.  The mathematical tools come from the fields of algebraic topology, analysis, numerical analysis, and dynamical systems theory and may be used to decipher some of the phenomena of interest in the studied systems.  Prior progress in studying complicated dynamics in models from population ecology and heat convection motivates these continued studies.<br/>"

The first is the development of max-plus based curse-of-dimensionality-free algorithms for solution of nonlinear deterministic optimal control problems, and the second is determination of fundamental solutions for ordinary and partial differential equations with quadratic nonlinearities. In the former, we rely on the max-plus linearity of the semigroup associated to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation associated with the control problem. In the latter, we develop new fundamental solutions and associated exponentially fast numerical methods for such equations, which are obtained through an exponentiation operation on an idempotent semiring.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with nonlinear optimal control, of which auto-pilots for air and space vehicles, stock portfolio management, and manufacturing control are examples.  Mathematical models of optimal control problems typically involve partial differential equations, whose solution must be obtained computationally. The difficulty is that the dimension of the space over which one must solve the equations is the dimension of the state of the system. For example, the absolutely simplest model of the motion of an object relies on a six-dimensional state vector, with three components describing position and three describing velocity.  Thus one would solve the partial differential equation over six-dimensional space. Realistic models typically have say ten or more dimensions. When one begins putting a grid over space, the number of points needed per dimension is on the order of 100. Consequently, to solve a partial differential equation in two dimensions one would need 10,000 grid points, and for three dimensions, 1,000,000 grid points. For a six-dimensional problem one requires a trillion grid points; this is the ""curse-of-dimensionality"" and it has been a severe obstacle to nonlinear control for over a half-century. We are developing methods for solution of such problems, and these methods are not subject to the curse-of-dimensionality. There is no free lunch, and there are other prices to be paid. Nonetheless, we are already solving problems which would have been intractable for many decades, even if Moore's law were to continue indefinitely. Further, this is just the beginning, and more major advances should follow.<br/>"

The objective is to achieve a better understanding of problems which are in the forefront of current research and to contribute to the solution of long-standing problems by synergetic collaboration of theory, modeling and numerics. To this end, this Focus Research Group (FRG) will provide a platform, led by leading researchers from Universities of Maryland, Brown, Iowa State, Wisconsin-Madison, Arizona State, Austin-Texas and Toulouse, France, who will merge their expertise in the construction, analysis and implementation of kinetic descriptions for a selected suite of problems with crossing scales from quantum and micro scales to the macro scales. Topics to be discussed include kinetic descriptions of microscopic and quantum phenomena, and kinetic descriptions of macroscopic phenomena. As a recent novel example for the kinetic methodology we will use kinetic descriptions to study hyperbolic flows for complex supply chains. The theoretical and modeling aspects of this research program, on both microscopic and macroscopic scales, will be integrated with kinetic-based numerical methods for capturing ``smaller scales phenomena"". <br/><br/>The rationale behind this proposal is a timely effort to address several important issues in modern applied mathematics. Kinetic theories are not new. Yet, there have been many major developments in kinetic modeling, kinetic theories and related numerical methods, with the potential for a considerable impact on emerging new fields in physical and social sciences. The proposed effort will significantly strengthen the leading role that the US researchers can play in pursuing cutting-edge research and training a new generation of applied mathematicians in this important field. We expect this project to contribute to the development of scientific workforce by advanced training for doctoral and postdoctoral researchers and by providing a platform for interdisciplinary interactions with researchers from related disciplines. Internal and external interactions will be maintained through synergetic collaborations which will come to fruition during the three annual workshops to be held in Maryland (Year 1), France and Brown (Year 2), and Wisconsin (Year 3). International meetings will be held as part of a series of interdisciplinary workshops organized by the Center for Scientific Computation and Mathematical Modeling (CSCAMM) at the University of Maryland.

The focus of the Workshop is a set of problems brought by contributing participants from industry. These problems span a wide range of application areas, often in fluid and solid mechanics but also in mathematical biology, data analysis, and mathematical finance, among others. Work on the problems is done in vertically integrated teams consisting of the representatives from industry, senior and junior faculty, postdocs and graduate students. The main objective of the Workshop is to provide links between mathematicians at universities and scientists and engineers from industry for the mutual benefit of both sides.<br/><br/>The MPI Workshop has run for many years, starting at RPI in 1985, but now run at other universities as well, including the University of Delaware and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, among others. For the past four years, the educational mission of the Workshop has grown significantly with the introduction of the GSMM Camp, another NSF-supported program. This four-day meeting, held during the week preceding the Workshop, is designed to promote problem solving and scientific communication skills. At the Camp, graduate students work together in teams, with the guidance of invited faculty mentors, on interdisciplinary problems typically inspired by industrial applications. The problems span a wide range of areas of application, and are carefully selected to promote a broad set of problem-solving skills. Students from the Camp also attend the Workshop, and the combined program exposes graduate students to real-world problems of current scientific interest, and provides them with a valuable educational and career-enhancing experience outside of the traditional academic setting. The interdisciplinary program consisting of the MPI Workshop and GSMM Camp is unique amongst universities in the United States. The present collaborative proposal addresses several ways in which the program can be expanded to improve links with industry and to enhance the research and educational opportunities provided by the Workshop. This expansion involves increased participation in the Workshop amongst early-career mathematicians (upper-level graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty) and invited high-impact faculty with targeted expertise, and increased participation from new industries in emerging areas. Additional plans include dissemination of mathematical results from the Workshop at other national meeting, and seminars with industry to promote contacts for future Workshop participation. The expanded program will have a broad impact on the education and development of early-career mathematicians, and on the interdisciplinary research of participating faculty. The Workshop also promotes collaborations with industry and will have an impact on the development and analysis of new technologies in industry. The intellectual merit of the program centers around the problems considered at the Workshop. Many of these problems have led to follow up research and new mathematical results, and it is expected that this will continue to be an outcome of the expanded problem-solving experience.<br/>"

An improved numerical method will be designed for the combined motion of viscous fluid flow, governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, and a moving boundary which exerts a force on the fluid in<br/>response to its stretching.  The immersed boundary method of C. Peskin was developed for this prototype problem and has had a number of applications in biology.  In the new approach the interface is kept sharp and the method should be second-order accurate. The velocity will be found in two parts:  at each time the steady Stokes velocity, determined by the interfacial force,<br/>will be found either from singular integrals, as done in related work with J. Strain, or from a grid calculation such as the immersed interface method.  The remaining regular part of the velocity will be calculated on a rectangular grid using characteristics backward in time. The decomposition of the velocity allows effort to be concentrated at the interface, where it is most needed.  For initial development the moving interface will be represented by tracking particles, but the present approach can be combined with refined methods for interface motion such as Strain's semi-Lagrangian contouring.  Implicit versions of the method will be considered, to avoid time step limitations due to the interface motion. A graduate student will work on a related project dealing with the representation of surfaces.  In the second part of the work,<br/>estimates of maximum errors will be derived for finite difference methods for diffusion equations with discontinuities at interfaces, in which corrections are added to the differences near the interface, as in the immersed interface method of R. Leveque and Z. Li and related work of A. Mayo. Such methods allow treatment of general interfacial boundaries with the simplicity of a rectangular grid. An expected gain of accuracy in the solution relative to the truncation error will depend on the choice of discretization.  This choice will be investigated and proofs of accuracy will be given.<br/><br/>A number of scientific problems involve moving boundaries in fluids, such as a drop of one fluid in another, or the motion of an elastic membrane in living tissue.  Numerical study of such problems has special difficulties.  It is desirable to calculate fluid quantities at fixed points not depending on the current location of the moving boundary, but discontinuities in quantities across the boundary must be taken into account.  The aim in the first project is to improve such a method for a prototype model which has been applied to several biological problems.  Such improvement could extend the usefulness of numerical simulation in these problems since it would be inherently more accurate and therefore more efficient for large computations, especially<br/>in three dimensions.  The second project concerns analytical understanding and estimation of errors made when difference operators are used in the presence of boundaries, with resulting discontinuities. Such error estimates are needed to ensure the accuracy of approximations made in numerical simulation of fluid flow with moving boundaries using the immersed interface method or in the method developed here."

The MPI Workshop is a five-day meeting which attracts leading applied mathematicians, scientists and engineers from industry, universities and national laboratories. The focus of the Workshop is a set of problems brought by contributing participants from industry. These problems span a wide range of application areas, often in fluid and solid mechanics but also in mathematical biology, data analysis, and mathematical finance, among others. Work on the problems is done in vertically integrated teams consisting of the representatives from industry, senior and junior faculty, postdocs and graduate students. The main objective of the Workshop is to provide links between mathematicians at universities and scientists and engineers from industry for the mutual benefit of both sides.<br/><br/>The MPI Workshop has run for many years, starting at RPI in 1985, but now run at other universities as well, including the University of Delaware and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, among others. For the past four years, the educational mission of the Workshop has grown significantly with the introduction of the GSMM Camp, another NSF-supported program. This four-day meeting, held during the week preceding the Workshop, is designed to promote problem solving and scientific communication skills. At the Camp, graduate students work together in teams, with the guidance of invited faculty mentors, on interdisciplinary problems typically inspired by industrial applications. The problems span a wide range of areas of application, and are carefully selected to promote a broad set of problem-solving skills. Students from the Camp also attend the Workshop, and the combined program exposes graduate students to real-world problems of current scientific interest, and provides them with a valuable educational and career-enhancing experience outside of the traditional academic setting. The interdisciplinary program consisting of the MPI Workshop and GSMM Camp is unique amongst universities in the United States. The present collaborative proposal addresses several ways in which the program can be expanded to improve links with industry and to enhance the research and educational opportunities provided by the Workshop. This expansion involves increased participation in the Workshop amongst early-career mathematicians (upper-level graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty) and invited high-impact faculty with targeted expertise, and increased participation from new industries in emerging areas. Additional plans include dissemination of mathematical results from the Workshop at other national meeting, and seminars with industry to promote contacts for future Workshop participation. The expanded program will have a broad impact on the education and development of early-career mathematicians, and on the interdisciplinary research of participating faculty. The Workshop also promotes collaborations with industry and will have an impact on the development and analysis of new technologies in industry. The intellectual merit of the program centers around the problems considered at the Workshop. Many of these problems have led to follow up research and new mathematical results, and it is expected that this will continue to be an outcome of the expanded problem-solving experience.<br/>"

Such behavior has been of interest to engineers and physicists for at least a hundred years and has been a pressing concern of mathematicians working in fluids for at least half of that time. There is much practical knowledge about the boundary behavior, but little precise mathematical understanding. The proposal is to investigate the boundary behavior of the fluid in the limited setting of a two dimensional bounded domain, focusing on a disk, where important aspects of the analysis are simplified, but where the behavior is still physically relevant. The goal is to strengthen existing partial results concerning the boundary behavior of the fluid and to attempt to integrate the partially heuristic methods of engineers and physicists into a mathematical setting.<br/><br/>Many fluids have reasonably low viscosity and nearly all fluids are in contact with a boundary. How is the flow of blood affected by imperfections in vessel walls? How is the lift of a wing determined by its shape? How do a submarine's propellers induce turbulence when running at certain speeds? In all of these problems and many more the flow of the fluid can be constrained by the interaction of the fluid with the boundary in ways that are currently only partially understood. Almost any progress that can be made in the understanding of this interaction would ultimately be beneficial in addressing all of these problems, whether by giving better control on the error bounds in numerical computations, by giving a qualitative understanding of the interaction, or even by demonstrating that the boundary behavior is even more complex than is currently believed.<br/>"

The second component studies the inference of risk measures from market data. Under many standard financial models, good time-consistent convex risk measures are characterized by solutions of backward stochastic differential equations and quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), for which calibration is an inverse problem. The goal is design of asymptotic and numerical methods to translate market values of instruments contingent on extreme events into risk measures.  The third component is to develop new models and algorithms for valuing and managing credit risk. The class of top-down models is a convenient macroscopic description of the number of defaults, and our study involves asymptotics for wave-type PDEs with random coefficients. The relationship with constituent bottom-up (microscopic) models needs to be understood, and the challenge is to design effective approximations to pass between the two levels of detail.<br/><br/>This research project develops mathematical and computational tools for understanding and modeling credit risk and volatilities in extreme regimes, and seeks to construct appropriate risk measures. The broad goal is better quantitative assessment and management of market volatility and default risk, especially in times of heavy turmoil like the present.

In the area of economics of global warming, where most of the models and large scale simulation programs are deterministic, there is still a strong resistance to the introduction of probabilistic thinking. Poor regulation and a lack of understanding of the stochasticity of the risks involved, have contributed to embarrassing public policy faux pas in previous emissions market designs. By developing new tools and strategies within the realm of stochastic analysis, and by showing how they can be brought to bear on the regulation of emissions markets, the results of this research will help educate the future scientists about what financial markets can and cannot do, and policy makers and regulators about what equilibrium models can explain and justify. By focusing on stochastic models which have traditionally remained off the radar screen of practitioners and policy makers, it will raise the level of awareness for the power of probabilistic modeling in a wide range of domains."

One of the issues to be studied then is the dependence of solutions on the choice of regularization. It is conjectured that this regularization will only have a moderate effect on collapse turbulence, and this conjecture will be studied in this project. There is a general framework for the statistical study of turbulence in the context of the equations of fluid dynamics that goes back to Kolmogorov, and this work will place collapse turbulence of solutions of the NLS in this general framework.

This work will study situations where such solitons appear randomly and unpredictably, but still following statistical patterns. The work done with this award will contribute to the understanding of these statistical patterns. This phenomenon is similar to turbulent fluid flow, which is also characterized by unpredictability that occurs with a statistical pattern.

The Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are very challenging mathematically because the particular nature of their nonlinearity.<br/>This project addresses some of the nonlinear phenomena that arise in the fluid equations, particularly those connected with the limit of vanishing viscosity. So called ""shell models"" are studied: these are composed of an infinite system of nonlinearly coupled ordinary differential equations which, although less complex than the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations retain certain important features of their nonlinearity. It has been shown in previous NSF-supported work that the inviscid model behaves precisely as Onsager conjectured for a turbulent fluid. In the project that will be supported by this award, it is proposed to prove Kolmogorov's ""law"" for the viscous model, namely that the average dissipation rate of the viscous system stays positive and converges to the average turbulent dissipation rate in the vanishing viscosity limit. Another line of research concerns instabilities in fluid motion, and the interrelation between linear and nonlinear instability in the vanishing viscosity limit.<br/><br/>The mathematical study of the differential equations that model fluid motion forms an essential foundation for many applications, such as oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics and engineering. An issue of particular importance is the behaviour of turbulent fluids.

The focus of the Workshop is a set of problems brought by contributing participants from industry. These problems span a wide range of application areas, often in fluid and solid mechanics but also in mathematical biology, data analysis, and mathematical finance, among others. Work on the problems is done in vertically integrated teams consisting of the representatives from industry, senior and junior faculty, postdocs and graduate students. The main objective of the Workshop is to provide links between mathematicians at universities and scientists and engineers from industry for the mutual benefit of both sides.<br/><br/>The MPI Workshop has run for many years, starting at RPI in 1985, but now run at other universities as well, including the University of Delaware and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, among others. For the past four years, the educational mission of the Workshop has grown significantly with the introduction of the GSMM Camp, another NSF-supported program. This four-day meeting, held during the week preceding the Workshop, is designed to promote problem solving and scientific communication skills. At the Camp, graduate students work together in teams, with the guidance of invited faculty mentors, on interdisciplinary problems typically inspired by industrial applications. The problems span a wide range of areas of application, and are carefully selected to promote a broad set of problem-solving skills. Students from the Camp also attend the Workshop, and the combined program exposes graduate students to real-world problems of current scientific interest, and provides them with a valuable educational and career-enhancing experience outside of the traditional academic setting. The interdisciplinary program consisting of the MPI Workshop and GSMM Camp is unique amongst universities in the United States. The present collaborative proposal addresses several ways in which the program can be expanded to improve links with industry and to enhance the research and educational opportunities provided by the Workshop. This expansion involves increased participation in the Workshop amongst early-career mathematicians (upper-level graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty) and invited high-impact faculty with targeted expertise, and increased participation from new industries in emerging areas. Additional plans include dissemination of mathematical results from the Workshop at other national meeting, and seminars with industry to promote contacts for future Workshop participation. The expanded program will have a broad impact on the education and development of early-career mathematicians, and on the interdisciplinary research of participating faculty. The Workshop also promotes collaborations with industry and will have an impact on the development and analysis of new technologies in industry. The intellectual merit of the program centers around the problems considered at the Workshop. Many of these problems have led to follow up research and new mathematical results, and it is expected that this will continue to be an outcome of the expanded problem-solving experience.<br/>"

Composite materials are rapidly<br/>becoming the materials of choice for structural applications. <br/>This is due to their light weight and superior stiffness<br/>properties.  In order to accelerate their deployment an improved<br/>understanding of their strength properties based upon their<br/>microstructural geometry is required.  This proposal focuses on<br/>properties related to failure initiation.  Failure is often<br/>precipitated by extreme excursions of the local fields at the<br/>level of the microgometry.  The proposal consists of three<br/>projects that make new connections between the excursions of<br/>local deformation, strain, and stress fields as functions of<br/>applied boundary loads and initial conditions.

The waves move under the influence of gravity and surface tension on the free surface.  Approximate model equations and exact Euler equations governing the flow will be used to study the stability of these waves.  The project consists of three problems.  The first one is to study the stability of solitary waves for generalized Boussinesq systems and show that the solitary waves for such a system are stable.  The second problem intends to study the spectral stability of solitary waves and establish the criteria for the existence or nonexistence of unstable eigenvalues for the equations linearized around the solitary-wave solution.  The third problem deals with the conditional stability of three-dimensional solitary waves under the assumption that waves initially close to the solitary wave exist for any finite time.  Here, interplay of the theories in fluid dynamics and applied analysis is essential.  <br/><br/>The theory of water waves has developed for more than 150 years, and numerous real-world phenomena, such as waves generated by boats in lakes or ships in oceans, have been studied experimentally, numerically, and mathematically.  Research on the stability of these waves is one of the important and difficult subjects in this area.  In particular, experiments and observations have shown that the solitary waves propagating along a channel or an open sea have a remarkable property of permanence.  Yet, the stability of such waves remains an unsolved problem mathematically.  This research project, which is focused on analysis of the stability of solitary waves, has potential impact in many areas of mathematics, science, and engineering that involve fluid interfaces and wave propagation and interactions, such as the propagation of tsunami waves in oceans caused by earthquakes, the giant waves generated from fast ferries that threaten coastlines and have been blamed for many boat accidents, and the waves induced by storms or hurricanes that cause tremendous damage to offshore oil rigs.<br/>"

A first part of the project is to elucidate the structure and classify the zero temperature limits of such systems.  The suspensions in fluids of these systems lead to nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations coupled to Navier-Stokes equations.

The methods to be used will combine harmonic analysis tools and classical techaniques for the Navier-Stokes equations. In addition, it is planned to study  global attractors of the 3D NSE and related models, such as the dyadic (a.k.a. shell) models of turbulence. The study of the structure of the global attractor is essential for a better understanding of turbulent phenomena. Due to the lack of a uniqueness proof, it is not known whether the 3D NSE possesses a semigroup of solution operators, and consequently a classical theory of semiflows cannot be used for this system. It is proposed to continue developing a theory of global attractors for an evolutionary system, which is a generalization of a dynamical system that can be applied in this situation.<br/><br/>This award will support research on some fundamental open questions concerning the equations of fluid motion. The equations were introduced almost two centuries ago but are still not well understood mathematically. Even though the equations are broadly used by physicists and engineers for real-life applications, the existence and uniqueness of (classical) solutions is still not known. An answer to this question is expected to shed light on fundamental issues related to turbulence.  Turbulence, often referred to as the last unsolved problem in classical physics, is a fundamental phenomenon occurring in fluid flows around airplane bodies, vehicles, ships, and blades of turbines. A better mathematical understanding of turbulence will result in improvements in the design of these objects."

This is particularly interesting in the context of financial mathematics in which one is interested in the behavior of the stock price in a short time. For instance, this will be relevant to option prices at short maturities, or probabilities to reach a default level in a short time. Multi-factor stochastic volatility models have been studied intensively in the past years, and  they have been found very useful to describe the observed smile/skew of implied volatilities. At short maturities the rate functions appearing in the large deviation estimates will usually not be given in closed form, and will depend on some details of the models like volatility of volatility. On the other hand it has been shown that multiscale stochastic volatility models and their asymptotics are very useful to obtain accurate approximations of option prices and hedging strategies which can be efficiently computed with only a few group parameters easy to calibrate to data. It is then natural to study asymptotic expansions of the rate function in the regime of separation of volatility time scales. In particular, the regime in which the maturity is small but large compared to the mean-reversion time of the stochastic volatility factor turns out to be very interesting and challenging. The research supported by this award is about deriving and fully justifying such asymptotic expansion. The problem will be formulated as logarithmic asymptotic for exponential moments of certain functionals of diffusion processes, which in turn is connected with homogenization/averaging theory for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.  The collaborative nature of the  research combines expertise in the area of multiscale stochastic volatility modeling, in the areas of large deviation theory, and viscosity solution and homogenization/averaging for HJB equations. <br/><br/>This award will support a multidisciplinary research effort. It concerns very practical modeling issues in the area of financial mathematics as well as theoretical convergence results in the theories of large deviations for diffusion processes and homogenization of nonlinear partial differential equations. It is expected that the results obtained on small default probabilities will be very helpful in understanding default mechanisms in credit markets. This research therefore is very timely. The senior PI at UCSB is actively involved in organizing conferences, workshops and special sessions which promote interaction between academic researchers and practitioners. The research will be given full exposure in the activities of the newly created Center for Research in Financial Mathematics and Statistics (CRFMS) at UCSB.

Eigenvalue problems arise in a number of contexts in various branches of science, in particular in questions related to the stability of a physical system. Specifically, in many equations arising in mathematical physics there may exist valid exact solutions which are unstable, in the sense that nearby solutions rapidly diverge from this exact solutions as time progresses. Such solutions are often difficult or impossible to realize in an experiment, since the initial conditions must be chosen very precisely in order for the solutions to remain observable for any appreciable length of time. Put differently, physically interesting solutions typically are the stable ones.  and what is not. Unfortunately it is often very difficult to determine whether a particular solution is stable or not. The problems that will be studied under this award range from water waves and wave propagation in photonic materials to models in physiology. Specifically, problems related to photonic crystals with defects, standing waves for nonlinear Schroedinger equations, vortex crystals for Bose-Einstein condensates, scattering problems related to the Sine-Gordon equations, and a problem from neurophysiology (oculomotor integrator of the brain) will studied. In some of these projects, geometric methods for establishing the instability of solutions will be developed. These methods are very general, being based on geometric considerations rather than details of the equation in question. Thus they are potentially applicable to problems in many disciplines within science. Other techniques such as asymptotics and topological arguments will also be employed. <br/><br/>Stability is a fundamental property of many physical systems. For example, a pocket watch hanging from a chain is a stable system - it will eventually return to its rest state when perturbed. A pencil that is balancing on its tip on a table is unstable - a very small perturbation will cause it to fall over. For many engineered physical systems, it is however not clear if it is stable or not. Examples occur in the design of novel optical materials, where the stability of a traveling light pulse is of interest. In other situations, e.g. in physiology, instability is related to malfunction, and it is of interest to explore mechanisms that lead to instability. For example, the oculomotor integrator, which is part of the brain subsystem that moves the eyes, is known to function properly as long as a mathematical model satisfies a suitable condition (a single dominant eigenvalue is near the origin). The system becomes unstable if there are eigenvalues in locations where they not are supposed to be, resulting in a condition known as congenital nystagmus that effects one in about 2000 people. The research in this project is primarily concerned with questions of stability in the broadest sense. It will provide tools that are applicable to problems ranging from photonics to physiology. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

A somewhat counter-intuitive quasilinear evolution in nonlinear dispersive wave equations of Hamiltonian type will be investigated and a general criterion of quasilinear behavior developed. The study will begin with specific equations such as the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam system, the Korteweg-ed Vries equation, the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak model, etc. The nonlinear dynamics becomes linear for high frequency initial data because of a subtle averaging effect due to the dispersion.  Besides purely nonlinear dynamics interest, understanding the quasilinear phenomenon is important for  engineering systems design, since designing linear systems is easier for a number of reasons.  A second area of study is the structure of the set of periodic orbits in Hamiltonian systems of billiard type. The approach is based on the methods of geometric control  theory and exterior differential systems.  It is expected that analyticity of the large (two parameter) families of periodic orbits will be proved. While being an important problem in theoretical dynamics, the structure of the set of periodic orbits is of great value to other areas of science. In particular, zero probability occurrence of periodic orbits implies high accuracy of Weyl's asymptotics for eigenvalues in the Dirichlet problem.  In physics, the structure  of the set of periodic orbits plays an important role in the study of  quantum chaos and in optical microcavities. <br/><br/>Optical communication systems provide the most effective way of data transmission over long distances. The information is usually transmitted by light pulses of short duration.  In an ideal world, the incoming data stream would appear undistorted at the other end of the transmission line, so the information would not be corrupted. In reality, two major effects distort the light pulses: dispersion and nonlinearity.  Dispersion characterizes how much the speed of the wave depends on the frequency, and nonlinearity forces larger amplitude waves to move differently from the smaller amplitude ones. The distortion due to nonlineariy is especially undesirable. Recently, optical system engineers have discovered the remarkable fact that by packing pulses more and more tightly, nonlinear effects become smaller.  In earlier work this ?quasilinear? phenomenon was explained for a simple model problem by demonstrating that it occurs under certain precisely formulated conditions. One part of the proposed research aims to develop general criteria of quasilinear behavior in other important systems, such as  shallow water dynamics, solid state physics, and water waves. The second part of the project deals with the study of periodic orbits in mechanics.  Periodic orbits produce recurrent behavior and their study is of great importance for basic systems, such as the classical billiard problem. Here one should think of an oval cavity in which a light ray (or a point mass) travels along straight lines, suffering reflections at the boundary.  It is believed that the probability is zero that a given ray will produce a closed (i.e., periodic) trajectory. This issue has deep connections to other fields, and it is proposed to understand when this probability is zero and when it is positive.   <br/>"

The research will lead to a better rigorous understanding of these solitons. Not only will the new mathematical methods developed in the project feed back into the analytic toolbox available for mathematicians, but it will also put the often ad-hoc formal calculations of engineers on a firm basis.

The second cluster focuses on ground state properties: area laws for the local entropy and entanglement, the spectral gap above the ground state and its relation with the behavior of correlation functions, and the quality of approximation of ground states by matrix product states.

There are three themes:  (1) Information transmission and coding theory, (2) Rational surface modeling and implicitization, and (3) Approximation theory and multidimensional splines.  The main goal of the project is to bring the full power of abstract machinery to bear on these themes; frequently the key to solving an applied problem is to view it from a different perspective.  For example, in past work, the PI has used spectral sequences and local cohomology to study splines; in coding theory the PI has used toric geometry and Cayley-Bacharach theory to obtain good bounds on certain codes obtained from algebraic geometry. The coding theory portion of the project will focus on finding optimal codes from toric varieties of dimension three or more; on the spline front the PI will investigate splines on polyhedral complexes, as well as the efficacy of the Groebner basis algorithm as a symbolic algebra front end for spline computations. Finally, an exciting new interaction between computer science (specifically, computer vision and animation) and algebra involves rational surface modeling: if a map is defined from the plane to three-space by three rational functions, what is the (unique) polynomial vanishing on the image? Here there is again a fruitful interplay with commutative algebra; the most efficient way to determine the polynomial involves syzygies (relations among the functions which define the map); the aim is to obtain fast algorithms to determine the polynomial vanishing on the image.<br/><br/>One of the fundamental problems in information theory is that of signal transmission; applications range from CD systems to space communication. In a perfect world, the signal sent from point A and the signal which arrives at point B are identical. In the real world, the medium over which the signal is transmitted is not perfect (there is noise), and so errors are introduced into the signal. In signal processing jargon, the transmitted signal consists of code words, and the study of how to clean up the signal is called ``coding theory''. So the problem is simple: how does one catch the errors? The solution is to introduce some additional information into the transmission, so that the receiver at point B can strip off the errors and recover the original signal. It turns out that codes which are obtained from certain geometric objects can sometimes be optimal (that is, not too much redundant information needs to be added). One aim of this proposal is to discover more such codes. A second theme of the proposal involves computer vision and animation. Given a surface and a point in space, the goal is to decide if the point lies on the surface (this arises, for example, in plotting the image of a character in an animated movie). This is easy to do if the surface is given by an equation f(x,y,z)=0 and the point p=(a,b,c); simply check if f(a,b,c)=0. The goal is to find efficient algorithms to determine f(x,y,z), which is typically unknown. The final theme of the proposal is to study ``splines'', which are objects used by companies like Boeing to model surfaces.  The PI will work to determine theoretical bounds on the number of splines on certain objects and will also analyze the complexity of a symbolic algebra algorithm (not currently used in the area) for computing splines. Accomplishing either of these goals could lead to an actual speed up in the software used to generate splines."

Recent advances in experimental imaging, computational methods, and dynamical systems theory suggest a way to bridge this gap and make a fundamental breakthrough in our understanding of turbulence. It has recently been discovered that recurrent coherent structures observed in wall-bounded shear flows (such as pipes and boundary layers) result from close passes to weakly unstable invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. These 3D, fully nonlinear solutions (equilibria, traveling waves, and periodic orbits) structure the state space of turbulent flows and provide a skeleton for analyzing their dynamics. We propose to calculate a hierarchy of invariant solutions for a canonical wall-bounded shear flow and to use these solutions (1) to develop a quantitative description of the flow's turbulent dynamics, and (2) to predict, directly from the fundamental equations, physical quantities such as bulk flow rate and mean wall drag.

The first project is rooted in proving dispersive estimates for the linearized vortex sheet problem along with a priori energy estimates for the nonlinear problem. The ultimate goal is to show that if the initial configuration is nearly flat then solutions of the full nonlinear equations of motion exist globally in time. The second area is focused on understanding and circumventing technical obstructions which arise when trying to establish orbital stability for solitary waves in approximate models for free fluid interfaces derived without the assumption that there is a preferred direction of propagation. Uni-directionality plays an important but subtle role in the stability analysis and generalization to bi-directional systems has proven difficult. The third project is centered around understanding how an applied electric field can exacerbate/arrest rupture of the interface.  The electro-magnetics introduce new nonlocal and nonlinear effects which complicate the analysis of the system.<br/><br/>Predicting how an interface between two fluids which are shearing past one another moves in time is a central problem in mathematical hydrodynamics. This very general scenario occurs in many situations of practical interest: on the surface of the ocean, between layers in the atmosphere, in the wake of a boat or behind the wing of an aircraft.<br/>A natural question to ask is whether or not an interface initially very close to being perfectly flat will in fact become perfectly flat as time evolves.  In the first part of this research project, very precise quantitative descriptions of nearly flat interfaces will be developed.  The second component of this project concerns the evolution of solitary water waves, which are called tsunamis when they occur in the open ocean.  The destructive power of these waves is directly related to the fact that they are very difficult to disrupt: they can travel great distances essentially unchanged.  That solitary waves are so stable is well understood for a variety of models for their evolution wherein one makes an assumption that the wave has a preferred direction of motion.  This part of this project studies their stability without this assumption, and also to examine ways in which bottom topography can (possibly) disturb such waves.  The final part of this project is concerned with developing and analyzing systems which model the effects of an applied electromagnetic field on a fluid interface.  There is a great deal of interest in manipulated fluid interfaces in this way.  Applications include:  dynamic wave guides and lenses, high speed switching, coating and cooling processes.<br/>"

A new feature of this method is that the interaction of the immersed boundary with the fluid now involves not only translation of the immersed boundary points at the local fluid velocity, but also rotation of the associated triads at the local fluid angular velocity.  <br/><br/>This method will find numerous applications in biological fluid dynamics, where filamentous structures interact with a viscous fluid.  Examples include the supercoiling of DNA during transcription and replication and protein folding.  In addition, one of the challenges in nanotechnology is to develop machines at the nanoscale which can be used in the treatment of disease.  Understanding swimming mechanism by means of rotary motors will help to create a nanomachine, operated by self-propelled biomolecular nano motors, that could be used for drug delivery inside the body.  Furthermore, such interdisciplinary projects give rise to problems and activities that can be used to attract students to science through the investigator's work with the Women in Science and Engineering program (WISE) at her university.<br/>"

The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop novel analytical and numerical methods based on kinetic descriptions of complex phenomena with multiple scales and with a wide range of applications. The objective is to achieve a better understanding of problems which are in the forefront of current research and to contribute to the solution of long-standing problems by synergetic collaboration of theory, modeling and numerics. To this end, this Focus Research Group (FRG) will provide a platform, led by leading researchers from Universities of Maryland, Brown, Iowa State, Wisconsin-Madison, Arizona State, Austin-Texas and Toulouse, France, who will merge their expertise in the construction, analysis and implementation of kinetic descriptions for a selected suite of problems with crossing scales from quantum and micro scales to the macro scales. Topics to be discussed include kinetic descriptions of microscopic and quantum phenomena, and kinetic descriptions of macroscopic phenomena. As a recent novel example for the kinetic methodology we will use kinetic descriptions to study hyperbolic flows for complex supply chains. The theoretical and modeling aspects of this research program, on both microscopic and macroscopic scales, will be integrated with kinetic-based numerical methods for capturing ``smaller scales phenomena"". <br/><br/>The rationale behind this proposal is a timely effort to address several important issues in modern applied mathematics. Kinetic theories are not new. Yet, there have been many major developments in kinetic modeling, kinetic theories and related numerical methods, with the potential for a considerable impact on emerging new fields in physical and social sciences. The proposed effort will significantly strengthen the leading role that the US researchers can play in pursuing cutting-edge research and training a new generation of applied mathematicians in this important field. We expect this project to contribute to the development of scientific workforce by advanced training for doctoral and postdoctoral researchers and by providing a platform for interdisciplinary interactions with researchers from related disciplines. Internal and external interactions will be maintained through synergetic collaborations which will come to fruition during the three annual workshops to be held in Maryland (Year 1), France and Brown (Year 2), and Wisconsin (Year 3). International meetings will be held as part of a series of interdisciplinary workshops organized by the Center for Scientific Computation and Mathematical Modeling (CSCAMM) at the University of Maryland.

Numerical calculations reveal that these solutions are unstable but with very low dimensional unstable manifolds (1 or 2 dimensional) and that they control transition to turbulence. Numerical calculations also reveal that the solutions have a striking asymptotic structure involving a critical layer. An asymptotic theory is needed to clarify, solidify and extend the numerical results to large Reynolds number. Such an asymptotic theory would have interesting mathematical features and implications about the high Reynolds number limit of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations because of the nonlinear self-interaction of a singular critical layer structure. This research project will continue to develop such a theory.<br/>A second aspect of this research program is to continue the numerical study of the various coherent states and their connection with turbulent flows.

Kida and M. Nagata (Japan) and B. Eckhardt (Germany).<br/><br/>We have walked on the moon but we still do not understand flow of water down a pipe. For low speeds, the water flows in an orderly manner (`laminar flow'), but at higher speeds the flow becomes very disordered (`turbulent flow'). Turbulence is an ubiquitous fluid phenomenon that also occurs for flow of oil in pipelines, air around cars, airplanes and buildings, as well as in plasmas inside tokamaks, the sun and stars. The energetic and environmental effects of turbulence are major. Turbulent flows consume a lot more energy and mix things much better than laminar flows. Turbulence has been actively studied for over 120 years and is widely considered as the major unsolved problem of classical physics. A main emphasis of that research has been to developed semi-empirical models of turbulence for engineering calculations. These models are invariably based upon various presumptions about the nature of turbulence. This research program is one of an handful of pioneering programs around the world that have uncovered a series of previously unsuspected other possible states of fluid flow, intermediate between laminar and turbulent states. These new flow states consists of equilibria and periodic states that are unstable but appear to control onset of turbulence as well as fully developed turbulent flows. The discovery of these states forces a fundamental rethinking of the nature of turbulence. These discoveries were suggested and made possible by advances in experimental visualization methods as well as computers and computer calculation methods."

An idealized model of the cell membrane that includes these features is a lipid bilayer vesicle, comprised of two or more chemical components capable of phase separation and endowed with different inherent rigidities. Examples include several lipid-cholesterol systems.  In general, compositional fluxes and elastic moduli may be derived from a common energy potential, resulting in a tightly coupled system.  These vesicles have characteristic thicknesses that are much less than characteristic diameters, suggesting their treatment as co-dimension 1 surfaces.  This proposal links three research topics to develop a continuum model of such vesicles in fluid media.  First is the high-order interface tracking.  Embedded boundary methods will be developed to couple the motion of a membrane suspended in, and containing, viscous fluid.  Second is the dynamics -- chemical and mechanical -- of a membrane with time dependent shape.  An approach to this problem is to employ cartesian grid finite volume methods with a phase field approach to compute dynamics (Cahn-Hilliard for chemistry, and solid mechanics for motion) in an annulus, with the desired behavior obtained in the limit of zero thickness.  The problems of front tracking and interface dynamics must be tightly coupled, e.g., through predictor-corrector and relaxation strategies.  The third problem concerns constitutive modeling - the development of energy potentials, constrained by experimental phase diagrams, elasticity measurements, and the symmetry requirements of frame invariance, to couple the effects of chemistry with shape.<br/><br/>This proposed work will advance the understanding of numerical partial differential equations of mixed hyperbolic-elliptic type on time-dependent domains.  A numerical model of vesicle dynamics, linking the dynamics of shape and chemistry, will be developed for the purpose of better understanding experiments on heterogeneous vesicles, both natural and biomimetic, and ultimately to aid in understanding the connections between cell membrane chemistry, shape, and function.<br/>"

Many solutions to differential equations with heterogeneous coefficients are not accessible to us because they are too expensive to obtain even with today's computational capabilities. The derivation of macroscopic models, which average the small-scale heterogeneities one way or another, is then in order. In many applications, one is interested not only in the (deterministic) ensemble average of the solution, for which many theories exist, but also in a quantitative description of its random fluctuations, i.e., the part that cannot be modeled in a deterministic manner. Understanding the latter fluctuations is the first goal of the project. Once a model has been proposed, the second question pertains to the reconstruction of the coefficients in the equation from available measurements, typically performed at the boundary of a domain of interest. A quantitative understanding of how these inverse problems are affected by the random fluctuations in the solution is the second major objective of the project.<br/> <br/>Equations with random (highly heterogeneous) coefficients are ubiquitous in applied sciences.

The proposed research will combine theoretical and computational tools arising from Dirac mechanics and geometry, noncommutative harmonic analysis, and uncertainty quantification to dramatically extend the applicability of computational geometric mechanics and geometric control to engineering problems that evolve intrinsically on nonlinear spaces, such as Lie groups and homogeneous spaces. This will provide insights into the canonical discretization of Dirac constraints, nonholonomic constraints, and interconnected systems. In addition, the study of uncertainty in the context of geometric control will improve the robustness and reliability of the resulting numerical and computational tools.<br/><br/>This research will improve our ability to control interconnected systems of autonomous vehicles in a robust and efficient fashion, by explicitly taking into account the uncertainty inherent in our knowledge of the surrounding environment.

In the absence of statistical description such problems of Measurement Output Feedback Control (MOFC) were investigated mostly within the H(inf) setting, with soft-type integral costs, while problems with hard bounds on the unknowns were less developed. The present proposal is aimed to produce a fairly complete investigation of the problem of output feedback control constructed through available measurements under unknown but bounded disturbances subject to hard bounds on the uncertain items. The proposal covers topics from basic theoretical problems to computational methods. The novelty of the suggested solution schemes, applicable to nonlinear systems, with greater specifics for the linear case, lies in the combination of dynamic programming, set-valued analysis and minmax approaches. It is well understood that the overall problem under consideration is a combination of two ? a finite-dimensional problem of guaranteed state estimation and an infinite-dimensional problem of feedback control under set-membership uncertainty. The second problem is especially difficult to formalize and solve. In the proposed solution, based on earlier work, the aim is to reduce the second problem to a finite-dimensional one, which would facilitate calculation. For systems with linear structure and convex constraints the computational procedure is to be based on using and also generalizing the ellipsoidal calculus which proved effective for many problems and allows development of complementary software. It is expected that such approach will produce solutions ""to the end,"" with illuminating examples.

Under suitable chemical<br/>conditions these molecules can self-assemble in aqueous solution<br/>into long aggregates known as worm-like micelles.  These long<br/>flexible structures entangle to form a network and lead to<br/>viscoelastic properties similar to those of polymer melts and<br/>concentrated solutions, but with the added complexity that the<br/>worms continuously break and reform (i.e. they are ""living<br/>polymers"").  External deformations can enhance the local rate of<br/>micellar breakage, thus the macroscopic flow affects the<br/>microscopic structure which in turn further modifies the global<br/>velocity field.  Due to these multi-scale interactions these<br/>fluids exhibit flow inhomogeneities even in simple geometries. <br/>Development and analysis of new constitutive models and<br/>comparison with experimental results is generating new insight<br/>and understanding into the multi-scale nature of these flows and<br/>of the influence of the evolution in the microscopic structure on<br/>the macroscopic measurables.  The governing mathematics is that<br/>of a nonlinear system of partial differential equations<br/>describing conservation of mass and linear momentum, coupled to<br/>equations governing the number densities of the entangled<br/>molecules and constitutive (stress) equations for each species. <br/>Specifically, the investigators study a pair of two-species<br/>network models that they recently proposed: a two species model<br/>with chain scission and reforming effects (the VCM model)<br/>physically appropriate for wormlike micellar solutions, and a<br/>simplified non-interacting model (PEC+M model) appropriate to<br/>monodisperse entangled polymer solutions.

The primary goals are to establish the theoretical possibility of global controllability, and  to obtain an explicit construction of the control strategy.  The latter will be in the form of asymptotic formulae or by reduction of original nonlinear problem to a much simpler controllability problem for linear PDEs or integral equations capable of numerical solution. For example, if a physical process is described by an<br/>integrable nonlinear PDE , we reduce the question of controllability to the analysis of a controllability problem for the Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko integral equation and then try to solve this problem  asymptotically.  For a physical process described by a nonintegrable PDE we plan to adapt Coron's return method, which allows construction of asymptotic solutions to a large class of controllability problems with control distributed over the whole<br/>boundary or just a part of the boundary. The main analytical tools will be the inverse scattering technique, microlocal analysis, the Carleman type<br/>estimates and soliton theory.<br/><br/>Understanding the control and stabilization of  physical processes described by nonlinear partial differential equations is becoming increasingly important due to the rapid advances in material science, physics, aircraft design, fiber-optic communication systems. The nonlinear partial differential equations used as models are mathematically challenging and widely used in physics and engineering. The global controllability problems for these equations are motivated by practical real-world applications which include suppression of turbulence, control of waves in channels, control of plasma flow, design of a new generation of amplifiers which will allow the preservation of the shape of optical pulse in fiber-optical communication systems. <br/><br/>"

It has been generally understood that such a spectral energy density of internal waves is the result of nonlinear wave-wave interaction, and the theory of wave turbulence describes the spectral energy transfers in such systems. Wave turbulence has contributed tremendously to our understanding of spectral energy transfers in atmosphere and ocean. However, the question remains why the internal wavefield spectrum possesses such a universality. The goal of the research that is funded by this award is to give a theoretical explanation of this apparent universality. To begin with, it will be demonstrated that the traditional wave turbulence assumptions of weak nonlinear resonant wave-wave interactions are violated by interacting internal waves. A generalization of  traditional wave turbulence is necessary, including strongly nonlinear wave-wave interactions that are not necessarily resonant. Oceanographers believe that it is sufficient to consider only wave-wave interactions to describe the formation of the spectral energy density of internal waves. It will be demonstrated that this intuition is correct to a large extend. Yet wave-wave interactions alone are not exclusively responsible for the formation of the spectral energy density of internal waves. Using direct numerical simulation of wave-wave interactions, it will be demonstrated that energy tends to cascade towards longer and longer horizontal waves. Additional, large scale vortices in the ocean and their interactions with internal waves will be considered. In particular, the coupling of the quasi-geostrophical potential vorticity turbulence and of internal waves will be studied. Such wave-vortex interactions will describe how internal waves are influenced and influence large scale oceanic vortices. To achieve these goals, a novel Hamiltonian structure that has been developed for internal waves will be used, and a rigorous reformulation of wave turbulence theory that was developed recently by the proposer will be employed. <br/><br/>The oceanic wavefield is a large and complex system. For such systems, it is often extremely useful to decribe the energy spectrum of the underlying dynamics: How much energy is contained in surface ripples, how much in swells travelling across the ocean, how much in tidal flows, how much in large scale currents such as the Gulf Stream, and how do these features at vastly different scales influence each other. The work supported by this award focuses on internal waves. For a simple table-top illustration, one should visualize a glass container whose bottom half is filled with water, with oil in the top half. Then it is possible that waves slosh around at the water-oil interface while the oily surface appears calm. Such waves at interfaces between fluids of different density are often observed in the ocean over the continental shelf during the summer, due to solar heating, and they in turn influence weather patterns. It has been observed that such internal waves in the ocean have an energy spectrum that is universal. This research work will contribute to a theoretical understanding of this universality. It will also lead to a better understanding of processes in the ocean and in the atmosphere, and thus contribute to mathematical models for climate and weather modeling and prediction. <br/>"

Such laws arise in diverse areas such as the study of biological networks, earthquakes and fully turbulent flows. The investigator's research vision is to bring some of these laws within the scope of rigorous mathematical analysis. To this end, seemingly unrelated problems are treated within a unified framework that combines mathematical methods from dynamical systems, partial differential equations and probability theory. Explicit connections between these areas are used to provide a fundamental understanding of the microscopic origin of `universal' scaling  laws in (a) models of domain coarsening in materials science and physical  chemistry, (b) dynamic scaling of transport coefficients in polymer  chemistry, (c) models of turbulence. Analogies with classical probability are also used to guide new investigations of universality in dynamical systems.<br/>These research goals are closely tied to concrete improvements in education and training. Scaling and self-similarity are used as a unifying theme in a program for curricular innovation for undergraduates that stresses the extraction of simple quantitative answers from complex models. This includes the development of new freshman and senior seminars and an REU program.<br/><br/>This mathematical research is motivated by problems of fundamental technological significance in fluid mechanics, materials science and physical chemistry. Studies of domain growth in materials science improve understanding of the stability of binary alloys and coarsening of nanoscale islands on thin-film substrates. Improved numerical methods for the simulation of polymers advance the analysis of biochemical flows, such as the manipulation of individual strands of DNA in confined channels. A deeper understanding of universality in dynamical systems enhances knowledge of the transition to chaos in several fluid flows, and is the first step in the control of such flows. The plans for undergraduate education place early emphasis on the basic utility of scaling analysis in emerging areas for the application of mathematics such as biology, physical chemistry and geosciences. They also include the development of innovative expositions at the undergraduate level of successful mathematical research in these fields. This contributes to a growing demand for mathematical sophistication in these areas, and is critical for sustained impact. The educational plans stress small classes, undergraduate research, and outreach to under-represented groups, in the firm belief that careful, individual mentoring of students is the foundation for  a diverse and talented  scientific workforce.<br/>"

This project will develop analogous algorithms for nonlinear stochastic systems subject to delays.  Computations and simulations show that appropriate controls that take the delays into account can improve performance considerably. Yet little is currently available concerning algorithms or convergence proofs for nonlinear problems.   Due to the delays in the dynamics, the original model problem is infinite-dimensional, and the memory requirements of the numerical algorithms are a serious concern and cause major technical challenges for both the structure of the algorithms and the proofs of convergence. One must be careful since the delay equations can be very sensitive to model perturbations. Approximations to the original models are being developed to simplify the memory problems for the numerical algorithms, and convergence proofs are being developed. The methods of proof are purely probabilistic, being based on weak convergence techniques, hence are very flexible and general.  Furthermore the numerical algorithms can be represented as control problems for Markov chain models, which gives the procedure intuitive meaning.  Communications systems are of interest for a long time period, hence the popularity of the ergodic (or average cost per unit time) cost criterion.  There is little relevant ergodic theory for the delay case and the problem of effective numerical approximations is almost completely open, from both the analytical and algorithmic perspectives.  Extensions to singular and impulsive controls and neutral equations will be carried out.<br/><br/>Nonlinear controlled stochastic dynamical models subject to delays are ubiquitous. They occur in models of internet control (and elsewhere in communications, control, biology, financial economics, etc.) where the control signals are subject to communications  delays. Indeed, the effects of communications delays are major concerns in the design of internet protocols for efficient and stable usage. The Principal Investigator?s methods for numerically solving stochastic control problems are widely used (in control systems, economics, financial models) for continuous time problems without delays.  This work  will extend the range of the methods to general nonlinear stochastic systems with delays.  Little is known about such problems at present. The algorithms and analytical methods to be developed will enable much more effective control of such systems and demonstrate the usefulness on concrete problems of current importance."

Recent experiments suggest that there is a stronger interaction between large-scale (hydrodynamic) and small-scale (diffusion) effects at high pressure, as compared to atmospheric conditions.   It is proposed to more <br/>fully account for these interactions by developing new asymptotic models that allow for merging of these scales through certain mild restrictions on the small scale structures, and selective use of numerical strategies to address these features in simplified configurations.  It is also proposed to develop new mathematical models of flames in supercritical fluids, i.e. fluids whose pressure exceeds the thermodynamic critical point. The physical and thermal properties of supercritical fluids are fundamentally different from a liquid or an ideal gas, and only recently have some of the distinguishing traits been identified as essential ingredients to be incorporated in formal theories.  Multi-scale analysis will be used to develop simplified asymptotic models that incorporate these features, most notably a novel transport mechanism. <br/><br/>The main thrust of this work is to develop new mathematical theories of flames in high-pressure environments. Many practical combustion devices operate at high pressures, including internal combustion engines, propulsion systems, turbines, furnaces, and incinerators.  Given the growing global concerns about energy, efficiency, and pollution, theories describing the fundamental burning characteristics in these systems are likely to have a significant impact on many future experimentation and engineering applications.  When a fluid is subjected to extremely high pressures, it displays very peculiar properties that are intermediate to a gas and a liquid.  In recent years, the odd properties of these fluids, called supercritical fluids or SCF's, have been exploited in a number of emerging technologies, e.g. remediation of hazardous waste in supercritical water, the design of the next generation of motors, and as an agent for catalytic activity.  The present work will produce new mathematical theories that describe how combustion occurs in such fluids. Given the broad applications for SCF's, it is expected that the theories to result from this work will be relevant to a number of technologies outside the field of combustion, including supercritical fluid extraction and chemical processing.  <br/>"

This conference will feature<br/>both introductory and advanced lectures on the rapidly developing relationships among these established fields. Since the fundamental tools in these research areas are quite different, there is a need for experts in different aspects of the conference to both present overviews of their subjects and point out the interactions among these topics. <br/><br/>Speakers and participants have been invited from the US and Europe. Already over 30 top mathematicians from the three conference fields have agreed to attend, including Spencer Bloch, Alain Connes, Alexander Goncharov, Dirk Kreimer, and Richard Melrose. The attendance for this conference is expected to be roughly 75 -- 100 mathematicians and mathematical physicists. <br/><br/>The three fields of motives, quantum field theory, and pseudodifferential operators are well established and active as independent fields, but until the past decade they have been viewed as essentially disjoint enterprises. The theory of motives was developed by Grothendieck in the 1960s as an arithmetic algebraic geometric setup incorporating diverse cohomology theories. Perturbative quantum field theory first appeared around 1945 to explain laboratory results in quantum electrodynamics and other field theories, and depends heavily on the calculation of Feynman integrals. Finally, the theory of pseudodifferential operators, dating from the 1960s, is a framework to treat all classical differential, Green's and heat operators in one setting.<br/><br/>Until recently, connections among these apparently very different fields were limited mainly to the appearance of Green's operators in quantum field theory. The unexpected appearance of multiple zeta values as values of Feynman<br/>integrals indicated a deep connection between quantum field theory and motives, the usual setting for multiple zeta functions. In addition, the Hopf algebra structure encoding the complicated combinatorics of Feynman integrals, <br/>uncovered by Connes and Kreimer, appears both in the theory of multiple zeta values and symbol calculations for pseudodifferential operators. Further research has shown that the connections are much more than coincidences, and<br/>the work of Bloch, Connes, Esnault, Kreimer, Marcolli and others points towards the possibility of a noncommutative geometry explanation or a direct motives/quantum field theory connection.<br/><br/>This is the first conference on this topic in the US. Since junior faculty and graduate students are encouraged to attend with partial NSF support, the schedule will include introductory lectures on the three conference areas and on Hopf algebras and multiple zeta functions. Other speakers will give research level talks on the conference areas, with a particular emphasis on their interactions."

These issues are central to Asset Pricing applications, such as dynamic portfolio choice and derivatives pricing with several assets and state variables, for preference structures which include expected utility, recursive utility, and multiple priors. In their mathematical formulation, these models lead to complex control problems, involving multidimensional diffusions and stochastic differential equations of forward and backward type. A satisfactory analysis of these models requires explicit solutions, either exact or asymptotic, which disentangle the impact of price dynamics from those of the different aspects of preferences. The reserach will (i) develop a theory for long-run asymptotics, combining martingale methods, duality theory, Markov processes, and stochastic control; (ii) investigate the expansion of exact solutions around their long-run asymptotics, exploiting ideas of spectral theory; (iii) explore the connections to turnpike theorems, risk-sensitive control, and large deviations; and (iv) develop solutions to models of interest.<br/><br/>This problem-driven research will seek new insights for Asset Pricing applications, which in turn suggest new directions for advancing mathematical theories. The involvement of graduate students in this effort will enhance their cross-training in Mathematical Finance and Applied Probability, and will bridge the traditional language gaps with related fields.<br/>This research has a twofold external relevance: first, a thorough understanding of portfolio choice is fundamental to devise efficient pension schemes, and to evaluate their welfare properties. Second, the equilibrium implications of long run investments are key to understanding the link between macroeconomic variables and asset price dynamics, and the interplay between risk aversion, ambiguity aversion and intertemporal substitution."

With such a discretization, the vorticity field equations become particle interaction equations and the models can be viewed as N-body problems with long-range interactions governed by a logarithmic Hamiltonian. The projects focus on three general themes: (i) the N-vortex problem on a rotating sphere with applications to atmospheric flows, (ii) vortex lattice theory with applications to recent experiments in Bose-Einstein condensate systems, (iii) the study of streamline topology, bifurcations, and evolution with the a focus on connecting this with chaotic advection and particle transport. There are seven detailed projects described in the proposal, each is designed to develop new analytical and computational techniques in dynamical systems theory, test current techniques on models that are physically well grounded, and push the models closer towards applications, mainly in oceanographic and atmospheric flows, but also in molecular modeling and the study of Bose-Einstein condensate lattices and vortices in thin film superconductors, where some of the same underlying issues pertain (albeit sometimes with Hamiltonians of a different form). An overriding theme of all of the projects is to develop Hamiltonian particle models in conjunction with probabilistic methods to analyze fluid flows and to develop and apply new techniques in nonlinear dynamical systems theory. <br/><br/>The main goals associated with the mathematical models being developed are to model, analyze, and simulate specific atmospheric events, such as the Antarctic pole vortex splitting event of September 2002, which manifested itself in the form of a split ozone hole in the Southern Hemisphere and led to enhanced global particle transport over the full stratospheric layer of the Earth's atmosphere. The specific reasons for this enhancement are not well understood and we will investigate several low dimensional models of this important and unprecedented event. Interestingly, the mathematical models developed in this context are similar to those used in completely different physical settings, such as the study of Abrikosov lattices in superconductivity theory, the recent flurry of experiments done on Bose-Einstein condensate lattices, and the modeling of spherical molecules in chemical physics, such as the famous Buckminsterfullerine molecule. We expect that developments associated with this proposal over the three year funding period will shed light on many physical mechanisms important to these areas as well."
