Horgan<br/>Institution: University of Virginia<br/>Title: Boundary-value problems for new classes of nonlinearly elastic materials <br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The investigator will study mathematical boundary-value problems in continuum mechanics for new classes of nonlinear elastic constitutive models describing the mechanical behavior of rubber-like materials undergoing large strains.  The material models exhibit strain hardening at large strains, in contrast to the classic models used in the literature.  In the molecular theory of elasticity, the models to be investigated are called non-Gaussian, because they involve a distribution function for the end-to-end distance of the polymer chain composing the material that is non-Gaussian.  From the phenomenological point of view, the models can be divided into two classes: models with limiting chain extensibility and power-law models.  The former have the feature that a stress singularity occurs at the limiting strain and thus offer new mathematical challenges.  It is proposed to use theories of nonlinear continuum mechanics to analyze some fundamental mechanical problems for these materials.  These challenging problems will be formulated as boundary-value problems for nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations, the latter involving second-order quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations and coupled systems of such equations.  Since the stress response of nonlinearly elastic material models with limiting chain extensibility is significantly different from that of classical models currently used in science and engineering practice, the proposed research should have important practical implications.<br/><br/>The work proposed here is relevant to the mechanical behavior of rubber and rubber-like materials (of critical importance to the automotive, aerospace and defense industries) as well as to the behavior of biological soft tissues including both natural and tissue derived engineered biomaterials.  In industrial practice, finite-element based large-scale commercial computer codes are based primarily on classical material models and their predictions for rubber-like materials at large strains warrant reassessment.  In particular, fracture of rubber leading to automobile and aircraft tire degradation is an important current technological problem to which the proposed work will contribute.  Applications to biological materials include the study of arterial wall mechanics with emphasis on the role of strain hardening in the development of cardiovascular disease.  The work is interdisciplinary involving modern methods of engineering mechanics, applied mathematics and physics.  Fundamental mathematical studies of the type proposed here are necessary to ensure the safe reliable utilization of rubber-like materials in modern technology.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Specific layered elastic systems we are <br/>concerned with include constrained-layer damping models, laminated <br/>plates, plates with surface-mounted and/or embedded actuators and <br/>general multilayer plate theory.  For a given layered structure, generally <br/>there are many different PDE systems of varying complexity that could be <br/>used to model the vibrations. Often the various PDE's are connected <br/>through a perturbation, which may be singular. The central concern will be <br/>to determine the dependence of stability and controllability upon the <br/>perturbation parameters that connect the possible models. This way model <br/>dependence, accuracy, and robustness properties of control and feedback <br/>strategies can be tested. The plan is to apply this type of analysis to <br/>practical control applications such as optimal design for constrained-layer <br/>damping and the stabilization of elastic structures using surface-mounted <br/>and embedded piezoelectric actuators. Several theoretical challenges <br/>present themselves in attempting to develop control methods that are <br/>useful for multilayer plates.  In particular, it is hoped to develop a theory <br/>of Carleman multipliers that is applicable to boundary control of layered <br/>systems. The objective is to obtain the sharpest possible results regarding <br/>boundary control.<br/> <br/>Understanding the modeling, control and stabilization of layered elastic <br/>systems is becoming increasingly important due to the rapid advances in <br/>material sciences, fabrication of composite materials, and speed of <br/>processing. The models considered are motivated by practical real-world <br/>applications involving composite layered structures.  These include the <br/>design of ship hulls and airplane fuselage, sound-proofing in auto bodies <br/>and the design of sporting goods such as skis and tennis rackets. Often, it <br/>is possible to utilize a composite construction to achieve a far superior <br/>design compared to what is possible with a single material.  Developing a <br/>theory for control and feedback of these structures is a challenging <br/>problem due the complicated nature of the coupling between the layers.  <br/>On the other hand, for a model to be useful in practical engineering <br/>applications, various crude approximations need to be made to reduce the <br/>complexity. Thus, a large part of the goal is to quantify the connection <br/>between an accurate, but complex mathematical model and a simplified, <br/>but more useful engineering model.   Specific problems of practical <br/>interest which will be addressed include: feedback control of vibrating <br/>structures using strategically placed actuators, optimal design and stability <br/>analysis for damping in layered and laminated composites.<br/>"

The focus is mainly on three topics: singular solutions of systems of partial differential equations, critical exponent phenomena in nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic equations, and effects of damping and convection.<br/><br/>An issue of fundamental importance in the mathematical theory of evolution equations is that of singularity formation. Analysis of this phenomenon can be essential for understanding the physical processes being modeled. One might very roughly divide the subject into three categories: regularity theory (proofs that singularities do not occur), propagation and interaction of singularities results (proofs that singularities persist in some respect) and theory of singularity formation (proofs that singularities must occur, and behavior of solutions near singular points). It is this last topic which is the main theme of the proposed conference, which will provide an excellent opportunity for communication and collaboration among faculty and between senior and junior investigators. <br/>"

Armbruster<br/>Institution: Arizona State Univsity<br/>Title: Dynamics and Control in Semiconductor Manufacturing Lines<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>It is proposed to apply nonlinear dynamics methods from dynamical systems theory and fluid dynamics to three problems in industrial mathematics: 1) The organization of production lines with  flexible workers.  A dynamical systems model will be derived and analyzed.  The goal is to determine whether chaos or other instabilities are present, to find out whether the production line is still self-organizing, and to determine the resulting throughput.  2) A switched arrival system<br/>for three parallel machines has been shown to be chaotic.  Increasingly realistic production scenarios will be added to this model, and the resulting dynamics will be determined.  Networks of such systems will be studied to determine whether  synchronization or partial synchronization can occur.  Such systems are hybrid dynamical systems that require new tools to study their dependence on changing parameters.  Such tools will be developed as extensions of standard dynamical systems methods.  3) A hierarchy of fluid-dynamical models to describe the flow of products through factories based on conservation laws will be developed. These models are based on the methods of gas dynamics and fluid averaging and promise to allow fast and accurate simulations for supply networks.<br/> <br/>This project is based on an ongoing  collaboration between researchers from Mathematics, Industrial Engineering, and Intel Corporation.  We expect that our results have a significant impact on the understanding of the relationship between policies and management decisions and the resulting performance of factories and whole business networks.  The three major areas of inquiry will be:  i) The management concept of bucket brigades: The organizational principle of bucket brigades will be studied for workers with different skill levels along the production line as well as changing skill levels due to learning.  ii) There are theoretical results stating that certain work allocation rules for parallel machines will lead to chaotic behavior.  These results are based on highly abstracted models.  We will study more realistic models and larger networks of production machines.  iii) Supply chain modeling and simulation: We will derive models that allow fast scalable simulations of production flows in a supply chain.  The long-term goal is to optimize production across the whole supply chain, an intermediate goal is to generate simulation tools that allow to explore business questions and to pose ""what if"" questions on these simulations.<br/>"

The meeting is a collaboration between the Research Triangle universities of Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<br/><br/>The central theme of the conference is the role of nonlinearity in physical systems, especially elasticity, granular materials, and fluid flow.  The interplay between experiments, modeling, theoretical mechanics, mathematical analysis, numerical simulation, and industrial design has proved particularly fruitful in recent years. This conference brings together scientists and mathematicians from all of these areas. The conference is designed to include lively discussion of the interplay between discoveries of new experimental phenomena, proposed mathematical models, theoretical developments and challenges, and corresponding innovations in numerical methods.  Bifurcation and pattern formation are observed in experiments with solids, fluids and granular materials, and the mathematical techniques to analyze phenomena have grown quite sophisticated.  This connection between experiment and theory, coupled to numerical simulation, occurs throughout the conference.<br/><br/><br/>"

Exact <br/>and null boundary controllability problems for two-dimensional systems <br/>of thermoelasticity will also be studied. In part, the work will entail a <br/>study of the dual problem; namely, the attainment of related observability <br/>inequalities for solutions of homogeneous adjoint equations. In line with <br/>the intended engineering applications, the focus will be on situations <br/>which allow control of the structural acoustic dynamics on as small a <br/>(boundary) control region as possible. Moreover, this project is aimed at <br/>finding conditions on the geometry and prescribed controls so that, with <br/>control implemented on the flexible portion of the acoustic chamber only, <br/>one will have exact controllability of the acoustic flow, for arbitrary initial <br/>data of finite energy. It is anticipated that key ingredients in the work will <br/>include the following: (i) sharp trace regularity for the wave equation in <br/>the absence of the so-called Lopatinski condition (intrinsic to the wave <br/>equation under Neumann boundary conditions); (ii) microlocal analytical <br/>estimates which will allow the absorption of tangential wave traces by <br/>time derivatives on the boundary; and (iii) recent results involving <br/>Carleman's estimates for the wave equation with controlled Neumann part <br/>of the boundary. In addition, the project will focus on problems of linear <br/>and (globally) nonlinear exact controllability for thermoelastic systems. In <br/>particular, thermoelastic PDE's will be considered which have their <br/>associated (non-Lipschitz) nonlinearities in place; e.g., the von Karman <br/>bracket and the quasilinearities which appear in the modeling of extensible <br/>plates. This work will attempt to use, in an essential way, the now-known <br/>analyticity of linearized thermoelastic models and our recent stability <br/>work for uncontrolled (but fully nonlinear) thermoelastic systems.<br/> <br/>Examples of coupled partial differential equations (PDE's), such as those <br/>to be investigated, have long existed in the literature. However, recent <br/>innovations in smart material technology, and the potential applications of <br/>these innovations within the context of control engineering design, have <br/>greatly increased the interest in these PDE models. The project is aimed at <br/>obtaining information about certain qualitative properties of these <br/>equations, which in turn can be used to design effective control laws for <br/>the structures/interactions that these equations govern. For example, <br/>structural acoustic PDE's are used to model the interaction of an aircraft <br/>cabin's interior acoustic field with the surrounding walls of the cabin. For <br/>the benefit of the passengers, it is desirable to negate or control pressure <br/>disturbances that act directly on the interior acoustic field. These <br/>disturbances typically emanate from outside the cabin environment; e.g., <br/>vibrations due to aircraft engine and propeller noise, or effects due to <br/>weather turbulence. In practice, engineers attempt to control this external <br/>noise by placing piezoelectric actuators/sensors on a portion of the cabin <br/>wall, these devices to act in such a way so as to remove, or at least lessen, <br/>the harmful acoustic pressure effects. However, the efficacy of this <br/>technology is profoundly sensitive to the shape of the cabin, as well as to <br/>the particular region of the cabin walls where the actuators are placed. The <br/>goals of this project include: (i) the precise mathematical characterization <br/>of those cabin geometries for which active control design by piezoelectric <br/>actuation is indeed possible; and (ii) when such control design is <br/>practicable, the construction of a reliable method to prescribe the amount <br/>and region of control actuation which will be necessary to maintain a calm <br/>acoustic field within the cabin.<br/>"

Both analytic and computational means will be used to analyze the effective properties of such materials in many spatial dimensions and time.  Analytically, by applying homogenization to the relevant hyperbolic systems with spatio-temporally varying senior coefficients, attainable bounds will be specified for the effective parameters of the binary mixtures of isotropic dielectrics in the framework of Maxwell's theory.  Computationally, a direct numerical simulation of the original equations will be used to better understand the physics of wave propagation through heterogeneous media with complex microstructure.  Together, both approaches will lead to a correct formulation and analysis of optimal material design in space time in response to a dynamic environment.<br/><br/>By allowing spatio-temporal variability in the material properties, it is possible to create effects that are unachievable through purely spatial design.  For example, by appropriately controlling the design factors of an elastic construction, i.e., its mass and stiffness, it is possible to selectively screen major parts of it from the invasion of destructive dynamic disturbances caused by impacts<br/>or other dynamic factors.  Disturbances can be purposefully guided into regions where their effect is less pernicious.  Another example is related to electromagnetic or acoustic waveguides.  To function properly, a conventional waveguide must have a certain minimum diameter relative to the wavelength of the signal.  If the waveguide is too narrow or the frequency of the waves is too low, then propagation will not be possible.  However, by allowing the material properties of the filling of the waveguide to vary both in space and in time, it will become possible to transmit waves of all frequencies.<br/>"

Osiris wavelets appear to be particularly well-suited for this purpose. One of the goals is to obtain cleaner hierarchical models by which renormalization group calculations of critical exponents can be determined. <br/><br/>The lattice models in classical equilibrium statistical mechanics are designed for the study of condensed matter physics, which deals with the critical behavior of solid materials with respect to changes in pressure, temperature, magnetic field intensity, etc. For example, the low temperatures at which supercomputers need to be maintained is a consequence of the fact that certain materials become super-conducters below a critical temperature.  Other examples of critical behavior would include the agnetization of a bar of iron, which can be induced at room temperature, but not above a certain temperature.  There are countless examples in nature. Wavelets are mathematical functions that are especially effective in recovering structures from compressed data. As such, they should be suited to the multiscale resolution of of these types of problems.

A major difficulty in scattered-data problems has been that the class of data-generating functions for which the methods are known to converge is much smaller than what one encounters in practice. This is problematic in numerically solving partial differential equations via Radial Basis Function collocation, since target functions need to be smoother than the basis functions, which is a major restriction in hyperbolic problems. One of the goals of this project is to obtain error estimates for a greatly expanded class of target functions. In our very recent work on interpolation via a restricted class of Spherical Basis Functions on the sphere, such estimates were obtained. This provides hope that the broader goal is attainable. Another important goal is to develop and implement rigorous, computationally efficient algorithms for  numerical partial differential equation problems, neural networks, and problems from the geosciences requiring scattered-data surface fitting on the sphere.<br/><br/>The investigation of scattered-data modeling is of great potential importance for the understanding of earth based phenomena of every kind. Fitting surfaces to meteorological or geophysical data collected via satellites or ground stations is a good example of such an application. Spherical basis functions (SBFs) have been used in such problems. Radial and periodic basis functions have been extensively employed in a variety of neural networks, including architectures used for direction-finding via phased-array radar.  Very recently, they have been employed in grid-free numerical methods for solving partial differential equations, and to do computer graphics and computer aided design problems. Calculations assocaited with these are time consuming. Recent advances have ameliorated these difficulties and the work under this project will continue to improve efficiency.<br/>"

For this problem a central concern for output <br/>feedback design is the analysis of the input-output map, i.e. the map from <br/>the control to the observation.<br/><br/>Advances in digital technology have led to an emphasis on sampled-data <br/>design in control engineering, but the development of sampled data <br/>control for infinite-dimensional systems such as PDEs has been limited.  <br/>In many applications output data is available in discrete time rather than <br/>continuous time, and a feedback controller for such a system should be <br/>designed to take discrete data as its input, but act in continuous time.  <br/>Since there is already an enormous literature on continuous time <br/>stabilization of PDEs, the project will involve the investigation of how to <br/>modify continuous time controllers to obtain sampled data controllers, <br/>while maintaining system performance.  Also of interest are techniques for <br/>designing effective sampled-data controllers without reference to <br/>continuous time design.  Another topic to be considered is the design of <br/>active feedback control tracking external signals and rejecting noise. As an <br/>application, these methods will be used to design a controller to reject <br/>noise in a PDE model which describes the interaction between sound <br/>waves in a cavity (for instance, an airplane cockpit) and the motion of a <br/>flexible wall of the cavity.  Suppose that there is an external noise source, <br/>such as engine noise, which is to be rejected, and active feedback control <br/>is to be applied to smart material actuators on the cavity walls.  Then a <br/>properly designed low-gain controller (either continuous time feedback or <br/>sampled-data) will attenuate the sound pressure at and near finitely many <br/>points of the cavity.<br/>"

This method has found use in at least 15 different areas of mathematics, which includes solving linear equations and inequalities, signal analysis, and computed tomography. The main practical drawback of the MAP, at least for some applications, is its slow convergence. We will study rates of convergence for the MAP by extending the notion of ``angle'' between subspaces to that of more general convex sets, as well as determine means for accelerating the convergence of the MAP. In addition, we expect to show that the speed of convergence of the MAP is directly related to a property (the ``strong conical hull intersection'' property) of the convex sets in question that we have studied in several papers over the last 20 years. <br/><br/>The method of alternating projections is an algorithm for computing nearest points in certain sets by a repetitive application of the same few simple steps. Since the method has  applications to so many different areas of mathematics (one of the earliest being in medical imaging via X-rays), it is important to know how fast (i.e., how many steps) this algorithm needs to take before  the results give good accuracy of the exact solution. The ``rate of convergence'' of the algorithm deals with the question of how fast the algorithm is for any given problem. For those problems when the rate of convergence is slow, we will also study ways to  make the algorithm work faster by making appropriate modifications of certain steps in the algorithm.   <br/><br/><br/>Date: May 13, 2002<br/>"

The symposium will <br/>include several invited 50-minute talks and a series of shorter <br/>contributed presentations of approximately 20 minutes each. The <br/>organizers plan to publish proceedings of this meeting in book <br/>form. <br/><br/>The rapid pace of change in technology constantly presents new <br/>challenges and new opportunities to researchers in systems and <br/>control, especially those in nonlinear control.

The nonlinearity <br/>of these complex systems leads not just to instability but also to <br/>periodic solutions, bifurcations, and chaos. Recent research shows <br/>promise for controlling such systems to achieve stability or <br/>instability.  Cooperative control is another research topic of <br/>nonlinear systems that is attracting increasing attention.

The symposium will provide an opportunity <br/>for both well-established and young researchers to exchange ideas <br/>on new developments and directions for future research.

The common theme of these mechanisms is that they involve transport phenomena caused by diffusion and nonlinearities. Examples of such transitions are backfiring instabilities of fronts, period-doubling bifurcations of spiral waves, and the effect of inhomogeneities on the dynamics of spiral waves. While transport is most conveniently modeled and described using an idealized unbounded domain, boundaries may well enhance or inhibit the instability through partial reflection or generation of waves. It is the aim of this project to develop techniques that can help to investigate instability mechanisms simultaneously on bounded and unbounded domains. One of the expected outcomes will be a description of instability mechanisms that is robust with respect to typical boundary conditions in large reactors. Technically, our approach is based on methods from spatial dynamics that allow us to derive sharp pointwise estimates which capture explicitly the effects of boundaries.<br/><br/>Complicated spatio-temporal patterns that arise due to the interplay of chemical reactions and diffusion have been observed experimentally in a number of specific reactions (among them the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction and the chlorite-iodide-malonic acid reaction). Similar phenomena have been observed during fibrillation of cardiac tissue where spiral waves act as organizing centers for the complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Other examples where irregular patterns occur are the interaction of pulses in oscillatory media, backfiring of excitation pulses in catalytic reactions, and optical bistability in nonlinear photonic gratings. The focus of this project is to analyze some of these instability mechanisms by analytical means. This will not only further our understanding of pattern formation in chemical and biological systems, but will eventually allow for a systematic control of patterns, for instance, in the catalytic oxidation of carbon-monoxide and in the propagation of calcium waves in intracellular tissue. <br/><br/>"

Meiss<br/>Institution: University of Colorado Boulder<br/>Title: Geometry and Computation of Dynamics for Conservative Systems<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The principal investigator proposes to study the geometry of low-dimensional dynamical systems, especially symplectic and volume-preserving maps, using both computational and analytical techniques.  While much is known about the two-dimensional case, there are still many questions about the onset and development of chaos for three- and higher-dimensional systems.  While most oscillators are anharmonic (have twist), twistless bifurcations occur in one-parameter families of these systems.  In the proposal, the geometry of twistless bifurcations will be studied leading to an understanding of fold and cusp bifurcations in the twist.  The resulting geometry of the reconnection of resonances and exotic twistless tori will be studied numerically.  These should play a role in limiting the stability domains for many dynamical systems.  From the other side, the destruction of chaos can be profitably studied using a limit of extreme chaos, the anti-integrable (AI) limit as a starting point.  In this proposal, the PI will use the AI limit to study coupled systems of maps and chaotic boundaries.  Near this limit, structures such as exotic versions of the Smale horseshoe, and other heteroclinic tangles should occur.  The onset of chaos in conservative systems is signaled by the destruction of tori.  These have been studied by a rescaling analysis called the renormalization transformation.  The structure of this transformation for four and higher dimensional systems is only beginning to be understood.  The PI proposes that recent approximate versions of this transformation will give effective numerical strategies for finding the destruction and analyzing the topology of the resulting objects.<br/><br/>Developing an understanding of the dynamics of conservative systems is important to applications including the design of particle accelerators, obtaining rates for simple chemical reactions, calculating confinement times for charged particles in plasma fusion devices, understanding the spectra of highly excited atomic systems, and designing efficient spacecraft trajectories in an era of lower budgets.  Dynamics is such systems is often chaotic, which implies <br/>that prediction of specific trajectories is difficult; however, chaos can be profitably utilized to improve efficiency, for example of spacecraft trajectories, by judiciously applying small course <br/>corrections.  Chaos can also dramatically affect the lifetimes of particles in confinement devices and the rates of chemical reactions.  The PI proposes to develop geometrical and computational techniques that can be used to address these questions.  In addition extending our understanding of chaos to higher dimensional cases will help populate the zoo of chaotic objects in multidimensional systems.<br/>"

In all these examples the motion is well described by an autonomous Hamiltonian with an approximately conserved canonical momentum, for which an averaged effective potential exists.  For small deviations from axisymmetry the motion remains essentially two-dimensional, simply averaging over nonaxisymmetric perturbations.  This effect has major consequences for the long time confinement of orbits, such as pairs of ions in a Paul trap.  In this research we will develop new analytic methods for describing this transition from two- to three-dimensional behavior using canonical perturbation theory, Morse theory, and Birkhoff normal forms.  Global bifurcations of critical points and Arnold diffusion will also be investigated.  The results are expected to have immediate impact on several fields under active investigation, such as high-performance computers utilizing quantum computation and the confinement of charged dust grains under the influence of solar radiation pressure.<br/><br/>Axisymmetric systems have circular symmetry about an axis;  a communication satellite in geosynchronous orbit about Earth is an example.  In reality the Earth has small longitudinal deviations from sphericity, causing a geosynchronous satellite to wander in the sky rather than remain directly overhead, unless it is carefully placed at a stable longitude.  Nevertheless, its orbit remains very nearly circular.  This simple example illustrates a nearly axisymmetric system with quasi-two-dimensional behavior.  This project investigates the detailed dynamics of such nearly axisymmetric systems.  The resulting increased quantitative understanding will greatly aid in design, numerical simulation, and operation of such systems.  Other (much more complex) examples include two-ion motion in ion traps, which are often constructed to be slightly elliptical rather than circular, and the orbits of small moonlets that have been recently discovered about many asteroids. <br/>"

The influence may be detrimental or beneficial.  For example, barium-rich YBCO films may loose their superconducting properties but, on the other hand, islands on YBCO films may act as pinning centers for the magnetic field.  Further applications of phase segregation and the formation of secondary-phase islands are found in quantum dots and wires in semiconductors.  Understanding the mechanisms underlying phase segregation and the stability of secondary-phase islands is therefore crucial for the design and controllability of thin films.  One objective of the present research project is to provide, in the context of deposition of multispecies thin films, a mathematically rigorous and thermodynamically consistent derivation of the equations governing the evolution, away from equilibrium, of interfacial triple junctions along which the film, vapor, and secondary phases intersect.  Such a continuum model lends itself to a stability analysis and may thus shed light on the conditions under which surface precipitates can be expected to form and grow.  When the film surface is a vicinal one, growth can occur via step flow---that is, lateral motion of atomic-high steps which separate several-unit-cell-wide terraces.  In multicomponent films, the deposition of gas-phase atoms can be competitive---that is, adsorption of distinct species on individual terraces can occur on the same site.  The second objective of this proposal is to develop a micromechanical model for multicomponent films that accounts for the combined effects of the terrace-and-ledge microstructure, adatom diffusion, and competitive adsorption-desorption kinetics.  A third objective of this project is to link the nanoscale to the microscopic scale by incorporating averaged information obtained by homogenization of the micromechanical model of film growth discussed above into macroscopic models in the form of constitutive relations.<br/><br/>Thin films constitute a fundamental component of numerous novel technologies.  Examples include semiconductors in micro- and opto-electronic device applications, diamonds in industrial cutting tools, various anticorrosion and antiwear coats, shape-memory alloys as actuators in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and superconductors in wireless communication devices.  In most industrial applications, multispecies films are more widely used than their single-component counterparts.  The properties of these films and their performance under very stringent conditions depend on their chemical composition and the morphological details of the film surface.  To better control the chemistry and microstructure of thin films during the growth process, a mathematically rigorous understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical mechanisms at play is necessary, especially as the atom-by-atom fabrication of materials is no longer a remote dream.  Applied mathematicians can (and already do) make a significant contribution to such a global effort by developing physically sound predictive models which can be analyzed rigorously and implemented for numerical simulations.  The concepts of modern continuum physics, when combined with the tools of modern mathematics (for example, homogenization and the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations), constitute a potent methodology with which to address many of the challenging issues related to the growth of multicomponent thin films.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The common theme of these mechanisms is that they involve transport phenomena caused by diffusion and nonlinearities. Examples of such transitions are backfiring instabilities of fronts, period-doubling bifurcations of spiral waves, and the effect of inhomogeneities on the dynamics of spiral waves. While transport is most conveniently modeled and described using an idealized unbounded domain, boundaries may well enhance or inhibit the instability through partial reflection or generation of waves. It is the aim of this project to develop techniques that can help to investigate instability mechanisms simultaneously on bounded and unbounded domains. One of the expected outcomes will be a description of instability mechanisms that is robust with respect to typical boundary conditions in large reactors. Technically, our approach is based on methods from spatial dynamics that allow us to derive sharp pointwise estimates which capture explicitly the effects of boundaries.<br/><br/>Complicated spatio-temporal patterns that arise due to the interplay of chemical reactions and diffusion have been observed experimentally in a number of specific reactions (among them the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction and the chlorite-iodide-malonic acid reaction). Similar phenomena have been observed during fibrillation of cardiac tissue where spiral waves act as organizing centers for the complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Other examples where irregular patterns occur are the interaction of pulses in oscillatory media, backfiring of excitation pulses in catalytic reactions, and optical bistability in nonlinear photonic gratings. The focus of this project is to analyze some of these instability mechanisms by analytical means. This will not only further our understanding of pattern formation in chemical and biological systems, but will eventually allow for a systematic control of patterns, for instance, in the catalytic oxidation of carbon-monoxide and in the propagation of calcium waves in intracellular tissue. <br/><br/>"

A typical problem is to determine the present decision that <br/>minimizes expected cost.  While much knowledge has been gained from <br/>the investigation of two-stage models, a limited view of many-stage <br/>stochastic programming has resulted in which multistage problems are <br/>considered as simple extensions of the two-stage case.

Briefly, spectral functions are mappings of the spectrum <br/>of real or complex valued matrices to the real numbers. Two <br/>examples are the spectral abscissa (the maximum real part of the <br/>spectrum) and the spectral radius (the maximum modulus of the <br/>spectrum). The spectral abscissa and the spectral radius play an <br/>important role in understanding the asymptotic behavior of <br/>continuous and discrete dynamical systems, respectively.

The particular <br/>research outlined in this proposal focuses on optimization <br/>problems that are closely related to the stability properties of <br/>systems that evolve with time. In particular, it impacts the design <br/>of structures such as buildings and aircraft that are subject to <br/>temporal deformations from environmental factors such as an <br/>earthquake or a wind-shear.

The influence may be detrimental or beneficial.  For example, barium-rich YBCO films may loose their superconducting properties but, on the other hand, islands on YBCO films may act as pinning centers for the magnetic field.  Further applications of phase segregation and the formation of secondary-phase islands are found in quantum dots and wires in semiconductors.  Understanding the mechanisms underlying phase segregation and the stability of secondary-phase islands is therefore crucial for the design and controllability of thin films.  One objective of the present research project is to provide, in the context of deposition of multispecies thin films, a mathematically rigorous and thermodynamically consistent derivation of the equations governing the evolution, away from equilibrium, of interfacial triple junctions along which the film, vapor, and secondary phases intersect.  Such a continuum model lends itself to a stability analysis and may thus shed light on the conditions under which surface precipitates can be expected to form and grow.  When the film surface is a vicinal one, growth can occur via step flow---that is, lateral motion of atomic-high steps which separate several-unit-cell-wide terraces.  In multicomponent films, the deposition of gas-phase atoms can be competitive---that is, adsorption of distinct species on individual terraces can occur on the same site.  The second objective of this proposal is to develop a micromechanical model for multicomponent films that accounts for the combined effects of the terrace-and-ledge microstructure, adatom diffusion, and competitive adsorption-desorption kinetics.  A third objective of this project is to link the nanoscale to the microscopic scale by incorporating averaged information obtained by homogenization of the micromechanical model of film growth discussed above into macroscopic models in the form of constitutive relations.<br/><br/>Thin films constitute a fundamental component of numerous novel technologies.  Examples include semiconductors in micro- and opto-electronic device applications, diamonds in industrial cutting tools, various anticorrosion and antiwear coats, shape-memory alloys as actuators in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and superconductors in wireless communication devices.  In most industrial applications, multispecies films are more widely used than their single-component counterparts.  The properties of these films and their performance under very stringent conditions depend on their chemical composition and the morphological details of the film surface.  To better control the chemistry and microstructure of thin films during the growth process, a mathematically rigorous understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical mechanisms at play is necessary, especially as the atom-by-atom fabrication of materials is no longer a remote dream.  Applied mathematicians can (and already do) make a significant contribution to such a global effort by developing physically sound predictive models which can be analyzed rigorously and implemented for numerical simulations.  The concepts of modern continuum physics, when combined with the tools of modern mathematics (for example, homogenization and the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations), constitute a potent methodology with which to address many of the challenging issues related to the growth of multicomponent thin films.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

It is therefore a grand<br/>scientific challenge to derive global climate  models which are reliable <br/>and trustworthy. Exploiting certain geophysical balances, such as <br/>geostrophic balance (due to earth rotation) or hydrostatic balance <br/>(due to the shallowness of the ocean and atmosphere) geophysicists derive<br/> reasonable, yet less complex, balanced models. It is therefore essential to <br/>justify rigorously the  validity of these models, for the relevant spatial<br/>and time scales. The focus  of the proposed project is on the analytical,<br/>statistical and numerical properties of solutions to nonlinear ocean <br/>dynamics models and turbulent sub-grid models. The first aspect of this <br/>project is to: show existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on <br/>initial data, to some of these reduced geophysical models. In particular, <br/>a two-layer zonal jet model, a planetary geostrophic ``thermocline'' model, <br/>the lake equations with degenerate varying bottom topography and the <br/>two-dimensional primitive equations. This is the first and the most essential <br/>step in validating the derivation of these  models. In order to justify the <br/>long-time behavior of fluid dynamical models, one has to compare the statistical <br/>properties of their attracting invariant sets, rather than compare individual<br/>solutions. To do so, it is necessary to focus on models which include some <br/>mechanism of dissipation. This project addresses questions related to the asymptotic <br/>derivation of these models and the effect of numerical dissipation on their <br/>solutions, which include boundary layer analysis. The second aspect of this<br/>project is to: derive new large-eddy simulation models, the so-called alpha-models, <br/>in the context  of the  two-layers geostrophic zonal jet models. The alpha-models <br/>are asserted to reproduce the right energy spectrum for a wide range  of large <br/>scales. It is proposed to investigate  this claim using rigorous analytical tools. <br/>It is also proposed to perform computational tests on the newly derived two-layers <br/>geostrophic zonal jet alpha-model to verify the above assertion. Furthermore, <br/>it is proposed to explore the implementation of the alpha-models approach as <br/>sub-grid models. <br/><br/>The grand challenge in climate prediction is that the mathematical equations <br/>governing the ocean and atmosphere dynamics, are too difficult to study <br/>analytically, and still prohibitively expensive computationally. Indeed, <br/>it is well established, based on physical grounds and collected experimental <br/>data, that atmospheric and oceanic turbulent flows involve a broad spectrum <br/>of spatial and time scales. This in turn  makes them inaccessible  to the most <br/>powerful  and state-of-the-art computers. However, due to the rotation of the <br/>earth and other geophysical situations, such as the shallowness of the oceans <br/>and the atmosphere - in the sense that they are much wider than they are deep - <br/>geophysicists take advantage of certain geophysical balances to derive simplified<br/>balanced models. The first theme of this project is to: establish existence <br/>and regularity of solutions to some of these nonlinear reduced models. This is<br/>a crucial step  in justifying the derivation  of these models and their<br/>consistency with the physical observations for the relevant length  and time <br/>scales. Furthermore, in global climate prediction one is interested in the <br/>long-time statistical features of the climate. The second theme of this project <br/>is to develop a systematic approach for deriving and studying  new averaged <br/>models, in the context of ocean and atmosphere dynamics, which are reliable in <br/>reproducing the correct long-term statistics."

The bodies are composed of nonlinearly elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, viscoplastic, or magnetoelastic materials.  In each case, properly invariant, geometrically exact theories encompassing general nonlinear constitutive equations are to be used.

Homogenization is the common theme of all four areas, and it is expected that the proposed work will result in the development of new homogenization techniques and tools.  The first area concerns the discrete network approximation for highly packed high-contrast composites.  The main objective is to characterize the dependence of the effective transport properties of composites on the shapes and random locations of the filling particles in a rigorous mathematical framework with a controlled error estimate.  Our objective in the second area is to obtain analytical formulas for the effective properties of composites.  Such formulas reveal the explicit dependence of the effective properties on geometrical and physical parameters and provide a valuable physical insight, which can be used to test numerical algorithms developed for generic situations.  The important practical issue of polydispersity will be addressed from different perspectives in the first as well as the second area, and the results will be compared. The third area concerns the rheology of complex fluids such as polymeric composites, suspensions and micellar fluids.  The main features here are: (i) the interaction between micellar tubes or balls, which leads to a drastic change in the effective constitutive equations as compared with the constitutive law of the phases, (ii) the laminarization of the flow and drag reduction in viscoelastic flows (reduction in pressure).  The fourth area is the exploration of novel features of homogenization for some nonlinear problems with nonstandard boundary conditions arising in modeling of superconductors and liquid crystals.  The main objective is to characterize the dependence of the homogenization limit on the domain size and to explore the ramification of this size effect in physical problems.<br/><br/>Composite materials are of critical technological importance.

The first part deals with a fundamental theoretical question of dynamics: To understand the nature of physically observable chaos.  Despite the great amount of work done over the past five decades, the fundamental question of demonstrating genuine chaotic behavior in a physically realistic differential equation has not been answered.  The answer seems finally within grasp, due to incremental progress in understanding two-dimensional mappings on the one hand and some new insights into differential equations on the other.  The second part of the project deals with rapidly vibrating systems.  High-frequency oscillations lead to fascinating phenomena, which have found their use in such areas as particle confinement, particle accelerators, and laser tweezers.  A recent observation of the author shed a new light on these phenomena and opened connections with other fields, which will be further explored in this project, along with possible new applications.  The third part of the project deals with the mathematical analysis of a geometrical object (a class of area-preserving cylinder maps) which is of independent mathematical interest on the one hand and gives insight into physical systems on the other.  These systems include (i) charged particles in magnetic fields, (ii) the Frenkel-Kontorova model of an equilibrium configuration of electrons in a crystal lattice, and (iii) arrays of Josephson junctions.<br/><br/>This project involves three different research directions.  The first direction addresses a major gap in our understanding of how chaos really manifests itself in physical systems.  Surprising as it may seem, despite the large amount of sometimes deep work in the field of ""chaos,"" chaotic behavior has not been proven (understood in the mathematical sense) in realistic physical systems.  The nature of chaos has really been understood only in mathematical models that are too simplified to include some key features of real systems (although even those simplified models can be quite complex).  The theory, however, has reached a level where such understanding seems finally within grasp.  A mathematical proof of the existence of chaos for a realistic physical system would be the culmination of a long development over the past five decades or more.  The second direction of the project deals with the study of physical systems with rapid oscillations, where phenomena occur that are both utterly fascinating and useful.  For example, subjecting the end of an open bicycle chain to high-frequency vibrations will, in theory, enable the chain to stand up stably (!) on its end.  The theory which underlies this curiosity is also responsible for the workings of such seemingly unrelated devices as particle traps, particle accelerators, laser tweezers (which allow one to move a particle inside a cell by a laser beam without breaking the cell wall), and acoustic levitators.  Over the past few years, the author has found an explanation of these effects; prior theory predicted the result but did not answer the ""why.""  The explanation opened new directions, which we plan to explore further.  We plan, in particular, to better understand the concept of vibrational control and explore the use of vibration for filtering (using acoustic waves).  The third direction is of basic mathematical interest but has significance in several physical situations.  The mathematical theory will give insight, otherwise inaccessible, into at least three different phenomena: (i) the behavior of particles in magnetic fields of certain patterns; (ii) the electric conductivity of certain types of crystals, and (iii) the electric behavior of some arrays of Josephson junctions known as superconducting quantum interference devices (the so-called SQUIDS).<br/><br/>"

The objective is to uncover the mathematical structure of possible blowup flows suggested by the PI previous investigations. Two projects are planned. The first will be to use advanced computational techniques to reveal the asymptotic behavior associated with collapse and blowup. Previous work indicates that there exists an inner Leray-type self-similar solution which exhibits a finite-time singularity, a regular  outer solution and a matching region of poloidal vorticity. The other project expands upon the observation that all candidate blowup flows found by all investigators have one or more discrete symmetries and can be associated with the finite number of point and space groups. All fluid field variables can be associated with irreducible representations. How the characteristics of the discrete point groups, such as degeneracy, commutivity, associated lattices and space groups effect flow solutions will be explored. <br/><br/>The equations that govern the motion of an incompressible fluid, such as water, are routinely used by engineers and scientists for design and research. The most fundamental question about these equations, however, has been open for more than 250 years and reflects directly on the validity of using these equations as a model of fluid flow: whether solutions remain smooth or blowup in finite time. Finding an answer to this question for frictionless flow is addressed in this work. It is a very challenging problem computationally and will be a severe test on modern numerical  techniques. Because of its importance, the related viscous problem has been selected as one of seven Clay Millennium prize problems regarded as the Hilbert problems for this century.  <br/>"

The influence may be detrimental or beneficial.  For example, barium-rich YBCO films may loose their superconducting properties but, on the other hand, islands on YBCO films may act as pinning centers for the magnetic field.  Further applications of phase segregation and the formation of secondary-phase islands are found in quantum dots and wires in semiconductors.  Understanding the mechanisms underlying phase segregation and the stability of secondary-phase islands is therefore crucial for the design and controllability of thin films.  One objective of the present research project is to provide, in the context of deposition of multispecies thin films, a mathematically rigorous and thermodynamically consistent derivation of the equations governing the evolution, away from equilibrium, of interfacial triple junctions along which the film, vapor, and secondary phases intersect.  Such a continuum model lends itself to a stability analysis and may thus shed light on the conditions under which surface precipitates can be expected to form and grow.  When the film surface is a vicinal one, growth can occur via step flow---that is, lateral motion of atomic-high steps which separate several-unit-cell-wide terraces.  In multicomponent films, the deposition of gas-phase atoms can be competitive---that is, adsorption of distinct species on individual terraces can occur on the same site.  The second objective of this proposal is to develop a micromechanical model for multicomponent films that accounts for the combined effects of the terrace-and-ledge microstructure, adatom diffusion, and competitive adsorption-desorption kinetics.  A third objective of this project is to link the nanoscale to the microscopic scale by incorporating averaged information obtained by homogenization of the micromechanical model of film growth discussed above into macroscopic models in the form of constitutive relations.<br/><br/>Thin films constitute a fundamental component of numerous novel technologies.  Examples include semiconductors in micro- and opto-electronic device applications, diamonds in industrial cutting tools, various anticorrosion and antiwear coats, shape-memory alloys as actuators in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and superconductors in wireless communication devices.  In most industrial applications, multispecies films are more widely used than their single-component counterparts.  The properties of these films and their performance under very stringent conditions depend on their chemical composition and the morphological details of the film surface.  To better control the chemistry and microstructure of thin films during the growth process, a mathematically rigorous understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical mechanisms at play is necessary, especially as the atom-by-atom fabrication of materials is no longer a remote dream.  Applied mathematicians can (and already do) make a significant contribution to such a global effort by developing physically sound predictive models which can be analyzed rigorously and implemented for numerical simulations.  The concepts of modern continuum physics, when combined with the tools of modern mathematics (for example, homogenization and the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations), constitute a potent methodology with which to address many of the challenging issues related to the growth of multicomponent thin films.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Many famous mathematicians have made significant <br/>contributions in the last century to this area, but it is widely held that the <br/>time is ripe for a new round of discoveries to be made. Solutions of these <br/>problems typically rely on tools from a wide range of mathematical <br/>areas and potentially have a significant impact on the study of important <br/>physical applications. The purpose of this conference is to assemble as <br/>many experts as is possible in this research area, in order to discuss and <br/>catalog the area's most important open (unsolved) problems and the <br/>methods that might be used to attack them. Numerical investigations <br/>(using a computer to visualize and approximate solutions and their <br/>properties) are gaining respect in the mathematical community, but their <br/>power is not yet fully appreciated by many in the established research <br/>world, nor are they yet accessible to many of those who do appreciate <br/>that power. This modern approach will be integrated with traditional <br/>(non computer-related) discussions via numerical lectures and hands-on <br/>technological demonstrations. Special attention will be given to physical <br/>applications, in order to facilitate our contributing to real-world science <br/>and to provide a source of renewed inspiration for our endeavors.<br/><br/>The driving force for this conference is a desire to produce a highly <br/>usable, in fact essential, reference for those actively researching in the <br/>area and for young mathematicians just starting their careers. Both <br/>groups will benefit greatly from having a single succinct catalog of good <br/>research problems together with an introduction to the most fruitful <br/>relevant mathematical tools and an exhaustive bibliography. A publisher <br/>(American Mathematical Society Journal of Contemporary <br/>Mathematics) has already provisionally accepted a proposal for <br/>publishing this document. The conference will encourage informal <br/>discussion about the future of our field, the potential for it to make <br/>significant contributions to the sciences, and how best to put all this <br/>information in a single proceedings volume.<br/><br/>The focus of the discussed research will be on nonlinear elliptic partial <br/>differential equations, a key application of variational methods. <br/>Nonlinear equations in general are vital to the description of physical <br/>phenomena, and elliptic equations describe (roughly speaking) one third <br/>of these. The efficient harvesting of biological mass, modeling of star <br/>birth and death, and the fundamental equations governing quantum <br/>physics all rely on elliptic equations. Significant progress in this research <br/>area has the potential to make a real difference, scientifically and <br/>economically, to the world at large. The aim is to trigger a vibrant <br/>renewed surge of interest and effort towards solving these types of <br/>problems. The conference and corresponding proceedings volume will <br/>be of equal parts research and educationally oriented. Beginning <br/>researchers will be exposed to research in mathematics to the physical <br/>importance of the field, unsolved problems will be suggested for their <br/>pursuit, and analytical and numerical tools essential to that research will <br/>be introduced. These new researchers who attend or, more generally, <br/>have access to the resulting proceedings volume, will in the long run be <br/>the key contributors. The aim is to encourage informal discussion, where <br/>real mathematics is done, but guide the process with a focus on the <br/>ultimate goal of producing a cohesive document.<br/>"

These frameworks will allow us to further construct many universally applicable inpainting models, and design their efficient and robust computational algorithms. Our proposed approach is to employ several high level mathematical tools for the modeling and computation of inpainting, which include the Bayesian decision theory, nonlinear partial differential equations (e.g. mean curvature motions, nonlinear transport and diffusion), variational methods in the space of Bounded Variations and for free boundary problems, a variety of state-of-the-art tools from harmonics analysis such as wavelets and multiresolution analysis, and many efficient schemes in numerical analysis and computational partial differential equations. The project is also highlighted by the fact that we are proposing for the first time to integrate visually important curve, surface, and image geometry into the traditionally statistical models and dynamic processes. <br/><br/>Digital inpainting is to develop an automatic process to intelligently recover and complete the missing, unavailable, or purposely disguised image information. Such loss of information occurs ubiquitously in a   variety of important fields including computer vision, network (especially wireless) communication, robust image coding and transmission (from the Hubble Space Telescope for example), three-dimensional volumetric organ reconstruction from two-dimensional medical images, disguise of enemy weapons and personnel in the battlefields, and the digital restoration of cracked   ancient paintings in digitized fine art museums. This project will develop a mathematical framework for image inpainting. Besides the broad impact on the numerous important fields mentioned above, the project will also strengthen the integration of high level pure mathematics into the contemporary digital, computer, and artificial intelligence technology, and in return, create numerous opportunities for mathematical modeling, analysis, and computation. It will also help the principal investigator develop new curricula and train new graduate students in this booming fresh field of applied mathematics.<br/><br/>Date: May 22, 2002<br/>"

It will bring together leading world class experts in the newest numerical methods for delay equations, in the most recent aspects of high performance supercomputers, and in the most important applications (especially biological) that lead to Volterra problems.  It will, for the first time, emphasize research and applications in the newly developing vast area of delay and Volterra partial differential and integral equations.  The subject of Volterra equations includes functional differential equations (delay, advanced, and neutral) as well as delay and Volterra partial differential equations.  <br/><br/>Volterra equations have have important and crucial applications as models in diverse areas of science and engineering; e.g. biomathematics and medical science, population dynamics, control theory, electrodynamics, neutron transport theory, oscillation theory, and viscoelasticity.  These applications arise in a variety of critical areas such as modeling of the spread of infectious diseases and biological agents like anthrax and smallpox, the design of nuclear reactors and weapons, aerospace technology, the guidance of drone weapons and intelligence vehicles, and even the design of super computers themselves.  Since the solution of Volterra and delay equations can almost never be obtained in closed form, computational techniques must be used.  By their nature, Volterra problems create enormous demands on computing resources (both on computer speed and memory) and therefore require the use of extremely high performance super computers. This conference will bring together the experts in these areas and will help to stimulate various research efforts.<br/><br/>Date: June 25, 2002<br/>"

The conference will mark the 25th anniversary of the first ETOPIM conference, which was held in Columbus, Ohio, in 1977, and will be the second ETOPIM conference held in the US.<br/><br/>The electrical transport and optical properties of composites and inhomogeneous media are of fundamental importance to a broad range of highly interdisciplinary problems throughout science and engineering.  Photonic crystals and band-gap structures, semiconductors, porous media and rocks, conducting polymers, electrical activity in the heart and brain, composites with negative index of refraction, electrorheological fluids, optical networking, smart slime molds, optimal design of composite microstructures, imaging in geophysical, medical and industrial applications, transport in nanostructures, and the role of sea ice microstrucural and optical properties in polar biology and climate, are all examples of such problems.  ETOPIM 6 will address a broad array of active areas in the physics and engineering of inhomogeneous materials and expand the coverage of previous ETOPIM conferences to include problems of current interest in the biological, geophysical and mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>The conference is expected to have over 100 participant, representing 22 countries throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Oceania, as well as North and Latin America.  Within the USA, 21 states will be represented.  The program will consist of more than 30 invited lectures, about 60 contributed papers, and 20 posters.  Most of the talks, invited and contributed, will be in series.  Parallel minisymposia have been scheduled to focus on mathematical methods in homogenization, porous media and percolation problems in hydrology, and experimental results on random lasers and conducting polymers.  Through planned activities at the conference as well as recruiting, the conference organizers will try to maximize  the participation of younger researchers, from postdoctoral associates to graduate and undergraduate students, provide career development opportunities for them, and encourage interactions between junior and senior researchers.<br/><br/> <br/>"

Mathematics is<br/>well-suited to sorting out the interplay among the many forces<br/>(mechanical, electrochemical, and biochemical) that determine<br/>biogel structure and function.  The investigators use<br/>mathematical tools to explore four closely related problems of<br/>biogel growth and dynamics, with an emphasis on pattern-forming<br/>mechanisms and the relationship between pattern and function.<br/>The four problems are biofilm and blood clot formation and<br/>function, gastric protection of the stomach, and the behavior of<br/>biogels in contact with a moving fluid.  Models are developed to<br/>understand how physical properties such as the viscoelastic<br/>constitutive properties and the gel morphology are determined and<br/>controlled, and how these properties affect the biological<br/>function of the biogel.  The investigators use analytical and<br/>computational tools to examine gel growth and dynamics on<br/>different scales using various models (continuum, discrete,<br/>isotropic, anisotropic), while attempting to incorporate what is<br/>known experimentally, and to expand the experimental database<br/>about specific biogel systems.<br/>     Biogels are composites of water, filamentous protein<br/>networks, and other chemicals, and are increasingly recognized as<br/>having profound influence on the function of many biological<br/>systems.

The project includes derivation and mathematical analysis of models, development of algorithms for the approximation of solutions, implementation of the algorithms as computer codes, comparisons of the output of numerical simulations with field data, the use of the models for prediction and their development as a tool for effective coastal engineering.  The basic issue under consideration is challenging in that it involves the temporal evolution of two free surfaces whose dynamics are connected in a complex and nonlinear way.  The wave motion involves the deformation of the water's  surface, or in the case of internal waves, the pycnoclines.  Even over a fixed bottom, these issues are difficult in their exact formulation, and consequently model equations are typically used.  In the present conception, the bottom is not fixed, and this added complexity is what makes the issues proposed here for study scientifically very interesting.  In view are three-dimensional models that are initiated by incoming wave fields from deep water.   These models will allow for long-shore variation and take account of reflection.  It is planned to develop such models and to test them extensively against both laboratory experiments and field observation.  Comparisons are in view at several sites around the world, including the Field Research Facility of the US Army Corps of Engineers at Duck, NC, a site of the Polish Academy of Sciences on the Baltic Sea, the North Coast of the Magdelan Islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Gold Coast of Australia, the Island of Djerba off the Tunisian coast and two regions in Morocco (Alger in the Gibraltar Strait and Agadir on the Atlantic coast).      <br/><br/>The motivation for carrying out the study outlined above is several-fold.  First is the pure science of the subject.  The project involves interesting and substantial issues from hydrodynamics, partial differential equations, and sediment transport theory.  Secondly, it is an ideal venue in which to acquaint students with interdisciplinary research.  There is a strong practical reason for this study as well.  The erosion and retreat of coastlines is a worldwide phenomenon.  Global warming will increase the activity of storms, raise the sea level, and further degrade the present, sometimes catastrophic state of many beaches.  Fragile Arctic coasts, beaches on the Great lakes and on many coastal regions already display the unmistakable signs of deterioration caused by these global changes and aggravated by social developmental pressure.  Severe erosion is likely to spread to many coastal areas within half a century and thus increase the demand for effective prevention methods.  The present project aims at deepening our understanding of fundamental wave-bottom interaction processes, especially as regards sediment dispersal. Going beyond the science, the project also grapples with the intelligent use of this kind of knowledge in designing coastal protection strategies.  With experience already in hand, it is clear that there are a variety of protection options and that it is not always smart to simply build some permanent, often-ugly structure.  So-called 'soft' protection methods are a useful addition to the reperatoire of the coastal engineer.  These are much less expensive when they can be made to work.   The assessment of the practicality of a protection plan, be it 'hard' or 'soft' relies upon the kind of knowledge investigated under the auspices of this project. <br/><br/>"

Stability of a fluid flow is one of the most basic problems in fluid dynamics: stable flows are robust under the inevitable disturbances in the environment, while unstable flows may break up, sometimes rapidly. The investigator will continue to  explore the relations between different types of instability with the goal of defining  scales or degrees of instability. Sufficient conditions are sought to demonstrate nonlinear instability for classes of inviscid fluids. Another topic studied in the project is the equation for a viscous fluid when there is a nonlinear relation between the stress and strain tensors (a so-called non-Newtonian fluid ). A fundamental mathematical question asked for any of the fluid equations is the possibility of the development of singularities in finite time. Motivated by results from a dyadic model for the non-Newtonian equations, the investigator and collaborators use techniques of wavelets and Littlewood -Paley theory to give an upper bound on the dimension of the singular set in the case of the Navier Stokes equations with nonlinear viscosity.   <br/><br/>The greater portion of our world is composed of fluids: e.g., the atmosphere, the oceans, even our own bodies. However fluids behave in very complex ways that are presently understood only to a very minor degree. This project uses rigorous mathematics to examine several questions that are fundamantal to the nature of fluid motion. These include the stability or instability of a fluid configuration. In the view of many scientists, waves and instabilities lie at the heart of long term weather prediction  with all its practical implications for global change and the world economy. Another topic under investigation concerns fluids with a nonlinear viscous force relation. This happens, for example, in models for turbulent eddies and also in fluids with a special molecular structure such a blood or some polymers. The investigator seeks to bound the development of singularities (e.g. infinite energy spikes) in the motion of such fluids. <br/><br/><br/>Date: April 26, 2002<br/>"

To<br/>decide on what is a good method to search out a given item in<br/>some database, or a good method for storing music or video with<br/>minimal use of memory, it is important to analyze the method or<br/>algorithm.  For example, one might ask for the average search<br/>time, or for the likelihood that the search time will be very<br/>long, exceeding some prescribed tolerance.  Such questions involve<br/>the ""analysis of algorithms.""   They can frequently be reduced to<br/>solving certain classes of equations.  The investigator and<br/>colleagues develop mathematical tools for obtaining solutions of<br/>these equations, either exact ones or accurate approximations.<br/>Approximations are often sufficient, because for example the<br/>searching problem is most important if the total number of items<br/>stored is very large.  This ""largeness"" shows up as a parameter in<br/>the governing equation that facilitates its solution.  Related<br/>mathematical problems arise in other important areas such as<br/>molecular biology and communications, and the investigators'<br/>methods and results should thus find applicability to a wide<br/>range of problems.<br/>"

One sees them on windswept sand dunes, as ripples on long sandy beaches, on plant skins and animal coats, as fingerprints, on optical beams, in cloud formations.  The striking similarities between the textures of patterns and their defects which arise in diverse microscopic situations lead one to the conclusion that patterns are macroscopic objects whose behaviors are well described almost everywhere by universal equations that reflect overall symmetry properties shared by the individual systems.  For example, the triradius defect on each human fingertip is also seen on optical beams and in magnetic materials. The reason is not that there is any fundamental connection between light and the fetal epidermis but rather that in both contexts the system under stress is two dimensional with translational and rotational invariance.  The equations describing the overall pattern will be the same.  The central goal of this research is to develop a global description of such stationary patterns far from onset.  Up to now, certain individual parts of the textures were well understood, but there was no theory, for example, to say what the total convection pattern would be in an elliptical container whose side walls were heated.<br/><br/>This research project will investigate the common mathematical structure that underlies the diverse occurrence of patterns in nature.  The work will contribute to the understanding and prediction of important physical phenomena.<br/>"

This includes developments in computational algorithms.  For instance, recent advances in variational integration algorithms have produced state of the art collision codes, for example, for collisions between elastic bodies and elastic shells.  The work in this proposal further develops the mathematical framework that led to these algorithms in the first place.  This includes proving, in a precise sense, that the algorithms respect the special structure of mechanics, such as conservation laws.  In addition, studying the effect of symmetry on such algorithms and factoring out this symmetry directly on the discrete level is an important aspect of these algorithms which is only understood in special cases at the moment; this proposal will develop and extend these techniques.  Another area where symmetry and geometric techniques are important is that of the control of mechanical systems (such as how rotors are used to control spacecraft orientation).  Symmetry reduction for the control of such mechanical systems is one of the techniques that will be developed under this grant.<br/>"

The second approach to<br/>investigate the well-posedness and long-time behavior of<br/>solutions is based on the monotone approximation and comparison<br/>results that have been successfully established for the<br/>semilinear case by the investigators.

For many stellar environments the Mach number, the ratio of flame or convection speed to the sound speed, is very small (order .01 or less) so that for explicit computations based on full hydrodynamics timesteps are limited by the acoustic speeds, thus requiring excessive computation time to simulate the relatively long timescales associated with the deflagrations and associated convection flows.  Our model filters out the sound waves while accounting for strong vertical pressure stratification (of the order of ten orders of magnitude).  The model is based on initially pre-computing a strongly stratified hydrostatic solution by solving a boundary value problem in the vertical coordinate. The hydrodynamic equations are then expanded about this solution. The resulting system for the velocities and the non-hydrostatic pressure is then expanded in Mach number, effectively filtering out sound waves and yielding a system where timesteps are restricted by fluid and flame speeds rather than the sound speed.  The new model will be applied to the study of convection in the envelope of an accreting white dwarf during a nova outburst.  The model will allow simulation over convective timescales and thus allow a theoretical description of the multi-dimensional nuclear burning development of novae.<br/><br/>We propose to simulate the hydrodynamics of nuclear fluids in a stellar envelope in which sound waves are filtered out.  It is typical of such environments that energy is released via nuclear reactions in a manner similar to terrestrial combustion (nuclear combustion). In many such configurations the flame speed and associated fluid speeds are much smaller than the sound speed. This limits the length of time for which these models can be solved and effectively precludes a simulation of phenomena associated with the burning and convection.  For example, a simulation of burning in a neutron star envelope required approximately 30,000 hours net processor time, i.e., the time for all processors on a parallel Silicon Graphics computer, for  approximately 200 milliseconds of simulated time.  For this problem, the burning and convection timescales were of the order of minutes, e.g., about 5 minutes.  Thus, a simulation and computer analysis of such phenomena would be prohibitive using current models. We anticipate that such analyses would be feasible with the proposed new model, because acoustic effects would be eliminated.  The model will be used to study the nature of white dwarf novae, and in particular to resolve competing theories regarding the role of mixing of different species in promoting nova outbursts.  The numerical solution of the model will employ parallel algorithms and computers and thus the project will entail the use of high performance computing to explain observed astrophysical phenomena.<br/><br/>Date: June 21, 2002<br/>"

While the effects of this slip may remain negligible in some flows, accounting for slip is a prerequisite for predicting the correct behavior in many other types of flows, such as those in small geometries, flows in which an interface (between two fluids) moves along a solid, and flows in which particles must pass through an interface.  This project seeks to develop models of the slip boundary condition. The formulation will incorporate results of recent experiments and numerical simulations to construct the equations of flow in the neighborhood of a solid substrate.  Preliminary work indicates that such a model, as well as related useful simpler approximations, can be developed. The simplicity of the equations and consequent efficient numerical procedures for evaluating the dynamics near the wall should provide insight into how slip occurs and how the characteristics of the fluid and the substrate determine the amount and nature of slip. The recent availability of high quality experimental data and simulation results, as well as the advent of technologies demanding flow in small geometries, make this a timely undertaking. <br/><br/>This project concerns mathematical modeling of the behavior of fluids where they adjoin solids.  The results will allow highly accurate computation of fluid flow, which is essential for the design of small hydrodynamical instruments, including ""lab-on-a-chip"" devices.<br/>"

In this setting collisions are ignored while the charge and current densities (which drive the Maxwell system) are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity moments of solutions to the Vlasov equation.  The major question to be studied is this: are there shocks in a three dimensional collisionless plasma?  That is, could a singularity develop from smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses? Smooth global solutions are known to exist in lower dimensional situations (e.g., two space and velocity variables) and when the data are ""small.""<br/><br/>Kinetic Theory includes the study of the motion and properties of plasmas.

Notable examples of collisionless plasmas include the solar wind, the ionosphere, galactic nebulae and comet tails.  The motion of a plasma is described by a number of complicated equations dictated by physics.

The team will consolidate several scattered advances into a unified body of theory and methods to be called Multiscale Geometric Analysis, which can probe the fine structure of 2-, 3- and higher- dimensional functions and point clouds, able to isolate and manipulate intermediate-dimensional phenomena. Simple examples include edges in 2-d images, filaments and sheets in 3-d point catalogs. Characterizing such intermediate-dimensional phenomena is essential for fundamental progress in a wide range of problem areas (including 2-d and 3-d imaging) where traditional multiscale methods have now run their course. Our united effort has three main outcomes. 1. Theory. Coherent, comprehensive knowledge, showing what can and cannot be accomplished with computational harmonic analysis. 2. Tools. A wide range of practical MGA algorithms and a unified, publicly available software environment - BeamLab - deploying them. 3. Applications. Our main initial focus will be on the analysis of 3-d point catalogs in astronomy, such as those coming on-line soon from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We know a priori that the data contain filaments and sheets, embedded in a scattered background, and MGA provides a decisive set of tools to resolve the structural properties of such catalogs, far more sensitive and more comprehensible than any tools currently available for such analysis.<br/><br/>Many new kinds of massive databases are being created in our era's revolutionary transition to a data-rich society.  Many of these databases contain geometric structures such as surfaces, and filaments, albeit in a sometimes hidden manner. Databases of this sort can include galaxy catalogs in astronomy -- in which the filaments and sheets are predicted by various theories of universe formation -- 3-D scanning of faces and other objects -- in which filaments and surfaces are caused by structures such as skin and hair -- and statistical databases in which curves and surfaces arise from existence of predictable patterns. This Focused Research Group on Multiscale Geometric Analysis is a research effort bringing together mathematicians, statisticians, image analysts and astronomers to create new tools and theories to help extract geometric structure and meaning from such databases.  The participants are skilled at multiscale analysis, which will be a central organizational principle. We expect multiscale methods to have an impact here comparable to what wavelets have had over the last twenty years in many other problems in science and technology.<br/>"

There are three fundamental aspects of the <br/>first research area: 1A) The concept of risk adjusted control <br/>(optimization) criteria for investment problems with finite and <br/>infinite planning horizons. More specifically, we shall continue to <br/>develop theory and applications for mean-variance stochastic <br/>control. This kind of control problems is appealing to financial <br/>industry as it extends to more realistic dynamic framework the <br/>classical approach of Harry Markowitz  (1990 Nobel Prize in <br/>Economics).  1B) Development of control methodologies for the <br/>fixed income investment problems with finite planning horizon <br/>coinciding with the maturity of the underlying bond. We shall <br/>attempt to overcome certain singularity problems arising in this <br/>context, which will lead to derivation of applicable fixed income <br/>investment strategies. 1C) Explicit consideration given to statistical <br/>estimation issues. Optimal control methodologies are rarely used in <br/>the financial industry, largely because of statistical difficulties <br/>associated with the estimation of constant drift coefficients in <br/>diffusion process models of individual securities. Practitioners <br/>typically channel their energies into forecasting security returns <br/>based upon exogenous factors such as interest rates and firm-<br/>specific accounting measures. The proposed research will serve to <br/>reduce the gap between theory and practice by developing <br/>optimization models, which explicitly incorporate exogenous <br/>factors. By explicitly modeling the dependence of the assets on <br/>factors, it will be possible to obtain more realistic models, to better <br/>understand the statistical estimation difficulties, and to be in a <br/>position to apply adaptive control methods. The fundamental <br/>aspects of the second research area are: 2A) Explicit consideration <br/>given to possibility of credit migrations of defaultable contingent <br/>claims. This will be done in the context of conditionally Markov <br/>chains both with regard to a single defaultable claim as well as <br/>with regard to several such claims. The latter situation is very <br/>important for applications to basket credit derivatives. 2B) <br/>Development of mathematical theory for hedging of certain classes <br/>of credit derivatives that are vital for financial industry. This will <br/>be done in the context of martingale representations associated <br/>with conditionally Markov chains. 2C) Development of analytical <br/>tools for computation of certain class of functionals of conditional <br/>Markov processes. This will build upon the classical Feynman-Kac <br/>characterizations, and will find applications for valuation and <br/>hedging of some fundamental (basket) credit derivatives such as <br/>default swaps. <br/><br/>Although the proposed research will require fundamental advances <br/>within the areas of applied mathematics, probability, and financial <br/>economics, it is anticipated that the proposed research will lead to <br/>new and practical tools that eventually become widely used in the <br/>financial industry, and possibly in the insurance industry as well. <br/>The main reason for this expectation is that the proposed research <br/>addresses the need of the two industries for quantitative <br/>methodologies that would enable financial and insurance decision <br/>makers to properly manage certain categories of risks. The major <br/>implication of incidence of risks in financial/insurance decision-<br/>making is the possibility of financial losses. In general, neither the <br/>possibility of financial losses, nor their occasional severity, can be <br/>completely eliminated. However, workable tools, such as pricing <br/>and hedging strategies, are sought for controlling some of the risks <br/>underlying financial and insurance industries, so that both the <br/>possibility and severity of losses are kept to minimum. The <br/>proposed research will provide mathematical basis for <br/>development of such tools.<br/>"

For the analysis of data, he will develop frames having small or compact supports,  and having dual frames with other desirable properties. The proposer will study the optimal representation of functions on the manifolds using finitely many bits, rather than real coefficients, and develop algorithms for these representations based on scattered data.  An important new mathematical tool in this study will be quadrature formulas with positive weights based on data near (rather than on) the manifolds, and local quadrature formulas based on data near parts of the manifolds. The research is expected to have applications in the areas of signal processing, analysis of satellite data, and the study of development of tumors.<br/><br/>The problem of approximation of functions on the sphere is a very old one; among the early workers in this area was Gauss. It arises naturally in geodesic studies, for example, the study of the environment, and variations in the gravitational and electromagnetic fields around the earth. The data taken from a satellite is most naturally modelled as a function on the sphere. Additional applications arise in mathematical biology, where the growth of a tumor is modelled by a system of differential equations satisfied by functions on a sphere, which need to be approximated efficiently and accurately in real time. Many recent applications require a study of functions on slight perturbations of the sphere. For example, the data from the satellite may be taken not from the surface of the earth itself (which is not perfectly spherical either), but from different heights above the surface. Similarly, in biological applications, a tumor which may be initially assumed spherical, no longer remains so after its evolution. The proposer will study the analysis and modelling of data collected at arbitrary sites on a nearly spherical manifold, using ideas from wavelet analysis and metric entropy.<br/> <br/>Date: June 18, 2002<br/>"

It is organized into four projects, chosen partly because of their importance in the field of granular materials, but also because they raise intriguing mathematical and scientific issues of broader significance.  The first project attacks a fundamental physical problem: How to include micromechanical effects in a continuum description of granular flow, especially the effect of velocity fluctuations.  The second project concerns the mathematics surrounding multidimensional continuum models for granular flow, specifically the issue of extracting mathematically rigorous information from ill-posed partial differential equations.  The third project proposes to extend Jenike's radial solution for flows in axisymmetric hoppers to conical hoppers with a general cross section.  The fourth project deals with flows of fine granular materials, where the interstitial gas significantly affects the flow. The research program involves coordinated efforts in modeling, analysis, numerical simulations, and experiment.<br/><br/>At the heart of this research project is a basic question concerning the flow of granular materials: ""What behaviors of slowly flowing granular material can be understood in terms of a continuum formulation?""  This question may be viewed as an attempt to reconcile continuum models, used in industrial design and engineering problem solving, with discrete models, introduced to understand the results of small- to medium-scale physical experiments.  Continuum models are highly desirable since they are much more tractable analytically and computationally than particle dynamics simulations, which treat the discreteness of the flow directly.  An important issue that arises from this basic question, and which is addressed in this project, is the form that a continuum description should take.  This issue has been the subject of debate in the engineering literature ever since Janssen in 1895 demonstrated that stresses in a column of granular material do not increase indefinitely with depth, but approach asymptotically to a constant. The research program has significance well beyond the context of granular materials in mathematics as well as physics.  The project is supported by a long-standing industrial collaboration."

(a) To advance existing approaches and to develop new methods for the rigorous asymptotic solution of integrable nonlinear wave equations, primarily the nonlinear Schroedinger equation, in the small dispersion limit; also to understand how the structure of the solution, critically affected by the modulational instability, depends on the degree of smoothness of the initial data.  (b) To develop methods within the theory of integrable and near-integrable wave equations to deal with wave reflection from boundaries and time dependent forcing.

PHOTONIC CRYSTALS, first developed in the eighties, allow light to be trapped in or guided through regions of dimensions comparable to its wavelength. They are already in use in microwave antennas, low threshold lasers and other devices. In most of their current applications they function as linear devices.

There are two goals in this project. One is to develop an applicable model describing motion of soluble substances in a liquid environment. The other is to use existing reaction--diffusion systems and  free boundary  models to study  certain interfacial phenomena that are important in industrial applications. When chemical reactions are concerned, existing models to be used are  reaction--diffusion systems  such as the activator--inhibitor,  FitzHugh--Nagumo, Belousov-Zhabotinsky, Gray--Scott, and  Gierer--Meinhardt. Most of the focus here will be on slow diffusion--fast reaction equations and their singular limits, namely, free boundary problems. A large part of the investigation will be to find solutions related to interfacial phenomena, such as traveling spots, spikes, target patterns, checkerboard patterns, rotating spiral waves, and self--replicating behavior. The underlying investigation for patterns in free boundary problems and reaction--diffusion systems  will  enable  people to predict and to control the seemingly complicated yet natural  interfacial dynamics.  It can also develop mathematical theories and ideas. As a particular example,  certain  evolution equations that do not possess uniqueness and thus classically are regarded as ill--posed, will  be  carefully investigated and  regarded as good models since they reflect the nature in which an unobservable local microscopic change may affect the whole observable macroscopic outcome.  Such a research will be guided by the current industrial needs.<br/><br/>In chemistry, biology, and many applied sciences, it is  common that chemical substances move around in a liquid environment, due to dissolution or chemical reaction. Quite often circular shapes are stable and circular spots move and interact each other like elastic objects, with their own special ``momentum laws"". One purpose of the project is to develop, at least for soluble solids in a liquid medium, a model enabling one to calculate the speed of a traveling spot and the reflection principle---the relationship between the incoming and outgoing angles when a traveling spot bounces off  another  spot or the physical boundary of a container. The model developed for the motion of spots is expected to find useful industrial applications in many areas such as  water contamination control, chemical testing, chemical processing, etc. This project will involve graduate students and stimulate their interest in mathematical problems of practical importance.<br/><br/>Date: June 14, 2002<br/>"

Combined experimental and theoretical studies of water waves recently yielded a characterization of the chaotic evolution in perturbed NLS equations that is generic, observable, and physically significant.  Preliminary analysis indicates that similar results hold in fiber optics.  In this project, further experimental, numerical, and theoretical analysis will be carried out.  The latter includes extending the geometric interpretation of the Floquet discriminant and the associated Melnikov integrals for solutions in the full phase space and obtaining criteria for the existence of homoclinic structures for symmetry-breaking perturbations of the NLS equation.  The implication of these results in the context of homoclinic chaos and the likelihood of rogue wave formation will be examined.  The research also involves the development of efficient, stable multi-symplectic integrators for equations of interest in the water wave and optics problems.  A comparison of the multi-symplectic, energy, and momentum errors to the overall performance of the integrators (including accurate capture of qualitative features of the system) will be carried out.  Error bounds on the approximate preservation of the local conservation laws will be sought.  <br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on mathematical and computational issues central to water wave dynamics and nonlinear optics.  Rogue wave events can have a devastating effect on offshore structures and ships.  The results of this project will address fundamental properties of rogue wave generation and potentially have impact on the design and analysis of structures such as offshore oil rigs.

Three directions of research will be pursued: the analysis of models <br/>in cancer chemotherapy, an analysis of models for HIV-infection and anti-<br/>viral treatment of AIDS, and the design and analysis of a general <br/>mathematical framework which combines common features of both cancer <br/>and HIV models. The investigators will use their previous experience <br/>working on cancer chemotherapy models and apply new tools based on <br/>the method of characteristics and high-order conditions for optimality. In <br/>compartmental models for cancer chemotherapy the cell-cycle is <br/>controlled by clustering its phases into compartments and using phase <br/>specific cytostatic killing and blocking agents. The goal is to maximize the <br/>number of cancer cells that the cytostatic agent in the drug kills while <br/>keeping the toxicity to the normal tissue acceptable. In this project a <br/>synthesis of optimal controls for these models will be constructed. <br/>Furthermore, more complex mathematical models that take into account <br/>additional aspects such as evolving drug resistance or bone marrow <br/>destruction will be analyzed. Due to the complexity of HIV infection, <br/>mathematical models for AIDS have only recently been developed and <br/>still are constantly being revised and updated taking new medical data into <br/>account. With the main attention so far given to the form of the dynamics <br/>that best models the interactions between the virus and the human immune <br/>system under drug treatment, many of these models still have not been <br/>formulated as optimal control problems. The investigators will analyze a <br/>variety of these models in the framework of optimal control and compare <br/>the solutions aiming at a design of optimal treatment protocols.<br/><br/>In the project, the investigators will consider mathematical models in the <br/>chemotherapy of diseases that have a strong cell proliferation aspect such <br/>a cancer or AIDS. These models will be analyzed as optimal control <br/>problems with the drug dosage serving as control parameter with the goal <br/>of maximizing the number of cancer cells killed by the drug in the case of <br/>cancer (respectively maximizing the number of uninfected cells in the case <br/>of chemotherapy for AIDS) while minimizing the harmful side effects and <br/>cost of the chemotherapy. Although individually these problems are very <br/>different in their specifics, they also have many aspects in common and <br/>can be put into one general mathematical model that encompasses them <br/>all. Thus, while on one side there is a need to consider these problems <br/>separately to understand the implications for the underlying disease, on the <br/>other side there are simplifications and insights to be gained by looking at <br/>the general properties common to these models. This project will address <br/>both directions. A biomedical interpretation of the conditions that optimal <br/>controls satisfy will be given in terms understandable by biomedical <br/>personnel and the conditions will be related to the underlying biological <br/>situation. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will be of interest <br/>to the medical community by giving some insights into the analysis of <br/>existing chemotherapy protocols for cancer or HIV and possibly aid in the <br/>design of new improved protocols. These results are particularly important <br/>for HIV treatments which so far do not cure the disease, but only provide a <br/>long-term maintenance program.<br/>"

He will develop and refine singularity detection algorithms (including limited data Lambda CT and wavelet methods) and apply them to electron microscopy and limited data industrial and medical X-ray tomography, with the goal of testing the algorithms on<br/>real data and using them in scanners.  Professor Quinto will continue to develop a boundary detection method that is applicable to Sonar in shallow water, and he will begin to develop these methods for synthetic aperture Radar.  The theoretical underpinnings will be based on Professor Quinto's pure mathematical research.  Radon transforms have an intimate relation to harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and complex analysis, and he will use integral geometry to prove theorems in these fields.  The principal investigator will prove uniqueness and support theorems for Radon transforms defined by spreads of polynomials, including spherical<br/>transforms in Euclidean space and other settings.  He and Professor Agranovsky will use these results to characterize zero sets of solutions of the wave equation on crystallographic domains and other sets.  Zero sets, where the solution is zero for all time, are important and difficult to characterize.  He will prove uniqueness theorems for Radon transforms on spheres and other surfaces and use these to solve Morera and mean value problems on manifolds.  He will<br/>prove support theorems for X-ray transforms.<br/><br/>This research encompasses both applied and pure mathematics: tomography and integral geometry.  The pure research will be used to develop, understand, and justify the applied<br/>algorithms, and the applied problems will motivate much of the pure research.  Computed tomography (CT) algorithms will be developed for the nondestructive evaluation of rockets and other objects.  The algorithms will allow scientists to detect cracks in rocket bodies, air pockets in rocket fuel, and delaminations in rocket exit cones. Limited data algorithms will be developed for electron microscopy as a part of a joint industrial project.  The goal is to produce an algorithm that reliably produces accurate pictures for a SIDEC electron microscope.  He will develop pure mathematics that will show how well the algorithms work and where their limitations might show<br/>up.  These pure mathematical underpinnings are required to ensure that his (or any other) reconstructions are correct and are not lucky guesses.  SONAR data can be modeled as averages over spheres (the spherical wave fronts of the sound) and Professor Quinto will prove<br/>theorems about these averages.  He will use these theorems to develop simple algorithms to map the ocean floor and to find boundaries of objects in the ocean and to apply to Radar.  This pure mathematics is intriguing in its own right.  Professor Quinto will prove theorems about spherical averages which will be used to understand the wave equation (the equation that describes how sound and light behave). The wave equation describes the motion of a drum head, and he will<br/>specify which points on the drum do not move at all.  Finally, he will prove theorems he will apply to complex and harmonic analysis, fields in pure mathematics.<br/><br/>"

One of the major directions is the study of free-interface problems related to combustion and exothermal phase transitions. Free interface problems correspond to sharp changes in physical characteristics describing the problem; they arise naturally in many models in physics. An important example of free-interface problem to be studied is the model of SHS (Self-propagating High-temperature Synthesis a.k.a. solid combustion) which exhibits a remarkable variety of dynamics scenarios. SHS is a potentially new method of manufacturing composite materials with qualities superior to those obtained through traditional methods. Frankel  will  show the compactness and finite dimensionality of  the attractor for SHS model. Frankel will also study the free-interface model of premixed gas combustion. The second major direction of the project is the study of surface evolution equations modeling certain basic flame instabilities and spatio-temporal patterns associated with them. These equations are expressed in terms of instantaneous geometrical characteristics and normal velocity of the surface which allows a more natural representation of the basic nonlinearities that are of a purely geometric origin. Solutions of these equations exhibit wrinkling and self-fractalization similar to those observed in experiments. They are also capable of generating the so-called fingering of the surface that occurs in many processes in fluid dynamics. The proposed work will include rigorous study as well as asymptotic methods and direct numerical simulation.<br/><br/>This project addresses mathematical modeling of the complex dynamics of flames. The investigator will study two major themes to enhance the modeling of flame dynamics: 1) free-interface problems, i.e. ones in which there are sharp changes in physical characteristics and 2)  <br/>surface evolution problems, i.e. where the equation is associated with the flame front deformation and motion. These methods could extend our understanding of flame instabilities, wrinkling, fingering as well as a form of solid combustion which could have new applications in manufacturing of composite materials.  <br/> <br/>Date: May 8th, 2002<br/>"

Next, we will consider the multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid and establish global existence of large solutions with spherical or cylindrical symmetry.

The research will investigate systems of conservation laws, compressible fluid flow, and equations describing reactive flow.

One of the goals is the derivation of specialized models in certain distinguished asymptotic limits.  Another goal is to study the relation between the applied magnetic field and the resulting current distribution as a function of the geometry and the topology of the network.<br/><br/>Superconductors form a special kind of material with the unique property that they exhibit quantum-mechanical (that is, atomic) effects on large scales that can be observed by the unaided eye.

It also makes them candidates for many applications ranging from very precise measuring devices and unusual generators of magnetic fields (already on the market) to quantum computers. To understand the behavior of superconductors we need mathematical models.  Moreover, since the standard model is very complicated, it is very useful to derive simpler models that fit special circumstances.  For example, some of the fascinating effects of superconductivity are observed when the material forms a complex network of thin wires.  I therefore derive special models to describe such geometries. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The purpose of the research is to obtain a better understanding of the underlying physical phenomena through the study of the qualitative behavior of the solutions of the PDEs.  The first objective is to obtain the nonlinear stability of shock profiles for hyperbolic systems with relaxation, including fully dissipative systems and those containing one non-decaying wave in a linearly degenerate field (systems of composite type).  The second objective is to obtain a similar stability result for initial boundary-value problems for hyperbolic-parabolic systems, especially to understand the effect of the boundary.  The third objective is to extend the study to contact discontinuities and rarefaction waves. <br/><br/>The research conducted under this award is relevant for the study of compressible viscous flows, the motion of viscoelastic materials, gas dynamics in thermal nonequilibrium, and magnetohydrodynamics.

The project has three specific objectives.  The first objective is to understand the stability properties of shock profiles in, for example, high-temperature gas flows when the internal structure of molecules and chemical reactions are no longer negligible.  This problem arises, for example, at the reentry of a space shuttle into the atmosphere and is quite different from the traditional supersonic flight of an airplane.

It is organized into four projects, chosen partly because of their importance in the field of granular materials, but also because they raise intriguing mathematical and scientific issues of broader significance.  The first project attacks a fundamental physical problem: How to include micromechanical effects in a continuum description of granular flow, especially the effect of velocity fluctuations.  The second project concerns the mathematics surrounding multidimensional continuum models for granular flow, specifically the issue of extracting mathematically rigorous information from ill-posed partial differential equations.  The third project proposes to extend Jenike's radial solution for flows in axisymmetric hoppers to conical hoppers with a general cross section.  The fourth project deals with flows of fine granular materials, where the interstitial gas significantly affects the flow. The research program involves coordinated efforts in modeling, analysis, numerical simulations, and experiment.<br/><br/>At the heart of this research project is a basic question concerning the flow of granular materials: ""What behaviors of slowly flowing granular material can be understood in terms of a continuum formulation?""  This question may be viewed as an attempt to reconcile continuum models, used in industrial design and engineering problem solving, with discrete models, introduced to understand the results of small- to medium-scale physical experiments.  Continuum models are highly desirable since they are much more tractable analytically and computationally than particle dynamics simulations, which treat the discreteness of the flow directly.  An important issue that arises from this basic question, and which is addressed in this project, is the form that a continuum description should take.  This issue has been the subject of debate in the engineering literature ever since Janssen in 1895 demonstrated that stresses in a column of granular material do not increase indefinitely with depth, but approach asymptotically to a constant. The research program has significance well beyond the context of granular materials in mathematics as well as physics.  The project is supported by a long-standing industrial collaboration."

Probability densities for this stochastic process solve the classical diffusion equation. A continuous time random walk is a simple random walk subordinated to a renewal process, used in physics to model anomalous diffusion. Increments of the simple random walk represents particle jumps, and the renewal epochs represent the particle jump times. Infinite variance particle jumps cause superdiffusion, in which a cloud of particles spreads faster than the classical model predicts. Infinite mean waiting times lead to subdiffusion. Scaling limits of continuous time random walks are stochastic processes whose densities solve fractional partial differential equations. Infinite variance particle jumps lead to operator stable Levy motions, while infinite mean waiting times induce subordination to an inverse stable subordinator. Fractional derivatives are generators of stable continuous convolution semigroups. The research funded by this grant is developing a sound mathematical basis for this physical theory, and pursuing practical applications to problems in contaminant transport. The goals of this research include limit theory for continuous time random walks with possible dependence between the jump sizes and the waiting times, extension to more realistic multidimensional jump vectors with matrix scaling to allow different rates of particle spreading in each coordinate, parallel development of multiscaling fractional derivative operators in space, analysis of the fundamental physical basis of fractional diffusion to elucidate the physical meaning of the model parameters, development of useful statistical methods for parameter estimation, numerical methods for fractional partial differential equations, and application of these methods to real data from laboratory and field experiments and remediation efforts involving porous media and fracture flow. <br/> Movement of contaminants in a mountain stream takes place over a vast range of time scales. A majority will move away quickly, but a small amount can be caught in eddies for minutes or days. Another fraction may move into the relatively motionless water beneath the streambed, and it may take months or years for the last molecules to disappear completely. The movement of contaminants in underground water spreads over a similar range of time scales. Our team of mathematicians and hydrogeologists uses modern interdisciplinary research methods to develop accurate models for the movement and spread of these contaminants. Much more than an academic exercise, this work is needed for realistic models of contaminant and nutrient movement in drinking water supplies. The research is necessary because existing diffusion models greatly underestimate the time and concentration at which contaminants arrive downstream, when compared to actual data."

In particular, we plan to address the following aspects of the behavior, dynamics and stability of the waves in lattice settings:  (1)  The role of spatial dimensionality on  nonlinear waves. Most of the earlier studies had been conducted in 1+1 (1 space, 1 time) dimension.  We can now go even in 3+1 dimensions and examine physically realistic settings.  (2)  The interplay between disorder, nonlinearity and discreteness.  It is well known that disorder can induce localization.  Understanding the interplay of this mechanism with nonlinearity, especially in realistic discrete settings is then crucial, as defects are ubiquitous in physical systems.  (3)  Travelling waves in discrete systems are also of paramount importance. Intrinsic Localized Modes (ILM's) have the intriguing property of bottlenecking the energy.  But could they carry it over (even more so in a targeted way) from one molecule to another (from one lattice site to another)?  If so, they would be natural candidates for many bioenergetics processes, such as photosynthesis.  (4)  The study of instabilities of such waves. We believe that we are now close to a general classification of the possible instabilities and to a connection of these with the underlying symmetries of the physical problem.  (5)  Finally, the comprehension of progressively more complex physical models is also of interest.  The latter involve additional physical perturbations such as, for example, long range interactions, boundary conditions, the interaction of multiple waves between them and with defects. <br/><br/>Intrinsic Localized Modes (ILM's) have been a topic of increasing focus over the past decade as their role in energy localization and transport has been appreciated in a variety of contexts.  Their applications span nonlinear optics and telecommunications (optical fibers and waveguides),  atomic physics (BEC, an issue of fundamental relevance as highlighted by the Physics Nobel Prize in 2001 awarded for its experimental observation), condensed matter physics (superconductivity and charge density waves), biophysics (the local breaking of DNA  and  conformational changes in proteins), and environmental science (nucleation of liquid droplets in the atmosphere).  The areas of interest are diverse and broad, the impact of the understanding of the fundamental physics is potentially very deep, but the underlying mathematical principles are simple and unifying.  These models share a common structure of nonlinear complex behavior, the spatio-temporal variation of which we wish to explore.  Understanding this behavior and the role of (nonlinear) waves in it is of fundamental interest in all these fields.  The nonlinear waves represent the electric field of light in optics, the quantum-mechanical Bose particle wavefunction in BEC, the DNA base-pair distance or the liquid-vapor interface of a nucleating droplet in the atmosphere.  The properties of these waves, their stability, dynamical evolution and internal structure are therefore at the heart of a wealth of physical effects.  The goal of our research is to explore these features using a combination of analytical and computational mathematical techniques and physical intuition.  Our project addresses, in particular, lattice dynamical systems, where space is discrete, as is the case in many fundamental applications, such as optical waveguides, DNA, and arrays of superconducting Josephson junctions.<br/>"

One of primary goals of this project is to obtain intrinsic surface propagation laws for both steady and unsteady curved detonation waves that are governing by several forms of realistic, but fundamental, reaction kinetics. Also, one of the most important concerns in engineering applications has to do both with the successful initiation of detonation and preventing premature failure. Mathematical investigations of these events will be conducted, including research on a new mode of detonation propagation that must be accounted for in failure problems, namely the edge-detonation.

In earlier work, the principal investigator and collaborators were able to deduce a great deal of information about the transport properties and induced intermittency in a particular model of fluid flow, using ideas of asymptotic analysis, semiclassical eigenvalue problems, and probability.  In current work we extend these ideas to more complex flow fields, where exact solution formulae are not available.  In addition to the above techniques, we intend to make use of the Donsker-Varadhan theory, giving large deviations principles for quantities defined via Feynman-Kac integrals.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between physical understanding and mathematical proof in the area of fluid transport.  At present only a few very simple models for the transport of a passive quantity, such as a dye, by a turbulent fluid are understood in a rigorous mathematical sense.  By extending the mathematical understanding to more complex models, we will clarify the question of what properties these simple models do and do not share with the more realistic flows of interest to scientists and engineers.

Ryzhik plans to concentrate on two areas of research: refocusing of time-reversed pulses in random media and the effect of flow motion on combustion and chemical reaction processes. Time reversal of acoustic waves is a recent experimental technique that refocuses a signal that arrived from a localized source at its original location even if it has been recorded at a very long distance from the source.  This method has been successfully applied in a number of applications, that range from medicine, where it was used for destruction of kidney stones, to long distance propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean, cellular communications, and imaging in noisy environments. Remarkably, refocusing of the time-reversed and re-propagated signal is very robust, and is greatly improved in a highly heterogeneous random medium as compared to a uniform domain. Ryzhik intends to build on his previous work on wave propagation in random and other complex media to advance the mathematical understanding of this important phenomenon.<br/><br/>The second major component of the proposed research is the mathematical analysis of the combustion processes in fluids, and the effect of fluid motion on combustion. It is well known that stirring by a fluid flow may both speed up chemical reactions and stop them, depending on the nature of a particular problem. These phenomena have been intensively studied by physicists, engineers and mathematicians alike. Nevertheless, there are few quantitative rigorous mathematical results in the area. Ryzhik intends to continue his work in this field, concentrating on mathematical studies of models that take into account both the affect of the flow on the chemical reaction via improved mixing, and the effect of combustion on the fluid, through changes in temperature and density of the fluid. The potential impact of this research is development of our understanding of combustion processes in turbulent flows in various settings. The mathematical tools that are necessary to address the above problems include homogenization, averaging of equations with random coefficients, maximum principles and estimates on solutions of partial differential equations.<br/><br/><br/>Date: April 25, 2002<br/>"

The resulting partial differential equations are highly nonlinear, making description of the solutions difficult.  Numerical simulations involving adaptive methods which change resolution as the process evolves are necessary to resolve these solutions.  Asymptotic methods have also been successful in describing steady and slowly varying approximate solutions to these models.  The proposed project involves extending both asymptotic and numerical methods in order to study non-steady and spatially varying smolder combustion.  These techniques will then be used to describe the details of the dynamics and transitions of these solutions.  The techniques developed will likely be applicable in other areas of combustion and problems of flow in porous media.  This project should be of interest to scientists using asymptotic methods, using adaptive numerical methods for high-performance computing, interested in issues of stability of solutions with many time scales, or interested in the development of chaotic solutions.  The results should be of particular interest to fire safety experts and combustion control engineers who wish to understand dynamics of smoldering near extinction limits, transitions from smoldering to flaming and patterns such as fingering of smolder waves as they move through materials.<br/><br/>Smoldering combustion refers to fire in a porous medium in which the oxygen supply to the reaction site is limited, for example when it must flow through the porous substance to reach the fuel.  Smolder is often a precursor to airborne flames and is particularly dangerous because of the amount of smoke produced and the difficulty of ensuring extinction.  When controlled, smolder also has important applications to material synthesis (high temperature synthesis) and to the design of timing devices (fuses).  A better understanding of the processes controlling smolder combustion will enhance fire safety as well as allow better control for engineering uses of smoldering combustion.  This Research in Undergraduate Institutions project includes a training program and participation of several undergraduate students, mentored by the principal investigator. <br/><br/><br/>Date: May 7, 2002<br/>"

Modeling complex behavior exhibited by multi-scale nonlinear dynamics often entails an effective description of large scale, coarse-grained dynamics. Their resolution requires a precise mathematical characterization of all spatial and temporal excitations present in systems. The issue of quantification of statistical properties of long-time, large-scale dynamics of spatiotemporal chaos will be addressed in a near-integrable setting and in a system in which the separation of scales, as well as instability, can be precisely tuned and controlled. Once a good statistical characterization is obtained, it can provide not only guidance in modeling coarse-grained dynamics but also statistical calibrations of these effective models against the original full dynamics. With these statistical insights, the research further focuses on the study of coarse-grained dynamics and invariant measures for two possible situations --- namely, dynamics with and without separation of scales. The projects also address important aspects of dispersive wave turbulence: clarification of the derivation of kinetic equations and their validation; and detailed characterization of resonance conditions, flux dynamics, and spatially localized, coherent structures.<br/><br/>A multitude of spatiotemporal scales may arise in modeling problems in modern science, ranging from molecular dynamics simulation of protein folding to short term climate prediction for coupled atmosphere-ocean dynamics --- the study of which has great impact on our daily world. This project investigates mathematical methods that can be used to understand and predict the complicated behavior of systems of this type.<br/>"

In the first part, entitled Stochastic Equations in Infinite Dimensions, I propose to study some prototype stochastic partial differential equations which arise in connection with hydrodynamic turbulence and other problems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.  The emphasis is on going beyond the more standard existence/uniqueness statements for these equations and considering harder questions like: What does a typical solution look like?  What are the properties of its probability density function?  In the second part of the proposal, entitled Effective Stochastic Modeling, I consider large systems where the variables can be separated into two groups evolving on different time scales.  Effective equations for the slow variables alone are derived by elimination of the fast variables using techniques which borrow from singular perturbations techniques for Markov processes.  Finally, in the third part of the proposal, entitled Transition Pathways -- String Method, I consider systems where, due to the disparity between typical energy barriers in the system and the thermal energy available, the dynamics proceed by long waiting periods around the metastable states followed by sudden jumps from one state to the other.  The effective dynamics in these systems is determined by the transition pathways between the metastable states and the rates at which these transitions occur.  The objective here is to develop and implement efficient numerical algorithms which compute these paths and rates.<br/><br/>Despite the rapid improvement of computer performance, many problems of scientific and engineering interest will not be amenable to direct numerical simulations in the foreseeable future.  Typical problems arising, for example, in hydrodynamic turbulence, dynamical critical phenomena, climate modeling, molecular dynamics, phase transition in spatially extended systems, involve such a large number of variables interacting on so many different space-time scales that they vastly overwhelm direct numerical computations.  On the other hand, while a complete description of the dynamics in these examples is impossible, it is also not necessarily useful.  Indeed one is typically interested only in some coarse-grained variables, suitably defined by means of averaging over appropriate ensembles (time, space, ...), which evolve in a more regular fashion and thereby provide the most useful information about the system.  The main objective of the present proposal is to improve the techniques for such a statistical analysis of these large systems -- including the identification of the coarse-grained variables and the equations they satisfy.  The common emphasis is on techniques which are truly computational tools -- either analytical or numerical -- and allow for concrete and explicit investigation of the properties of the solutions."

Their study is of great importance for the understanding of complicated phenomena in nature, such as turbulence in fluids, noisy signals in telecommunication, transport of DNA chains, and transmission dynamics of infectious diseases.  The results of this project will also have a large impact on practical engineering designs of mechanical and electrical systems and devices, in particular the identification of useful design parameters and the prediction of singular oscillatory behavior.  <br/><br/><br/>"

Katsoulakis<br/>Institution: University of Massachusetts Amherst<br/>Title: ITR: Mesoscopic Modeling and Simulation: A Novel Approach to Monte Carlo<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This project is concerned with a novel framework for Monte Carlo simulations based on recently developed coarse-grained stochastic mesoscopic models.  Mesoscopic models are stochastic partial differential equations which are rigorously derived as asymptotic limits from microscopic Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms by means of techniques from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.  Although such models describe the mesoscopic scales, which are much larger than the underlying molecular scales, they still include detailed microscopic information on particle interactions and dynamics and can systematically model anisotropies and multiple micromechanisms.  Another attractive feature of mesoscopic models is the inclusion of random fluctuations derived directly from the underlying master equation and yielding important nucleation and pattern formation and selection mechanisms.  Finally, formal and rigorous asymptotics using Large Deviation and WKB expansions as well as preliminary numerical simulations indicate that the MC algorithms and the corresponding stochastic mesoscopic models produce essentially identical results for such delicate quantities as nucleation rates and phase transitions.  The main research objectives of this proposal are: (a) to develop non-equilibrium coarse-grained MC algorithms by numerically solving the stochastic mesoscopic equations using highly efficient spectral-based methods and carry out detailed benchmarkings against conventional MC, and (b) to apply the proposed computational tools to applications arising in pattern formation in advanced materials and molecular separation in nanoporous films.<br/><br/>Because of their fundamental nature and their versatility in describing complex out-of-equilibrium interactions between atoms and molecules, molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms have become preeminent computational tools for science and engineering research.  With the advent of enhanced computing capabilities, these methods can provide unprecedented insights into numerous problems ranging from physicochemical and biological processes to biomaterials, drug design, pattern recognition, and image processing.  Despite their widespread use and the substantial progress in related computational methods, molecular algorithms are limited to short length and time scales.  Hence, they are capable of simulating only a relatively small number of atoms or molecules for quite short time periods.  On the other hand, device sizes and morphological features observed in experiments often involve much larger spatial and/or temporal scales.  A major obstacle in meeting this multiscale modeling challenge is the lack of a rigorous mathematical and computational framework providing a direct link from the atomistic scale to the complex mesoscopic and macroscopic phenomena that are the result of the microscopic interactions.  In this direction, our work focuses on developing novel stochastic models and algorithms capable of describing much larger length and time scales than conventional MC simulations while still incorporating microscopic details.  We intend to apply the computational methods to provide new insights into two engineering problems, which are currently intractable with conventional MC techniques:  (1) the study of self-organizing micromechanisms and their role in pattern formation in advanced materials, and (2) the transport and separation of molecules in nanoporous films and membranes.<br/><br/>"

The nature and role of the coherent  structures have remained subjects of debate at a qualitative level due to a lack of theoretical understanding and foundation for these structures.  However, the gap between theory and experiments is closing thanks to recent discoveries of three-dimensional traveling wave solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations that are best described as exact coherent structures. This research will continue the study and characterization of these rich solutions in plane shear flows and seek to elucidate the connections between their instabilities and the disorder that is characteristic of turbulence. The approach is that of bifurcation and dynamical systems theory applied to the nonlinear partial differential equations of hydrodynamics. Extensions of these traveling wave solutions to pipe flow and mixing layers will be considered.<br/><br/>Shear turbulence is an ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs in the flow of simple fluids, such as air and water, and the more complex fluids that arise in biological and industrial processes. Turbulence has an enormous impact on the properties of fluid flows, such as the transport of momentum and energy and the mixing of chemicals in combustion, manufacturing and the environment. However, the complexity of turbulent flows severely limits our ability to predict the properties of fluid flows. This research promises to provide a fundamental understanding of the nature of shear turbulence thanks in large part to high-performance scientific computing.

Specifically, the projects investigates statistical<br/>theories of coherent structures in turbulence, which in a model<br/>atmosphere or ocean usually take the form of long-lived, large-scale<br/>jets and vortices.  The approach builds on recent developments in the<br/>equilibrium statistical theory of such structures, which has now<br/>matured to the point that it can be justified mathematically,<br/>implemented computationally and applied succesfully to geophysical<br/>models.  A prime example is the recent model of the zonal jets and<br/>vortical spots in the atmosphere of Jupiter, whose predictions agree<br/>remarkably well with observational data.  In light of these<br/>developments, the goals of the project are two-fold.  First, the<br/>equilibrium statistical theory of coherent structures is elaborated<br/>for increasingly realistic geophysical models, such as multi-layer<br/>quasi-geostrophic models and shallow-water models.  The physical<br/>implications of the theory are investigated by computing families of<br/>equilibrium structures and deriving nonlinear stability theorems for<br/>them.  Second, a novel approach to statistical closure is developed<br/>from the corresponding nonequilibrium theory.  Unlike traditional<br/>closure schemes for fluid turbulence, this new methodology derives<br/>macroscopic equations for some specified resolved variables by<br/>conditioning random paths of microstates on the ensemble-averaged<br/>dynamics for those resolved variables.  A combined theoretical and<br/>computational investigation of this approximation to nonequilibrium<br/>behavior is undertaken for some prototype problems.  In the context of<br/>model geophysical systems with damping and driving, this approach is<br/>envisioned as a general procedure for deriving effective subgrid-scale<br/>parametrizations of unresolved eddies.<br/><br/><br/>Turbulent fluid flow remains one of the unsolved puzzles of physical<br/>science.  A better theoretical understanding of turbulence is needed<br/>as a basis for the computational simulation of almost all natural<br/>fluid motions.  This is especially true of geophysical fluid flows --<br/>the motions of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere -- which involve<br/>complex motions over a wide range of scales, from meters up to the<br/>planetary size.  Every modern computer code used in weather<br/>forecasting or climate prediction requires special, but often<br/>unreliable, assumptions about how the small-scale turbulent motions<br/>affect the computed large-scale behavior.  The research conducted in<br/>this project addresses the general issue of modeling a complex fluid<br/>flow -- a mathematical prototype of an atmosphere or ocean -- in such<br/>a way that its predominant large-scale features can be captured<br/>reliably without resolving the full complexity of its small-scale<br/>motions.  In particular, the work seeks to develop the mathematical<br/>and computational tools necessary to predict the behavior of modeled<br/>geophysical fluid systems which exhibit organized features on large<br/>scales but disordered and random motions on a range of small scales.<br/>To do so, the project draws on sophisticated techniques from<br/>statistical physics to construct theoretical models of complex systems<br/>of this kind, and thereby to provide efficient and reliable methods<br/>for computing their expected or most probable behavior.  A recent<br/>example of this approach is the remarkably successful explanation of<br/>the persistent jetstreams and vortices, such as the Great Red Spot, in<br/>the atmosphere of the giant planet Jupiter, which for the first time<br/>shows quantitative and qualitative agreement between mathematical<br/>theory and NASA spacecraft observations.  In the context of Earth's<br/>atmosphere and oceans, such theoretical models and computational<br/>methods can used as building blocks in predictions about the long-term<br/>trends in the ocean-atmosphere system.<br/>"

Probability densities for this stochastic process solve the classical diffusion equation. A continuous time random walk is a simple random walk subordinated to a renewal process, used in physics to model anomalous diffusion. Increments of the simple random walk represents particle jumps, and the renewal epochs represent the particle jump times. Infinite variance particle jumps cause superdiffusion, in which a cloud of particles spreads faster than the classical model predicts. Infinite mean waiting times lead to subdiffusion. Scaling limits of continuous time random walks are stochastic processes whose densities solve fractional partial differential equations. Infinite variance particle jumps lead to operator stable Levy motions, while infinite mean waiting times induce subordination to an inverse stable subordinator. Fractional derivatives are generators of stable continuous convolution semigroups. The research funded by this grant is developing a sound mathematical basis for this physical theory, and pursuing practical applications to problems in contaminant transport. The goals of this research include limit theory for continuous time random walks with possible dependence between the jump sizes and the waiting times, extension to more realistic multidimensional jump vectors with matrix scaling to allow different rates of particle spreading in each coordinate, parallel development of multiscaling fractional derivative operators in space, analysis of the fundamental physical basis of fractional diffusion to elucidate the physical meaning of the model parameters, development of useful statistical methods for parameter estimation, numerical methods for fractional partial differential equations, and application of these methods to real data from laboratory and field experiments and remediation efforts involving porous media and fracture flow. <br/> Movement of contaminants in a mountain stream takes place over a vast range of time scales. A majority will move away quickly, but a small amount can be caught in eddies for minutes or days. Another fraction may move into the relatively motionless water beneath the streambed, and it may take months or years for the last molecules to disappear completely. The movement of contaminants in underground water spreads over a similar range of time scales. Our team of mathematicians and hydrogeologists uses modern interdisciplinary research methods to develop accurate models for the movement and spread of these contaminants. Much more than an academic exercise, this work is needed for realistic models of contaminant and nutrient movement in drinking water supplies. The research is necessary because existing diffusion models greatly underestimate the time and concentration at which contaminants arrive downstream, when compared to actual data."

The conference will focus on two related areas within applied mathematics with applications to telecommunications, and electrical and computer engineering: wavelets/signal processing and error-correcting codes. As a result, this conference will be of interest to engineers and physicists as well as to mathematicians. A major emphasis of the conference will be ""coding theory"": Much of signal processing is about source coding while the theory of error-correcting codes is channel coding. Wavelets are now the most applicable tool in signal processing. For instance, wavelet filters were recently adopted as the JPEG-2000 image compression standard. Wavelet packets, a mathematical shorthand for compressing and restoring virtually any image or sound, have been used by the FBI and Scotland Yard to compress their fingerprint files to a more manageable size. <br/><br/>CAM 2002 will foster interdisciplinary communication between mathematicians, computer engineers, and signal processors; i.e., this conference will bring together theoreticians and practitioners. Moreover, the conference will provide an opportunity for students (undergraduate & graduate) and faculty from the region to share their research with each other and interact with world-class experts in the areas of wavelets/signal processing and error-correcting codes. Error-correcting codes provide the means for the reliable transformation of speech, audio, images and video into digital content. Deep space communication, wireless phones, high speed data networks, the Internet, and products like compact disc players, hard drives, and high speed modems make essential use of coding and data compression to improve speed and reliability. The federal funds will be used primarily to provide travel support for students, recent doctoral recipients, junior faculty, women and other underrepresented groups in mathematics, science and engineering.<br/><br/><br/>Date: May 14, 2002<br/>"

Radiative transport theory provides an accurate macroscopic description of the microscopic<br/>interactions between the propagating waves and the rapidly-fluctuating underlying medium. The objectives of the research are threefold.  First, extend radiative transport theory to include boundary conditions and surface and volume wave interaction. Second, solve the volume and surface equations numerically using a Monte Carlo method based on a probabilistic representation of radiative transfer with polarization.  Finally, assess the domain of validity of radiative transfer by setting up suitable inverse problems that allow determination of statistical<br/>parameters characterizing the underlying medium from boundary measurements.<br/><br/>A major recent success of radiative transport theory is the modeling of the propagation of seismic waves in the earth's crust.  Numerical study of seismic wave propagation over hundreds of kilometers remains prohibitive with a microscopic model, but simulations are now accessible<br/>using radiative transfer theory and suitable statistical methods.  Results promise to yield better understanding and prediction of earthquakes.  Another application of radiative transport and its diffusion approximation is near-infrared spectroscopy.  This novel method is increasingly<br/>used in medical imaging for monitoring properties of human tissues. Numerical simulation of forward and inverse transport problems remains an active field of research. The project provides the mathematical and numerical analysis to address these issues.<br/>"

While the fundamental equations describing fluid motion, the Navier-Stokes equations, are well-known, it is generally computationally expensive and analytically infeasible to solve the full equations exactly. To better understand these systems, it is necessary to turn to simplified or reduced models resulting from systematic approximations of the full equations. The semi-discrete approximation techniques which are utilized in this project focus primarily on reducing the dimension of the full fluid equations by exploiting symmetries or widely disparate lengthscales in specific systems. The resulting predictions from the reduced models will be compared qualitatively and quantitatively with experimental data.<br/><br/>Fluid dynamics arises in a multitude of biological, environmental and industrial applications. This project is designed to develop models that describe basic hydrodynamical phenomena such as hydraulic jumps that can arise in jet impingement cooling systems and hydrodynamical systems with flexible boundaries. The latter include spinning magnetic media such as disk drives, and biological problems such as insect flight, blood flow in arteries and dynamics of the syrinx in song birds. Undergraduate participation is an integral part of both the experimental and mathematical aspects of the program. Mathematical models will be tested in the new Fluid Dynamics Laboratory which will provide a hands-on environment in which students learn to integrate mathematics with physical phenomena. This unique approach encourages students to apply their mathematical skills in consort with their physical intuition within the framework of contemporary research.<br/>"

The WTG equations form a<br/>""balance model"", or set of singular limit equations, asymptotically valid<br/>in a parameter regime relevant to the tropical atmosphere.  The WTG<br/>equations are designed to facilitate study of key aspects of the tropical<br/>climate problem, such as the large-scale dynamical roles of moist<br/>convection and other diabatic processes.  This focus is achieved by<br/>eliminating other processes which can be present in solutions to the<br/>primitive equations, such as gravity waves and baroclinic instability, in<br/>the same way as gravity waves are eliminated in extratropical balance<br/>models  such as the quasi-geostrophic equations.  One goal of this project<br/>is to develop new mathematics by studying the WTG equations' properties.<br/>Another goal is to solve the equations under geometries, boundary<br/>conditions and forcings which represent idealizations of those relevant to<br/>the real earth's climate, and then to study the sensitivity of the<br/>solutions to key parameters.  Achievement of these goals is expected to<br/>lead to deeper understanding of both the real climate and more complex<br/>mathematical models of it, such as general circulation models (GCMs).<br/><br/>The earth's climate system is notoriously complex.  Many different<br/>physical processes interact in a tangled web of feedbacks to produce the<br/>dynamic and variable climate we observe.  Unlike a laboratory science,<br/>meteorology and oceanography are hindered by the impossibility of<br/>controlled experiments which might allow the key mechanisms to be<br/>conclusively revealed.  We are stuck with the one planet on which we live<br/>and cannot change its basic properties to see what happens.  Consequently,<br/>the science proceeds by observation and by a heavy reliance on numerical<br/>simulation with GCMs, which are sophisticated computer programs run on the<br/>most powerful computers available.  These simulations offer the<br/>possibility of a certain kind of controlled climate experiments:  we can<br/>create virtual earths on the computer, control their properties, and<br/>observe their behavior with precision.  One obvious limitation of this<br/>approach is that the models are imperfect representations of reality.  A<br/>less obvious, but equally important problem is the models' complexity,<br/>which both limits the number and type of simulations which can be done and<br/>renders the results nearly as difficult to understand as the real climate<br/>system.  Because of these problems, there is a need to supplement<br/>observational and GCM studies with theoretical studies using models that<br/>are simpler than GCMs - if not simple enough to allow solution with pencil<br/>and paper, then at least using very simple computer programs that run<br/>quickly on a PC.  To the extent that these simpler models have key<br/>features in common with the real system, their simplicity allows a deeper<br/>level of understanding of the basic dynamics of climate and leads to<br/>explicit hypotheses that can be tested against observations and GCM<br/>simulations.  This project  harnesses the physical insight of climate<br/>scientists and the sophisticated methods of applied mathematicians to<br/>develop and study simple models designed specifically to represent the<br/>tropical atmospheric component of the earth's climate system.<br/>"

The second approach to<br/>investigate the well-posedness and long-time behavior of<br/>solutions is based on the monotone approximation and comparison<br/>results that have been successfully established for the<br/>semilinear case by the investigators.  Although similar approaches<br/>have been used in studying other nonlinear partial differential<br/>equation models, their applications to special cases of the<br/>general nonlinear and nonlocal model considered in this project<br/>have only been carried out by the investigators.  In addition, a<br/>numerical methodology is developed for an inverse problem<br/>governed by the proposed nonlinear nonlocal system of equations.<br/>It uses a connection between real data and the model to estimate<br/>unknown parameters.  Meanwhile, a numerical package is developed<br/>for simulating the proposed model.<br/>     Many populations and their interactions with the environment<br/>have been modeled using the structured population approach, where<br/>the structures of interest are induced by internal<br/>characteristics such as age or size.  For example, size-structured<br/>population models with distributed rates have been successfully<br/>used to describe the dynamics of mosquitofish in California rice<br/>fields.  The structured population approach has also been used to<br/>model the dynamics of hierarchically structured populations in<br/>which the differences between individuals have a direct effect on<br/>the availability of resources.  Another application is the<br/>predator-prey interaction between zooplankton and phytoplankton<br/>within the context of algal aggregation.  Generally speaking, in<br/>order to analyze, manage, and control the dynamics of a<br/>population, it is necessary to understand the interactions<br/>between the population evolution and its environment.  In this<br/>project, the investigators study a general structured population<br/>model.  Due to its complexity, a combination of analytical and<br/>numerical methods is developed to investigate the dynamics of<br/>such a population.  In particular, a numerical package to simulate<br/>the proposed model is provided.  Furthermore, certain techniques<br/>are introduced to estimate the growth and mortality for<br/>individuals within the population from field data.  Because of the<br/>generality of the proposed model, the results help to answer<br/>questions about nonlinear phenomena in population dynamics.  In<br/>addition, the resulting numerical method can be used by<br/>population biologists to investigate the dynamical behavior of<br/>general population models."

Applications of this work<br/>include environmental aspects of ocean dynamics, semiconductor<br/>manufacturing and increases in laser efficiency, and condensed-matter<br/>physics and materials science at low temperatures.  The educational<br/>component includes course development on undergraduate and graduate<br/>level that will incorporate an experimental component in an<br/>undergraduate mathematical modelling course, and a graduate course on<br/>waves and weak turbulence theory.<br/><br/>What do internal waves deep below the ocean surface, semiconductor<br/>lasers, and extremely cold metallic vapors have in common?  They are<br/>all very complicated physical systems composed of simple components<br/>that interact weakly.

The question of how the energy of an<br/>internal ocean wave depends on this wave's length has an elegant<br/>experimental answer pointing to a universal law, but has eluded<br/>theoretical explanation for more than thirty years.  This work aims to<br/>provide such an explanation, which will furnish new insights into the<br/>oceanic environment.  Semiconductors and semiconductor lasers<br/>manufacturing and operation requires ever increasing efficiency.  This<br/>work will explore an improvement that is based on a more efficient way<br/>of delivering energy to the working semiconductors and semiconductor<br/>lasers.  Three quarters of a century ago Bose and Einstein predicted a<br/>new phase of materials, the Bose-Einstein condensate, that can only<br/>occur at extremely low temperatures.  Finally, six years ago, this<br/>phase was realized experimentally, and the the creators of the<br/>experiment received this year's Nobel Prize.

Two particular physical phenomena are examined: the mixing and transport of substances immersed in a turbulent fluid and the interaction between weakly nonlinear waves. The common mode of investigation is a precise analysis of simplified stochastic models. The main feature of the turbulent transport model is its inclusion of both a large-scale mean flow, which can depend on both space and time, and a small-scale fluctuating component of the velocity field.  This allows a study of how the large and small scales of a turbulent fluid interact in determining the effective evolution of the passive scalar density.  The work will be directed toward extending some rigorous homogenization theorems and investigating some physical phenomena which arise from the new features of the model.  The second research area concerns the development of simplified equations to describe wave propagation under the influence of weak nonlinearity.  A well-known weak turbulence theory has found some success in treating such systems in a number of contexts, but its foundations and limitations are still under active investigation.  Some particular aspects of the weak turbulence theory will be scrutinized and illustrated on the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model.  The outcomes of this analysis will be used to suggest modifications of the standard kinetic equations of weak turbulence theory which may improve their accuracy and generalize their domain of applicability.<br/><br/>Both of these studies are directed toward achieving a better understanding of how turbulent systems can be effectively described through simplified equations.  A chief application of this research theme is in atmosphere-ocean models designed for climate and weather prediction.  Limitations on both available data and supercomputing resources make fully detailed simulations impossible for the forseeable future, and the effects of turbulence must be represented by some managable set of parameters.  The research described above will contribute toward a better understanding of how turbulence can be parameterized in atmosphere-ocean science models in a more rational and effective manner."

It involves the following projects, which are motivated by the recent breakthrough of Bianchini and Bressan on the vanishing-viscosity method:  (a) The study of balance laws with dissipative source terms through the vanishing-viscosity method;  (b) An attempt to extend the layering method from scalar conservation laws to systems thereof; and  (c)  The study of the classical Riemann problem with the help of the new estimates of Bianchini and Bressan.<br/>Hyperbolic conservation laws belong to a class of nonlinear partial differential equations that govern the dynamics of materials with nonlinear elastic response, including solids like rubber and gases like air.  The special feature of these equations is that the nonlinearity induces the development of discontinuities, akin to the familiar phenomenon of the breaking of waves on the beach.  The discontinuities then propagate as shock waves.  The proposed research program is to investigate a number of methods for constructing solutions with shocks.  The objective is to settle questions of a theoretical nature, such as the issue of existence of solutions, by an approach that brings out the intimate connection between mathematics and physics, while suggesting, at the same time, algorithms for the actual computation of such solutions.<br/>"

Two prototypical examples will be analyzed in detail: porous elastomers and ""polydomain"" liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs).  The first is an example of a<br/>two-phase composite with one void phase and one elastic phase. These materials are used extensively in various industries for their insulation and shock absorption properties.  The second is an example of a polycrystalline aggregate involving single-crystal grains made of a liquid-crystal elastomeric phase. They are materials that exhibit ""soft'' modes of deformation, are capable of being actuated by temperature and light inputs, and also exhibit the remarkable property of becoming optically transparent at sufficiently large stretches.  In particular, we<br/>propose to develop simple estimates of the Hashin-Shtrikman and self-consistent type for these materials, which have already been found to be extremely useful in other contexts.  However, because of the finite deformations involved in elastomeric systems, it will be necessary to also<br/>characterize the evolution of the microstructure (e.g., porosity, texture, void or grain shape and orientation) in these systems and its implications on the overall behavior. Because of the non-convexity of the relevant energy functions, the possible development of instabilities must also be<br/>taken into account, especially because such unstable modes may be useful in the design of devices. This program of research will involve an exciting combination of several tools in mathematical analysis, including calculus of variations, convex analysis, differential equations, and optimization, and is likely to impact our understanding of constitutive theory of complex<br/>materials in general.<br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with heterogeneous material systems that can undergo large elastic (recoverable) deformations.  Examples of these material systems include, among others, carbon-black-filled elastomers, polymeric foams, liquid crystalline elastomers, block copolymers and skeletal muscle tissue.  Two essential features characterize their mechanical response: 1) they can undergo large elastic  (recoverable) deformations; and 2) they exhibit non-unique behavior (micro-buckling and other instabilities).  In addition, most importantly from the applications point of view, the behavior of many of these material systems can be controlled by external fields (temperature, electric, magnetic, chemical inputs).  Because of their remarkable properties, these materials, usually appearing in the form of composites or polycrystalline aggregates, will continue to provide the vehicles for many technological innovations, ranging from rubber tires, more than a century ago, to light-activated switches and artificial muscles, today.  Because of their highly nonlinear properties, the characterization of these material systems is also mathematically challenging. In particular, even though much progress has been made in recent years in  developing rigorous homogenization frameworks for these material systems, much work remains to be done in terms of developing ""constructive"" mathematical tools to estimate the constitutive behavior of specific systems within this class.<br/><br/>"

The alpha-models <br/>are asserted to reproduce the right energy spectrum for a wide range  of large <br/>scales. It is proposed to investigate  this claim using rigorous analytical tools. <br/>It is also proposed to perform computational tests on the newly derived two-layers <br/>geostrophic zonal jet alpha-model to verify the above assertion. Furthermore, <br/>it is proposed to explore the implementation of the alpha-models approach as <br/>sub-grid models. <br/><br/>The grand challenge in climate prediction is that the mathematical equations <br/>governing the ocean and atmosphere dynamics, are too difficult to study <br/>analytically, and still prohibitively expensive computationally. Indeed, <br/>it is well established, based on physical grounds and collected experimental <br/>data, that atmospheric and oceanic turbulent flows involve a broad spectrum <br/>of spatial and time scales. This in turn  makes them inaccessible  to the most <br/>powerful  and state-of-the-art computers. However, due to the rotation of the <br/>earth and other geophysical situations, such as the shallowness of the oceans <br/>and the atmosphere - in the sense that they are much wider than they are deep - <br/>geophysicists take advantage of certain geophysical balances to derive simplified<br/>balanced models. The first theme of this project is to: establish existence <br/>and regularity of solutions to some of these nonlinear reduced models. This is<br/>a crucial step  in justifying the derivation  of these models and their<br/>consistency with the physical observations for the relevant length  and time <br/>scales. Furthermore, in global climate prediction one is interested in the <br/>long-time statistical features of the climate. The second theme of this project <br/>is to develop a systematic approach for deriving and studying  new averaged <br/>models, in the context of ocean and atmosphere dynamics, which are reliable in <br/>reproducing the correct long-term statistics."

The PI intends to do this by finding and analyzing solutions that are more general than traveling plane wave solutions as well as by analyzing the stability of plane wave solutions in higher dimensions.  The goals include demonstrating that the SDRDE is a better model than many existing models for interface motion and growth in materials with a crystalline lattice structure.  Specifics include studying stable pattern formation for the spatially discrete one-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation and applying the results to multiple interface problems, studying equilibrium shapes for the SDRDE in two and three dimensions, showing that a small local perturbation in an equilibrium planar interface solution for a two- or three-dimensional SDRDE can and does cause the solution to evolve to a spatial translate of the original equilibrium interface, and accurately modeling the growth of helium-4 crystals.  The techniques the PI will be using include construction using integral transforms, linear Fredholm theory, and the implicit function theorem, showing existence and continuation of solutions, finding and classifying equilibrium shapes using the free-energy functional, and  analyzing the stability of an edge (3D) or corner (2D) where two planer interfaces (facets) meet.  Although modeling phase changes in crystalline materials with SDRDEs is natural and can be done from the fundamental properties of the physical systems, the mathematical tools  to effectively study the resulting equations have been lacking until now; hence, SDRDEs are now  ready to be used as a modeling tool.<br/><br/>This project intends to develop, solve, and apply mathematical equations which model phase transitions (solidification or melting, movement of a grain boundary, etc.) in crystalline materials, where the atoms line up in an ordered arrangement.  Examples include water, metals, and salts.  Existing models are either at the atomic structure (micro-) scale or the (macro-) scale of the entire system.  (Some hybrid models combine the two scales).  Micro-scale models of phase transitions have to be solved computationally and are extremely computational-resource intensive.  They also depend on atomic interactions that, if properly modeled, often make the problem too ""large"" to compute.  Macro-scale models can represent phase transitions with a pair of evolution equations but lose the ability to account for the influences of the ordering at the atomic level.  Somewhat successful attempts have been made to reclaim the ordering information, but in a phenomenological manner.  The modeling tools that are being studied in this project are a simple pair of evolution equations (which can be studied both analytically and computationally) that contain both the macro-scale and micro-scale properties derived from the basic physics of the materials.  Although the idea for using such equations has been around for over 40 years, the mathematics necessary to study and solve these equations is just now reaching maturity.  The result is a more accurate mathematical description and understanding of crystalline materials.  The applications range from predicting the failure of mechanical parts (for example, in jet turbines) to controlling the growth of crystals (for example, in forging steel or growing gem stones)."

This project<br/>concerns methods to find such principled reductions, using<br/>mathematical tools that enable one to investigate circumstances<br/>under which parts of the dynamics behave like that of systems<br/>with a much smaller number of degrees of freedom. Other tools to<br/>be used allow one to understand how only some subset of the<br/>components can be involved at a given time, even though all<br/>components are coupled. The methods are applied to problems from<br/>neural, chemical and gene regulation systems. The project also<br/>provides interdisciplinary training opportunities for students<br/>and postdocs."
