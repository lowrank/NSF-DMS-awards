More specifically, the systems that will be studied belong to a class of nonlinear evolution equations referred to as soliton equations or integrable systems, which arise as mathematical models in various areas of applications, ranging from fluid dynamics and nonlinear optics, to low-temperature physics and Bose-Einstein condensates, to name a few.  In particular, one of the model equations that will be studied describes the formation of rogue waves in the open ocean.  These extreme events, which are characterized by wave crests up to four times bigger than the average, have been known to cause significant damages to vessels and other equipment.  Effects similar to rogue waves have also been recently observed in optical fibers.  A precise mathematical description of these model equations is also a key component in the design of optical fiber transmission systems.  The project outcomes will help to better characterize the behavior of these systems and the properties of their solutions, they will elucidate the role that such solutions play in the generation of rogue waves, and they will contribute to paving the way for a deeper understanding of these important nonlinear phenomena. The project will provide a rich educational experience through research for graduate students at the State University of New York at Buffalo and undergraduate students at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.<br/><br/>Mathematically, the overarching goal of the project is a wide-ranging investigation of initial and initial-boundary value problems for integrable nonlinear evolution equations, thereby contributing to closing the gap between our knowledge of linear and nonlinear integrable systems. More precisely, the project comprises problems where the boundary conditions play a key role, as well as various kinds of singular limits. Specific problems that will be studied include: (i) the development of the inverse scattering transform for coupled systems of equations of nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) type with non-zero boundary conditions at infinity; (ii) the study of initial-boundary value problems for NLS equations on a finite interval with linearizable, periodic or nearly periodic boundary conditions; (iii) the study of the long-time asymptotics of NLS systems affected by modulational instability and of semiclassical and dispersionless limits for NLS equations and the Korteweg-deVries equation with periodic boundary conditions."

The first part of the project mathematically describes the phenomenon of acoustic sound waves within a chamber whose flexible walls are allowed to move freely as time evolves. For such acoustic wave dynamics, the goal is to determine which pre-assigned chamber geometries will give rise to an interior acoustic field that is as ""quiet"" as possible. That is to say, because of the analytically pre-determined chamber configuration, the acoustic pressure will be minimized and external noise optimally reduced. The second part of the project focuses on structure-fluid interactions as they occur in nature and engineering, for example the nucleus of a cell interacting with the cellular cytoplasm. In this example, the wall of the nucleus might be described by structural PDE, and the cytoplasm mathematically modeled by fluid flow PDE.  The goal of the project is to develop and analyze more realistic models that comprise both fluid and structure PDE dynamics. <br/><br/>The first part of the project will address the feasibility of stabilizing interior acoustic wave dynamics on a time-evolving bounded domain through the means of prescribing, in advance, the evolution of the geometry. That is, as time gets large, the prescribed moving boundary feedback law should cause the acoustic wave solutions to either decay or approach a certain set of finite energy states. Since the associated wave energy is majorized by wave boundary trace quantities that resemble velocity feedback mechanisms, this ""geometry-control"" problem might be viewed as a moving boundary analog to Neumann boundary stabilization of the wave equation on a fixed domain. The second part of the project will consider linear and nonlinear structure-fluid PDE models in which the structural components are mathematically modeled by physically relevant but quite complex Reissner-Mindlin-Timshenko (RMT) plate systems. By decoupling these structure-fluid dynamics, the associated pressure variables are eliminated in a nonstandard manner, intrinsic to the coupling mechanisms in place. Having resolved the well-posedness, the study will consider an associated optimal control problem that will reveal certain ocular dynamics. In addition, the question of global exact controllability for nonlinear von Karman plate dynamics will be investigated. The objective is to establish the exact steering property with respect to finite energy states of arbitrary size, not only target states within a small neighborhood of the origin. This control process will be simulated numerically and the dependence of the controllability time on the size of the initial and target states will be examined."

This project seeks to further the development of numerical and analytical tools for SPDEs with a view towards novel applications in climate and weather modeling and for the study of turbulence.<br/><br/>The work will focus in particular on three emerging areas of nonlinear SPDEs.  Firstly we will address the theory of invariant measures and statistically steady states. In particular we will develop tools to study inviscid limits in the class of invariant measures for the Navier-Stokes equations and for related  models arising in geophysical and turbulence applications. We will also identify and characterize noise regimes leading to ergodic and mixing properties for some previously unaddressed classes of nonlinear SPDEs.

The focus of the project is to better understand dissipation and stability of equilibrium configurations and related problems in this regime using mathematical analysis.

Three general areas are studied: (A) analysis tools for understanding enhanced dissipation and transient unmixing; (B) linear and nonlinear stochastically forced problems in order to understand statistically stationary direct cascades in mathematically accessible settings; (C) estimating the subcritical transition thresholds and understanding instabilities for laminar flows, such as pipe flow, in infinite and finite regularity.  Finally, natural extensions to hypoelliptic problems, such as collisionless limits in kinetic theory, may also be considered.  The work is primarily mathematical analysis; however, computer experiments may be performed in order to provide preliminary insights and to provide accessible training opportunities for undergraduates in applied mathematics.

The feedback from the research findings on electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals will guide researchers of an experimental liquid crystal group at Kent State University in their experiments and will advance the understanding of pattern formation in complex fluids and their technological applications.

The novelty of this research lies in a combination of qualitative theoretical predictions resulting from a bifurcation analysis of amplitude and phase equations with traditional quantitative diagnostic methods used to study complex dynamics. Moreover, new and innovative tools such as topological data analysis and roughness measures are proposed for the quantitative characterization of anisotropic patterns. The results will provide a firm foundation for the intuition required to make sense of physical experiments and may suggest interesting further questions to test experimentally."

Probabilistic models are commonly used to represent physical, biological and financial phenomena that are often however too complex to solve, approximate or even simulate. The primary purpose of this research is to rigorously investigate problems related to multiscale systems, rare events and related Monte Carlo simulation methods. We are interested in studying stochastic dynamical systems that may have different time scales and understudying and quantifying related events that may be rare in a given time scale, but can have important consequences for the system itself. Exact solutions are typically impossible, so one has to rely on simulation and for this reason rigorous development of provably-efficient approximation methods and simulation Monte Carlo methods is in the core of our analysis. The problems of interest in this project are motivated both by fundamental mathematical questions and by a broad array of questions in other branches of science. Examples range from estimation of rare event probabilities in chemical physics, genetic switch models in biology, tracking loop problems in engineering to network failure and large portfolio losses in complex financial systems, where multiscale features and rare events are core issues. In addition, the research project is integrated with an educational program that is designed to help in the training of undergraduate and graduate students in applied mathematics, physics, engineering and chemistry in the exploration of rare events, multiscale processes and their analysis, calibration and simulation.<br/><br/>This research project leads to the development of a rigorous mathematical framework that allows to design provably efficient algorithms associated to modeling and estimation of rare events as well as statistical calibration methods. We are interested in both the large deviations regime (tail or rare events) as well as in the moderate deviations regime (the gap between the typical center and the tail of the distribution). We develop provably-efficient Monte Carlo methods such as importance sampling and statistical calibration methods. In a closely related direction we rigorously investigate the consequences of violation of time-reversibility in the design of Monte Carlo methods such as steady state simulation and algorithms for acceleration of convergence to equilibrium. The research project attempts to crystallize concepts and methods that are not well understood such as the effect of metastability on Monte Carlo methods and of multiple scales on large and moderate deviations, on Monte Carlo methods and on statistical estimation methods. The goal is to provide a useful and reliable methodology for simulation and statistical procedures for complex stochastic multiscale dynamical systems that can be used by a wide collection of disciplines and also open frontiers for research. Metastability behavior and multiscale phenomena are of central interest."

Compressible fluid mechanics includes a large set of models in very diverse settings: geophysical fluids with gravity in large scale fluids (Earth atmosphere), biological fluids (such as swimming bacteria), or ""exotic"" examples such as solar events or photon radiation.  Systems of particles typically involve a very large number of coupled equations, one for each particle.  Particles can here represent many different objects: In physics they can represent ions and electrons in plasmas, or molecules in a fluid, or even galaxies in some cosmological models; in the biosciences particles typically model micro-organisms (cells or bacteria); in economics or social sciences, particles are individual ""agents.""  Instabilities can develop in all those systems and may manifest as oscillations in the mass density of the fluid or as collisions (or near collisions) between particles.  A better understanding of such behavior can have important consequences.  For example, insights on the swarming motility of micro-organisms would help the development of new biotechnologies.  The main challenge to reduce the complexity of such systems is to understand how, and how quickly or slowly, the convection or transport (of mass in the fluid or of the particles) can amplify such oscillations.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The project offers a new mathematical framework to study instabilities in many-particles systems and nonlinear convection equations.  It unifies the methods to control collisions between particles, required by singular forces, and the ones to propagate regularity in convection equations, required to limit oscillations in nonlinear terms.  The new method relies on a direct control of the regularity of the solution through a doubling of variables and requires delicate and explicit commutator estimates.  This natural interplay between apparently very different sets of problems leads to new insights and breaks some of the barriers to more realistic models: Systems of interacting particles with physically realistic and unbounded forces or random collisions in velocity, leading to degenerate diffusion; models of fluid mechanics with thermodynamically unstable state laws or anisotropic terms.

Mathematical techniques have served an integral role in advancing neuroscience research for many decades. The International Conference on Mathematical Neuroscience will provide a forum for researchers to discuss current mathematical innovations emerging in neuroscience. The lectures will discuss new tools and methods for analyzing complex data sets and building rigorous mathematical models of brain function. A major aim of the conference is to attract and train young researchers on current methods in mathematical neuroscience. To fulfill this goal, there will be a tutorial component held the day before the main meeting. For broader impact, a collection of tutorial chapters will be solicited from presenters and published as a  collection of lectures, and presentations will be made available on the conference website. The conference  is in line with the present national BRAIN initiative, aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying neural computation. The topics discussed during the tutorial sessions and main meeting are relevant to scientific disciplines beyond neuroscience: including systems biology, economics, and ecology.<br/><br/>The meeting provides an opportunity for mathematicians to gain exposure to current research in neuroscience and communicate with neuroscientists. At the same time, it enables experimental neuroscientists to discuss current progress on understanding the dynamics and function of neural systems with mathematicians who develop new tools and methods to address present challenges. The meeting will begin with a tutorial day (May 30) featuring topics from three major areas in mathematical neuroscience: stochastic and nonlinear dynamics, information theory, and probability and statistics.  The tutorials will introduce junior researchers to fundamental techniques used in contemporary mathematical neuroscience through lectures given by leaders in the field. The main conference (May 31 - June 2) will feature a broader set of topics in mathematical neuroscience, with a focus on the use of experimental data in modeling studies as well as using theory and models to explore hypotheses and design better experiments. A new challenge in modern neuroscience is to extract understandable patterns and features from high-dimensional data sets including neuronal activity, functional connectivity, and anatomy. To understand how the human brain functions and performs complex computations, improved methods for handling data are needed, together with rigorous mathematical models of neural systems. This conference will bring together leaders in applied mathematics and neuroscience that are developing new mathematical techniques for understanding high-dimensional data sets, building models to capture activity patterns and emergent computation, and working closely with experimentalists to address more targeted questions about brain function. Synergistic interactions between these topics will also be identified, to understand the full complexity of the nervous system.

Partial differential equations (PDE) arise as mathematical descriptions of many natural and societal phenomena, for example, processes that change in both space and time, such as fluid mechanics, particle interaction, or financial markets. On the other hand, dynamical systems theory originated in classical Newtonian mechanics and developed into a universal tool for studying time evolution of a very broad range of phenomena. Techniques from the theory of dynamical systems have been used to analyze certain classes of PDE. The purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers who have pioneered the use of such techniques in the context of PDE, in order to share ideas, promote collaboration, and advance our understanding of these PDE models and how dynamical systems techniques can be used to analyze them. In addition, the conference will further our ability to predict dynamics of the physical phenomena that these PDEs describe. Many of the conference participants will be junior researchers, such as PhD students, who will benefit greatly from interacting with more senior researchers and also from presenting their own work. <br/><br/>In the last several decades techniques from the theory of finite-dimensional dynamical systems have proven to be extremely useful for analyzing certain classes of PDE that can be viewed as infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. These PDE are viewed as evolution equations whose phase space is an appropriate infinite-dimensional Banach or Hilbert space. Methods such as semigroup theory, invariant manifolds, stability analysis, and KAM theory have all been utilized to great effect for a variety of these PDE, including the Navier-Stokes equation, Korteweg-deVries equation, Boussinesq equation, nonlinear Schrödinger equation, and the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model. The conference will focus on two main types of PDE where this dynamical systems approach has been particularly successful: Hamiltonian systems and models from fluid dynamics. This focus on the two classes of PDE mentioned above will allow for a more complete coverage of recent related developments. Broader impacts will result from the participation of early-career researchers and those from underrepresented groups, who will be able to network and interact with senior participants and to learn about emerging directions in their field. Furthermore, both Hamiltonian systems and fluids models arise from practical applications, and thus the advancement in our understanding of the behavior of solutions to those models will in turn forward our ability to predict the types of behaviors observed in the physical systems themselves.

Similar mathematical approaches are useful for the study of image reconstruction from incomplete data in optical imaging, such as in microscopy and optical metrology applications. We will apply the methods developed for CT to optical imaging with the goal of increasing the field-of-view or reducing the amount of measurements, while maintaining spatial resolution in the ROI. This research may pave the way to the development of inexpensive, large-field-of-view direct phase imaging systems, which, in turn, would benefit cell biology research, and applications such as digital pathology and cell-tracking. <br/><br/>In CT with truncated data, the key analytical tool is the Gelfand-Graev formula, which transforms the tomographic reconstruction problem to the problem of inverting the finite Hilbert transform (FHT) of the attenuation coefficient from incomplete data. When CT data are truncated, reconstruction of the attenuation coefficient is frequently non-unique. On the other hand, the contribution of the missing data to the ROI is analytic, and adding prior knowledge about the attenuation coefficient inside the ROI restores uniqueness. Another application where inversion of the FHT with incomplete data is useful is optical imaging. Inspired by the recent development of compressive optical imaging in spectroscopy and holography, optical systems based on the FHT have the potential to achieve high resolution, high speed phase contrast imaging. In a number of microscopy imaging applications, prior knowledge about the sample being investigated is possible to obtain. Thus, similar approaches can be used both for CT and for optical imaging. The objective of the research is to develop theory and algorithms for inverting the FHT with incomplete data. We will estimate stability of inverting the FHT with incomplete data by finding the singular value decomposition of the relevant operators. The method of the Riemann-Hilbert problem, perturbation theory, and the Titchmarsh-Weyl theory, are some of the mathematical tools that will be used in this project. We also plan to develop and test the corresponding reconstruction algorithms and test them on simulated and experimental data."

This research project concerns the derivation and numerical implementation of a mathematical theory capable of describing, explaining, and predicting the initiation and propagation of fracture in soft organic solids---namely, solids made up of networks of long carbon-based macromolecules such as elastomers, gels, and biological tissues---when subjected to arbitrarily large mechanical forces.  Soft organic solids are known to fracture in a very different manner than standard hard solids (such as metals and ceramics).  The defining difference is that internal fracture in soft organic solids initiates through the sudden growth of inherent defects into large enclosed cavities/cracks (a phenomenon popularly referred to as cavitation).  With the ever-increasing use of soft materials in new technologies, a fundamental and quantitative understanding of when and how organic solids fracture is of utmost importance for their advancement.  Likewise, such a fundamental and quantitative understanding is critical in advancing medical treatments involving soft biological tissues, such as shock-wave lithotripsy, or treatments dealing with aneurysms.<br/><br/>This project centers on a novel variational theory of fracture for finitely deformable solids that is consistent with the principle of conservation of mass (a highly non-trivial feature that has been overlooked in the literature by related formulations) and wherein the newly created surfaces (by fracture) are not restricted to be hypersurfaces (as in classical brittle fracture) but can also be the boundaries of N-dimensional cavities, N being the spatial dimension.  The main objectives of the project are: (1) to develop a formulation in terms of variational evolutions for the initiation and propagation of fracture in soft organic solids under arbitrarily large quasi-static deformations, and (2) to implement this formulation numerically and confront its predictions with emerging experimental evidence of high spatio-temporal resolution.  Objective (1) entails rigorous existence results, while objective (2) entails the construction of appropriate approximate functionals (of the phase-field type) and their stable and convergent numerical implementation in the non-convex context of finite deformations with constraints (in particular, incompressibility)."

Albeit well understood from a physical perspective, the phenomenon still is not rigorously described from a precise quantitative perspective. This project concerns an analogous phenomenon that arises in biomedical applications, where one needs to describe how the optical field ""scintillates"" and is affected by tissue microstructure in imaging studies. High-resolution biomedical imaging is fundamentally important for early cancer detection, monitoring of drug efficiency, computer assisted surgery, and for the evaluation of health of tissue, organs, and bones in general. Monitoring of glucose level, heart rate, blood pressure, and other medical indicators may in the future be optically based, and new drugs that are activated by focusing of optical energy may significantly reduce potential side effects in the treatment of cancer or diabetes.  Biological tissue is typically so complicated that one can only describe the microstructure in a statistical fashion.  In this project the complex multiscale propagation environment will be modeled as a heterogeneous multiscale random field varying in both space and time. The project will support the development of new optically based techniques in biomedical imaging by enhancing our understanding of how the optical field is affected by the microstructure. The project will also support the development of new techniques in other areas of imaging and wave propagation, such as remote sensing and communication through the atmosphere and in geophysical imaging. <br/><br/>In the project, specific scaling relations will used to derive asymptotic descriptions of wave field statistics. The descriptions will be used in the development of optimal filtering and imaging techniques that can exploit the vast amount of data that new optical technology provides. Such a description of the wave field will have important applications in a range of areas in optics and imaging, while the focus here is on quantitative biomedical imaging. The project aims at developing new results that allow one to model optical wave propagation in complicated media. This will concern propagation both for paraxial waves and propagation in the sub-diffusive regime, moreover, propagation in the radiative transfer and diffusion regimes. The development is based on stochastic modeling of the multiscale medium and using scaling limits that allow one to characterize the statistics of the wave field. A main technical challenge in this work is the fact that in the context of waves, information flows in all directions due to wave scattering, rather than being an evolution problem as in the classic context of stochastic processes. This situation leads to an infinite family of imbedding problems that couple statistically. Novel imaging and filtering techniques that exploit spectral wave information for multi-point observations of the optical field will be analyzed and developed in the project, using the scaling limit results developed together with random matrix theory and statistical estimation techniques."

This research is aimed at the mathematical study of special and very important ""solitary-wave"" solutions that represent a single wave or a train of single waves traveling through the medium. Solutions of this mathematical nature are instrumental for predicting behavior and designing engineering devices for the wide range of physically unrelated phenomena, such as water wave dynamics, in particular, gigantic ocean waves (""rogue"" waves), magnetization of materials, propagation of light in optical fibers and other optical media, or some quantum mechanical dynamics. Even when it is not possible to completely determine the solutions to such equations, the evolution of the corresponding physical system can often be understood satisfactorily by considering a computational or approximate solution. This is feasible, provided the behavior of solutions does not change qualitatively when unavoidable computational errors or uncertainty in the parameters are introduced. In mathematics this insensitivity to small perturbations is termed ""stability."" The principal goal of this research project is developing new mathematical tools for study nonlinear dispersive waves and stability of their solitary-wave solutions. In particular, the Principal Investigator (PI) aims at obtaining precise, quantitative information about the long time (asymptotic) behavior. Graduate students will be trained and mentored through their participation in this project.<br/><br/>The PI will consider the questions of stability of solitons, such as traveling waves, standing waves, traveling kinks, for various models arising in physical applications.

In addition, the PI will address several outstanding problems in the theory of spatially discrete dispersive systems, of the type of the discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation and the granular chain model with Hertzian interactions. These are the models, where new paradigms are expected to emerge. More precisely, the models present obstacles to their investigation that are either not present in the corresponding ""standard"" continuous limits or else, the solutions behave in a substantially different ways than the respective continuous analogues. Thus, new mathematical methods need to be developed to address the challenges associated with the study of evolution of these discrete models."

In the first part of the project, the investigator focuses on understanding and modeling the behavior of complex fluid flows under the requirement of incompressibility, that is, preserving the volume occupied by the fluid.  Many fluids are approximately incompressible, including water and under some conditions even air.  The complex behavior that is investigated is due to friction between the fluid and rigid walls, and to stirring of the fluid itself.  Both are major phenomena in fluid mechanics and are still not fully understood rigorously.  Wall friction creates drag and produces swirls in the flow that contribute to the onset of turbulence.  Quantifying the effect of stirring and mixing in fluid flows has direct impact on many physical processes, from extrusion and molding, to efficient combustion, to pollutant dispersal.  In the second part of the project, the investigator studies the propagation of time-periodic waves in elastic materials.  Waves can be used to remotely probe materials by recording their elastic response under an applied disturbance.  This is a so-called inverse problem, as material properties are inferred from measurements, and it is highly sensitive to errors.  Mathematical algorithms are used to improve the reliability of the reconstruction.  The type of inverse problem that is studied finds applications in geological exploration, earthquake prediction, and ground-penetrating radar.  The project provides training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The investigator uses analytical and computational techniques to study problems in incompressible fluid mechanics and in mechanics of deformable solids.

Elasticity: Inverse boundary problem for time-harmonic waves in elastic media.  These problems are characterized by the presence of singularities, in the form of singular problems for partial differential equations (PDE), such as the zero-viscosity limit for the Navier-Stokes equations, or in the form of singular coefficients in the PDE, such as in mixing problems under non-Lipschitz flows, or singular domains for the PDE, such as domains with corners.  The project addresses some fundamental open questions in fluid mechanics concerning the behavior of incompressible fluids at high Reynolds numbers.  It seeks to shed light on the mechanism for boundary layer separation and the validity of Prandtl approximation through the rigorous analysis of special flows.  It also seeks to quantify mixing properties of flows under the strong divergence-free constraint from the point of view of transport equations and geometric analysis.  In the second part, the project addresses the stability and performance of reconstruction algorithms in inverse boundary problems, which have had a major impact on non-invasive imaging techniques.  The appearance of singularities and the interplay between analysis and geometry are recurring themes of the project.

It will provide rigorous insight and fundamental scientific understanding supporting applications of graphene sheets and related carbon macromolecules to develop new materials and technologies.<br/><br/>The particular focus of this research is on pattern formation and interface motion in various two- or three-dimensional nanoscale structures built from two-dimensional macromolecules of carbon atoms.  The project addresses a collection of problems related to lattice registry effects in single and bilayer graphene sheets, carbon nanotubes, and other carbon nanostructures.  The phenomena motivating this study include pattern formation and localized wrinkling driven by lattice and orientation mismatches between a graphene sheet and its supporting substrate, moire patterns in bilayer graphene, motion of grain boundaries in polycrystalline graphene, and polygonization and faceting in multi-walled carbon nanotubes.  Several variational problems are considered; analyzing the minimizers of these problems will yield insight into the phenomena just mentioned.  A part of the project is devoted to studying propagation of interfaces using gradient flow dynamics.  Much of the research activity hinges upon deriving continuum models that retain lattice registry effects to describe weak van der Waals interactions in carbon nanostructures.  Hence, an important part of this study is the rigorous justification of the atomistic-to-continuum procedure that leads to such continuum models.  Understanding and perhaps controlling phenomena influenced by lattice registry in carbon nanostructures and recently developed van der Waals heterostructures is essential for the successful use of these structures in materials science and nanoscale device development."

These problems are known as fluid-structure interactions and fluid-solid mixture problems, respectively.  In most of these applications, the ultimate goal is the optimization or optimal control of the considered process, as well as related sensitivity analysis (with respect to relevant physical/biological parameters) investigations. Examples include the design of small-scale unmanned aircrafts and morphing aircraft wings, like robo-bees, minimizing turbulence in blood flow within a stenosed or stented artery, or optimizing the pressure of the blood flow and investigating the influence of pertinent biological parameters in the case of the lamina cribrosa in the eye, where these factors are believed to be related to the development of glaucoma.  This research program addresses sensitivity analysis, control, and optimization-related problems for moving boundary fluid-elasticity interactions and fluid flows through biological tissues.  The project will focus on the particular example of the coupling between biomechanics and hemodynamics in the lamina cribrosa in the eye, where performing sensitivity analysis with respect to important parameters (like blood flow and intraocular and retrolaminar pressures) will further the understanding of the cause and progression of glaucoma, and enable novel means for preventing or treating glaucoma. This research will also be applicable to other biological fluid-solid mixtures such as cartilages, bones, and engineered tissues. <br/><br/>Moving boundary fluid-elasticity interactions and  porous media flows are nonlinear dynamical systems with Banach space parameters, and most questions related to their sensitivity analysis and control are open in the field. This project will (i) advance the theory of optimal control problems subject to these nonlinear systems by developing the theoretical framework for sensitivity analysis and optimality conditions;  (ii) perform sensitivity analysis on the lamina cribrosa model to identify the important biological parameters, and use the obtained results to develop and address possible control strategies in the development of glaucoma. Well-posedness of optimal solutions, Frechet differentiability of cost functionals and state  with respect to both distributed and boundary controls, and derivation and well-posedness analysis of adjoint systems will be addressed.  These results will provide the starting point for all sensitivity calculations, parameter estimation, and derivative-based optimization algorithms."

Engineering devices generally consist of more than one material.  Their interconnections, as well as the binding of the device to substrates, are susceptible to environmental agents that ultimately cause them to break down, leading to device failure.  It is estimated that the cost of product recall in the medical device industry alone ranges between $2.5 and $5 billion annually, 50% of which is attributed to material failure.  This project will investigate material fracture in polymeric materials, with a main focus on gels.  The mechanism of failure in gels as well as the mathematical methods to address it are very different from those in crystalline materials.  Upon placement of a polymeric material in a fluid-rich environment, such as an implanted medical device in the body, it tends to swell by absorbing water.  Different materials have different swelling ratios, which cause stress to build up at the bonding interfaces and substrates.  Upon reaching the stress threshold of the adhesive, the device may experience debonding.  The research activities will consist of modeling, analysis, and numerical simulation of the phenomena that causes a gel to break apart from its substrate.  There will be a strong and clear connection with laboratory experiments and industrial applications, especially those related to the medical device industry.  Several graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research.<br/><br/>Understanding material fracture, its initiation and evolution, remains one of the main challenges in materials science.  From the mathematical point of view, the study of debonding requires dealing with singular solutions, in cases when standard mechanical assumptions fail.  This project will develop and apply combined tools from calculus of variations, geometric measure theory, asymptotic analysis, and free boundary problems for partial differential equations to provide a mathematical description of how microdefects present in the material may evolve into cavities that grow and cause the material to detach from a substrate.  The main mathematical difficulty in the study of cavitation is the loss of injectivity of the deformation map that transforms a point in the reference configuration into a cavity surface.  The application of tools from measure theory, such as the distributional determinant, allows validation of the governing equations in the singular frameworks.  The research will provide a unified framework to study cavitation and debonding, and the evolution from the former to the latter.  The project will focus on studying singularities that form in gels, assumed to be mixtures of polymer and fluid.  Swelling of a gel sample attached to a substrate may produce the necessary force for singularities to form.  The analysis of delamination will be based on the conjecture that there are two relevant parameters, geometric and material, able to describe the optimal energy of the body in terms of the length of detachment from the substrate.  One goal is to show that stress concentrations at interfaces correspond to shearing."

This condition allows the fluid to slip over a surface, which is known to occur with hydrophobic surfaces, with human tissue constructs that have rough surfaces, and with shark's skin.  Very recently it was shown that using the standard no-slip condition to study contact between structures (e.g., rigid balls) immersed in a viscous, incompressible fluid, contact can never occur in finite time.  Using sophisticated mathematics, recent results also show that if the Navier slip condition is used to model contact of immersed bodies, allowing fluid to slip in between the structures leads to the structures touching each other in finite time.  These recent results all address contact between rigid structures.  This project goes a step further to study the interaction between fluids and elastic structures when the Navier slip boundary condition is used to model the physics of the problem.  The aim is to resolve questions related to the modeling of closure of human heart valves interacting with blood flow, and flows over rough elastic surfaces such as tissue constructs interacting with blood.  A series of novel mathematical and computational methods is proposed to understand these complex physical and physiological problems.  Students and postdocs are involved in the project.<br/><br/>     The mathematical techniques to study these problems are based on a partitioned fluid-structure interaction algorithm.  The investigator develops a novel approach to studying existence of weak solutions to this class of problems by first semi-discretizing the multi-physics coupled problem in time, and then using an operator splitting strategy to split the fluid from structure sub-problems.  Particular care is used to deal with the well-known added mass effect that may lead to instabilities.  The splitting approach developed here to deal with the Navier slip condition promises to provide the correct splitting strategy, which leads to the uniform energy estimates.  With the construction of compactness arguments based on Simon's and Ehrling Lemmas, the existence of a weak solution is obtained by calculating the limits of the approximate sequences converging in time to a weak solution.  This analysis can be used as a base for a computational algorithm in the calculation of solutions to this class of nonlinear, moving-boundary problems.  The result of this work promises to contribute to the understanding of the so called ""no-collision paradox,"" referring to the impossibility of a contact of smooth rigid bodies immersed in an incompressible, viscous fluid, modeled with the no-slip condition."

Answers to natural questions about the stability and rigidity of material structures involve understanding the geometry of their components.  Recent advances in materials synthesis have emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of the geometric stability of physical structures at the atomic scale and the need for insight at all scales, from atomic to macroscopic. Key mathematical tools for this analysis come from the area of ""rigidity theory,"" which studies the mathematical properties of discrete sets of points with the distances between certain pairs of points held fixed or constrained by distance inequalities. Rigidity theory lies at the nexus of discrete geometry, graph theory, and algorithms, and it has deep connections to semidefinite programming and convex geometry.  This project aims to deepen understanding of the stability of material structures. <br/><br/>One goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic explanation of tunneling between asymmetric stable configurations of two-dimensional disordered materials, such as glass. Construction of accurate mechanistic and computational models requires deep mathematical analysis and development of appropriate algorithms. A second goal is to develop methods for predicting the stability, configurational entropy, and kinetics of small short-ranged-potential systems in three dimensions. Examples of such distance-constraint systems include small molecular structures, as well as colloidal clusters, containing a few particles bound together by reversible attractive interactions, modeled as sticky spheres. What kinds of rigid configurations are there, and what are computationally feasible tests for their rigidity? How do these particles move and the structures deform? There is a tight link between rigidity theory and the general convexity and duality properties of the positive semidefinite cone, a central concept in numerical optimization. Finding a recursive decomposition of a generically rigid framework into rigid subsystems is a longstanding problem. Additionally, matroid theory, important in rigidity theory, has made the characterization of rigid systems more approachable and more algorithmically efficient. Rigidity theory could have implications for algorithms for low-rank matrix completion as well. These connections, questions, and implications will be explored in this project."

Periodic media, such as photonic crystals or media with periodically changing refractive index, can be manipulated to control light's propagation and achieve, for example, light trapping and routing. Progress in this area of research has promising applications for on-chip data processing at microscopic scales. By judiciously balancing the gain and loss in the so-called parity-time-symmetric configurations, one can induce the light to behave in novel ways, giving rise to a possibility of ""optical diodes."" Such an optical diode that is capable of transmitting a signal in only one direction would be an elemental base of optical computers. In this project, novel nonlinear behavior of light in periodic media and gain-loss-balanced media are theoretically investigated. By developing new mathematical methodologies, new insight will be gained on the nonlinear propagation of light in such media, so that their application for data processing can be assessed. From a broader perspective, this project will facilitate training of a graduate student in this important interdisciplinary area.<br/><br/>The problems undertaken in this project are at the cutting edge of applied mathematics and optics.  On the mathematical side, this project will develop novel mathematical methodologies for the treatment of contemporary nonlinear optics problems, such as a sophisticated exponential asymptotics technique for the bifurcation and linear stability of lump solitons in two-dimensional periodic media. On the physical side, the mathematical results from this project will allow us to assess the potential of optical solitons for various physical applications such as data processing on microscopic periodic structures. In addition, the theoretical investigation of actual parity-time-symmetric single-mode lasers could directly impact the nonlinear operation of those lasers and may lead to more advanced laser devices."

While these problems are common across the applied sciences, this project will focus on three examples. In neuroscience, recordings of neuron activity using extracellular electrodes measure the action potentials or spikes of adjacent cells. Spike sorting, or equivalently multi-waveform deconvolution, is the problem of identifying the signals corresponding to each cell and deconvolving them to reveal the separate spiking patterns. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy allows one to obtain images or videos of complex cell structures at high resolution from low-resolution data. In computer vision, blurred pictures, such as ones taken from a cellphone, are well approximated by the convolution of a sharp image with a motion-blur kernel. The aim of this project is to develop and analyze algorithms to tackle these problems, with special emphasis on adapting these methods so that they can be applied efficiently to large amounts of data. <br/><br/>Most recent literature on underdetermined linear inverse problems under sparsity constraints focuses on randomized sensing schemes, which do not allow to model convolution problems such as super-resolution, spike sorting in neuroscience, or blind deconvolution in computer vision. The main goal of this project is to develop optimization-based methods for deterministic deconvolution problems, as well as to derive theoretical guarantees on their performance and their robustness to noise. This will require developing novel proof techniques, which do not rely on probabilistic tools, to characterize the conditioning of convolution operators and the optimality conditions of L1-norm minimization problems. Building upon these optimization-based methods, practical algorithms will be designed to operate in big-data regimes where it is not computationally tractable to apply sophisticated processing uniformly across the data."

It is driven by applications in gas dynamics and plasma physics as well by mathematical interests in analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. Kinetic equations are used to describe evolution of interacting particles, such as gas molecules, ions and electrons in a plasma. The most famous kinetic equation is the Boltzmann equation: formulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872, this equation describes motion of a large class of gases. Later, in 1936 Lev Landau derived from the Boltzmann equation a new mathematical model for motion of plasma. This latter equation was named the Landau equation. Despite the fact that many mathematicians and physicists have been working on these equations, many important questions are still unanswered due to their mathematical complexity. The proposed research will fundamentally contribute to this field by bridging the gap between mathematical analysis and physics and enable further mathematical understanding of physical phenomena. The work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen inter-institutional ties. The research program will be integrated with educational and outreach activities designed to (i) broaden the students' understanding of different research areas, (ii) provide the students with a modern skill set that is essential for different career paths, and (iii) promote existing connections between local institutions in the DC Metro area and help establish new avenues for collaboration and training of high quality scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The proposed research will advance the knowledge in global properties of solutions to collisional kinetic mathematical models, improving our understanding of non-linear dynamics, entropy, equilibrium, and regularizing effects. The corresponding equations contain integro-differential operators that are highly nonlinear, singular and with degenerating coefficients. Integro-differential equations of this type have received increased attention recently: well-posedness and regularity theory are being developed since many new applications have emerged, among which conformal geometry, stochastic control and image processing. The project aims at advancing knowledge in the theories of kinetic equations, nonlocal integro-differential operators and degenerate differential operators."

A dynamical system consists of a state space, in which a point represents a complete description of the state of the system, and a rule governing the evolution of the system from one state to another. This project focuses on the long-term behavior of such systems from two complementary points of view. From the first point of view, the project seeks to describe the behavior of typical systems when the rules of evolution are chosen at random. Such results shed light on what properties one might expect to find in disordered systems. The second point of view, the ""inverse problem,"" concerns the statistical problem of recovering some information from the observation of a dynamical system. While there are many examples of dynamical systems being used as mathematical models, and there is a large statistical literature regarding inference and estimation, the performance of statistical procedures when applied to data generated by nonlinear dynamical systems is poorly understood. This project focuses on characterizing when traditional statistical procedures may be effectively applied in the context of dynamical systems. Beyond the very fertile potential applications, the project will also have broader impact on training of graduate students who will acquire invaluable skills in sound probabilistic modeling and statistical inference by working on the project's research topics.<br/><br/>Symbolic dynamical systems, which may be defined in terms of discrete constraints on the possible trajectories, serve as prototypical models of systems that evolve over time. Random ensembles of these systems may be produced by selecting the constraints at random. Ideas from both discrete probability and dynamical systems may then be used to analyze the structural properties of the resulting systems with high probability. For the inverse problem, this project seeks to evaluate the performance of several statistical inference procedures, both frequentist and Bayesian, when the models involved are dynamical systems. Fundamental questions about convergence and consistency of the procedures may be addressed using tools from ergodic theory, such as joinings and the thermodynamic formalism."

Answers to natural questions about the stability and rigidity of material structures involve understanding the geometry of their components.  Recent advances in materials synthesis have emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of the geometric stability of physical structures at the atomic scale and the need for insight at all scales, from atomic to macroscopic. Key mathematical tools for this analysis come from the area of ""rigidity theory,"" which studies the mathematical properties of discrete sets of points with the distances between certain pairs of points held fixed or constrained by distance inequalities. Rigidity theory lies at the nexus of discrete geometry, graph theory, and algorithms, and it has deep connections to semidefinite programming and convex geometry.  This project aims to deepen understanding of the stability of material structures. <br/><br/>One goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic explanation of tunneling between asymmetric stable configurations of two-dimensional disordered materials, such as glass. Construction of accurate mechanistic and computational models requires deep mathematical analysis and development of appropriate algorithms. A second goal is to develop methods for predicting the stability, configurational entropy, and kinetics of small short-ranged-potential systems in three dimensions. Examples of such distance-constraint systems include small molecular structures, as well as colloidal clusters, containing a few particles bound together by reversible attractive interactions, modeled as sticky spheres. What kinds of rigid configurations are there, and what are computationally feasible tests for their rigidity? How do these particles move and the structures deform? There is a tight link between rigidity theory and the general convexity and duality properties of the positive semidefinite cone, a central concept in numerical optimization. Finding a recursive decomposition of a generically rigid framework into rigid subsystems is a longstanding problem. Additionally, matroid theory, important in rigidity theory, has made the characterization of rigid systems more approachable and more algorithmically efficient. Rigidity theory could have implications for algorithms for low-rank matrix completion as well. These connections, questions, and implications will be explored in this project."

While a system of interest is often relatively simple, the environment it interacts with is often complicated and requires a judicious choice of a mathematical model. A model must be rich enough to capture essential features of the underlying phenomena; at the same time, the model needs to be mathematically tractable. In some of the models under investigation, the environment manifests itself as static disorder. This is in particular the case in models of activated carbon. One of the challenges in this particular investigation is to understand appearance of graphene sheets in activated carbon production. Graphene, a material that consists of just one layer of carbon atoms forming two-dimensional sheets, demonstrates a plethora of remarkable properties just beginning to be employed in engineering. This work, which has both theoretical and strong applied potential, will be done in collaboration with scientists working in industry. The long-term goal is to understand statistical mechanics in the presence of noise and disorder, which will enable study of more complicated systems relevant for applications in life sciences. The project will involve training of students through involvement in the research.<br/><br/>In the majority of systems under study in this project, interaction with the environment takes the form of noise, modeled as a random perturbation, varying in time. Both classical and quantum systems will be modeled this way. In the case of classical systems, the project studies the qualitative impact of noise in systems with magnetic and time-dependent forces and, more generally, bifurcations resulting from the presence of noise. Of particular interest are also systems of large number of interacting particles. Previous work on one such system has possible applications for design of systems of task-performing micro-robots; that research will be continued in the present project. The theory of open quantum systems is much less developed; in this context the project investigates simple quantum optical systems, as well as the basic phenomenon of quantum Brownian motion. Particularly interesting physically is the case in which the strength of the interaction of the Brownian particle with the environment depends on its position. Mathematical models of this situation are not well understood and the project aims to improve the existing theory. More involved systems will also be studied, especially in the limit of small particle masses. The research on diffusive and open systems will be done in close collaboration with physics groups, both experimental and theoretical."

Examples of this are contact processes which model infections that spread by contact with an infected neighbor. Other example are voter models which describe the spread of opinions where an individual's opinions are affected by his or her neighbor's opinions. Other motivations arise from extending methods of statistical mechanics classically done on regular lattices to the setting of random lattices which we may think of as random graphs or networks on a surface. In this work the PI will provide an improved understanding of such models in terms of random metrics. One may imagine these metrics are determined by patterns of disease propagation or social contact. Interestingly the general study of random metrics arose from physical investigations of two-dimensional (2D) quantum gravity.<br/><br/>The central problem of 2D quantum gravity, in mathematical terms, is to rigorously construct a measure on the space of metrics on a Riemann surface. This is a long-standing problem of both geometric and physical relevance. But aside from, and perhaps even beyond this, it serves as a rich source of novel problems and ideas that are at the interface between random structures and integrable systems. The focus of this proposal is on emerging crosscurrents of research between probability theory, with an emphasis on random geometry and combinatorics, and integrable systems theory with an emphasis on classical analysis, complex function theory, dynamical systems and conservative partial differential equations."

Mathematicians and physicists believe that an explanation for and the prediction of both breezes and turbulence can be found through an understanding of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations.  Though most physicists and engineers believe that the smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations cannot break down without external forcing, currently there is no theoretical guarantee that this is indeed the case.  The investigator's recent study with collaborators indicates that the Euler equations, which correspond to the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations, could develop a catastrophic behavior if one starts with a highly symmetric but perfectly smooth flow.  Such a scenario is like a perfect storm in which all things that could potentially go wrong indeed go wrong.  A potentially singular behavior of the fluid flows described by the Navier-Stokes equations could negate the ability to forecast the behavior of fluid systems accurately.  The investigator studies conditions under which the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations may develop a potentially singular behavior.  The ultimate goal of the project is to develop effective analytical and computational tools that enhance our ability to model and predict various complex fluid flows, such as those arising in engineering, oceanography, and weather forecasting.  Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars are included in the work of the project.  The interdisciplinary training they receive is important for their future careers in mathematics and science.<br/><br/>The project seeks to understand whether the incompressible 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations could develop a finite-time singularity from a smooth initial condition with finite energy.  A major approach of the project is to study the spatial profiles in potential self-similar singularities of the solutions, which can be obtained by solving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem.  A notable aspect of the project is the combination of highly resolved numerical simulations and rigorous mathematical analysis.  Numerical computations are first conducted to detect potential finite-time singularity scenarios and gain primary understanding about the singularity formation.  Then the evolution equations of spatial profiles in the solutions are studied using a dynamic rescaling formulation both analytically and numerically.  The theoretical framework developed in this project introduces an appropriate notion of stability for the self-similar profiles through the dynamic rescaling formulation.  Stability of the numerically constructed self-similar profile is a crucial step in constructing a finite-time singularity of the Euler equations.  Another interesting aspect of the project is that the dynamic rescaling formulation provides a natural framework to investigate whether the finite-time singularity in the Euler equations may lead to a potential finite-time singularity of the Navier-Stokes equations for certain type of singularities.  The stability of self-similar profiles of the Euler equations again plays a crucial role in this study."

The overarching goal of the activity is to address scientific issues that are relevant to the scientific community and bring to surface possible areas of opportunity for multidisciplinary research in the study of complex systems. The specific goals of the workshop include: 1) identifying the most substantive research questions that can be addressed by fundamental complex systems research; 2) recognizing community needs, knowledge gaps, and barriers to research progress in this area; 3) identifying future directions that cut across disciplinary boundaries and that are likely to lead to transformative multidisciplinary research in complex systems. The outcomes of the workshop will include the preparation of a report to inform the scientific community at large of the current status and challenges as well as future opportunities in multidisciplinary complex systems research as perceived by the participants of the workshop.<br/><br/>The workshop is motivated by the observation that many processes in natural, engineered, and social contexts exhibit emergent collective behavior and are thus governed by complex systems. Because challenges in understanding, predicting, designing, and controlling complex systems are often common to many domains, a central objective of the workshop is to facilitate the exchange of ideas across different fields and avoid disciplinary boundaries typical of many traditional scientific meetings. The workshop participants will include experts both in theory and in applications as well as a selection of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students from various domains. Because of the cross-disciplinary nature of the workshop, the participants themselves will become aware of the latest developments in fields related to but different from their own. This environment will foster discussions on the state of the art, potential issues, and most promising directions in multidisciplinary complex systems research. The inclusion of early-career researchers will help to promote the transfer of this expertise to the next generation of engineers, mathematicians, and scientists."

The first part of this research project addresses the mathematical modeling and analysis of systems of multidimensional conservation laws that mostly relate to problems in dynamics of gases and liquids. It focuses on change of type (transonic) problems, from supersonic to subsonic, or mixed type problems with discontinuities, such as vortex waves and shock waves. The commonly known manifestation of the latter is generation of a sonic boom when an airplane exceeds the velocity of sound. This project aims at developing systematic theories to understand the solution structures of these transonic problems in multidimensional conservation laws. The second part of the project aims to investigate the feasibility of various wildfire spread models with sparse data, and develop efficient algorithms to perform simulations for the model problems. In recent years wildfires have become an all too frequent occurrence, especially in the Western United States. The research on the wildfire spread models will enable effective fire-fighting planning, and thus have a direct impact on the welfare of society. The project will take place at a large, urban, Hispanic-serving institution and involve undergraduate/master students in simulations of the proposed problems, preparing them for further work in the design, implementation, and development of the algorithms. <br/><br/>This project addresses long standing open problems in multidimensional conservation laws, such as Mach shock reflections to resolve the von Neumann paradox, slip line discontinuity propagation to understand vortex waves, and the transonic flow to study a flow passing an airfoil. The investigator will focus on these nonlinear transonic problems to gain new physical insights, to develop novel analytical tools, and to find the correct mathematical framework in which to pose the nonlinear conservation laws and to perhaps develop efficient numerical methods. This research aims to provide more efficient and effective methods for applications, including compressible gas dynamics, thermodynamics, multi-phase flow, and porous medium flow. A part of this research will be devoted to modeling wildfire spread with reaction-advection-diffusion systems. The investigator will investigate the feasibility of various wildfire spread models with sparse data and develop efficient algorithms to solve the model problems. Results will be tested on realistic data. Some aspects of this project will be conducted in collaboration with early career researchers, and in communication with the USDA Forest Fire Lab in Riverside, CA."

Such systems are ubiquitous in nature, and include examples as diverse as light propagation through the atmosphere, seismic waves in the Earth following an earthquake, stock market fluctuations, and medical imaging problems. The mathematical modeling of such problems involves partial differential equations with highly oscillatory coefficients. Typically, such problems involve a multitude of temporal and spatial scales: a typical propagation distance may be of the order of hundreds or thousands of wavelengths and as many correlation lengths of random fluctuations. Numerical simulation of the microscopic details of the solutions is beyond the reach even for the most powerful modern computers. For the prediction and understanding  of behavior of these multi-scale system, it is imperative to use various approximate macroscopic effective models that preserve the salient features of the processes without keeping track of all microscopic details. The overarching goal of the project is to develop a better understanding of the validity of such macroscopic models. <br/><br/>The goal of the first part of the project is to develop new tools and better understanding of the effective limits in wave propagation, with the focus on random media with long-range correlations that lead to multiple temporal and spatial scales for various physical phenomena. The second part of the proposal investigates the qualitative behavior of the solutions of reaction-diffusion equations with stochastic perturbations.  Stochastic fluctuations and heterogeneities play a significant effect on front propagation properties, leading to new types of solutions and asymptotic behavior. One goal of the project will be to understand the connection between the stochastic reaction-diffusion problems and the recent theory of the regularity structures."

Major multinational companies, such as W.L. Gore & Associates and Pall Corporation, manufacture a huge range of membrane-based filtration products and have a keen interest in improving and optimizing their filters.  Membrane filtration is used in applications as diverse as water purification; treatment of radioactive sludge; various purification processes in the biotech industry; the cleaning of air or other gases; and beer clarification.  While the underlying applications may vary dramatically (gas versus liquid filtration; small versus large particle removal; slow versus fast throughput; rigid versus deformable particles), the broad engineering challenge is the same: to achieve finely-controlled separation at low power consumption.  But membrane characteristics (and hence the filter's behavior and performance) are far from constant over the filter lifetime: the particles removed from the feed are deposited within and on the filter, fouling it and degrading its performance.  The processes by which this fouling occurs are complex and depend strongly on several factors, including the internal structure of the membrane, the flow dynamics of the feed solution, and the type of particles in the feed (their shape, size, and chemistry affect how they are removed by the membrane).  In this project new mathematical models are developed to simulate membrane filtration and fouling, allowing membrane design parameters to be tuned for optimal performance.  Particular attention is paid to the role played by the details of the internal membrane morphology, so that detailed design guidelines can be formulated.  Collaboration with an industrial partner (Dr. Anil Kumar of Pall Corporation) maximizes the chances that our theoretical results translate into industrial practice.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     This project studies flow and fouling in membrane filters, which are of significant interest for industrial applications.  Working with a PhD student, the PI and her collaborator formulate new predictive mathematical models that describe two situations of practical importance: (i) Flow and fouling within pleated filter cartridges, and (ii) Membrane fouling models for internally heterogeneous membranes.  In each scenario the team builds models that account for an arbitrary particle size distribution within the feed solution, and also for a distribution of membrane pore sizes.  First-principles theoretical studies of these scenarios are of interest to others carrying out fundamental theoretical and experimental research on such systems, as well as to those seeking to extend the scope of current applications and improve manufacturing processes.  An industrial colleague, Dr. Anil Kumar of Pall Corporation, collaborates on the project.  An experimentalist, he shares his existing data with the team, generates new data as needed to test the models, and acts as industrial advisor.  This interaction ensures that the project remains focused and that questions relevant to applications are identified and addressed.  The experimental data help to determine appropriate ranges for unknown parameters in the models, and to test uncertain modeling assumptions."

This project aims to develop new mathematical methods for addressing some of the major challenges in this area. These include showing existence of solutions to classes of mathematical models for fracture evolution, improving dynamic fracture models, and analyzing properties of dynamic fracture solutions, with a particular emphasis on exploring crack branching and its consequences. <br/><br/>Showing existence of quasi-static cohesive fracture evolutions, showing existence for mathematical models of dynamic fracture, and establishing qualitative properties of dynamic fracture solutions are major challenges in the mathematical analysis of fracture mechanics. The methods that have been used to show existence for quasi-static Griffith evolutions are now known to fail for cohesive fracture. The main difficulty arises from the delicate role that history plays in the definition of these solutions. This project will continue the development of new methods for analyzing this and other quasi-static problems, based on higher order energy approximations using history at only a finite number of prior times. Dynamic Griffith fracture is also very delicate, due to complex interactions between elastic singularities and the (a priori unknown) evolving crack set. New methods based on blow-up techniques will be developed for analyzing these evolutions."

From a practical point of view, no single predetermined model can fully describe a complicated financial market; it is more reasonable to take into account all probabilistic models that are compatible with market data. Another reason to consider model uncertainty lies in the fact that different investors may have different beliefs or predictions about how the market would evolve, reacting differently to the same stimuli. In this research project, the investigator studies several stochastic optimization problems under model uncertainty that are related to differential and Nash equilibrium in game theory, quantile hedging, and derivative pricing with transaction costs. These studies aim to illuminate some aspects of model uncertainty, which can be applied not only to financial markets but also to other dynamical systems. <br/><br/>Mathematically, model uncertainty is usually represented by a non-dominated set of mutually singular probabilities (a negligible set under one probability can have positive mass under another probability). The investigator analyzes four stochastic optimization problems when the uncertain evaluation criterion varies in the nondominated probability set: (1) to determine whether a robust Dynkin game has a value and admits an optimal triplet; (2) to determine whether a robust non-zero-sum game among many players has a Nash equilibrium; (3) to find an optimal strategy for a robust quantile-hedging problem; and (4) to find a no-arbitrage condition for a robust continuous-time form of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing with transaction costs. The lack of a reference probability in the nondominated probability set makes difficult the use of classic tools, such as the dominated convergence theorem and Komlos separation lemma, to analyze the nonlinear expectation associated to the probability set. This project aims to develop new methods to handle the much more complicated probabilistic situations under model uncertainty. These are expected to be useful also in the more general subjects of stochastic control and optimization."

For decades, researchers have been trying to increase the strength of coupling between light and matter by engineering artificial dielectric structures (like silicon or glass) to be in resonance with incoming light.  Nearly all such structures have been patterns that are periodically repeating in space: a kind of microscopic scaffolding.  One of the principal goals of this project is to show that certain non-periodic structures with no repeating units can facilitate stronger light-matter coupling than periodic designs.  This could open a new design principle for light-matter interaction and lead to applications like more efficient lighting, solar cells, or even components for optical quantum computers. <br/>  <br/>The principal investigators will engineer photonic structures (both waveguide arrays in silica and photonic crystals in silicon) to have Dirac points in their band structure.

The aim of this project is to address significant aspects of the above type of phenomenon and is directed toward the accomplishment of the following objectives.  The first one regards occurrence of resonance phenomena in the interaction of a viscous liquid with an elastic structure.  For example, in the context of modeling of arterial blood flow it is of the utmost importance to find out whether, for a given model, the pulsatile action of the heart pumping blood would produce an unrealistic high-amplitude oscillation of the arterial wall.  The second one deals with the so-called vortex-induced oscillations of a structure in the uniform stream of a viscous liquid.  This phenomenon is considered to play a major role in the collapse of chimneys and bridges under wind load.  The most famous event in this sense is probably the failure of the Tacoma Narrows bridge.<br/><br/>     From a technical viewpoint, the above questions are addressed by studying the existence of time-periodic solutions and the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation in coupled systems of nonlinear hyperbolic-parabolic equations that model fluid-structure interactions.  One of the main focuses of this project is to understand whether the dissipative mechanism (the parabolic component of the system) can prevent the occurrence of resonance in the elastic structure (the hyperbolic component).  Some of these problems need to be formulated in unbounded spatial domains, like infinite pipeline systems or regions exterior to a finite number of bodies.  The latter may add an even further complication, in that the linearized relevant operators may possess, in such cases, a non-empty essential spectrum."

Their idea was to adapt the mean field approach from physics and mechanics to social sciences. The mean field approach allows the description of the macroscopic behavior of fluids and gases without considering the motion of the individual particles. One can consider a representative particle whose dynamics is influenced by a mean field term that represents an averaging effect coming from all other particles. In the social sciences, particles are replaced with agents. For example, an agent can be a car when modeling traffic on highways. An important difference from physics is that the agents are decision makers and the dynamics correspond to decisions. This proposal develops control methods for these mean field models, called Mean Field Control Theory. Results will be applied to dynamic networks and provide insight for applications such as economic theory.<br/><br/>A basic problem in mean field control theory is to solve a system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker Planck (HJB-FP) equations. The Master Equation, introduced by Lions, allows one to encapsulate the system of HJB-FP equations in a single equation by driving a decoupling argument. A serious difficulty is the fact that one needs to work with functions of probability measures. Lions introduced the idea that one could write the Master Equation using for the space of arguments the Hilbert space of square integrable random variables. This leads to new control problems in this particular Hilbert space, which is the first objective of the research. The second objective is to study specific problems in mean field control theory, motivated by economics."

Of special interest are two problems that go beyond the classical setting of a homogeneous medium: (i) surface waves interacting with internal waves and (ii) surface waves interacting with rough topography.  These two problems are of physical importance.  In case (i), internal waves are large-amplitude waves that play a key role in many oceanic processes like mixing and energy dissipation, which impact the transport and diffusion of contaminants and nutrients.  The strong currents associated with them also affect ocean acoustics, and present a potential hazard to offshore and submerged structures.  In case (ii), the character of coastal wave dynamics is known to be very complex and can lead to extreme phenomena such as wave breaking.  In turn, these wave phenomena influence many other coastal processes such as current generation and sediment transport which eventually drive sandbar formation and beach erosion.  A detailed description of these two problems entails considerable mathematical challenges due to the complexity of the physical mechanisms involved.  This project develops analytical and numerical tools that can help address a wide range of questions, ranging from theoretical to more practical ones (e.g., to improve the remote sensing of internal waves, the parameterization of wave forecasting models, and the design of wave energy farms in coastal regions).  The project thus has broader impacts in oceanography, marine biology, coastal engineering, and climatology, which ultimately affect human activities, and also has far-reaching applications to wave problems in such diverse areas as material science that share similarities with the present ones.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project.<br/><br/>The investigator studies wave-wave and wave-bottom interactions occurring at substantially disparate scales, which poses serious challenges to their asymptotic analysis and direct numerical simulation.  More specifically, attention is paid to long internal waves resonantly coupled with smaller surface wavepackets in case (i), and to surface waves propagating over rapidly varying topography in case (ii).  Such interactions produce complex dynamics such as wave localization and scattering, and a better understanding has important physical and technological implications.  So far little effort has been devoted to examining these two problems analytically and in particular they still lack a mathematically justified asymptotic theory.  The investigator develops building blocks for such a theory by deriving new reduced models that describe essential features of these nonlinear dispersive wave systems based on the large separation of scales.  For this purpose, he develops new analytical methods from Hamiltonian systems and homogenization theory to deal with the multiple scales.  Of special interest is the modulational regime for surface waves, in which the solution exhibits a two-scale dependence allowing for fast and slow dynamics.  The latter can be described by an evolutionary partial differential equation (or a system of such equations), while the former can be determined by e.g. resonance conditions and their effects can be reproduced via effective coefficients in this equation.  Together with the rapid progress in optical and imaging technologies, such models have the potential to improve the performance of remote sensing techniques for internal waves, and the subgrid parameterization of wave-bottom interactions that have so far been poorly represented in operational forecasting.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project."

The meeting is organized jointly by the Departments of Mathematics at the University of Missouri-Columbia and the University of Kansas in Lawrence.  The conference will showcase recent advances and facilitate exchange of ideas in partial differential equations (PDEs) and dynamics of complex systems. Many basic first principles in nature take the form of conservation (or balance) laws for quantities that vary in space and time, and these laws lead naturally to partial differential equations. PDEs are therefore encountered in nearly all areas of science; they describe wave motion, diffusion, deformation, mixing, pattern formation, and many other phenomena. Specific application of current interest include climate modeling, water waves, electrodynamics phenomena in complex media, and neuroscience. While participants are clustered in the Midwestern and Southern states near Missouri and Kansas, many researchers working at institutions elsewhere in the US will be included. Early career mathematicians will be given an opportunity to present their work to gain recognition and invaluable feedback. The conference website is http://faculty.missouri.edu/~walshsa/kumu2016/<br/><br/>Many of the complex nonlinear problems governed by PDEs can be reframed as dynamical systems posed on infinite-dimensional spaces.  This strategy has proved to be effective, and it certainly shows tremendous promise as a means to attack a host of open problems in nonlinear science. To realize this promise, a strong and continuing collaboration between the PDE and dynamics communities is essential. The goals of the KUMU Conference are to support and facilitate this collaboration. The major themes of this year's meeting are as follows: applications of dynamical system techniques to fluid mechanics and water waves; dynamics of dispersive PDEs; and index formulas in the study of stability of nonlinear waves.  Each of these topics has generated a great deal of recent activity.  The KUMU Conference will help to advance this research."

This project concerns applications of Hilbert space frame theory---one of the most active and applied subjects in mathematics today, with applications to pure mathematics, applied mathematics, engineering, medicine, computer science, and more.  Frame theory is fundamental to the digitalizing of information for processing and storing.  One part of this project will develop new methods for ""phase retrieval,"" which has applications to X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, astronomical imaging, optics, quantum physics, and more.  Phase retrieval will even be needed to align the mirrors in the new James Webb Space Telescope scheduled for launch in 2018.  Another part of this research project involves developing ""fusion frames"" for modern applications.  Recent advances in hardware technology have enabled the economic production and deployment of a large number of low-cost components, which through collaboration enable reliable and efficient operation.  Wireless sensor networks have emerged as a new technology with the potential to enable cost-effective and reliable surveillance.  Radar imaging is moving away from single platform to multiple platforms that cooperate to achieve better performance.  Recent advances in sensor hardware provide an unprecedented capability to detect the production, deployment, and use of chemical and biological weapons.  All of these applications involve a large number of data streams, which need to be integrated at a central processor---often at multiple levels of information fusion.  Fusion frames are being designed to deal with these problems.<br/><br/>Phase retrieval is the century-old problem of reconstructing a function (such as a signal or an image) from the magnitude of its Fourier transform.  Its origin comes from the fact that in many scenarios, detectors can only record intensity measurements and lose the phases.  This project is pushing phase retrieval in several relatively new directions using frame theory.  Determining the minimal number of measurements needed to ensure that a signal or image can be uniquely reconstructed from its intensity measurements (without any prior knowledge) will provide crucial insight into designing detectors.  This project will also use an innovative combination of tools from time-frequency analysis, quantum physics, and discrete geometry to provide novel measurement designs that are backed up by a rigorous mathematical theory and efficient numerical algorithms.  Another direction of the research will be to extend the existing approach used for phase retrieval, which uses vector-based measurements, to higher-rank projections.  This will have important applications to crystal twinning.  Fusion frames offer great promise to a host of problems surrounding information fusion but need much better designs, algorithms, and much more generality to fit current needs.  This project will address all of these problems to bring fusion frames into the mainstream."

This research project concerns the mathematical modeling of the interaction between a cell membrane and a solid particle, a physical process that is essential to cell adhesion to a solid surface and cellular uptake (endo/exocytosis) of colloidal nanoparticles (e.g., drug carriers).  Advances in nano- and biomedical engineering have made it possible to design smart materials for more effective medical treatments (e.g., targeted drug delivery).  These technical developments are based on understanding how a cell membrane interacts with colloidal particles in a fluid environment filled with ions and macromolecules.  It is imperative to better understand the physical processes that underpin such ubiquitous membrane-solid interactions in a complex fluid environment.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new mathematical models and numerical algorithms to describe quantitatively the particle-membrane interactions by considering random thermal fluctuations, electrokinetic effects, and nanoscale phenomena (e.g., molecular layering) that are commonly ignored in conventional continuum-based approaches.  Microfluidic experiments will be developed in parallel to guide the mathematical and computational modeling of a membrane interacting with solid surfaces with curvature and/or localized features.  This project will advance the mathematical modeling of a lipid bilayer membrane (LBM) interacting with solid surfaces and particles by considering the presence of the thin liquid film filling the gap between the LBM and other solid surfaces.  It is hypothesized that, through physically consistent effective interaction potentials, a continuum-based thin film equation can capture the macroscopic spreading dynamics of LBMs on surfaces with variable wetting properties and zeta potentials, under different ionic strengths.  One of the main results from the mathematical modeling will be the stochastic nonlinear lubrication equation for the height of the thin liquid film between the LBM and a solid surface.  Theoretical predictions, such as LBM adhesion and spreading time, will be compared against experimental results for validation and model refinement.  The developed model will be employed to investigate the adhesion of a LBM (1) under different ionic concentrations in the liquid and (2) on solid surfaces with curvature and localized features."

It serves to protect the Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere. Changes in the magnetic field have significant implications for climatic changes. The source of the Earth's magnetic field is deep inside the Earth where a small solid iron center is surrounded by a huge spherical mass of electrically conducting liquid iron. Convection in this liquid is at the origin of Earth's magnetic field through a dynamo effect: this is the process by which the rotating, convecting, molten iron maintains the geomagnetic field against ohmic decay. The mathematical description of this process is a highly complex system of three-dimensional, nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) that govern convective magnetohydrodynamics. Computer models have been used to simulate the actual geodynamo; however, no three-dimensional model has yet been run at the spatial resolution required to encompass the broad spectrum of turbulence that surely exists in the Earth's fluid core. The investigator and collaborators study a PDE model for the core where a stochastic force driving the geodynamo is to be interpreted as a source that is continuously regenerating a statistically steady buoyancy distribution throughout the fluid. For scales relevant to the Earth's core, this PDE system has many small parameters. The team exploits this feature by analyzing the asymptotics of the stochastically forced PDE in the limit of vanishingly small parameters. They aim to establish that the PDE system sustains ergodic statistically steady states, thus providing a rigorous foundation for a turbulent geodynamo. A graduate student is involved in the research. <br/><br/>The partial differential equations that govern fluid dynamics are notoriously challenging. One aspect of the challenge is the singular behavior of the equations as certain parameters, which are produced by the physics of the problem, vanish. Studying such problems is important both to illuminate the physical processes described by the singular limits and to advance the creation of new mathematical techniques. The investigator and collaborators contribute to this endeavor by studying mathematical models for magnetostrophic turbulence in the Earth's fluid core.  The analysis requires a detailed understanding of the delicate interaction between the nonlinearity and the stochastic forcing. The team plans to apply recent developments in a theory of hypoellipticity for stochastic PDE with spatially degenerate forcing to prove the existence of unique ergodic invariant measures for the PDE that model magnetostrophic turbulence."

Such a description is instrumental for predicting behavior and designing engineering devices, such as optical switches for information transmission. Even when it is not possible to completely determine the solutions to such equations, the system can often be understood satisfactorily by considering an appropriate approximation, such as long time or small dispersion. A rich and maturing asymptotic theory has been developed for the somewhat idealized integrable wave equations. However, in order to provide accurate predictions for more realistic physical systems, it is necessary to extend the current models to account for issues including coupling or interference, higher-order corrections, and boundaries. By taking advantage of recent mathematical advances, this project will improve available methods to better model these three effects. Specific applications of the models studied include the development of all-optical switches, Raman scattering, flux propagation in superconducting Josephson junctions, and hydrodynamic turbulence. <br/><br/>The research aims to enhance the physical applicability of current models of nonlinear wave propagation through the following three projects: (1) Extension of the small-dispersion theory to multicomponent systems, including the three-wave resonant interaction equations, to develop better mathematical models of coupled systems.

(3) Extending the unified transform method to understand small-dispersion behavior on finite or semi-finite domains.

Here information signifies the data that are observations of a random process, for example the price of a stock over time.  In the era of information technology more financial information is available about markets and each investor needs to process the flooding information.  Precise mathematical understanding of information provides some criteria to decide which information is more important than other information in the financial market.  Sharing this mathematical idea among investors would provide efficiency of information processing, enhance transparency of financial trading, and possibly increase the stability of the financial markets.  The project also has potential consequences in other fields of research where data arise from observations of random processes, such as economics, statistics, engineering, and physics.<br/><br/>     In approximating random phenomena in financial markets, financial information is understood as a set of filtrations generated by continuous-time stochastic processes.  The investigator studies rank-based diffusion market models -- these are systems of stochastic partial differential equations with singularities of various sorts -- that may better represent market information.  In order to quantify and better understand the information in these processes, he examines them in two different information settings, non-Brownian filtrations and information drifts, In the first setting he considers existence of solutions, from which he can work to separate non-Browwnian noise from observable information.  In the second he examines the information drift when the filtration is enlarged, which can introduce arbitrage opportunities.  The consequences of emerging non-Brownian filtration and information drifts are examined in the context of stochastic portfolio theory.  These two problems are closely related."

CRT maps a function defined in the 3D space to its integrals over a family of conical surfaces. These quantities often correspond to measurements of an imaging device, and the process of image reconstruction depends on the possibility of stable inversion of these transforms. The central problems addressed by the investigators include: the description of injectivity sets of BRT/CRT and formulas for their inversion, the study of the microlocal properties of these transforms, the description of their range, and the investigation of incomplete data problems. The methodology to attack such problems utilizes various combinations of techniques from Fourier analysis, partial differential equations, integral equations and microlocal analysis."

Superconductors are metals that at a sufficiently low temperature exhibit two important properties: they lose entirely their electrical resistivity, and the magnetic field is excluded from the superconducting area.  Superconductors have great technological potential for applications ranging from magnetic sensors, through generators of large magnetic fields, to high power transmitters.  Even for low temperatures, a sufficiently strong electric current would revert the superconductor to the state of a normal metal.  The Principal Investigator will study the transition of superconducting materials from the normal state to the superconducting one and vice versa, with either increasing or decreasing current.  Of particular interest is the disparity between experimental measurements of the critical current and theoretical predictions of the critical current in the absence of magnetic fields, and the maximal amount of current that can flow through a sample before the superconducting state loses its stability.  The project will shed light on both the nucleation of superconductivity for decreasing currents and on the loss of superconducting properties when the electric current increases.  The results are expected to have an effect on other areas of Applied Mathematics, such as hydrodynamic stability, magnetic resonance imaging, and more.<br/><br/>The research will address the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity in the presence of electric currents.  The Principal Investigator will study several fundamental theoretical problems related to this model.  Most of the project will involve analytical work to be performed by the investigator and his collaborators.  The following problems will be studied: (1) the existence and stability of fully superconducting solutions away from the boundary, which is adjacent in part to a normal material from which the current enters and exits the superconducting sample, and solutions will be studied both in the presence and in the absence of a magnetic field, (2) analysis of the behavior of solutions with decreasing current density below the critical current where the normal state loses its stability, (3) generalization of some recent results on the local and global stability of the normal state in the presence of strong electric currents, both in the presence and the absence of magnetic fields."

Magnetic materials have been an indispensable ingredient for information storage since the advent of the computer age and presently hold great promise for the development of revolutionary new computer and information technologies.  Recent advances in nanofabrication allow an unprecedented precision in building magnetic multilayer structures, using ultrathin films with thickness down to a single atomic layer and a lateral extent down to ten nanometers.  At these very small scales, new physical effects become prominent, driving interesting new phenomena such as spin transfer torque, chiral domain walls, magnetic skyrmions, spin, inverse spin, and topological Hall effects.  This new physics needs to be incorporated into the micromagnetic modeling framework that proved very successful in the previous studies of magnetic systems at larger scales.  This research project explores the multiscale, nonlinear, nonlocal, and often stochastic nature of the new models, which represents a significant challenge to understanding and predicting the behavior of such systems.  A key component of the project is the involvement of a new generation of applied mathematicians in this highly interdisciplinary area of research.<br/><br/>This project aims to formulate and analyze models of ultrathin ferromagnetic films in the presence of antisymmetric exchange interaction, which produces a non-trivial interplay with the topological characteristics of the magnetization.  Particular care will be taken to incorporate into the models the non-local effects of the stray field via rigorous analysis of the appropriate asymptotic thin film limits arising from the full three-dimensional treatment.  Within the obtained reduced thin film models, the properties of charged domain walls, chiral domain walls, and magnetic skyrmions will be investigated, using a combination of analytical, formal asymptotic, and numerical tools.  The questions of existence and asymptotic properties of these coherent structures give rise to challenging problems of energy-driven pattern formation and calculus of variations.  The research is strongly motivated by the rapidly expanding field of spintronics.  All the special magnetization configurations that will be considered in the project are currently targets for potential applications in spintronics devices and, in particular, for the development of non-volatile sequential and random access computer memories."

The variability of such irregular climate patterns has always had a large impact on humans; some possible disastrous consequences include heavy flooding or extended drought in different regions, collapse of fisheries, plagues, and crop failure.  To understand the time variability and to provide robust prediction of such climate patterns are thus of vital importance -- both for our economy and for society.  These tasks are, however, long-standing challenges in geosciences due to the complexity of our climate system.  In this project, the investigators and their colleagues study a factor important for such predictive understandings: the effect of ubiquitous random fluctuations on the dynamics of some fundamental climate models.  In particular, the mechanism of extreme El Nino warming events such as the 2015-2016 one is explored from the perspective of noise-induced phenomena.  The approach relies crucially on a novel dimension reduction methodology developed recently by the investigators and their colleagues.  The knowledge gained in this project is expected to bring new insights into the design of better prediction methods for the evolution of large-scale climate patterns.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The dimension reduction methodology adopted and further developed in this project is based on a new stochastic parameterization technique for the unresolved small-scale dynamics of the underlying nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations.  The approach has several distinctive features: (i) The parameterization is pathwise in nature.  It is very well suited for cases when one is not only interested in statistical quantities but also trajectory-wise dynamical behaviors, which is the case for the applications to climate dynamics.  (ii) The parameterization of the small-scale dynamics leads in particular to exogenous memory effects in the reduced systems.  This non-Markovian feature can help achieve good modeling performance even in situations that are known to be challenging for other traditional methods to operate.  (iii) A practical way to construct different parameterizations is also offered within the approach, and a simple non-dimensional quantity is designed to compare objectively the skills of these parameterizations prior to numerical simulations of the corresponding reduced systems.  The developed framework can be applied to deterministic partial differential equations as well; and the method has already been successfully used in several applications including the study of phase transitions, optimal control, and the analysis of noise-induced phenomena.  For the applications to climate dynamics, the goals are: (i) to develop useful and easy-to-use low-dimensional reduced models for ENSO based on stochastic versions of some sophisticated coupled ocean-atmosphere models, and (ii) to use these reduced models to investigate the impact of different types of noise on the irregularity of ENSO dynamics.  The challenges inherent to this study of climate models help provide new directions for the development of the methodology as well as of parameterization schemes in general.  The theoretical and computational tools developed in this project are general, flexible, and have a broad range of applications in nonlinear sciences and engineering.

Plasmas are often referred to as the fourth state of matter (after solids, liquids, and gases) and account for 99.99% of all material in the universe. Since plasmas are charged gases, they serve as excellent conductors of electricity, and thus are of great practical interest. As an example, plasma engines have been developed by a number of space agencies and recently used to power some NASA spacecraft. Additionally, the use of plasmas within nuclear fusion as a source of clean energy is currently of immense scientific interest.  Other notable examples of plasmas include the solar wind, the Earth's ionosphere, galactic nebulae, and comet tails. A complete understanding of the solar wind would also be particularly useful, as this natural phenomenon dictates the intensity of ""space weather"", which is often responsible for expensive damage to satellites orbiting the Earth. In general, the motion of a plasma is described by a number of complicated partial differential equations dictated by physics. Among the goals of the current project are to demonstrate that these equations possess realistic solutions, determine their qualitative behavior, compute their sensitivity with respect to model parameters (such as masses, charges, and temperature), and computationally approximate them so that one can accurately predict outcomes in future situations.<br/><br/><br/>A plasma is a fully ionized gas in which electromagnetic forces are often strong enough to dominate collisional effects. The motion of a high temperature, low density collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a nonlinear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this setting, collisions are neglected while the charge and current densities, which drive the Maxwell system, are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity averages of solutions to the Vlasov equation. One major question this project will study is: are there shocks in a collisionless plasma? That is, could a singularity develop from smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses? In some cases, such as in lower dimensional, relativistic formulations (e.g., one space and two velocity variables), smooth global solutions are known to exist.  Similarly, the associated Fokker-Planck system will be studied to further elucidate the smoothing influence of collisions on the particle distribution. Another problem to be investigated concerns the long-time behavior of the charge density and electromagnetic field in the system.  More specifically, do dispersive effects in the equations cause these quantities to decay over time, or is there sufficient interaction so as to sustain their strength even as time tends to infinity?  Finally, the sensitivity of fields and densities with respect to model input parameters will be computed using global sensitivity metrics and particle-in-cell simulations."

This research project concerns the derivation and numerical implementation of a mathematical theory capable of describing, explaining, and predicting the initiation and propagation of fracture in soft organic solids---namely, solids made up of networks of long carbon-based macromolecules such as elastomers, gels, and biological tissues---when subjected to arbitrarily large mechanical forces.  Soft organic solids are known to fracture in a very different manner than standard hard solids (such as metals and ceramics).  The defining difference is that internal fracture in soft organic solids initiates through the sudden growth of inherent defects into large enclosed cavities/cracks (a phenomenon popularly referred to as cavitation).  With the ever-increasing use of soft materials in new technologies, a fundamental and quantitative understanding of when and how organic solids fracture is of utmost importance for their advancement.  Likewise, such a fundamental and quantitative understanding is critical in advancing medical treatments involving soft biological tissues, such as shock-wave lithotripsy, or treatments dealing with aneurysms.<br/><br/>This project centers on a novel variational theory of fracture for finitely deformable solids that is consistent with the principle of conservation of mass (a highly non-trivial feature that has been overlooked in the literature by related formulations) and wherein the newly created surfaces (by fracture) are not restricted to be hypersurfaces (as in classical brittle fracture) but can also be the boundaries of N-dimensional cavities, N being the spatial dimension.  The main objectives of the project are: (1) to develop a formulation in terms of variational evolutions for the initiation and propagation of fracture in soft organic solids under arbitrarily large quasi-static deformations, and (2) to implement this formulation numerically and confront its predictions with emerging experimental evidence of high spatio-temporal resolution.  Objective (1) entails rigorous existence results, while objective (2) entails the construction of appropriate approximate functionals (of the phase-field type) and their stable and convergent numerical implementation in the non-convex context of finite deformations with constraints (in particular, incompressibility)."

In the first theme, lecturers discuss questions such as how the classical arbitrage pricing can be modified to reflect funding costs and counterparty risk, and how market imperfections lead to nonlinearities in wealth dynamics, affecting pricing and hedging of financial derivatives. These questions are naturally related to backward stochastic differential equations, which also are studied in the summer school. The second theme deals with relevant topics in market microstructure, by both providing a practical point of view to construct and analyze effective trading algorithms and developing the underlying mathematical theory using stochastic optimal control.

Answers to natural questions about the stability and rigidity of material structures involve understanding the geometry of their components.  Recent advances in materials synthesis have emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of the geometric stability of physical structures at the atomic scale and the need for insight at all scales, from atomic to macroscopic. Key mathematical tools for this analysis come from the area of ""rigidity theory,"" which studies the mathematical properties of discrete sets of points with the distances between certain pairs of points held fixed or constrained by distance inequalities. Rigidity theory lies at the nexus of discrete geometry, graph theory, and algorithms, and it has deep connections to semidefinite programming and convex geometry.  This project aims to deepen understanding of the stability of material structures. <br/><br/>One goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic explanation of tunneling between asymmetric stable configurations of two-dimensional disordered materials, such as glass. Construction of accurate mechanistic and computational models requires deep mathematical analysis and development of appropriate algorithms. A second goal is to develop methods for predicting the stability, configurational entropy, and kinetics of small short-ranged-potential systems in three dimensions. Examples of such distance-constraint systems include small molecular structures, as well as colloidal clusters, containing a few particles bound together by reversible attractive interactions, modeled as sticky spheres. What kinds of rigid configurations are there, and what are computationally feasible tests for their rigidity? How do these particles move and the structures deform? There is a tight link between rigidity theory and the general convexity and duality properties of the positive semidefinite cone, a central concept in numerical optimization. Finding a recursive decomposition of a generically rigid framework into rigid subsystems is a longstanding problem. Additionally, matroid theory, important in rigidity theory, has made the characterization of rigid systems more approachable and more algorithmically efficient. Rigidity theory could have implications for algorithms for low-rank matrix completion as well. These connections, questions, and implications will be explored in this project."

One important question is that of robustness: if one takes initial conditions near one of these special solutions, one would like to predict if the solutions would have a similar behavior or do something different. This idea of robustness, known in mathematics as stability, governs which solutions are likely to be observed in practice. Since real systems are noisy and have uncertainty, one is only likely to observe special solutions that are stable. This research project is aimed at understanding and quantifying the stability of solutions to a number of mathematical models governing diverse phenomena, including the behavior of a large-scale electrical network and wave propagation in a channel. Results will include proving theorems that either show that these solutions are stable or, if they are unstable, by characterizing the unstable manifold, thereby giving some sense of the manner in which nearby solutions diverge from the solution in question. <br/><br/>This project focuses on a number of models that arise in different areas of mathematics and the sciences, including the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, various shallow water models, the Kuramoto model for synchronization of oscillators, and various generalizations of the Kuramoto model that take into account phenomena such as neural plasticity and Hebbian interactions.

A second approach is to provide distortion-free reconstructions and accurately located inclusions in human bodies or the Earth's crust. This is achieved by using more realistic descriptions (specifically, spatially varying) of the propagation speed of the waves used to probe the medium of interest. The model considered becomes augmented with new technicalities, where additional phenomena (e.g., caustics) can occur and open mathematical questions abound.

Signal processing is concerned with making signals easier to handle or better in quality.  It is widely used in modern society, such as in cell-phone communications.  In this project, the principal novelties introduced to signal processing are developments of the notion of ""sparsity-inducing dual frames"" (""sparse duals"") and advanced ideas of recovering underlying signals from much smaller ""samples"" of the signal.  Sparsity-inducing dual frames are a set of signal components used in obtaining the sparsest (the most concise) decomposition of a signal.  The substance of sparse duals lies in the fact that they have the capacity to greatly advance the effectiveness of signal recovery through a small number of samples of a signal.  The objective is to advance the art of new signal-detection techniques.  This study has the potential to impact information technology, ranging from simplified sampling devices to radar systems, commercial imaging techniques, geographic survey, mapping, wireless communication, surveillance systems, medical image requisitions and combinations, and a number of signal requisition applications.<br/><br/>Topics proposed for study include the development of tail-minimization techniques in the sparse-dual-based l-one analysis approach and applications, together with the development of a soft-thresholding-infused null-space tuning algorithm with feedbacks for more effective denoising and signal smoothness.  Several themes will be developed.  One theme aims at directly reducing the tail coefficients of sparse frame expansions.  This is motivated by the observation that the signal recovery error bound is directly proportional to the ""tails"" of the signal coefficients.  Another theme is to construct sparsity-inducing dual frames that minimize the tail coefficients for a class of s-sparse signals and nearly s-sparse signals.  Such sparse duals are clearly ultimate analysis operators in the analysis approach.  A third theme is designed to understand an equivalent l-one synthesis problem derived from a sparse-dual-based l-one analysis formulation.  The new synthesis problem decouples the product of the sensing matrix and the frame matrix, and the kernel of the new sensing matrix is smaller.  A final theme is aimed at infusing soft thresholding into the iterative ""Null Space Tuning Algorithm with Feedbacks"" (NST+FB).  The NST+FB algorithm is known to converge in finitely many steps.  The Principal Investigator will enrich the NST+FB algorithm with a soft-thresholding mechanism for enhanced denoising and smoothness, for applications such as image processing and radar imaging."

Answers to natural questions about the stability and rigidity of material structures involve understanding the geometry of their components.  Recent advances in materials synthesis have emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of the geometric stability of physical structures at the atomic scale and the need for insight at all scales, from atomic to macroscopic. Key mathematical tools for this analysis come from the area of ""rigidity theory,"" which studies the mathematical properties of discrete sets of points with the distances between certain pairs of points held fixed or constrained by distance inequalities. Rigidity theory lies at the nexus of discrete geometry, graph theory, and algorithms, and it has deep connections to semidefinite programming and convex geometry.  This project aims to deepen understanding of the stability of material structures. <br/><br/>One goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic explanation of tunneling between asymmetric stable configurations of two-dimensional disordered materials, such as glass. Construction of accurate mechanistic and computational models requires deep mathematical analysis and development of appropriate algorithms. A second goal is to develop methods for predicting the stability, configurational entropy, and kinetics of small short-ranged-potential systems in three dimensions. Examples of such distance-constraint systems include small molecular structures, as well as colloidal clusters, containing a few particles bound together by reversible attractive interactions, modeled as sticky spheres. What kinds of rigid configurations are there, and what are computationally feasible tests for their rigidity? How do these particles move and the structures deform? There is a tight link between rigidity theory and the general convexity and duality properties of the positive semidefinite cone, a central concept in numerical optimization. Finding a recursive decomposition of a generically rigid framework into rigid subsystems is a longstanding problem. Additionally, matroid theory, important in rigidity theory, has made the characterization of rigid systems more approachable and more algorithmically efficient. Rigidity theory could have implications for algorithms for low-rank matrix completion as well. These connections, questions, and implications will be explored in this project."

Additionally, he considers the market for mortgage-backed securities, focusing on both how fair mortgage rates are determined, and how to improve the traditional mortgage contract by taking into account the negative effects of house price decline.  For the large investor analysis, the investigator seeks to answer the basic question of why a financial institution would take a large position in a derivative contract when the contract itself carries inherent risks.  What about the investor and underlying market would induce such behavior?  Could the investor find a willing counter-party to transact with and why?  What are the feedback effects which arise from taking a large position?  For the mortgage-backed security analysis, the investigator shows that current mathematical models can determine fair mortgage origination rates.  As these rates are typically computed using ad-hoc methods, the analysis provides both a deeper understanding of the sensitivities of such rates on broader economic factors, and a valuable tool for predicting future rates.  Lastly, the investigator studies recent proposals for adjusting the traditional mortgage contract to mitigate the ""underwater"" effect of buyers selectively defaulting on their loans in the event of house price decline.  Such defaults impose significant costs on the lending institutions as well as the broader economy.  Though various mechanisms have been suggested, rigorous proofs showing the viability, or superiority, of a given method are lacking.  Such proofs will help identify which proposal should be introduced into the marketplace.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The investigator uses modern tools from stochastic analysis to understand large investors in derivatives markets.  In particular, the theory of large deviations is appropriate, as large investors have acute sensitivities to rare events when hedging strategies fail, and large investors are seen to arise endogenously in the asymptotically complete setting where hedging errors vanish.  Developing new large deviations results, as well as using theories of optimal investment and equilibrium in incomplete markets, he shows how large positions arise and describes the resultant equilibrium.  Lastly, since large positions may induce feedback effects such as price impact, the investigator studies whether these effects are so severe as to preclude the existence of large investors in the first place.  For the mortgage-backed security analysis, the investigator uses modern functional analysis to prove existence of fair mortgage rates for agency-backed pools of residential mortgages, taking both prepayment and default into account.  Additionally, he uses the theories of continuous time optimal stopping and partial differential equations to investigate proposed changes to the traditional mortgage contract.  The goal is to show that these changes either do or do not effectively reduce the homeowner's incentive to selectively default on her loan in the event her house price has declined."

For decades, researchers have been trying to increase the strength of coupling between light and matter by engineering artificial dielectric structures (like silicon or glass) to be in resonance with incoming light.  Nearly all such structures have been patterns that are periodically repeating in space: a kind of microscopic scaffolding.  One of the principal goals of this project is to show that certain non-periodic structures with no repeating units can facilitate stronger light-matter coupling than periodic designs.  This could open a new design principle for light-matter interaction and lead to applications like more efficient lighting, solar cells, or even components for optical quantum computers. <br/>  <br/>The principal investigators will engineer photonic structures (both waveguide arrays in silica and photonic crystals in silicon) to have Dirac points in their band structure.

This pseudomagnetic field causes the eigenvalue spectrum to become highly degenerate, leading to a large density-of-states, which in turn causes stronger light-matter coupling (Purcell enhancement). This project is a cross-disciplinary endeavor of an engineer, whose contribution is through fabrication and characterization of optical media (Kevin Chen, University of Pittsburgh), a physicist (Mikael Rechtsman, Penn State), who will perform optical experiments and modeling and an applied mathematician (Michael Weinstein, Columbia), who will co-develop mathematical PDE / discrete models and analyze these in collaboration with Rechtsman and Chen.

The variability of such irregular climate patterns has always had a large impact on humans; some possible disastrous consequences include heavy flooding or extended drought in different regions, collapse of fisheries, plagues, and crop failure.  To understand the time variability and to provide robust prediction of such climate patterns are thus of vital importance -- both for our economy and for society.  These tasks are, however, long-standing challenges in geosciences due to the complexity of our climate system.  In this project, the investigators and their colleagues study a factor important for such predictive understandings: the effect of ubiquitous random fluctuations on the dynamics of some fundamental climate models.  In particular, the mechanism of extreme El Nino warming events such as the 2015-2016 one is explored from the perspective of noise-induced phenomena.  The approach relies crucially on a novel dimension reduction methodology developed recently by the investigators and their colleagues.  The knowledge gained in this project is expected to bring new insights into the design of better prediction methods for the evolution of large-scale climate patterns.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The dimension reduction methodology adopted and further developed in this project is based on a new stochastic parameterization technique for the unresolved small-scale dynamics of the underlying nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations.  The approach has several distinctive features: (i) The parameterization is pathwise in nature.  It is very well suited for cases when one is not only interested in statistical quantities but also trajectory-wise dynamical behaviors, which is the case for the applications to climate dynamics.  (ii) The parameterization of the small-scale dynamics leads in particular to exogenous memory effects in the reduced systems.  This non-Markovian feature can help achieve good modeling performance even in situations that are known to be challenging for other traditional methods to operate.  (iii) A practical way to construct different parameterizations is also offered within the approach, and a simple non-dimensional quantity is designed to compare objectively the skills of these parameterizations prior to numerical simulations of the corresponding reduced systems.  The developed framework can be applied to deterministic partial differential equations as well; and the method has already been successfully used in several applications including the study of phase transitions, optimal control, and the analysis of noise-induced phenomena.  For the applications to climate dynamics, the goals are: (i) to develop useful and easy-to-use low-dimensional reduced models for ENSO based on stochastic versions of some sophisticated coupled ocean-atmosphere models, and (ii) to use these reduced models to investigate the impact of different types of noise on the irregularity of ENSO dynamics.  The challenges inherent to this study of climate models help provide new directions for the development of the methodology as well as of parameterization schemes in general.  The theoretical and computational tools developed in this project are general, flexible, and have a broad range of applications in nonlinear sciences and engineering.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project."

The specific goals are first to identify characteristics of both the investor and the market that endogenously lead to large holdings, and second to determine the effects of large positions on pricing, price impact, portfolio optimization, and risk management.  Because large positions induce extreme sensitivity to rare unexpected events, the theory of Large Deviations is well suited for this analysis.  In particular, using Large Deviations in conjunction with utility-based theory on optimal position sizes, the investigator studies when, if ever, a risk-averse agent acting in an incomplete market should take a large position in a non-traded risky asset.  Regarding the issue of pricing and hedging, it is well known that in incomplete markets investor preferences affect the price at which one is willing to buy a claim.  Typically, closed-form expressions for utility based prices are unavailable and some approximation is necessary.  Existing approximations are only valid for small position sizes and thus large holdings approximations provide a natural counterpart.  In addition to determining asymptotic prices, the investigator identifies the key components of the investor's utility that drive such prices.  Lastly, examples show that large positions arise in conjunction with asymptotically complete markets: the investigator thus seeks to extend this notion beyond the current one, which focuses on weak convergence of asset price laws, to a more natural notion in terms of the asymptotic ability to hedge.  Once extended, questions regarding continuity with respect to market completeness are considered.<br/><br/>     From a rigorous mathematical perspective, the investigator seeks to understand the rapid growth in over-the-counter derivatives markets during the previous two decades.  Given the complexity of many of these products, it is not clear why a bank, or some other financial institution, would wish to take on a large position in a claim, especially given the lack of perfect hedging strategies or liquid markets.  The investigator thus studies when, if ever, a financial institution should own a significant notional amount of a derivative contract.  Additionally, given such a position, the investigator aims to determine the impacts in terms of pricing, hedging, and over-all risk that a financial institution faces."

It comes in response to the NSF initiative on ""Optics and Photonics"".  The interaction between light and optical media is one of the most fruitful areas of study in applied physics and provides the basic mechanism underlying devices such as lasers and optical amplifiers.  For decades, it has been providing a rich source of new physical phenomena, among the latest being ""slow light"", the recently-observed slowing-down of light pulses to the speed of a bicycle.  Slow light can potentially be used in devices such as optical memory.  This project is aimed at understanding the physical mechanisms underlying the slow light phenomenon by using a remarkable, highly accurate mathematical model that can be solved with explicit formulas.  The validity of this model and its explicit solutions will be verified using numerical simulations of more realistic models and careful comparisons with experiments.  Interdisciplinary training in applied mathematics and nonlinear optics will be provided to graduate and undergraduate students, and a lively, challenging research and training environment for both student groups will be established.<br/><br/>The slowdown of light pulses is modeled as the interaction between an optical pulse and an active medium with two or three working levels, the latter being a prototypical case known as the Lambda configuration.  This interaction is described by completely integrable Maxwell-Bloch equations with non-vanishing boundary conditions, a new twist.  This project is a mathematical study of novel dynamics generated by the interaction of light with two-level media and the Lambda-configuration medium, and includes: (i) developing a systematic, completely integrable theory of the dynamics for the two-level and Lambda-configuration Maxwell-Bloch equations with non-zero boundary conditions, (ii) using the analytical results of step (i) to describe phenomena related to slow light, (iii) numerical studies of dynamical phenomena in more general cases in which the two-level and Lambda-configuration Maxwell-Bloch equations are not integrable.  The completely-integrable description of slow light involves two new aspects: (1) non-zero boundary conditions, (2) non-trivial evolution of the spectral data.  The understanding of the first aspect will be extended from the Nonlinear Schroedinger equation to the Maxwell-Bloch equations by studying scattering and inverse-scattering problems with the spectral parameter on a Riemann surface.  The second aspect is complicated by the presence of the former and involves a careful derivation of how spectral data evolves from the initial state of the medium and finding correct cancellations of highly oscillatory terms.  In addition to generating new models and descriptions of the dynamics exhibited by light interacting with active optical media, the project will advance the theory of completely integrable systems."

This program will concentrate on the areas of harmonic analysis and approximation theory, areas of mathematics that underlie the representation and approximation of functions and data.  The emphasis will be put on constructive high-dimensional methods of approximation and representation.  Recently, driven by applications in engineering, biology, medicine, and other areas of science, new challenging problems have appeared.  A common feature of many of these problems is that they involve data and multivariable functions in extremely high dimensions, in which setting classical methods of approximation do not work well.  This is an important and rapidly developing area of mathematics.  A recent increase of activity at the interface of harmonic analysis and approximation theory makes the timing perfect for a research program that emphasizes this interplay and will help the cross fertilization of both fields.  CRM is a renowned mathematics research institute which provides excellent facilities for such a program, and both harmonic analysis and approximation theory have historically been strongly represented in the activities of CRM.<br/><br/>The program will include a workshop on ""Function Spaces and High-Dimensional Approximation"" (May 2016), several advanced courses on ""Methods of Constructive Approximation and Harmonic Analysis"" aimed at graduate students and postdocs (May-June 2016), and a Conference on ""Harmonic Analysis and Approximation Theory"" (HAAT 2016, June 2016).  In addition there will be ample time for collaborative research.  The program will bring together different groups of mathematicians working in several areas of analysis and numerical analysis to try to make a breakthrough in high-dimensional problems, which are very important in data compression and processing (critical to information technology applications and medical imaging).  Progress in this area will impact several other mathematical sciences communities, including signal and image processing, numerical mathematics, learning theory, and optimization theory.

This research project aims to develop novel ideas and algorithms for the model reduction of such systems. The investigator will develop automatic learning algorithms that, by collecting a number of short simulations in parallel, output a much lower-dimensional model of the original system that yields faster simulations, with provable accuracy, in a much reduced number of variables. This will make the simulations less expensive, allowing one to perform more and longer simulations, and make the extraction of useful information from simulated data easier. He will apply these constructions to molecular dynamics simulations, expecting to significantly reduce the computational time needed to simulate small biomolecules.<br/><br/>Large data sets in high dimensional spaces appear in a wide variety of scientific fields and applications. The PI focuses here on data sets that originate from the simulation of high-dimensional stochastic systems that arise in a wide variety of applications (e.g. molecular dynamics), with the goal of producing a much lower dimensional stochastic system with similar statistical properties as the full system, at least at a certain time scale. This is possible for a wide variety of dynamical systems with separation of time scales when the structure of the forces acting on the system and the stochastic perturbations are such that the trajectories of the system accumulate, in state or phase space, around low-dimensional sets (at the appropriate time scale and accuracy). The approach only requires access to a simulator S for the original system that, given initial conditions and the shortest time scale of interest as inputs, produces as output a (stochastic) path of the system starting at that initial condition and stops at the specified time. A call to S is typically expensive, but after a small number of carefully designed calls that yield a relatively small number of short paths, the algorithm learns and outputs a low-dimensional representation of the system, that is, a low-dimensional stochastic system whose trajectories are (in a suitable statistical sense), at the requested time scale, close to those of the original system. This construction may be performed in an online setting, as new regions of state space are explored, and in a multiscale fashion, where the time scale at which the system is reduced varies. These techniques will be adaptive to the assumed low intrinsic dimension of the simulated data, the timescale of interest, and the accuracy, leading to a new generation of results and algorithms for learning and approximating high-dimensional stochastic systems. While the techniques to be developed are applicable to a large family of stochastic systems, the main application considered in this project is Molecular Dynamics (MD). These techniques are expected to dramatically speed up the exploration of the state space of these molecules and of MD simulations as a whole. At the same time, they are general enough that they are applicable to a wide variety of stochastic systems, and the framework sets the stage for a novel approach to automatic learning of dynamical systems that is amenable to further generalizations."

He considers the Navier-Stokes system, which is the principal model for motion of a viscous incompressible fluid, the Prandtl equations (a boundary-layer approximation for Navier-Stokes), the Euler equations (roughly speaking, Navier-Stokes with zero viscosity), and the primitive equations, which represent large-scale motion of the ocean and atmosphere.  He analyzes fluid-structure interactions between a fluid and an elastic solid, other problems involving free boundaries, the limiting behavior of viscous fluids in the presence of boundaries as the viscosity goes to zero, and the regularity and long-time behavior of solutions.  Results expand our understanding of fluid flow problems arising in geosciences, engineering, and other areas, especially in connection with control and numerical methods.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The main goal of the project is the study of the qualitative properties and regularity of solutions of equations arising in fluid dynamics.  While the primary focus is placed on the Navier-Stokes equations, the investigator considers also related models such as the Euler system, Prandtl equations, and the primitive equations of the ocean and the atmosphere.  A special emphasis is systems involving a fluid (compressible or incompressible) and an elastic solid.  Here the main aim is to investigate the local and global well-posedness of solutions as well as their large-time behavior when they exist.  The investigator also studies the vanishing viscosity problem in domains with boundaries, using the properties of the local asymptotics.  The main goal here is to better understand the solutions of the Prandtl equation and to identify their role in the vanishing viscosity limit.  The last part of the project concerns the local properties of solutions of the partial differential equations modeling fluids, in particular their analytic and Gevrey regularity, unique continuation, and their long time behavior.

Together with the Navier-Stokes equations, which take into account the effect of friction in fluid motion, they are applied in a wide variety of natural and technical situations, for example when modeling the lift of an aircraft wing or the circulation of water in the oceans. Although these equations were first conceived more than two hundred years ago, some of their fundamental mathematical properties are still not well understood. The difficulty lies in the fact that all the equations describing fluids show a strong tendency for ""small scale formation."" This is seen, for example, in the formation of very small vortices and irregularities in the flow that ultimately cause turbulence. In this research project, the investigator and collaborators study the formation of irregularities in fluid flow from a mathematical point of view. The goal is to give a detailed analysis of the mechanisms that lead to small-scale formation.<br/><br/>The projects concern detailed research on geometric singularity formation for certain model equations of fluid dynamics. These model equations are inspired by the Euler equations for three-dimensional, incompressible fluid flow. The overall goal is to gain a better understanding of the complex mechanisms leading to singularity formation in finite time, and also the exact growth rates of quantities like the vorticity and vorticity gradient. The main difficulty comes from the nonlocal and nonlinear nature of the equations. In one of the projects, the investigator considers the hyperbolic flow scenario for the modified surface quasi-geostrophic and Boussinesq equations in two dimensions. The goal is to obtain insight into the hyperbolic flow scenario, which is thought to be a good candidate to ultimately create finite-time blowup for the three-dimensional Euler equations. In the remaining projects, the investigator considers one-dimensional model equations, for which the goal is to describe the singularity formation in as much detail as possible. An important overall theme consists in stabilizing the blowup scenario up to the singular time using barrier functions and a priori estimates that take detailed information about the structure of the solution into account."

Practitioners across the applied sciences and engineering often now resemble mountaineers more than hill-walkers, exploring optimization goals in sharp rather than smooth strategic landscapes. Solving such problems in control engineering, contemporary statistics, or big data applications has had transformative impact. Often lost in the computational fog, however, has been the fundamental geometry underlying this success: mathematical specialists often compute little, and conversely, practitioners across vital science and engineering applications are typically unaware of the fundamentals. This project aims to bridge that divide, developing an innovative mix of geometry and computation. Ph.D. students will be involved in all aspects of the research.<br/><br/>The project envisages a unifying mathematical strategy based on two dual but equivalent viewpoints: the geometric idea of partial smoothness and the algorithmic idea of identification. Using the power of modern variational analysis, the project aims to illuminate how partly smooth geometry encourages solutions with desirable structure (like sparsity or low rank), how popular contemporary algorithms are hence drawn to (or ""identify"") such solutions, how fast the methods therefore converge, and how we might accelerate them. In the project's spotlight are two motivating algorithms, both very promising in computational practice. The first, a prox-linear method, solves large-scale structured problems whose explicit partly smooth geometry it could potentially exploit. The second, a smooth quasi-Newton method with robust but baffling success for nonsmooth optimization, is blind to any explicit geometry, but is strongly influenced by it. Crucial to the project's success will be interplay with other areas of classical mathematics; matrix analysis is rich in potential applications -- the project aims in particular at the ""Crouzeix conjecture."" From a foundational perspective, commonly-occurring polynomial inequalities can induce partial smoothness through stratification into smooth surfaces, immersing this project in the fundamentals of semi-algebraic geometry."

Conversely, microscopic physics is widely thought to be intrinsically probabilistic, the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics a complete description of the microscopic world.  A decade ago, Yves Couder and co-workers in Paris discovered the first quantum analog system.  The system, consisting of millimeter-sized droplets self-propelling along the surface of a vibrating fluid bath, represents a macroscopic realization of the pilot-wave mechanics proposed by Louis de Broglie in the 1920s for microscopic quantum particles.  The fact that this hydrodynamic system exhibits quantum-like statistical behavior raises the question as to whether there really is a qualitative difference between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds.  The investigators explore this question by studying the potential and limitations of this hydrodynamic system as a quantum analogue.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The walking-droplet system raises a number of fascinating new mathematical questions concerning the dynamics and statistics of wave-particle systems in which a particle generates a wave field, then moves in response to it.  The investigator and co-investigator have developed a theoretical framework for describing this system, a hierarchy of mathematical models of increasing sophistication that have been carefully benchmarked against experiment.  The project is directed towards rationalizing the stability of single- and multiple-droplet static and dynamic states by analyzing, extending and adapting these models.  Specifically, we analyze the stability of both steady and periodic solutions to the model equations.  Particular attention is given to rationalizing the interactions of multiple droplets of equal or unequal size, pairs and lattices, which are known to exhibit a variety of novel dynamical bound states and instabilities.  New rationale for the behavior of single and multiple droplets is sought through an energetic analysis, by assessing the relative magnitudes of the global energies of the accessible solutions of the model equations.  Theoretical developments are guided and constrained by a supporting experimental program conducted in parallel in MIT's Applied Math Laboratory."

Magneto-active elastomers (MAEs) are composite materials consisting of nearly rigid, magnetically susceptible particles embedded in a soft, magnetically insensitive elastomer matrix (a rubber-like material).  MAEs exhibit field-dependent strains (changes in length) and changes in stiffness.  However, the strains that have been achieved experimentally to date are still relatively small (on the order of 1%).  The reason for these small strains can be traced back to the nature of the forces between the particles.  Large particle concentrations are required to generate strong forces, but large concentrations also lead to large overall stiffness for the composite material, which, in turn, tends to reduce the overall strain.  Generating large actuation strains and stresses in MAEs for successful application as ""artificial muscles"" requires novel strategies.  This project will be concerned with the possible excitation of a particular instability in a certain class of MAEs that will allow the generation of large strains by means of externally applied magnetic fields.  The work will result in novel and highly efficient multi-scale, multi-physics modeling techniques of broad application.<br/><br/>The development of constitutive models for MAEs undergoing such field-generated instabilities will require the use and appropriate generalization of several powerful and sophisticated mathematical tools.  First, nonlinear homogenization methods will be developed to obtain estimates for the macroscopic ""pre-bifurcation"" response.  For this purpose, a partial decoupling of the magnetic and mechanical energies will be implemented by means of a variational statement involving a purely magnetic problem in the deformed configuration, as determined by the unknown particle rotations, and a purely mechanical problem with prescribed torques on the particles.  The average particle rotations will then be obtained by minimizing the total magneto-elastic energy of the system.  The resulting constitutive model is expected to lose strong ellipticity, and to lead to the development of domain mesostructures, when the magnetic field and mechanical loading conspire to generate sufficiently large compression along the long axes of the fibers, which can in turn be relieved by collective rotation of the fibers within their respective domains.  Making use of multi-layered structures, the rank-1 convexification of the magneto-elastic energy will be computed, thus leading to an upper bound for the ""quasi-convexification"" or ""relaxation"" of the energy in the ""post-bifurcation"" regime.  Attempts will then be made to show that the rank-1 convexification is polyconvex and therefore quasi-convex.  The resulting models will be used to explore the parameter space of microstructural variables (e.g., fiber volume fraction and aspect ratio) for enhanced magnetostriction and other coupled magneto-elastic properties (e.g., field-dependent moduli)."

Answers to natural questions about the stability and rigidity of material structures involve understanding the geometry of their components.  Recent advances in materials synthesis have emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of the geometric stability of physical structures at the atomic scale and the need for insight at all scales, from atomic to macroscopic. Key mathematical tools for this analysis come from the area of ""rigidity theory,"" which studies the mathematical properties of discrete sets of points with the distances between certain pairs of points held fixed or constrained by distance inequalities. Rigidity theory lies at the nexus of discrete geometry, graph theory, and algorithms, and it has deep connections to semidefinite programming and convex geometry.  This project aims to deepen understanding of the stability of material structures. <br/><br/>One goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic explanation of tunneling between asymmetric stable configurations of two-dimensional disordered materials, such as glass. Construction of accurate mechanistic and computational models requires deep mathematical analysis and development of appropriate algorithms. A second goal is to develop methods for predicting the stability, configurational entropy, and kinetics of small short-ranged-potential systems in three dimensions. Examples of such distance-constraint systems include small molecular structures, as well as colloidal clusters, containing a few particles bound together by reversible attractive interactions, modeled as sticky spheres. What kinds of rigid configurations are there, and what are computationally feasible tests for their rigidity? How do these particles move and the structures deform? There is a tight link between rigidity theory and the general convexity and duality properties of the positive semidefinite cone, a central concept in numerical optimization. Finding a recursive decomposition of a generically rigid framework into rigid subsystems is a longstanding problem. Additionally, matroid theory, important in rigidity theory, has made the characterization of rigid systems more approachable and more algorithmically efficient. Rigidity theory could have implications for algorithms for low-rank matrix completion as well. These connections, questions, and implications will be explored in this project."

For this purpose, models with varied levels of success have been proposed in the past.  This research project aims to develop basic mathematical techniques that will deliver proper analytical footing for the recently proposed ""peridynamic model"" of continuum mechanics.  The findings will also be applicable to other nonlocal models of similar structure, with applications in social and biological sciences.  The activities not only will contribute to the success and effectiveness of attempts on modeling development and experimental validation but also will ensure that future modeling and simulation efforts based on these nonlocal theories will be more quantitative and reliable.

The models have been successfully applied to better describe jump stochastic processes, anomalous diffusion, and spontaneous formation and propagation of cracks in solids, to name a few applications.  However, the models have also presented the scientific community with new mathematical challenges.  This research is devoted to exploring some analytical issues while at the same time laying the necessary mathematical foundation for future analyses on nonlocal and peridynamic models.  Issues to be addressed include research activities that advance knowledge on the analysis of linearized peridynamic models of practical interest; regularity properties of solutions of nonlocal equations as a function of applied force, initial data, and coefficients; and understanding of peridynamic-based nonlinear behavior.  The approaches involve various tools that lead to extensions of classical mathematical concepts and techniques to the nonlocal setting, including perturbation methods, calculus of variations, and nonlinear functional analysis.  Furthermore, the basic mathematical infrastructures that will be worked out are likely to impact the development of effective and reliable finite element methods and other numerical schemes to solve complex engineering problems via peridynamics.  The research will make nonlocal and peridynamics-based modeling and simulation more mathematically consistent, and it will contribute to making such modeling and simulation more quantitative and predictive in practical applications."

However, the problem can be simplified by focusing on one salient aspect of the phenomenon and ignoring the others. The ""model equations"" that result from this process are generally easier to handle than the original equation. However, model equations are often derived using heuristic arguments, and attempts to confirm the accuracy of the models numerically can be inconclusive. One aim of this research project is to mathematically justify that model equations accurately describe the full equation. In some cases, analysis of solutions to such simplified model equations remains difficult, even to the point where basic facts about the behavior of such model equations (such as whether they can be solved for all times) are not known. A good theoretical understanding of these fundamental properties is important for providing confidence that the model in question is accurate. This project will explore ways in which an equation interacts with its model equations and vice versa, with the goals of a better understanding of both problems. <br/><br/>This project deals with research involving partial differential equations (PDEs), specifically the relationship between evolution PDEs and model equations derived from them by asymptotic expansion methods. The first and most fundamental question of study from a mathematical standpoint is rigorous justification: to give a mathematical proof that a model equation derived from a formal argument provides a good approximation to the original PDE in the appropriate regime. This entails providing quantitative bounds on the errors incurred in approximation. Since such models often involve small parameters, one must have a good understanding of the well-posedness of the underlying problem for large initial data and over long time scales, both of which involve technical challenges. The other aspect of this project is to explore the idea of constructing, for a given equation known to arise from such a modeling procedure, an artificial equation constructed to force existence of the model equation for all time. This provides a new method for demonstrating global existence of solutions to equations which may be lacking structure for applying existing techniques, such as a coercive conserved energy. The first step is to demonstrate that this method applies in the context of nonlinear Schrodinger equations, which is one of the fundamental equations of mathematical physics. This project aims also to generalize the method to analyze other important model equations in which conserved quantities are either absent or otherwise unsuitable for use. A famous example of such an obstacle is the ""super-criticality barrier"" that prevents the establishment of global existence in a wide variety of problems."

The project focuses on simulation of the growth of nanoclusters, especially alloys, ranging in size from a few hundred to a few million atoms. Interest in nanoclusters is broad, arising in large part due to the tunable nature of their properties. The morphology, structure, and stability, along with the thermal, electronic, and chemical properties of clusters can vary dramatically with size, composition, and atomic ordering. Often, there are ""magic sizes"" that exhibit particularly unusual structures and properties. In some cases, the addition of as little as a single dopant atom can create a dramatically different material. Applications are diverse, including optics, catalysis, nanoelectronics, and biomedicine. While there is a large body of work on nanoclusters, the techniques under development in this project are new and uniquely suited to simulating the growth and evolution of atomistic-scale structures. The successful development of these techniques will fill a significant gap in existing simulation methods. <br/><br/>This project focuses on kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation of the growth of nanoclusters. Essentially all of the work on nanocluster simulation to date is based on either global optimization (the search for ground states) or equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast, KMC simulation is designed for following the dynamics of nonequilibrium processes and is therefore uniquely suited to simulating the growth and evolution of atomistic-scale structures. KMC methods fall into two broad categories: lattice and off-lattice, both of which will be used in this work. Lattice-based models are much simpler and orders of magnitude faster, allowing them to work with much larger systems for longer simulation times. This type of simulation will be used to study the growth of dendritic clusters containing several million atoms. This portion of the project also contains a significant modeling component, the main thrust of which is to derive general results for the way surface energy and equilibrium crystal shapes are determined by the formulation of various growth models. These results will then be used to identify parameter values and model configurations that are likely to yield interesting dendrite morphologies during the subsequent simulation of the growth. The off-lattice portion of the project will be focused on the growth of smaller clusters, containing hundreds or perhaps thousands of atoms. The main focus here will be on developing faster methods. The testing ground for these new methods will be simulating the growth of alloy nanoparticles with core-shell structures. This can be viewed as the nanoparticle analog of heteroepitaxial thin films."

It comes in response to the NSF initiative on ""Optics and Photonics"".  The interaction between light and optical media is one of the most fruitful areas of study in applied physics and provides the basic mechanism underlying devices such as lasers and optical amplifiers.  For decades, it has been providing a rich source of new physical phenomena, among the latest being ""slow light"", the recently-observed slowing-down of light pulses to the speed of a bicycle.  Slow light can potentially be used in devices such as optical memory.  This project is aimed at understanding the physical mechanisms underlying the slow light phenomenon by using a remarkable, highly accurate mathematical model that can be solved with explicit formulas.  The validity of this model and its explicit solutions will be verified using numerical simulations of more realistic models and careful comparisons with experiments.  Interdisciplinary training in applied mathematics and nonlinear optics will be provided to graduate and undergraduate students, and a lively, challenging research and training environment for both student groups will be established.<br/><br/>The slowdown of light pulses is modeled as the interaction between an optical pulse and an active medium with two or three working levels, the latter being a prototypical case known as the Lambda configuration.  This interaction is described by completely integrable Maxwell-Bloch equations with non-vanishing boundary conditions, a new twist.  This project is a mathematical study of novel dynamics generated by the interaction of light with two-level media and the Lambda-configuration medium, and includes: (i) developing a systematic, completely integrable theory of the dynamics for the two-level and Lambda-configuration Maxwell-Bloch equations with non-zero boundary conditions, (ii) using the analytical results of step (i) to describe phenomena related to slow light, (iii) numerical studies of dynamical phenomena in more general cases in which the two-level and Lambda-configuration Maxwell-Bloch equations are not integrable.  The completely-integrable description of slow light involves two new aspects: (1) non-zero boundary conditions, (2) non-trivial evolution of the spectral data.  The understanding of the first aspect will be extended from the Nonlinear Schroedinger equation to the Maxwell-Bloch equations by studying scattering and inverse-scattering problems with the spectral parameter on a Riemann surface.  The second aspect is complicated by the presence of the former and involves a careful derivation of how spectral data evolves from the initial state of the medium and finding correct cancellations of highly oscillatory terms.  In addition to generating new models and descriptions of the dynamics exhibited by light interacting with active optical media, the project will advance the theory of completely integrable systems."

PACT is a promising biomedical imaging technique, which has been developed rapidly in the past decade, with applications explored in vascular biology, oncology, neurology, dermatology, gastroenterology, and cardiology.  PACT can circumvent the limitations of many existing approaches and provide detailed three-dimensional anatomical, functional, and molecular information that can facilitate a wide range of biomedical studies.  This research project will dramatically improve image quality in PACT, which will accelerate the widespread adoption of this emerging imaging modality.  The project goals will be accomplished through a collaboration that involves complementary high-level expertise in the mathematical and biomedical imaging sciences.<br/><br/>The project aims at addressing several challenging problems in biomedical imaging in terms of modeling and inversion from both computational and experimental perspectives.  (1) Advanced ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) reconstruction methods will be developed for determination of acoustic heterogeneities.  (2) New photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) reconstruction methods will be developed to compensate for acoustic heterogeneities.  (3) Novel methods for joint PACT/USCT image reconstruction will be developed to reconstruct the absorbed optical energy density and speed of sound distributions simultaneously.  (4) Innovative PACT reconstruction methods in heterogeneous viscoelastic media will be developed for transcranial brain imaging.  (5) The value of the developed image reconstruction methods will be demonstrated for in-vivo imaging of small animals.  The resulting methods will open new venues for applying these algorithms to wave-related biomedical imaging problems."

Examples include vortices, drops, and solitary waves in fluids, spots in optical and chemical systems, localized buckling of slender structures under compression, pulses propagating along nerve fibers, and localized oscillations in vibrating granular media. These diverse systems have two things in common: (i) they dissipate energy and need to be sustained by external forcing, and (ii) they are sensitive to this external forcing and small changes may lead to distinctly different outcomes (patterns). This project seeks to extend existing theory to similar systems in two and three dimensions and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms responsible for growth of patterns when the forcing is varied. It will apply the results to improved understanding of vortices in rotating convection and crystal growth from a melt. The project will involve a graduate student in the research.<br/><br/>Spatially localized structures are common in solutions to many partial differential equations arising in physical modeling. This research project studies dissipative systems driven by periodic forcing in which different forcing amplitudes can lead to distinct localized states. The project seeks to extend existing theory to higher dimensions and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind the different types of growth of the structures that are observed when parameters are varied. The structures of interest include not only spatially localized pulse-like states, but also fronts connecting two distinct states and defects or holes in otherwise spatially periodic structures. In addition, the project aims to apply the results to several systems of importance in physics and engineering, including vortex structures in rotating convection and crystallization from a supercooled liquid. The techniques used include bifurcation theory for reversible and near-reversible systems, coupled with numerical branch-following and direct numerical simulations of realistic systems."
