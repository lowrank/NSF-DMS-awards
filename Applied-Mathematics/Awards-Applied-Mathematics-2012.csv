We will initiate a mathematical modeling study of second harmonic generation for metal and diectric interfaces. A significant challenge is to explore novel multiscale, multi-physics models involving to capture the useful microscopic effects. Novel computational methods and mathematical modeling techniques will be developed to solve the underlying PDE problems.  When nonlinear optical effects become significantly strong, numerical methods based on the linearization of the essentially nonlinear problem are inadequate. Novel techniques must be explored to develop stable numerical schemes. New robust solution methods for the associated optimal design and  inverse problems will also be developed to investigate the critical ill-posedness of the model problems.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop new mathematical models and computational algorithms that meet the basic research needs and provide the necessary modeling tools for scientists in the areas of diffractive optics and nonlinear optics. The proposed project has the potential not only to evolve new science, but also to lead to novel mathematics and computational methods. The capabilities for controlling and manipulating light are of paramount significance for many areas of our society, and have applications in critical areas such as energy, sensing, imaging, and information technology. Nonlinear diffractive optics is a fundamental and vigorously growing technology with diverse applications including fast optical switches, plasmonic materials, optical computing, optical microscopy, spectroscopy, and optical metamaterials. The recent enabling high-performance computing facilities and modern lithographic techniques have led to a substantial surge of applications of subwavelength structures, establishing diffractive optics and nonlinear diffractive optics as two of the most rapidly advancing areas of modern optical science. The continuous technology developments have given rise to exciting innovation such as ""invisibility cloaks"" and ""superlenses""; near-field or super-resolution optical microscopy, and other resonance phenomena. The future development and analysis of modern optics devices and theory will benefit from the availability of efficient computational modeling tools and mathematical analysis techniques. Our computational models and optimal design tools will provide an inexpensive and easily controllable virtual prototype of the structures in the design and fabrication of optical devices, potentially leading to faster information processing devices that consume less power, sensors with higher sensitivity, and nonlinear optical devices with high conversion efficiency."

The elastic evolutionary PDE models under present consideration might also be subjected to influences external to the system; e.g., elastic bodies subjected to damping forces across some boundary interface. In consequence, the governing PDE models we will analyze could conceivably constitute a coupling of PDE dynamics which are quite different in character; e.g., a von Karman dynamical plate PDE coupled to a thermal process would give rise to a coupled PDE system which evinces phenomenological traits of both hyperbolic and parabolic PDE, yet could not be said to be either strictly hyperbolic or parabolic. For such evolution equations, linear and nonlinear, we intend to address the following problems: (1) Exact controllability and general reachability properties of those coupled PDE models which describe the interaction between an elastic structure and a surrounding fluid medium.  In line with the physical application, the movements of the elastic body are to be controlled by the indirect means of fluid boundary control. (2) Uniform stability properties of structural acoustic systems. In this situation, acoustic waves, interior to a chamber geometry, are coupled to elastic equations which model the flexural vibrations on a portion of the chamber wall; the elastic component here will manifest some quantifiable measure of damping, from weak viscous to super-strong Kelvin-Voight damping.  For these systems, and under appropriate geometrical assumptions, we intend to investigate the possibility that the elastic damping is propagated throughout the entire composite system, to the extent that each component--ostensibly undamped wave as well as structurally damped elastic wall component--decays at some discernible rate. (3) Results concerning the asymptotic behavior of solutions, or flows, of certain nonlinear evolutionary plate PDE systems. In particular, we shall concentrate on those systems which are ""non-gradient""; that is, there is no available Lyapunov function on the associated finite energy space which can employed to track the long time behavior of the given, possibly non-dissipative, PDE. It is hoped that our work in this connection will culminate in the stabilization of such nonlinear processes to a global compact attractor.<br/><br/>We believe that the results of this project could give benefit much beyond their intrinsic worth as contributions to the discipline of mathematics. For example, in our aforesaid and intended structural acoustics uniform decay investigation, we anticipate that the stability results will depend critically upon the particular chamber geometry which is in play. As a consequence, we believe our research efforts could give a precise characterization of those structural acoustic geometries which will give rise, in long time, to relatively quiescent interior acoustic fields. Such geometrical situations could then conceivably obviate, or at least lessen, the need for the active engineering control of acoustic noise. Moreover, our intended project work in analyzing the long time behavior of nonlinear evolutionary plate dynamics could have immediate Control Engineering implications: Should we find, for a given nonlinear PDE system, that the corresponding flows converge to a global compact attractor of finite fractal dimension, then conceivably the system could be actively controlled numerically by means of a constructed finite-dimensional feedback. In addition, the research generated by this project will serve as the basis from which we will develop and implement a research program for undergraduates interested in numerical PDEs, and in mathematics generally.  In particular, the PIs will run the University of Nebraska-Lincoln ""Research Experience for Undergraduates"" site in Summer 2013. Within the context of a canonical one dimensional setting, and through the partial agency of a commercial computer algebra software package, we will teach, to our undergraduate participants, aspects of the nonlinear theory developed in the course of our project work. Moreover we will actively involve them in research projects concerning the numerical approximation of the solutions, or flows, which correspond to those one dimensional nonlinear processes which fall under the umbrella of our project work."

The goal is to develop new mathematical tools towards progress on various open problems, such as the global regularity versus finite time blow-up of classical solutions, the behaviour of solutions in singular limit regimes, and other qualitative properties.  The first part of the project is devoted to studying the regularity of active scalar equations.  The work is mostly geared towards the analysis of the inviscid and the supercritically-dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation, porous media equation, and the magneto-geostrophic equation.  For all these models the a priori controlled quantities are too weak to guarantee the global existence of smooth solutions.  The investigator and collaborators seek to identify analytic and geometric mechanisms that preclude the possible formation of singularities.  The regularity of supercritical drift-diffusion equations is also considered.  The second part of the project addresses the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations on a bounded domain.  The goal is to establish new well-posedness results for the Prandtl boundary layer equations under weak matching conditions at the top of the boundary layer, and analyze the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations in these regimes. <br/><br/>     The equations describing incompressible Newtonian fluids, such as the Euler and the Navier-Stokes equations, account for interactions between a very broad range of space and time scales, in a highly nonlinear fashion.  Due to this intrinsic complexity, the accuracy needed to fully resolve the underlying phenomena via numerical computations is out of reach for the foreseeable future.  This project seeks to further advance the rigorous analysis of these equations, which is vital to a finer understanding and validation of the models, and to an accurate interpretation of numerical simulations."

There are many natural links between these two areas that  lead to a better appreciation of techniques and methods used in either field. In addition, an approach that combines stochastic modelling with a dynamical-systems analysis often has the best chances of tackling a problem successfully: three examples are nonlinear optics, where noise from various sources plays an important role in laser and fiber dynamics; stochastic networks, where stability of the network can, in many cases, be determined by the analysis of a related fluid limit that is characterized by an ordinary or partial differential equation; and cell physiology, where stochastic models of ion channel gates often provide better agreement with experiments. A similar trend occurs on the theoretical level: probabilistic methods are an important tool that aids in the analysis of PDEs, for instance in the derivation and validation of scaling laws and the dynamics of fronts in heterogeneous media; conversely, dynamical-systems methods provide insight into the behavior of PDEs with noise. The goal of this project is to broaden and enhance the scope and quality of the educational and research training provided to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows by integrating research and education in the fields of dynamics, stochastics, and their applications and to involve more undergraduate students in courses and research experiences in applied mathematics.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems and stochastic processes are highly active and exciting fields of research that make important contributions to many applications in economics and the natural and social sciences, whilst also being of intrinsic mathematical interest. Dynamical-systems theory is concerned with time-dependent processes, while stochastics deals with nondeterministic, random processes. Examples where the interplay between these two fields is important are noise fluctuations in the design of high-power lasers, the long-time behavior of random interacting systems such as consensus formation in social networks, self-assembly of micro- and nanostructures for drug delivery, random fluctuations in biological cell processes, and importance sampling of rare events in finance. Providing more systematic and integrated training in dynamics and stochastics for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will prepare these groups better for careers in academia and industry. It will also lead to an increase in the number of US mathematicians trained in stochastic systems, and therefore make the US better able to compete with Europe, which has a larger community in this area. The initiatives for undergraduate students will increase the number of students who are exposed to applied mathematics and are engaged in summer research experiences."

However, the robustness of these tori and the existence of remnants upon destruction are understood only in two-dimensions. The PI proposes to study tori of three-dimensional maps, and to generalize the residue criterion discovered by Greene and the anti-integrable limit discovered by Aubry. Studies will include symmetry reduction, invariance, and the loss of integrability for general, structure-preserving maps and flows. An important application is the optimization of mixing in open duct flows used in the continuous blending of materials. Our current understanding of the mixing process is, for the most part, limited to flows that are in essence two-dimensional and either closed or recycling. Transport in three-dimensional systems can be quantified by the flux through the destroyed structures, computed using a generalized action based on Lagrangian forms, thereby obtaining accurate and computationally efficient volume fluxes. The PI and students will use the concept of transitory dynamics to quantify and optimize transport in open flows. The extension to episodic and more general time-dependence will clarify the definition of Lagrangian coherent structures in aperiodic dynamics.<br/><br/>The complexity of patterns obtained by mixing a passive scalar in a fluid can be observed by anyone pouring cream into hot coffee. That this process is not fully understood is perhaps less obvious. If the flow is sufficiently turbulent then mixing is rapid and uniformity is not hard to achieve. If, however, the flow is slow, on a small scale, or viscous, then mixing is much more difficult. Yet, such processes are important to many applications including the development of micrometer scale bioreactors and effective mixing of polymer and granular materials. A predictive theory for laminar mixing would also contribute to the understanding of climate modeling and pollution dispersal in the atmosphere as well as nutrient dispersal and spawning efficiencies for sea life. Mixing in laminar flows proceeds by stretching and folding due to chaotic motion that gives rise to fine-scale structure where diffusion is effective. Any measure of mixing requires quantification of chaos and its concomitant transport. Chaotic motion in incompressible fluids has some similarities to that in conservative dynamics. The later models are used to predict the lifetime of particles in accelerators, obtain rates for simple chemical reactions, calculate confinement times in plasma fusion devices, understand the spectra of highly excited atomic systems, and design efficient spacecraft trajectories. For chaotic dynamics, prediction of specific trajectories is difficult; nevertheless, chaos can be profitably utilized, for example, to improve efficiency of spacecraft trajectories, by judiciously applying small course corrections, or to enhance the lifetimes of particles in confinement devices and the rates of chemical reactions. In this study, chaos will be used to optimize mixing with the goal of obtaining practical designs for open, three-dimensional, mixing devices."

The Navier-Stokes and Euler equations have served as the primary tools for numerical modelling, yet the very basic question of whether they can actually produce solutions satisfying laws of turbulence has not been settled.  In recent years, with the advances of topological methods and better understanding of the nonlinear structure of the equations, this problem, commonly known as the Onsager conjecture, has come within our reach.  The underlying theme of this project is to develop an analytical approach for studying statistical properties of deterministic solutions.  The focus is on finding stationary energy dissipative weak solutions of the Euler and active scalar equations in the Onsager-critical regularity class, developing rigorous fractal analysis of the empirical concept of intermittency as a volumetric measure of non-uniformity of the Richardson cascade, excluding extreme deviations from the classical Kolmogorov laws as shown by the vast experimental data, and establishing links between intermittency and the global regularity problem. <br/><br/>     Turbulence is a complex chaotic process of fluid motion that commonly happens when a stirring force, like heat from the sun or an airplane cutting fast through air, injects a lot of energy into the system.  This motion gets so complicated and rough that a part of the kinetic energy gets lost, creating what is known as anomalous dissipation.  In our lives we can see this dissipation responsible, for example, for creation of additional drag in the turbulent wake of an airplane or our cars.  In order to improve energy efficiency it is therefore essential to understand the mechanisms behind the process of anomalous energy loss and the reasons why it arises.  In this project the investigator develops mathematical foundations of this aspect of turbulence based directly on the governing equations of fluid motion.  A particular emphasis is given to studying non-uniformity of energy dissipation, which allows identifying regions where it occurs the most.  An integral part of the project is developing the analytical and computational skills of graduate and undergraduate students."

The project extends their recent results regarding existence and locality of energy cascades, and anomalous dissipation in physical scales of the flow.  The main goals are, on one hand, to present Onsager-critical Morrey-type conditions preventing anomalous dissipation in 3D incompressible flows and to discover a set of universal scaling laws -- reminiscent of the fundamental Kolmogorov K41 laws -- that naturally transpire from their theory of turbulent cascades in physical scales, and on the other hand, to present mathematical evidence of a geometric scenario closing the scaling gap in the regularity problem, that is, of the criticality of the 3D NSE problem for large data.  The key idea is to use a new ensemble-averaging process capable of detecting significant sign fluctuations of the physical density of interest at the given scale.  This approach is highly local in space and is applicable to flows that do not satisfy homogeneity and isotropy assumptions.  In addition, it provides a framework for the study of geometrically coherent structures in physical space. <br/><br/>     In 2000, the Clay Mathematical Institute identified seven ""Millennium Problems"" in mathematics, solutions to which would have a broad impact on society in the 21st century.  One of these problems is the task of providing a rigorous mathematical foundation (namely, addressing the possibilities of singularity formations) for the Navier-Stokes equations that describe the motion of fluids.  Existence of singularities is a fundamental issue for mathematical modeling of any real-life phenomenon.  In the case of Navier-Stokes equations this regularity problem is believed to be linked with the notion of turbulence.  Despite successes in empirical modeling and computational techniques used to study turbulence, this phenomenon remains one of the unresolved fundamental problems of modern physics.  Any measurable progress in understanding turbulence can have a broad impact in such areas as weather and climate modeling and engineering applications.  On one hand, suppressing turbulence is essential in designing and engineering more efficient vehicles, wind turbines, pipeline systems.  On the other hand, enhancing turbulent mixing is desired in a variety of nano-scale engineering designs, as well as in biomedical engineering -- one example being more efficient drug delivery systems.  The project helps advance understanding of how to better predict and detect turbulent behavior, as well as possibly control it.  The investigators engage graduate and undergraduate students in the project and present lectures on turbulence to local high school students."

The asymptotic behavior of powers of matrix exponentials or the matrix itself for large exponents is still determined by the eigenvalues, but transient behavior is not. In this project, the principal investigator will use other sets in the complex plane that can be associated with a matrix, such as the field of values or the epsilon-pseudospectrum, to give more information about the behavior of such matrix functions e.g. for finite powers. In the other direction, new results about the behavior of such matrix functions will lead to new insights into problems in complex approximation theory.<br/><br/>This award will support work in the mathematical areas of matrix theory and complex analysis that is fundamental in many application areas in science and engineering. A range of mathematical methods is available for describing the long-term behavior of systems (will a radiation level eventually decay to zero, will flutter in an aircraft eventually die out), but a more crucial question may be what happens in the near-term. While a computer simulation may answer this question for a specific scenario, general results about what determines the transient behavior of such systems are often lacking. This project will provide better mathematical tools for analyzing such questions for a wide class of models.

Because of its close connection with<br/>material failure initiation, the phenomenon of cavitation has<br/>received much attention from the materials and mechanics<br/>communities.  Cavitation has also been a subject of interest in<br/>the mathematical community because its modeling has prompted the<br/>development of techniques to deal with a broad class of<br/>non-convex variational problems.  While in recent years<br/>considerable progress has been made via energy minimization<br/>methods to establish existence results, fundamental problems<br/>regarding the quantitative prediction of the occurrence of<br/>cavitation in real material systems remain largely unresolved. <br/>In this project, the principal investigator develops a novel<br/>framework to study cavitation that: (i) is applicable to large<br/>classes of nonlinear elastic solids of practical interest, (ii)<br/>allows for 3D general loading conditions with arbitrary<br/>triaxiality, (iii) incorporates direct information on the initial<br/>shape, spatial distribution, and mechanical properties of the<br/>underlying defects at which cavitation can initiate, and (iv) is,<br/>at the same time, computationally tractable.

Brownian dynamics with hydrodynamic interactions refers to the time-integration of these equations.  These SDEs are fraught with numerical difficulties such as high dimensionality, multiplicative noise, nonlinear drifts, multiple time-scales and complex coupling with the surrounding solvent.   While some schemes have been proposed to simulate such systems, none satisfy the fundamental requirement of numerical stability, which is a main motivation for this project.  This project will deliver novel techniques to solve these SDEs in a numerically stable and practical way.   <br/><br/>With fluorescence microscopy, scientists can now briefly watch individual DNA molecules move in all sorts of flow fields.  However illuminating these glimpses of DNA motion might be, they are not precise enough to answer fundamental questions such as how can certain shearing flows induce DNA to fragment or concatenate?  To answer such questions, numerical simulation is essential, and this example emphasizes the significant role that quantitative simulations play in the burgeoning area of DNA nanotechnology.  Simulations combined with fluorescence microscopy enable scientists to comprehensively study the mechanisms behind DNA dynamics in a variety of flow fields.

The focus of the conference will be on ""coupled-physics"" or ""hybrid"" imaging modalities that have received a lot of attention in recent years due to the great promises they hold for medical imaging and other fields. By combining two or three different types of waves (or physical fields) these methods overcome limitations of classical tomography techniques and deliver otherwise unavailable, potentially life-saving diagnostic information. Among these methods are the Thermoacoustic Tomography (TAT), Photo-Acoustic Tomography (PAT), Ultrasound Modulated Optical and Impedance Tomographies (UMOT, UMEIT), Magneto-Acousto-Electric Tomography (MAET) and several other modalities combining magnetic fields with ultrasound scanning of the tissue. Closely related to these methods are so-called combined physics modalities such as Current Density Imaging and Elastography. Besides medical imaging there has been also recent interest on coupled-physics inverse methods in oil exploration in particular on the Seismo-electric effect.<br/><br/>One of the goals of this workshop is to give the participants, in particular junior mathematicians, the opportunity of learning the state of the art in research on coupled-physics inverse problems and discuss future directions and problems.

We aim to carry out mathematical analysis and computation on prototype equations to gain fundamental understanding of the highly nontrivial effects of flow on transport. Significant amount of asymptotic and numerical work in this direction has been accomplished in recent years when the flow lines (streamlines) are either well-structured (regular motion) or fully random (ergodic motion). The often encountered yet less studied case is when the streamlines consist of both regular and stochastic motions, while neither one takes up the entire phase space. An example is the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flow, a class of three dimensional incompressible mean zero periodic flow with chaotic flow lines. The research program is to study large time front speeds of reaction-diffusion-advection and Hamilton-Jacobi equations in various ABC flows with chaotic and stochastic  streamlines in channel domains orin the entire space. A measure of the amount of disorder in the streamlines is given by the phase space volume occupied by the points on the Poincare sections. The project combines analytical and computational approaches to study the dependence of front speeds on the degree of chaos, nonlinearities, and correlation with effective diffusion, a related transport property.  Front speed variational formulas and corrector equations are used to reduce the original nonlinear dynamical problems on unbounded spatial domains to a principal eigenvalue or Lyapunov exponent (growth rate) problem on a finite spatial domain. Related educational activities, postdoc mentoring, and data management are also planned.<br/><br/>Carrying out the proposed work will advance our understanding of material transport in disordered flows arising in nature, and generate broad impact to the science and engineering of pollutant transport, forest fire spreading, internal combustion engine with power efficiency and low waste gas emission to name a few. The mathematical and numerical methods developed in the project are potentially estimation and consulting tools for resolving complex real-world problems.They may aid decision makers to act timely to minimize damage from fire hazards and pollutants, and help manufacturers improve energy efficiency in engine design for green environment. The results and data generated in the project will also benefit educators in curriculum development and course offerings, which in turn stimulates more US students to pursue higher degrees in science, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines."

Roughly speaking, turbulent flame speed is the averaged flame propagation speed under the effect of the flow (turbulence).  The central goal of the project is to understand the dependence of the turbulent flame speed on the turbulence intensity.  A particularly important problem is to figure out how the flow-stretching effect contributes to the strong bending and quenching of flame speeds. Another goal of the project is to compare turbulent flame speeds predicted by various G-equations and other models in the mathematics literature, such as the Majda-Souganidis model and the well-studied scalar reaction-diffusion-advection equation model. Some proposed problems have significant connections with the Aubry-Mather theory and weak KAM theory, which are important for understanding nonintegrable dynamical systems.  So far there are very few rigorous analytical results on turbulent flame speeds in flows of more than two dimensions. A long-term goal of this project is to understand how chaotic structures in three-dimensional flows (e.g., the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow) affect turbulent flame speeds. <br/><br/>Turbulent combustion plays the main role in important industrial issues such as energy production and engine design. The so-called G-equation and its variants are popular models in turbulent combustion due to their simplicity, efficiency, and robustness in fitting experiments. All the research components of the project are closely related to one of the most important unsolved problems in turbulent combustion; namely, to predict the turbulent flame speed and, in particular, to understand how it depends on the turbulence intensity (e.g., think of the relation between the spreading velocity of a wild fire and the strength of the wind). A very important part of the project is its educational component. Besides supervision of graduate students, the principal investigator also plans to participate in several well-established educational programs at UC-Irvine, ranging from the K-12 to the undergraduate levels: California MathCounts, a 6-8th grade math competition; the Irvine Area Math Modelers (IAMM), which is a training program that prepares local high school students for the National High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling (HiMCM)); the SURF program, which is an undergraduate summer research program; the  Freshman Seminar Program, which provides introductory lectures on research to undergraduate students at UC-Irvine.

The PI will address open questions by developing a systematic approach to the spectral stability of waves for second order in time PDEs. An advantage of this method is that it treats both spatially periodic and solitary waves, which provides a link between the well studied results for solitary waves and the mostly open questions on periodic waves.

The SQG equation has been very useful in modeling large-scale motions of atmosphere and oceans such as the frontogenesis, the formation of sharp fronts between masses of hot and cold air. The Boussinesq equation has also been successful in modeling many geophysical flows such as atmospheric fronts and ocean circulations. In addition, the Boussinesq equation is also at the center of turbulence theories concerning turbulent thermal convection. Mathematically, the SQG equation and the 2D Boussinesq equation serve as lower dimensional models of the three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics equations. In fact, they both retain the key features of the 3D Navier-Stokes and the 3D Euler equations such as the vortex stretching mechanism. The proposed study on these 2D models may shed light on the mystery surrounding the 3D equations. This project focuses on the fundamental issue of whether physically relevant solutions to these equations are globally regular for all time or they develop singularities. The objective here is to introduce new ideas and develop effective techniques to solve the outstanding open global regularity problem on the supercritical SQG equation and on the Boussinesq equation with partial or no dissipation. Extensive large numerical simulations will be performed to provide insight to the underlying dynamics and novel estimates via dedicated tools from harmonic analysis and differential equations will be derived to gauge the large-time behavior of their solutions. The award will support Ph.D. students in mathematics at Oklahoma State University.<br/><br/>Partial differential equations are fundamental tools in understanding many fluid phenomena ranging from small scale blood flows to large-scale geophysical flows and have played pivotal roles in many practical applications involving fluid flows. Outstandingly among them are the Navier-Stokes equations, which are widely used for describing phenomena that are as varied as lubrication in machine equipment, airflow around a wind turbine, oceanic flows, and large scale atmospheric flows that are responsible for cold fronts and the jet stream. The study and use of the full Navier-Stokes equation is notoriously difficult and there are still fundamental open questions associated with them. Researchers have therefore developed several simplified versions of these equations that still retain some of their fundamental properties. These partial differential equations have been at the center of numerous analytical, experimental and numerical investigations. One of the most prominent problems concerning these equations is whether all of their classical solutions are global in time. An affirmative answer would suggest that they may be valid even in extremal flow situations and that it makes sense to attempt to solve them with computational methods, while a negative answer will point to possible limitations of their use and to inherent difficulties when a numerical solution is attempted. This problem can be extremely challenging and remains open in many important cases. The main goal of this project is to create new strategies and develop effective techniques to further advance the research on and improve our  understanding of this difficult problem. The emphasis will be on unconventional approaches that combine methods and tools from different mathematical disciplines such as fluid mechanics, harmonic analysis and numerical simulations. The project will integrate research with education, promoting teaching and training of students. Four Ph.D. students will work with the PI on various aspects of the problems that will be tackled with this award and will be trained in the use of a wide variety of mathematical techniques. In addition, the PI will  organize several specialized scientific conferences and conference sessions during the award period, which will involve and support junior mathematicians as well as researchers from under-represented groups."

In addition he will analyze gradients flows in finite and infinite dimensions including flows on loops groups and other infinite-dimensional spaces, and their relationship to integrability.<br/><br/>The dynamics of mechanical systems is of great importance in technology. The theory of nonholonomic dynamics in particular is the study of mechanical systems subject to constraints imposed on velocities. Such constraints arise for example in systems consisting of rigid bodies rolling on surfaces without slipping  Nonholonomic systems occur frequently in many practical systems including wheeled vehicles such as cars (in particular self steering cars) and robots.  Control of such systems is an important technological problem.  In addition, the mathematics behind the control of nonholonomic systems plays a key role in control of nonlinear systems in general, such as the control of aircraft or underwater vehicles.  Also important is how dissipation (or friction) affects the behavior and stability of such systems We are interested in describing the behavior of these systems, how to control and stabilize them and how to simulate the dynamics and control on a computer.  It is hoped that this research will lead to advances in engineering and the proposer will collaborate with engineers and physicists.  The proposed program has a strong educational impact. Material related to this research will be used in an advanced dynamics class.  The research will involve the work of Ph.D students and undergraduates."

In several models and for certain types of risks, the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE for short) provides the price of the risk. The complexity of the pricing PDE increases with the dimension of the problem and with the complication of the non-linear components of the model. One of the major features of Monte Carlo methods is to be less sensitive to the dimension of the problem than other evaluation methods, as the dimension grows with the number of uncorrelated risk factors. For a significant class of PDEs, i.e. for fully non-linear parabolic equations, designing an appropriate Monte Carlo method is challenging. Recently, new work by the PI and his colleagues opened the door to progress. This award will exploit these advances in theoretical and practical aspects of Monte Carlo schemes for fully non-linear parabolic PDEs and will also incorporate existing ideas in the simpler linear and semi-linear cases. The project will relax the assumptions that had to made previously and will result in schemes for more general situations, such as fully non-linear parabolic equations, nonlinear terms that are neither concave and nor convex, or non-Lipschitzian terms. The convergence of such schemes will be analyzed and asymptotic results for the rate of convergence will be derived. In addition, more problematic PDE's, i.e. degenerate PDEs will be considered. The award will also support the study of so called non-monotone Monte Carlo schemes. Such schemes are observed to converge faster in practice than monotone schemes, but the rigorous mathematical verification of this improved convergence still presents difficulties at the theoretical level, which in turn impedes further broad progress. The theoretical discoveries will be verified by implementing them in practical numerical schemes. This implementation will involve undergraduate students in the context of a summer REU program. Students will be trained in a class of state-of-the-art numerical techniques that have wide practical applications.<br/><br/><br/>The award will support the development of computational methods that are useful in quantitative finance. Traditional methods for this task are known to be quite accurate, but are limited to situations of low complexity. So-called Monte Carlo methods, which employ simulated random experiments, are known to avoid this bottleneck (at some well-known loss of accuracy), but so far have been limited to cases with special (linear or nearly linear) structure. This project will extend computational Monte Carlo schemes to situations with more general non-linear structure. The results of this project will help mathematicians and financial engineers to test new models by comparing their outcome with the patterns in the market and thus help to extend our knowledge about financial markets. Specifically, the project will provide efficient methods for performing computations in the models. At the immediate application level, the project will contribute to progress in the practical aspects of risk pricing, i.e. to develop faster and more reliable evaluations of financial derivatives and of risk related products. Moreover, there are potential applications also in other areas of engineering, for e.g. noise reduction in image processing. The breadth of applications of this research project is also expected to attract students from mathematics and other disciplines. The award will support undergraduate students through summer research experiences and train them in an exciting and accessible area, and the results obtained from this research will be integrated into classes. The award will also be used to disseminate the results within the mathematical research community and beyond."

The reason for this requirement is that, according to the classical theory, image reconstruction from truncated CT data (the so-called ""interior problem"") is non-unique. As a consequence, many aspects of truncated data inversion have not been studied in literature. In this project the PIs will theoretically analyze the problem of image reconstruction from truncated data with minimal prior knowledge. Both transmission CT and emission tomography (SPECT) with constant attenuation will be addressed. The PIs will study the questions of stability of the reconstructions in 2D and 3D, characterize the null-space of an integral transform arising in the interior problem, and analyze eigenfunctions of certain singular Sturm-Liouville problems. The PIs will also develop efficient algorithms for numerical solution of the interior problem. These algorithms will be implemented and tested using both simulated and real data. <br/><br/>At present, interior tomography is at the cusp of being directly applicable in general medical imaging diagnostics. The confluence of theoretical, algorithmic, computational, and technological advances gives the PIs hope that interior tomography can move from the ""drawing boards"" to practical medical imaging in the not so distant future. While there are still some open research problems, the results obtained recently show that the problems can be solved with a fairly high degree of confidence. If successful, this study will provide theoretically justified and practically applicable two and three-dimensional reconstruction algorithms for imaging a region of interest inside an object (e.g., the patient) from truncated data. The broader impact of the proposed research lies in the promise it holds for improvements in the practice of clinical medicine and biomedical science generally, as well as for industrial non-destructive testing. The most direct benefit is the reduction in the x-ray dose to the patient; other benefits include less expensive scanners, improved temporal resolution, increased scanner throughput, capability of imaging larger objects, reduced system cost, etc."

A main theme of the work is the study of forces in living systems. The PI will take the point of view of materials science, and analyze, first, semi-flexible, biopolymer systems. These are anisotropic polyelectrolyte gels and consist of directionally biased and electrically charged elastic networks holding fluid with ions. The project starts out woith the question how the combined elastic anisotropy (modeled as in the case of liquid crystal elastomers), electrostatic and short range Van-der-Waals interactions may explain phenomena such as the negative Poynting effect in semi-flexible polymers. The next stage of the research consists in modeling the interstitial tissue. This is a polyelectrolyte gel sustaining large, rod-like protein structures that make the network anisotropic. One main goal is the modeling of edema, in order to explain the large forces that confine the excess fluid in the interstitial tissue of patients. The mathematical problems are formulated as systems of partial differential equations stemming from mixture theory. Specifically, these consist of the time-dependent equations of liquid crystal elastomers coupled with Stokes problems for fluids, and with the Nernst-Planck equations for ions. The new research will partially follow previous work on isotropic polyelectrolyte gels by the PI and coauthors, but new mathematical and modeling tools have to be developed. These new tools will also be applied to modeling the dynamics of cancer cells on fiber tissue. The research will be collaborative, involving the PI and faculty members from mathematics, physics, bioscience and engineering, as well as industrial partners, together with postdocs and graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award will support research aimed at the study of forces that hold living structures together. The PI will focus on modeling interstitial tissue that connects organs, vessels and bone. In particular, the research will try to understand the physical principles underlying the trapping of unusually large amounts of liquid in the interstitial tissue, a condition known as edema. The work, jointly carried out with researchers at the Kidney Institute of the Medical School of the University of Minnesota and with a Minneapolis biosciences company, may help motivate the search for new therapies. These models will also support research on cancer cell dynamics, with the goal of modeling biomechanical aspects of the onset of tumor nucleation.

The three main themes are electromagnetic waves, Sobolev spaces and related problems, and the calculus of variations with applications to elasticity. For the first theme, the principal investigator intends to study questions on approximate cloaking for Maxwell's equations and generalized impedance boundary conditions for evolution equations. The goal of the first direction is to understand whether or not one can approximately cloak an object using the transformation optics (or the change of variable scheme) under various circumstances. Regarding the second direction, the principal investigator seeks to obtain general impedance boundary conditions for highly conductive obstacles. This part of the project is intended to pose new problems and answer new questions motivated by image processing and recent approaches to Sobolev spaces. As to the third theme, the project investigates patterns formed by deformations of thin elastic membranes. The following three problems are considered: (1) the deformation of a thin circular elastic sheet placed on top of an open cylinder and subject to a downward force at the center of the sheet, (2) the deformation of a floating thin elastic membrane, and (3) the deformation of a thin film bonded to a compliant substrate.<br/><br/>The understanding of the problems whose solutions this project hopes to find will advance many applications in technology (e.g., cloaking, image processing, determining the property of materials). The proposed methods make use of various tools in analysis, the calculus of variations, and applied mathematics. These appear to be novel and robust, and they could be widely applicable. One of the main goals of the project will be to generate significant research and teaching interactions among faculty, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students associated with the University of Minnesota's School of Mathematics. The principal investigator is planning to use the techniques and results developed in this proposal for research topics in his classes (calculus, partial differential equations, and the calculus of variations). Since the research is multidisciplinary in nature, he is also planning to participate in multi- and interdisciplinary conferences and workshops."

(1) The first goal is to further advance the work concerning cloaking-by-mapping. Particular emphasis will be placed on the physical relevance of the proposed meta-materials (used for the cloak), and on the potential for improvement in the relative cloaking rates of the approximate schemes. In the context of physical relevance, the goal is to study meta- materials that satify the socalled Kramers-Kronig relations (which  naturally emerge from causality considerations).  Initially these studies will focus on materials, which are governed by the socalled Drude-Lorentz model. It is also planned to perform a careful study of the similarities between the technique of perfectly matched layers (PML) and cloaking-by-mapping. (2) The second goal is to better estimate the presence of inhomogeneities, in particular their volume fraction, from the response to multiple boundary loads. The aim is to extend earlier low volume fraction results, obtained for small number of boundary measurements (n measurements in n dimensions). (3) The third goal is to study the uniqueness and stability of an inverse problem, in which one seeks to identify a (nonlinear) current flux from a single (Neumann) boundary measurement. The associated boundary value problem is motivated by the equations of magnetohydrodynamic equilibria. (4) The fourth and final goal is to study static and dynamic problems associated with corrosion and oxidation modelling. These studies will range from the construction of explicit solutions, to the study of boundary blow-up, and criteria for finite time blow-up vs. existence for all time.<br/><br/><br/>There are significant possibilities for broader impact.  In the area of ""cloaking-by-mapping"", the kind of results, one can expect to obtain, will be extremely useful in determining the degree of ""near invisibility"" that is in practice achievable, given (physically relevant) limitations on the meta-materials, used to construct the cloaks. One can well imagine an interplay between the type of results expected, and the actual physical construction of approximate invisibility cloaks. The work on the estimation/detection of small inhomogeneities has already led to the development of algorithms of use in flaw detection and medical imaging. The improved bounds, for volume fractions, will have similar potential applications. While the studies of the identifiability of the electric flux in the context of magnetohydrodynamics will be mostly theoretical, it is clear that the study of stability properties, and of the benefits of using additional line-integral measurements, could have very practical applications in terms of the control of plasmas in Tokamak devices."

In particular, it is based on the novel proposition of using persistence diagrams, a relatively new concept in applied algebraic topology, as the fundamental modeling tool for DGM. The core tasks include the following. (1) Develop an efficient computational framework for working with persistence diagram data arising from spatiotemporal systems. (2) Using discrete element simulations (DEM) and experiments, carry out precise, well-defined, and complete characterizations of forces and stresses in DGM, including spatial and temporal variability of a given system and quantification of the differences between simulations and experiments.  (3) Formulation of an optimum combination of experiments and simulations to be used to analyze a given system, leading to reliable predictions for the nature and evolution of macroscopic quantities describing a system including stresses and bulk and shear moduli. (4) Use of persistence diagrams to characterize spatial and temporal fluctuations, including the dependence on system size, on the physical dimensions (e.g. 2D versus 3D), and particle properties such as shape or friction. (5) Study the topology of the space of persistence diagrams.

These materials appear in a broad spectrum of practical settings from heavy industry to pharmaceuticals. As such, they are of intense interest to the engineering world. The way in which grains pack and in which forces are carried in DGM presents a significant puzzle for the soft condensed matter and statistical physics communities.  Associated with force and packing complexity are challenging mathematical issues related to the analysis of complex high dimensional multiscale spatiotemporal data.  DGM are inherently high dimensional systems in which geometry plays a fundamental role. However because of their granular nature they cannot be usefully approximated by analytic continuum models and thus a clear method of reduction to a tractable problem is  lacking.  Our goal is to demonstrate that new ideas associated with computational topology provide an efficient, faithful and coherent approach to providing tractable models for the temporal evolution of spatial structures in DGM. The abstract nature of the topological methods being developed imply that the tools developed in this context will be applicable to a wide range of systems demonstrating complex spatiotemporal structures."

This work represents a departure from classical inverse problems where the unknowns are continuous variables.  One way to describe the unknown is to call it a ""word"" consisting of a number of letters.  In these problems one is given measured data which is related to the unknown  word.  The object is to determine the word from the data.  Given a set of characters that are permitted in forming a word, the number of possible n-letter words that can be formed is still very large.  However, it is finite.  The approach taken in this work is to exploit the structure of how a word is formed.  The goal is to devise specialized algorithms which are fast and robust.  Target applications for this work include bar code reading and RFID (Radio-frequency identification) where the hidden words are product codes consisting of ASCII characters.   This class of inverse problems requires new approaches and development of new techniques.  Ideas from sparse representation using dictionaries, coding theory, and signal processing will be employed in this work.  The aim of this effort is to develop practical algorithms that have desirable mathematical properties. The ultimate goal of this work is to create new technologies that will make a difference in industry and commerce.<br/><br/>Bar codes and RFID, used to identify products in stores and warehouses, are important elements in supply chain management.  They are also used to track the life-cycle of products.  There is a need for algorithms for hand-held laser scanners that can read bar codes that are damaged or dirty, and work in poor conditions.  There is also a need for RFID reading methods that can deal with multiple tags that are near each other.  The products of research from this proposal have the potential to make a difference in commerce.  The methods may improve identification and tracking of products at points of sale and in warehouses, and may be able to improve inventory control and supply-chain management.  It is hoped that the work being proposed will have a measurable economic impact.  The PI plans to use bar code decoding as exemplar of industrial mathematics in the classroom at the undergraduate level.  The subject is perticularly exciting and accessible, and involves a breadth of knowledge, from coding theory to signal processing, from measurement science to modeling.

The gravitational n-body problem remains an active topic for research three centuries after Newton proposed it.   In addition to its direct relevance for astronomy and space mission design, it has served as a stimulus for the development of new mathematical techniques.  The research is focussed on three main areas: regularization of singularities, topological and variational existence proofs for periodic orbits, and studies of relative equilibrium solutions.  One of the characteristic features of celestial mechanics is the presence of collision singularities.  It has long been known that simple binary collisions can be ``regularized'' by cleverly chosen changes of coordinates.  More complicated singularities like the triple collision in the three-body problem can be ``blown-up'' so as to reveal the quite complicated behavior of near-collision solutions.  Part of the proposal is to give a complete regularization and blow-up for the three-body problem which combines the older work on the subject with modern developments in symplectic reduction theory.   A similar project for the four-body problem will involve many new ideas and has surprising connections to algebraic surface theory.   <br/><br/>Periodic motions have always played an important role in dynamical systems theory.  They are often the simplest solutions of the equations of motion and provide a framework for understanding other, more complicated solutions.   Recently, variational methods have been used to construct some remarkable symmetric periodic solutions of the n-body problem.  This project will develop topological techniques for finding such solutions and will explore the relationship between the variational and topological approaches. The simplest periodic orbits arise from central configurations -- special arrangements of the masses such that the gravitational forces can be exactly balanced by centrifugal forces when the configuration rotates.  It is a difficult algebraic problem to find or even count the central configurations.  Techniques developed for this problem could be applied to other complicated systems of algebraic equations."

This regime is typical when the scalar in the flow has sources or sinks due to physical or biological forces, such as release or mitigation of contaminants, birth and death processes, predator-prey interactions in biological species, or many others.  As a result, the classical assumptions of turbulent isotropy and homogeneity do not apply, and the mathematical challenge is to properly represent enhanced diffusion (from molecular motion) by the associated fluid motion at scales smaller or comparable to the characteristic forcing scale of the flow.  The complementary expertise of the investigators enables the development of mathematically based models that are verified with numerical and physical experiments.  The investigators study scalar mixing from a variety of angles.  Topological measures on the background stirring, based on dynamical systems methods, are used and tested for modeling turbulent diffusion with coherent structures.  Additionally, mixing measures associated with sources and sinks are studied with an upper bound approach.  Overall, the investigators study how mathematical theory can be used and adapted to explain inhomogeneous, anisotropic diffusion processes observable from physical experiments. <br/><br/>     Transport and mixing processes associated with pollutants, such as the Gulf oil spill and radioactive contamination in Japan, and with biological tracers, such as plankton blooms, are greatly affected by stirring patterns in the background flow.  The novel theoretical and experimental studies proposed here lay the foundation for improved mathematical models and simulations of scalar mixing for many environmental and geophysical processes; in particular, they can be used to address realistic environmental problems.  Other broad impacts include training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher.

(1) It aims to develop new stochastic approximation algorithms (with delays, distributed processors, and a switching process representing the random environment).  Asymptotic properties of these algorithms and related limit results will be established. The results can be applied to consensus control problems among others. (2) Stability of systems with random delays (possibly due to communication latency) will be investigated. Sufficient conditions for stability of nonlinear systems and criteria for functional differential systems with random delays will be obtained. The expected results will shed more lights on treating stability of systems that are delay dependent.  (3) Error estimates in the form of large deviations for system identification using regular and quantized observations will be obtained. By considering both space complexity in terms of quantization and time complexity with respect to data window sizes, this study focuses on providing a better understanding to the fundamental relationship between probabilistic errors and resources that represent data sizes in algorithms, sample sizes in analysis, and channel bandwidths in communications. (4) To approximate the first exit time for diffusions, Markov chain approximation methods will be developed and their rates of convergence will be obtained. To treat numerical solutions to stochastic differential equations with continuous-state-dependent switching, pathwise rates of convergence will be ascertained using a sequence of re-embedded numerical solutions having the same distribution as the original systems in an enlarged probability space.<br/><br/>This project aims to bridge systems theory, stochastic optimization methods, and applications. The research topics proposed include developing iterative algorithms using parallel processors and taking random environment into consideration, investigating stability of systems involving random delays, obtaining lower and upper estimation error bounds for system identification under different observation patterns, and designing and analyzing numerical solutions of problem involving certain differential equations with random uncertainty. The problems to be studied have been extracted from or motivated by real applications. It is anticipated that the results of this research will be useful for applications in networked systems, wireless communication, financial engineering, system identification with regular and quantized observations, and numerical solutions of certain problems involving random differential equations. The models to be constructed, the intrinsic properties of the systems, and the numerical methods and algorithms to be developed will lead to potential transfer of advances in stochastic systems theory and optimization methods to the aforementioned applications. Theproposed research will involve participation of graduate students; it will also include undergraduate student research projects.

In a recent paper, she and collaborators developed a general method for homogenization of nonlinear partial differential equations.  This method was used to examine the problem of pricing options with short maturity, where the stock price was given by a stochastic volatility model with fast mean-reverting volatility.  The small maturity time made this a problem of large deviations in probability theory, while the shorter mean-reversion time of volatility made this an averaging problem.  Asymptotics of option price under shrinking time-scales of maturity and mean-reversion of volatility were obtained.  In this project the investigator aims to obtain higher order approximations for these option prices.  This problem naturally leads to the investigation of correction terms for large deviations in multi-scale diffusion processes.  Lastly, the investigator studies the effect of fast mean-reversion of volatility on the indifference price of options given in terms of dynamic convex risk measures.  This indifference pricing of options was given in a recent paper by Sircar and Sturm and would be useful for studying the effect of fast mean-reverting volatility on risk measures. <br/><br/>     In view of the current economic crisis, the study of risk of financial positions is essential.  The investigator studies a problem in which the option prices under consideration are given in terms of risk measures.  This makes sense as options offer protection against the risk of stock prices falling (put options) or rising (call options) and thus their price reflects the option buyer's risk aversion.  The investigator analyzes the effect of clustering in market volatility (an observed phenomenon) on the option price described via risk measures, thus indirectly studying the effect of volatility clustering on these important risk measures.  The topics considered here give a flavor of the types of multi-scale problems that are amenable to the homogenization techniques used.  While the specific problems considered are motivated from financial mathematics, multi-scale phenomena abound in nature and these methods for obtaining more accurate approximations of such phenomena should find wide application."

We allow for asynchronous dynamics (no global clock); specifically, nodes of the network may not be updated synchronously (at each time step). Of special interest is the further development of a very promising Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) network architecture that combines randomness (coming from node dynamics) with a loose (sloppy) asynchronous logic.  Overall, the research will use mathematical techniques developed in the study of statistical properties of dynamical systems with the mathematics of network dynamics and be guided by numerical simulation and experimentation.<br/><br/>Many physical, electrical and biological systems can be modeled by networks of interacting differential equations and maps. The most realistic models allow for randomness, discontinuity, time delays and asynchrony - there may be no global clock and so the nodes of the network may not be updated synchronously (by way of contrast, the motion of the planets round the sun is synchronous: all the planets continually move and interact, via gravity, with all the other planets).  Asynchrony is a characteristic feature of much recent technology as well as of complex biological systems, such as the brain.

The project also addresses the practically important problem of placing rigorous upper and lower limits (bounds) on the volume of an inclusion in a body using a small number of measurements of the electromagnetic or elastic fields at the surface of the body, focusing on the electromagnetic case in the quasistatic regime where the wavelength of the time harmonic fields is much larger than the microstructure and the moduli and fields are complex.

This may have future applications to determining the size of cancer tumors, or of voids in a body, or the porosity in an osteoporotic bone. In a third direction, new mathematical approximations for physical effects of imperfections at the interface between two different materials will be developed, which are expected to be of use in the practical design of new composite materials.

Some examples include the flow of blood through the microcirculation, the flow of droplets through microfluidic devices, the flow of magma through lava tubes, refrigerant flow in cooling systems and water flow in solar steam generators. While the physics differ, the underlying phenomena are often similar. In all of the examples above it is difficult to predict and determine the distribution of different phases or constituents within the network. Complexity in a network with many inter-connections containing unusual fluids (such as blood in the microvasculature) may seem unsurprising. However, even the   simplest networks with ordinary fluids can demonstrate extraordinary behavior. This proposal seeks to develop and verify a new general theory for describing phase distribution within and the dynamical behavior of fluid networks. The proposed work takes a building block approach, fully describing the behavior of simple network elements and then adding complexity in a systematic manner. The theoretical study is closely integrated with an experimental track which will verify the key predictions of the theory. Without the experimental data, it would be impossible to map the mathematical theory to specific physical manifestations.<br/><br/>Network fluid dynamics have been studied theoretically and computationally for approximately 20 years, yet few general statements about network behavior exist. The prevalent approach has been direct simulation which does not allow for the key parameters to be understood in a systematic way. Further, key predictions have never been tested in experiment. This proposal overcomes these limitations and will develop a new general theory for network fluid dynamics which is rooted in experiment and will describe the equilibrium and dynamic behavior of the network in a general manner such that results can be easily translated to specific physical systems.  Finally, the work will be conducted at an undergraduate college with undergraduate students playing a central role in the research."

Currently, there is a consensus that sufficiently<br/>large lattice cell sizes are necessary for some nontrivial physical<br/>effects to occur in such structures. (The most intriguing of these<br/>effects is high-frequency magnetism.) Classical homogenization<br/>theories work well in the zero-cell-size limit but are difficult to<br/>apply to large metamaterial cells. In contrast, the proposed theory is<br/>non-asymptotic and does not involve any series expansions with respect<br/>to the cell size. The electromagnetic field in the material is<br/>approximated by a finite set of functions (modes) usually but not<br/>necessarily Trefftz functions such as Bloch waves. The coarse-grained<br/>fields and flux densities are defined via curl-conforming and<br/>div-conforming interpolations, respectively. A linear map between<br/>these interpolants is established and defines an extended material<br/>tensor. In a certain canonical basis, this extended tensor has a<br/>classical block of 36 local parameters and a novel block quantifying<br/>nonlocal effects. From the differential-geometric perspective, this<br/>constitutive relationship can be viewed as a realization of<br/>Bossavit-Hiptmair's discrete Hodge operators (linear maps between<br/>discretized 1-forms that correspond to vector fields and 2-forms that<br/>correspond to fluxes).<br/><br/>Over the last decade, metamaterials have attracted unprecedented<br/>attention due to a variety of potential applications that include<br/>superlensing, electromagnetic cloaking, electromagnetically-induced<br/>transparency, efficient antennas, and more. Experimental<br/>demonstrations of these effects have been limited to proofs of<br/>principle and at optical frequencies have so far been incomplete.<br/>Subwavelength optical imaging has been achieved only in the<br/>quasi-static (near-field) regime, standard for the more conventional<br/>near-field optics; the so-called ""carpet cloak"" conceals surface bumps<br/>rather than 3D objects, and so on. Moreover, applications that do not<br/>depend critically on the effective medium description of metamaterials<br/>appear to be more easily achievable than the ones that do. The latter<br/>group includes, notably, superlensing and cloaking. This suggests<br/>that, to make further progress, theoretical and mathematical issues at<br/>the heart of metamaterial science must be unambiguously resolved. The<br/>main problem can be stated as follows. Given the composition of a<br/>metamaterial cell and the operating frequency, determine whether this<br/>metamaterial can be reasonably described as a continuous medium with<br/>some effective parameters, just like any natural optical material; if<br/>the answer is positive, develop a rigorous methodology for such a<br/>description. The proposed research is aimed at solving this problem in<br/>the most difficult case when the cell size of the composite is an<br/>appreciable fraction of the wavelength of light. The methodology, once<br/>developed, will allow the scientific community to delineate the<br/>possible from the impossible in the field of metamaterials.<br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research is in the development<br/>of a new paradigm of non-asymptotic homogenization, of new<br/>computational methods related to it, and in the application of the<br/>proposed methodology to electromagnetic metamaterials, allowing one to<br/>gain a much deeper understanding of their properties and limitations.<br/>As a new area of research, non-asymptotic homogenization will also<br/>have a broader technical impact in other areas of applied physics and<br/>engineering, such as acoustics, heat transfer and possibly elasticity."

Tomography techniques are also extensively used for industrial non-destructive testing, in geology and geophysics, astronomy, and in other areas. Lately, they have found important applications in homeland security. Over the last decades, several modalities have been developed and have became standard. Such are, for instance, the traditional X-ray CT scan, SPECT, MRI, Optical-, Ultrasound-, and Electrical Impedance Tomography, to name a few. However, such tasks as detection of small cancerous tumors in soft tissues or finding a small amount of nuclear material in a large container still present a significant challenge.  In recent years, revolutionary ""hybrid"" or ""multi-physics"" methods of medical imaging have been emerging. By combining two or three different types of waves (or physical fields) these methods overcome limitations of classical tomography techniques and deliver otherwise unavailable, potentially life-saving diagnostic information - at a lesser cost and with less health hazard to a patient. As a rule, the images in these modalities are obtained by complex mathematical procedures, rather than through direct acquisition. The corresponding mathematics is, mostly, at very early stages of development. Thus, the first part of the project addresses the central mathematical and numerical issues in several of the novel hybrid techniques, based on combinations of magnetic, electric, acoustic, and optical waves, and the general mathematical issues common to all of these techniques.      The second part of the projects is directed toward the improvement of the known methods and development of new tomographic techniques for homeland security problems. In particular, we will focus on the detection techniques for illicit weapons-grade nuclear materials in cargo, to be used at border crossings and harbors. In the third part these techniques will be used to resolve some outstanding problems in Synthetic Aperture Radar applications, radio tomography, ultrasound reflectometry, and other areas.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop new techniques of medical imaging, as well as efficient methods of detecting illicit nuclear materials at border crossings and in harbors.

The results will be disseminated through publications in high quality research journals, presentations at national and international conferences, and series of lectures at various venues. Graduate students will play a significant role in the project, which will prepare them for work in the exciting area at the junction of exact sciences, medicine, biology, and homeland security.

The major goal of the project is the development of new techniques to achieve breakthroughs in our understanding of fluid dynamics phenomena. The project research will address fundamental properties of the classical equations of fluid dynamics, qualitative properties of solutions, and modeling applications. The project focuses on three main directions. The first set of problems concerns global regularity vs finite time blow up that will be investigated for a range of fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. Axi-symmetric solutions for 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes will be considered, new potentially singular scenarios will be studied and new regularity criteria will be sought. Active scalars, such as surface quasi-geostrophic equation coming from atmospheric science, will also be analyzed -- here the effort will concentrate on studying properties of solutions, search for new Lyapunov functionals and novel regularity estimates. In the second direction, we will seek more detailed information on long time dynamics. This will include research on some long-open conjectures for 2D Euler equation, including possible mechanisms of inverse energy cascade, mixing and small scales formation. We will also work on passive scalar models and mixing properties of flows in this context. Biomixing by chemotaxis will be investigated as well, with an eye towards applications in ecology and marine biology. The third direction focuses on complex fluid models. In many applications - for instance, in studies of particle suspensions or solutions - the microscopic structure of   particles in the fluid becomes important. The shape and interactions between the particles can be taken into account by adding kinetic equations to the fluid dynamics systems and introducing physically natural couplings. Analysis of solutions to such systems, their regularity and qualitative properties will be a part of the project work.<br/><br/>Fluids are ubiquitous in nature, science and engineering. Diverse phenomena involving fluids appear in atmospheric and ocean science, astrophysics, chemistry and biology, and are described by partial differential equations of fluid mechanics. These equations are some of  <br/>the most difficult partial differential equations to analyze. They   describe a wide range of complex phenomena, are nonlinear, and usually   nonlocal. Due to their complexity, even the classical equations such   as 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes are far from well understood. The   proposed research lies at the interface of several central areas of mathematics - partial differential equations, dynamical systems, functional analysis and Fourier analysis. This FRG project   brings together several researchers that have been at the forefront of recent developments in mathematical fluid mechanics. Different   participants bring different strengths to the project. It is expected that intensive collaboration within FRG framework will lead to   development of new ideas and approaches and result in a burst of activity in mathematics of fluids. New techniques and tools developed   are likely to have an impact in neighboring areas of mathematics,  biology, and atmospheric science. An important part of the FRG   activity will be training of junior researchers.  Mathematics of fluid  mechanics covers a broad range of effective techniques, which are   applicable beyond fluids. The training activities will include a   summer school, two workshops, group meetings, course development,   research seminars and research projects for advanced undergraduate   students. The principal investigators will advertise all training   activities broadly, and strive to recruit talented, motivated, and   diverse trainees. Special attention will be paid to recruitment of   groups under represented in mathematics."

Traditional numerical techniques require several function evaluations per wavelength. This is typically prohibitingly computationally costly. In earlier work the investigators have developed and analyzed numerical algorithms for efficient solution of such systems with well-defined scale separation. In this proposal the investigators tackle the harder problems where the scale separation is less clear and where the decomposition into slow and fast variables is not known. Abstractly, a full-scale model with state variables u is given. A number of slow variables, U, which include the local averages of u(t), is to be computed using a sequence of short time histories of u(t), starting from appropriate initial conditions consistently defined by U(t). Hence, the essential objectives that form this proposal are: (1) Under what conditions and in what sense do the multiscale approaches converge? What is the accuracy in the approximation of U, and what are the stability properties of the methods? (2) How can we find higher order accurate algorithms in a systematic way, when the dynamical system's right hand side can be decomposed into stiff and non-stiff parts? (3) Design such methods with a substantial reduction of computational complexity compared with existing techniques. The proposed research will delineate mathematically what it means for a dynamical system that appear to be highly oscillatory to possess slow modes. With this information, new efficient numerical algorithms can be devised and tested rigorously. The proposed research will establish a mathematical link between a variety of averaging theories and new effective numerical integrators and filtering techniques.<br/><br/>The proposed research is at the very mathematical and computational heart of many important applications in science and engineering, from astrophysics to quantum mechanics. In these applications there are rapid oscillations as, for example, vibrations of atoms that affects the overall system on a much slower time scale. This is traditionally difficult to simulate with reasonable computational cost.  The theories and algorithms developed in this proposal make such simulations practical and directly relate to important atomistic simulations that are used in place of actual physical experiments. They will have direct consequences, for example, in molecular biology for understanding drug functions at the cellular level, and also in the study of material properties and unstable events such as the formation and propagation of cracks, which may affect electronic components as well as the structural safety of airplanes."

The first and most important topic is a new look at the dynamic programming method in continuous-time stochastic control using a novel version of Perron's method.  Taking the supremum of stochastic sub-solutions and infimum of stochastic super-solutions, the new method provides two viscosity solutions squeezing between them the value function.  Uniqueness of the viscosity solution (in case it holds) then easily shows that the value function is the unique solution of the dynamic programming equation.  The dynamic programming principle is obtained as a conclusion using this approach, without any a priori analysis of the value function.  This amounts to verification without smoothness of the existence of a viscosity solution (similar to the verification argument in the classic case).  The second topic of the project resides in understanding the incentives of high-watermark fees on the fund manager, by modeling his/her strategic behavior.  The investigator and his colleagues study the optimal choice of the fund manager among available assets (that leads to the fund share price), such that the rational behavior of the investor (utility maximization on her side) yields maximal fees paid to the manager.  The third topic is a first step into understanding information percolation in the context of mean-field games of optimal stopping.  <br/><br/>     Any decision under uncertainty can be modeled as a stochastic control/optimization problem.  This applies not only to finance and economics but to engineering and life sciences.  The current project mainly consists in a new technical approach to a very general class of stochastic control problems.  The new approach provides a deeper understanding of the optimization problems, and it also extends the scope of applications.  In addition, the project models and studies the strategic behavior of fund managers, as well as the percolation of information among populations that interact randomly."

The dynamics of the plate is governed by a system of two coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations known in aeroelasticity as the Goland model. The airflow, which is a small perturbation of a stream parallel to the main plate's axis, is assumed to be inviscid, potential, isentropic, and subsonic. The dynamics of the airflow is governed by the Euler hydrodynamic equation. Owing to the above physical assumptions, the Euler equation can be reduced to a single three-dimensional linear hyperbolic equation for the perturbation potential. This equation is coupled with the system of structural equations by a set of specific boundary conditions: (a) the flow-tangency condition, (b) the Kutta-Joukowski condition, and (c) the far-field condition. The goals of the project include the following: (a) asymptotic, spectral, and stability analysis of the model, (b) analysis of possible flutter control mechanisms, (c) generalization of linear model to the model involving nonlinear structural equations (the Dowell-Hodges model) and investigation of flutter as limit cycle oscillations. The model has two major practical applications: (a) flutter of a soft palate (the palatal flutter) resulting in snoring and sleep apnoea, (b) piezoelectric power harvesting. The project is a continuation of the PI's 12-year work on asymptotic, spectral, and stability analysis and on flutter control for aircraft wing models.<br/><br/>Examples of solid structures interacting with an air or fluid flow include: aircraft wings and tails, suspension bridges, electric power lines, walls of blood vessels and bronchial airways, etc. The phenomenon that unites all the examples is flutter, i.e., sudden chaotic vibrations of the structure, which occur when the speed of the air or fluid flow reaches certain critical value called the utter speed. The project deals with theoretical analysis of a recently developed mathematical model of an elastic solid plate in an axial air flow (an air flow parallel to the plate's main axis). An experimental and computational investigation of the model has already begun in the scientific community. However, an importance of theoretical analysis is obvious: it can provide new insights and is necessary for a design of flutter control mechanisms. The axial flow case is more challenging than a normal flow case (the flow is perpendicular to the plate?s main axis), which occurs in all aircraft wing models. One of the two major applications of the model is medical, which deals with palatal utter: uncontrolled vibrations of a soft palate resulting in snoring and even sleep apnoae. Currently, treatments involve surgical procedures and designing anti-snoring devices. The second application is a newly emerging area of piezoelectric energy harvesting from utter vibrations. The goal of this research direction is to develop a new technology for providing alternative sources of electric power and/or recharging storage devices such as batteries or capacitors. The concept has ecological ramifications in reducing the chemical waste and potential monetary gains by significantly reducing maintenance cost."

The major goal of the project is the development of new techniques to achieve breakthroughs in our understanding of fluid dynamics phenomena. The project research will address fundamental properties of the classical equations of fluid dynamics, qualitative properties of solutions, and modeling applications. The project focuses on three main directions. The first set of problems concerns global regularity vs finite time blow up that will be investigated for a range of fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. Axi-symmetric solutions for 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes will be considered, new potentially singular scenarios will be studied and new regularity criteria will be sought. Active scalars, such as surface quasi-geostrophic equation coming from atmospheric science, will also be analyzed -- here the effort will concentrate on studying properties of solutions, search for new Lyapunov functionals and novel regularity estimates. In the second direction, we will seek more detailed information on long time dynamics. This will include research on some long-open conjectures for 2D Euler equation, including possible mechanisms of inverse energy cascade, mixing and small scales formation. We will also work on passive scalar models and mixing properties of flows in this context. Biomixing by chemotaxis will be investigated as well, with an eye towards applications in ecology and marine biology. The third direction focuses on complex fluid models. In many applications - for instance, in studies of particle suspensions or solutions - the microscopic structure of   particles in the fluid becomes important. The shape and interactions between the particles can be taken into account by adding kinetic equations to the fluid dynamics systems and introducing physically natural couplings. Analysis of solutions to such systems, their regularity and qualitative properties will be a part of the project work.<br/><br/>Fluids are ubiquitous in nature, science and engineering. Diverse phenomena involving fluids appear in atmospheric and ocean science, astrophysics, chemistry and biology, and are described by partial differential equations of fluid mechanics. These equations are some of  <br/>the most difficult partial differential equations to analyze. They   describe a wide range of complex phenomena, are nonlinear, and usually   nonlocal. Due to their complexity, even the classical equations such   as 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes are far from well understood. The   proposed research lies at the interface of several central areas of mathematics - partial differential equations, dynamical systems, functional analysis and Fourier analysis. This FRG project   brings together several researchers that have been at the forefront of recent developments in mathematical fluid mechanics. Different   participants bring different strengths to the project. It is expected that intensive collaboration within FRG framework will lead to   development of new ideas and approaches and result in a burst of activity in mathematics of fluids. New techniques and tools developed   are likely to have an impact in neighboring areas of mathematics,  biology, and atmospheric science. An important part of the FRG   activity will be training of junior researchers.  Mathematics of fluid  mechanics covers a broad range of effective techniques, which are   applicable beyond fluids. The training activities will include a   summer school, two workshops, group meetings, course development,   research seminars and research projects for advanced undergraduate   students. The principal investigators will advertise all training   activities broadly, and strive to recruit talented, motivated, and   diverse trainees. Special attention will be paid to recruitment of   groups under represented in mathematics."

This award will support the development of new methods and tools for attacking the analysis and synthesis of scattered data -- i.e. data collected from non-uniformly distributed sites -- by means of kernel methods. The investigators supported by this awards recently discovered highly localized bases derived from special kernels on manifolds, and this breakthrough will play a key role both in the problems proposed and in their approach to investigating them.  The problem of finding a good, stable basis for an approximation space made from kernels is closely connected with determining well-localized bases at low computational cost. One of the major difficulties in dealing with kernel interpolation or least squares approximation with the ``standard'' kernel basis is that collocation matrices are full and frequently ill conditioned. Recent work by the investigators and collaborators showed that Lagrange-type interpolating functions associated with certain kernels are exponentially localized about their centers and, from numerical experiments, appear to be computationally inexpensive. This award will support exploring the full potential of these newly discovered basis functions.<br/><br/><br/>The need for analyzing and modeling data taken from scattered, irregularly placed sites arises frequently in diverse fields: computer-aided design graphics, data mining, medical imaging, learning networks, and geoscience, in addition to many other areas. For example, weather prediction or climate modeling is based on geophysical data collected at scattered sites, by sensors on satellites, ground stations, or stations at sea. Carrying out such tasks presents difficulties for traditional methods, which are based on collecting data at uniformly placed sites or which require constructing ``meshes'' (think wire fence) that must be carefully tailored to deal with the data sites involved. Newer methods, the so-called kernel methods, do not require such meshes and can handle scattered data. This award will further the development of these kernel methods, making them easy to use, faster, less expensive to implement, and capable of handling data from a hundred thousand or more sites. It will provide support for graduate students, who will be trained in both the theoretical and the applied aspects of using and developing these methods."

This question has attracted attention recently and requires rigorous mathematical treatment. Entanglement of two blocks of spins in ground states of spin models is important. After tracing the rest of the ground state, these two blocks are left in a mixed state. An appropriate measure of entanglement of mixed systems is negativity. The project will describe entanglement of 2 blocks of spins in the AKLT (Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy Takasi) spin chain by means of negativity.

We propose the study of the second and higher breaking of the solution of the semiclassical focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS), through a new  development of the  steepest descent method.  The method  will allow the deformation of strings of poles in the complex plane (they are solutions  of the Zakharov-Shabat  eigenvalue problem) in similar ways and for similar purposes that continuous contours are deformed. The discreteness of the poles will be  retained, contrary to our previous  approach, that condensed the poles to their continuum limit, obtaining the first break, but leading to serious obstacles in treating the second break.  We will also  tackle the derivation of the NLS waves  in a spatial half-line, that result from a time-periodic driver at the boundary point. The long-standing challenge here is that the method of inverse scattering  method is natural for solving evolution equations. Confronted with a boundary value problem, the method demands overdetermined  data on one side. We propose to overcome the difficulty  by matching the wavetrain to the driver, through a boundary layer constructed of multiphase waves and solitons (breathers). This is consistent with the linear limit of the problem.  In the second part of the proposal,  we continue our code development and analytic model development  on the  transmission and guidance of light through photonic crystals near resonance (see below).  <br/><br/>In both parts of the proposal, we address  waves in natural and in man-made materials, in particular, the generation, propagation, breaking and  extraordinary behaviour under resonant conditions of these waves.The physical and technological counterparts of the analysis are mainly in optics (linear and nonlinear). A central object of our analysis is the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS), which appears dominantly in nonlinear  optical transmission, together with its many variants. NLS is notoriously unstable, exhibiting the spontaneous break-up of wave-trains and the formation of new ones. While the mechanism of the  first break is understood from our previous work, subsequent breaks and the type  of wave-trains that eventually emerge are challenging open questions. These questions constitute one of the two focal points of our proposal. The second focal point of the proposal addresses electromagnetic (EM) waves, in particular light and its interaction  with  manufactured materials,  known as photonic crystals (PC). These small-scale materials, metallic or non-metallic,  have a periodic or repetitive geometry  (e.g.  film or plate  perforated at the nodes of a periodic lattice). Monochromatic light,  incident upon the PC, must adjust to the refractive index   inside each of the PC constituent materials. When the  PC geometry is structured appropriately, light can be manipulated to respond taking novel and technologically exploitable modes.  Examples are the guiding, blocking and even trapping of light, as well as extraordinary transmission through PC films. The first commercial products involving two-dimensionally periodic photonic crystals are already available in the form of photonic-crystal fibers (PCF).  Because of its ability to confine light in hollow cores or with confinement characteristics not possible in conventional optical fiber, PCF is now finding applications in fiber-optic communications, fiber lasers, nonlinear devices, high-power transmission, highly sensitive gas sensors, and other areas. Our effort is two-fold. We will continue our development of numerical codes that are dedicated to PC structures and are appropriate for overcoming the difficulties of calculation near resonance.  We have verified that such codes significantly outperform commercial EM codes. We will implement these codes to optimize  transmission in perforated films  and to experiment with novel PC geometries. We will also continue our development of simplified mathematical models that capture analytically the essence of phenomena when a PC operates in the nonlinear regime."

Recent developments in the study of pre-strained materials has put forward new unanswered questions in this field. The pre-straining might arise from a range of causes: inhomogeneous growth, plastic deformation, swelling or shrinkage driven by temperature or by solvent absorption.  The basic model, called ``three dimensional pre-strained elasticity'', is a generalization of the classical variational nonlinear elasticity theory, adapted to take into account the pre-straining. Rigorously deriving 2-dimensional shell models from the 3 dimensional model and studying their properties is among the main objectives of the project. In this context, the study of geometric properties of structures, e.g. the properties of various spaces of isometries and infinitesimal isometries of 2 dimensional surfaces, comes to the front line of the research. Some classes of weakly differentiable mappings with geometric constraints, namely the classes of Sobolev infinitesimal isometries and isometric immersions and of Sobolev solutions to Monge-Ampere type equations, must be studied in order to achieve a full understanding.<br/><br/>The award will support the methodical study of physical or biological phenomena involving structures that try to form an ideal yet unrealizable shape. Such situations, known broadly as pre-strained structures, occur quite often, e.g. in growing tissues, i.e. those structures that grow, such as leaves or tumors, or in engineered gels, which are manufactured with inhomogeneous density and then forced to stretch or compress proportionally to the distribution of the density. Puzzling aspects of such materials have been observed in recent experiments, and their better understanding is therefore of considerable interest. The main framework for a theoretical understanding is the mathematical theory of elasticity, whose goal is to explain various, apparently different, phenomena in terms of some shared mathematical principles. The basic understanding of the pre-straining and its effects on the behavior of the elastic bodies could lead to applications such as manufacturing of intelligently malleable materials or a better understanding of elasticity and morphology of growing biological tissues. The award will also promote interdisciplinary interactions and the research will be carried on in close connection with the applied mathematics, materials science and the biomechanics communities. Some graduate students will be trained in doing mathematical research through involvement in this project."

These equations are some of  <br/>the most difficult partial differential equations to analyze. They   describe a wide range of complex phenomena, are nonlinear, and usually   nonlocal. Due to their complexity, even the classical equations such   as 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes are far from well understood. The   proposed research lies at the interface of several central areas of mathematics - partial differential equations, dynamical systems, functional analysis and Fourier analysis. This FRG project   brings together several researchers that have been at the forefront of recent developments in mathematical fluid mechanics. Different   participants bring different strengths to the project. It is expected that intensive collaboration within FRG framework will lead to   development of new ideas and approaches and result in a burst of activity in mathematics of fluids. New techniques and tools developed   are likely to have an impact in neighboring areas of mathematics,  biology, and atmospheric science. An important part of the FRG   activity will be training of junior researchers.  Mathematics of fluid  mechanics covers a broad range of effective techniques, which are   applicable beyond fluids. The training activities will include a   summer school, two workshops, group meetings, course development,   research seminars and research projects for advanced undergraduate   students. The principal investigators will advertise all training   activities broadly, and strive to recruit talented, motivated, and   diverse trainees. Special attention will be paid to recruitment of   groups under represented in mathematics."

Two classes of problems will be investigated. The first one is that of the boundary conditions for limited area weather models for which physical models do not provide natural boundary conditions. This problem is as old as numerical weather prediction itself, and it is expected that inappropriate boundary conditions will introduce spurious modes, in particular as improved computing capabilities allow better spatial and temporal resolutions. The aim is to derive boundary conditions that lead to mathematically correct problems, and that are computationally satisfactory in the sense that they let the waves move freely inside and outside the domain of computation. The PI will continue his investigations in this direction. The second class of problems is that of moist convection, precipitations and clouds. Our limited understanding of the physics of clouds is one of the primary causes of uncertainty in the current weather and climate predictions. The difficulties are in part due to the large differences in scales, ranging from cloud sizes of hundreds of kilometers to particles (droplets of water, ice or aerosols) of a few microns. There is a similar range of time scales. The project will study this physical problem using mathematical tools from convex analysis and variational inequalities. Numerical multilevel methods will be used as well to study the interaction of clouds and topography near the equator; and finally the tools of convex analysis will also be used for the very modeling of the changes of phase in the clouds. These studies will be conducted in close collaboration with physicists. The project will involve graduate students and post-doctoral associates who will be trained in this important interdisciplinary area.  <br/><br/>This research project will study fundamental problems in the numerical prediction of weather and climate, as well as problems in the mathematical modeling of clouds and evaporation. The project component related to numerical weather prediction addresses the problem of using information from coarse featured global weather data for fine grained local and regional predictions. If the coarse data are not coupled correctly to the regional model that has higher resolution, then spurious systematic errors (e.g. ""ghost"" weather fronts) may arise. The project will investigate the mathematical foundations of this problem. The project component on the modeling of clouds and evaporation will use advanced mathematical tools to contribute to the understanding of a set of basic open problems in weather and climate research: Do clouds help cool the planet (because they reflect sunlight) or do they contribute to warming (because they can hold thermal energy)? Weather prediction and climate modeling are objectives with important human, social and economic interest. The project will also  train young scientists at the interface of mathematics, geophysical fluid mechanics, and scientific computing."

Such data sets  are often of very high dimension (for example digital images).  To be able to extract the information contained, it is desirable to simplify them with minimal loss of information.  One approach is to approximate the data set by a low-dimensional manifold. This project is concerned with a variational approach using nonlocal energies for parameterizing the data with a curve. The goal is to contribute to understanding of which functionals provide for good data approximation and are amenable to efficient computational implementation. The PI studies the fundamental questions such as existence and regularity of minimizers, as well as numerical implementation and applicability to data sets.

Such systems arise as models of collective behavior of a variety of living organisms (locust, fish, birds, bacteria, and others). Goal of this research is to help explain why and how large, well-organized groups (such as swarms, schools, flocks, etc.) of organisms form.

Shallow-water waves are defined as waves whose wavelengths are far greater than the water depth.  Nonlinear wave interactions occur when waves, moving possibly with different speeds and in different directions, intersect.  These equations and systems have permanent waves and breaking waves: the wave profile remains bounded, but its slope becomes unbounded in finite time.  The CH and DP equations also contain peaked solitary waves, as these wave forms replicate a feature characteristic of the traveling wave solutions to the governing equations for largest possible amplitude.  This project provides a greater understanding of wave breaking phenomena and contributes to the extensive modeling of shallow-water waves.<br/><br/>     Water waves lie at the forefront of modern applied mathematics and theoretical physics.  The study of water wave phenomena has been a rich source of mathematical theories for over 200 years and affects a variety of issues pertaining to the ocean and environment.  Breaking waves, both whitecaps and surf, are commonly observed in the ocean, but surprisingly, little is known about them.  Yet they are important for a variety of reasons.  They place large hydrodynamic loads on man-made structures, transfer horizontal momentum to surface currents, provide a source of turbulent energy to mix the upper layers of the ocean, and move sediment in shallow water.  The investigator studies mathematical models of nonlinear shallow-water waves, particularly the CH and DP equations as well as the CH2 systems.  The CH-type equations might also be relevant to the modeling of an important shallow-water breaking wave phenomenon, the tsunami.  A tsunami wave is generated when a large body of water, such as a region in a lake or a sea, becomes rapidly displaced on a massive scale.  With typical wavelengths of 200 km, tsunamis are governed by shallow water equations and can be catastrophic when they reach land, as seen in the recent Indonesia and Japan earthquakes.  This project seeks further understanding of the dynamics of shallow-water wave breaking, especially before and after breaking has occurred when the flow is steady and more amenable to theoretical and numerical study.  In particular, the investigator conducts mathematical analysis pertinent to the modeling of tsunami waves, which in turn helps better predict and understand the waves' characteristics."

It is motivated by the fact that many real-world signals can be well-approximated by or identified with sparse signals.The proposed research will utilize techniques based on nonlinear sparse representations with respect to redundant systems (dictionaries). The investigator's preliminary results show that, although the prior development of compressed sensing has occurred in Hilbert spaces, substantial improvement can be made in the construction of efficient algorithms for exact recovery of sparse signals when we consider the problem in a Banach space instead. To widen the search for efficient algorithms from Hilbert spaces to Banach spaces is the main fundamentally new idea of this proposal.

For example, managing large data bases, such as security data bases obtained through surveillance, requires classification and compression of the data in order to facilitate the extraction of significant features or specific information. More generally, the problem of compression and denoising of large data sets arises naturally in biology, medicine, and many other fields. The scientific discipline that studies this aspect of data processing is called 'compressed sensing.' The goal of the proposed research is to build a fundamental mathematical theory that will significantly increase our ability to process (compress, denoise, etc.) large data sets.

Furthermore, it will develop sophisticated new methods for approximation and numerical computation using these systems. The project lies at the interface between computational harmonic analysis, spectral decompositions, orthogonal polynomials, nonlinear approximation and numerical analysis. It is organized into two main directions of investigation with several specific goals. The first research objective of the project is to develop frames with elements of nearly exponential space localization in the general setting of strictly local regular Dirichlet spaces with doubling measure and local scale-invariant Poincare inequality which lead to a Markovian heat kernel with small time Gaussian bounds and Holder continuity. The key point of the proposed approach is to be able to deal with (a) different geometries, (b) compact and noncompact spaces, and (c) spaces with nontrivial weights, and at the same time to allow for the frame decomposition of Besov and other spaces with complete range of indices. This will facilitate the development of well localized frames in the context of Lie groups or homogeneous spaces with polynomial volume growth, Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below and other new settings. The development of frames on the simplex and on graphs is another aim of this project. The second core objective of this project is the development of adaptive representations in the framework of anisotropic dilations of the space. Anisotropic phenomena appear in various contexts in analysis, PDEs and in applications. For instance, functions are frequently very smooth on subdomains of Rd separated by smooth curves or manifolds. This project aims at resolving this kind of singularities of functions (and more general singular behaviors) by utilizing the framework of anisotropic multiscale dilations of d-dimensional space or its subdomain, which may change rapidly from point to point at any level and in depth. The main strands of this approach are (i) the development of algorithms for rapid construction of best or near best dilation matrices leading to optimal sparsity, (ii) the construction of highly localized anisotropic frames and their utilization to representation and approximation of functions.<br/><br/>Many scientific areas require efficient representation of the underlying functions in the natural topology of the targeted application. The capturing of physical phenomena occurring at various scales requires locally supported multiscale systems relative to the application domains. Moreover, these systems should be amenable to fast and accurate computation. Such systems (called needlets) have been recently developed by the investigator and his collaborators for the sphere and the ball. The needlets are the outcome of a complete rethinking of data representations in the context of classical orthogonal and spectral representations and break new conceptual and practical ground, going far beyond traditional multiscale ideas like wavelets. Spherical needlets have already had a significant impact in cosmology/astrophysics for the statistical study of the cosmic microwave background radiation data. This award will support the development of image and data processing techniques, which will lead to much novel representation systems in new mathematical settings, allowing the treatment of new data structures. It will also enhance our fundamental understanding of complicated processes through the development of innovative adaptive methods for efficient (sparse) representation and approximation of geometrical objects that have jumps or other sharp transitions along curves or surfaces. It has the potential to impact many areas ranging from image processing and edge detection to geopotential, oceanographic and atmospheric modeling, and to physics and cosmology."

Because of their physical importance and challenging mathematical nature there is a very extensive literature on such equations. However, many problems connected with the nonlinearity of the equation remain open, particularly when the drift velocity U is nonlocal. This project addresses some of these questions with particular emphasis on examples where the operator M that encodes the physics of the problem relating U to the active scalar is singular and unbounded. It is proposed to study the interplay of diffusive effects and the nonlinearity in singular active scalar equations for a range of fractional powers of the Laplacian. For certain powers it will be shown that the system is nonlinearly unstable: for lower powers the system is Lipschitz ill-posed. These results will be obtained via the construction of unstable eigenvalues for the evolution equation linearised about an appropriate equilibrium. Techniques of continued fractions will be employed to produce an explicit lower bound on the growth rate of the unstable eigenvalues as a function of the physical parameters. The project will also study the highly singular limit of vanishing  diffusivity. This limit is often physically appropriate and may be closely connected with turbulent phenomena modeled by weak solutions of the active scalar equations. The project addresses general classes of active scalar equations: particular physical examples include the incompressible porous media equation and the magnetogeostrophic equation. In both examples the Fourier multiplier symbol for the relevant operator M is even with respect to the wave number vector. This prevents certain cancellations in energy estimates arising in the nonlinearity. Hence the problem is more subtle than some frequently studied equations, such as the surface quasigeostrophic equation, where the analogous Fourier multiplier symbol is odd and commutator estimates can be employed.<br/><br/>The mathematical study of the partial differential equations that model fluid motion forms an essential foundation for many applications. These equations are highly complex and challenging.  A subset of these equations are so-called ""active scalar equations"" where the evolution in time of a scalar quantity such as the density of the fluid is governed by the motion of the fluid where the velocity itself varies with this scalar field. This feedback produces an intricate nonlinearity. Friedlander uses techniques of ""hard"" analysis to study general classes of such equations. A particular example is a model for the geodynamo. This is the process by which the Earth's magnetic field is created and sustained through the motion of the fluid core which is composed of a rapidly rotating, density stratified, electrically conducting fluid. Friedlander will prove that the model can indeed produce dynamo action by demonstrating the existence of a strong instability whose growth rate can be bounded from below by an explicit expression that depends on the physical parameters of the Earth's fluid core."

For finite random samples, methods such as maximum likelihood estimation and cumulative sum (CUSUM) sequential rules are known to be optimal for dealing with the two previously mentioned problems. Although one expects that optimality would be preserved when the time span between consecutive observations of a Levy process shrinks to zero, there exist important examples showing this not always to be the case. The mystery behind these counterintuitive results is closely connected to the ""fine"" distributional properties of Levy processes in short time. Rather than directly attacking the two proposed problems in continuous time, the investigator builds on the well-studied analogous problems in discrete time and fill in the infinite time continuum by analyzing their evolution when the time span between consecutive observations is made increasingly small. This bottom-up approach is not only appealing but also useful since in practice one would like to determine the performance of statistical methods for high-frequency observations rather than for continuous-time observations, which are arguably never available. The focus on Levy processes is motivated by the fact that the latter are the simplest stochastic models displaying abrupt changes while still preserving the parsimonious statistical properties of their increments. Extensions to other multi-factor stochastic models driven by Levy processes are also contemplated. <br/><br/>Automatic high-frequency monitoring systems of natural and social phenomena are increasingly used in engineering applications, financial markets, and environmental studies. Therefore, there is an increasing need for efficient and accurate statistical and computational methods for the high-frequency data generated by these systems. Two important issues arise with this need: understanding the meaning of statistical efficiency in a high-frequency sampling setting and analyzing the optimality of some of the commonly used statistical methods when applied to high-frequency data. The undertaken research responds to these two pressing problems. The project's outcomes have important applications in pricing of financial derivatives, calibration of financial models, monitoring of navigation system, intrusion detection in computer networks, and more. Educational impacts include providing summer research experiences for undergraduates and developing teaching/computational resources for interdisciplinary topics in statistics, probability, and mathematical finance.

The major goal of the project is the development of new techniques to achieve breakthroughs in our understanding of fluid dynamics phenomena. The project research will address fundamental properties of the classical equations of fluid dynamics, qualitative properties of solutions, and modeling applications. The project focuses on three main directions. The first set of problems concerns global regularity vs finite time blow up that will be investigated for a range of fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. Axi-symmetric solutions for 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes will be considered, new potentially singular scenarios will be studied and new regularity criteria will be sought. Active scalars, such as surface quasi-geostrophic equation coming from atmospheric science, will also be analyzed -- here the effort will concentrate on studying properties of solutions, search for new Lyapunov functionals and novel regularity estimates. In the second direction, we will seek more detailed information on long time dynamics. This will include research on some long-open conjectures for 2D Euler equation, including possible mechanisms of inverse energy cascade, mixing and small scales formation. We will also work on passive scalar models and mixing properties of flows in this context. Biomixing by chemotaxis will be investigated as well, with an eye towards applications in ecology and marine biology. The third direction focuses on complex fluid models. In many applications - for instance, in studies of particle suspensions or solutions - the microscopic structure of   particles in the fluid becomes important. The shape and interactions between the particles can be taken into account by adding kinetic equations to the fluid dynamics systems and introducing physically natural couplings. Analysis of solutions to such systems, their regularity and qualitative properties will be a part of the project work.<br/><br/>Fluids are ubiquitous in nature, science and engineering. Diverse phenomena involving fluids appear in atmospheric and ocean science, astrophysics, chemistry and biology, and are described by partial differential equations of fluid mechanics. These equations are some of  <br/>the most difficult partial differential equations to analyze. They   describe a wide range of complex phenomena, are nonlinear, and usually   nonlocal. Due to their complexity, even the classical equations such   as 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes are far from well understood. The   proposed research lies at the interface of several central areas of mathematics - partial differential equations, dynamical systems, functional analysis and Fourier analysis. This FRG project   brings together several researchers that have been at the forefront of recent developments in mathematical fluid mechanics. Different   participants bring different strengths to the project. It is expected that intensive collaboration within FRG framework will lead to   development of new ideas and approaches and result in a burst of activity in mathematics of fluids. New techniques and tools developed   are likely to have an impact in neighboring areas of mathematics,  biology, and atmospheric science. An important part of the FRG   activity will be training of junior researchers.  Mathematics of fluid  mechanics covers a broad range of effective techniques, which are   applicable beyond fluids. The training activities will include a   summer school, two workshops, group meetings, course development,   research seminars and research projects for advanced undergraduate   students.

The exact fully nonlinear equations governing the fluid flows will be used. The  project includes three problems.The first one is to study the nonlinear stability of solitary waves on water with zero surface tension, based upon recent breakthrough on the linear asymptotic stability. The second problem intends to give a rigorous proof on the existence of multi-hump (or multi-solitary) waves for water with small surface tension, since such waves have been observed in experiments and derived using model equations. The third problem deals with the existence of three-dimensional waves bifurcating from two-dimensional solitary waves (also called dimension-breaking bifurcation) on water with small surface tension, which may confirm the phenomena observed from many large-scale experiments. Here, the main thrust is to use the exact equations, rather than approximate equations,to study the waves on water of finite depth. An interplay of the theories in fluid dynamics and applied analysis will be essential to this research.<br/><br/>The mathematical theory of wave motions on a free surface over a body of water is a fascinating subject, with a long history in both applied and pure mathematical research, and with a continuing relevance to the enterprises of mankind having to do with rivers and oceans. Numerous observations in the real world, such as waves generated by boats in lakes or ships in oceans, have been studied experimentally, numerically,and mathematically. The mathematical study on the existence and stability of these surface waves is one of the important and difficult research subjects in this area. In particular, experiments and observations have confirmed that single-hump waves (called solitary waves) propagating along a channel or an open sea have a remarkable property of permanence. Yet, the stability of such waves remains an unsolved problem mathematically. Although multi-hump waves or three-dimensional waves bifurcating from two dimensional waves have been observed in many experiments, mathematical research on these waves is still lagging behind. The goal of proposed research is to make some significant mathematical advances on these problems. The research may have potential impact on many scientific research in mathematics, physics and engineering that involve fluid interfaces and wave propagation and interactions. For example, the theory may provide helpful forecasts and useful information on the propagation of tsunami waves in oceans caused by earthquakes, the prevention of giant waves generated from fast ferries that have been blamed for many boat accidents, and the properties of waves induced by storms or hurricanes in oceans which may cause tremendous damage to offshore oil rigs or marine structures."

They consider problems in three areas.  The first is mathematical modeling for financial risk management, with application to hedging, valuation, and management of counterparty credit risk (CCR).  Here they develop mathematical tools for evaluating and managing counterparty risk embedded in a large variety of over-the-counter contracts.  The valuation and hedging of CCR in credit default swaps and interest rate swaps, which are essential for the financial industry, are studied and new analytical tools are developed for this purpose.  The second area involves applications of stochastic analysis to investigation of dependence between Feller-Markov processes.

The third area deals with mathematical modeling of dynamic performance assessment indices with applications to conic finance.  New applications of convex analysis, probability, and L0-module theory are developed to study dynamic Performance Assessment Indices.  Dynamic performance assessment indices are measures of performances of a given activity in a random environment.  They apply this theory to conic finance for the purpose of computing acceptable bounds for arbitrage-free bid and ask prices in illiquid markets. <br/><br/>     The investigator and his colleague develop methods to analyze and manage risk in financial markets.  By viewing markets as stochastic systems whose behavior changes in time, they can bring to bear concepts from dynamical systems, probability, and stochastic systems.  They aim to take into account the provisions of recent legislation, such as the Dodd-Frank act of 2011, and the provisions of the Basel III regulations.  Outcomes of the project contribute to increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of financial institutions (both government and private), by effectively controlling the counterparty risk and, by extension, the systemic risk in financial markets.  The study of dynamic performance measures and assessment indices in particular provides new tools beyond the classical Value at Risk or Sharpe Ratio for measuring the risk and performance of a given financial institution (or portfolio).  Results are useful for market participants, including regulators and government agencies.

The former provides useful settings to study gravity currents, entrainment into the ocean's mixed layer and circulations such as those associated with the sea-breeze, coastal upwelling and the Hadley cells of tropical convection. The latter provides a sophisticated mathematical scenario to answer questions about the formation of mixed layers and their re-stratification, and the mechanisms behind the creation of staircase stratification profiles.<br/><br/>In its geophysical applications, this award will enhance our understanding of mixing and overturning circulations at many scales, including the storm-driven entrainment of water from the thermocline into the ocean's mixed layer and the elucidation of the leading factors determining the extent of the tropics.  This is particularly relevant, as there has been substantial recent interest in determining whether, under global warming scenarios, the Hadley cells would expand, yielding climatic changes such as higher-latitude desertification. If a model proposed here is correct, the extent of the cells is due to the trapping of diurnal waves by the Coriolis effect, which makes such an expansion much less plausible. On the mathematical side, new problems in partial differential equations will be addressed, including non-standard systems of conservation laws and shocks and vertical discontinuities in continuously stratified media.

Advances in experimental imaging, computational methods, and dynamical systems theory suggest a way to bridge this gap and make a fundamental breakthrough in our understanding of turbulence.  It has recently been discovered that recurrent coherent structures observed in wall-bounded shear flows (such as pipes and boundary layers) result from close passes to weakly unstable invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.  These 3D, fully nonlinear solutions (equilibria, traveling waves, and periodic orbits) structure the state space of turbulent flows and provide a skeleton for analyzing their dynamics.  The investigator calculates a hierarchy of invariant solutions for a canonical wall-bounded shear flow and uses these solutions to develop a geometrical and quantitative description of the flow's turbulent dynamics.  He uses a combination of novel and proven numerical and analytical techniques, such as periodic orbit theory, group representation theory, nonlinear search methods, variational solvers, and computational fluid dynamics.  The project is conducted with collaborators in Japan, Germany, the UK, and the US, and all results and numerical software are disseminated through the investigator's collaborative e-book www.ChaosBook.org. <br/><br/>     Turbulence is not only the great unsolved fundamental problem of classical physics, but a problem of great practical importance for technology and engineering, where turbulence is exhibited by cardiac systems, electromagnetic plasmas, oceans, and the atmosphere.  A mathematical description of turbulent phenomena is of necessity high-dimensional, and accurate prediction requires solving millions of equations.  Modern advances in computation and experimental data analysis have brought such computations within reach.  Even more recent is the discovery of ""recurrent coherent structures,"" whorls that one observes over and over in structures such as clouds.  Such structures enable us to classify types of turbulent states in a mathematically precise manner and to predict their evolution without resorting to further large-scale computations.  The project aims to deploy these ""coherent structures"" as a platform from which to chart the extremely high-dimensional world of all possible turbulent states, create an atlas over the important ones, and give a detailed predictive (as opposed to statistical) description of turbulent motions.  Any progress in fundamental understanding of turbulence affects applications that range from the suppression of plasma instabilities in magnetic confinement fusion reactors, to weather prediction, to the key challenge of reducing turbulent drag.  Even an incremental reduction of, for instance, turbulent drag by insights so achieved might have a significant economic impact, because drag is responsible for a significant part of the fuel consumed in transportation."

There has been significant attention in the scientific community in the last few years on invisibility for electromagnetic and other types of waves. The main goal of this project is to develop and analyze practical cloaking schemes under various circumstances, and to understand the cloaking phenomena. The main tools used are analysis and computation. Specifically, the proposed research will be devoted to the following four problems. The first one is to study the regularized approximate cloaking for the full system of Maxwell's equations via the transformation optics approach. Sharp estimates will be derived in assessing cloaking performances under various practical circumstances. The second problem is on the design and analysis of novel cloaking schemes including partial cloaking and on the implementation of isotropic cloaking medium obtained by inverse-homogenization theory. The third problem is to understand the invisibility cloaking from an optimization viewpoint by minimizing the scattering of the waves. This will also gives clues to what is the borderline between visibility and invisibility. The final problem is to develop effective and efficient numerical methods to numerically study cloaking. These problems present interesting challenges from both the analytical and computational points of view.<br/><br/>Research on invisibility cloaking has the potential for many civil and industrial applications, such as in medical surgery, wireless communications, air flight and space exploration etc. However, it presents many challenges both theoretically and in practical implementation due to the singular and unstable structures of the suggested blueprints for cloaking. The solution of the proposed problems would provide theoretical recipes for the construction of practical cloaking devices. Moreover, the mathematical understanding of invisibility cloaking will on the one hand offer a different way than the transformation-optics approach to achieve cloaking, and on the other hand provide important implications for inverse problems involving reconstructing electromagnetic objects. The analytical and computational techniques developed in this project are widely applicable to other electromagnetic phenomena. Some of the ideas developed in this project will be included into a graduate level class. The proposer also plans to advice and train graduate students in this challenging field."

Each problem is relevant to applications in the manufacture, design and use of NLC-based displays, where a thin sandwich of NLC between plates is subjected to an applied field, to control the molecular orientation of the NLC, which in turn controls the optical properties.  In free-surface spreading of a film of NLC over a rigid substrate, it is known that instabilities can manifest spontaneously under certain circumstances.  A mechanism for these instabilities has been identified, but several issues remain to be resolved.  (i) Any model with strong anchoring conditions on the director at both substrate and free surface requires regularization as an apparent contact line is approached.  The investigators will study possible regularizing mechanisms, including relaxation to the isotropic state, and molecular scale van der Waals' (vdW) interactions (which must be relevant in the vicinity of an apparent contact line).  (ii) The role of different defect/disclination types on spreading and stability will be considered in detail.  Preliminary study of idealized defects within 2D films suggests that they do not significantly affect global dynamics.  However, more general models are needed to draw firm conclusions.  3D defects of various topological types will be incorporated into our spreading model and their influence on spreading properties and on possible instabilities will be analyzed.  (iii) The models will be extended to the case of spreading over soft polymer substrates. The behavior of NLC between confining polymeric plates is relevant for applications related to a new generation of Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) devices with soft flexible bounding surfaces.  How such surfaces affect device behavior will be studied, with a particular focus on the effect of 'director gliding', where anchoring properties at a polymer interface can change over long timescales when the NLC exerts a stress on the surface.  These models will be used to investigate suitable LCD device designs.<br/><br/>The award will support the study of problems that are directly relevant to the manufacture, design and use of Nematic Liquid Crystal (NLC)-based microdisplays.  The basic operating unit of such displays (a pixel) is a simple sandwich of NLC between transparent plates, across which an electric field can be applied to effectively control the optical properties of the layer. The investigators will study basic problems of how NLC films behave between two closely-spaced polymeric surfaces. Such polymeric surfaces have economic potential as the basis for a new generation of flexible electronic displays.  The award will support theoretical investigations, leading to the development of robust predictive models, that complement experimental investigations. The project will have significant educational impact, providing experimental and theoretical modules for advanced undergraduate training in a capstone course in applied mathematics. A Ph.D. student will be trained in research and will also serve as laboratory assistant for the capstone course, gaining valuable mentoring experience and developing his/her experimental skills."

Such problems arise in applications involving processes with small relative correlation length or large number of random parameters, and for time-dependent nonlinear systems subject to uncertainty. The new equations are formulated in terms of the time-evolution of the joint probability density function (PDF) between the system's response and the stochastic excitation. In particular, functional integral methods are employed to determine new types of linear deterministic partial differential equations satisfied by the joint response-excitation PDF associated with the stochastic solution of nonlinear stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations. So far the theory is complete for nonlinear and for quasilinear first-order stochastic PDEs subject to random boundary conditions, random initial conditions or random forcing terms. For higher-order equations, such the stochastic wave equation or the Oberbeck-Boussinesq thermal convection equations, it is proposed  to develop a new PDF method based on differential constraints for the PDF of the solution. It is proposed to investigate the theoretical and numerical effectiveness of this new approach for high-dimensional random systems, such as random flows subject to high-dimensional random boundary or initial conditions in bounded domains.<br/><br/>Stochastic modeling and uncertainty quantification are important new directions in computational mathematics that will enable accurate predictions of physical and biological phenomena,in critical applications such as climate, energy and the design of new products.  The proposed work will have significant and broad impact as it will set new rigorous foundations in uncertainty quantification, data assimilation and sensitivity analysis for many physical and biological systems. It will affect fundamentally the way we design new experiments and the type of questions that we can address, while the interaction between simulation and experiment will become more meaningful and more dynamic.

The reason for this requirement is that, according to the classical theory, image reconstruction from truncated CT data (the so-called ""interior problem"") is non-unique. As a consequence, many aspects of truncated data inversion have not been studied in literature. In this project the PIs will theoretically analyze the problem of image reconstruction from truncated data with minimal prior knowledge. Both transmission CT and emission tomography (SPECT) with constant attenuation will be addressed. The PIs will study the questions of stability of the reconstructions in 2D and 3D, characterize the null-space of an integral transform arising in the interior problem, and analyze eigenfunctions of certain singular Sturm-Liouville problems. The PIs will also develop efficient algorithms for numerical solution of the interior problem. These algorithms will be implemented and tested using both simulated and real data. <br/><br/>At present, interior tomography is at the cusp of being directly applicable in general medical imaging diagnostics. The confluence of theoretical, algorithmic, computational, and technological advances gives the PIs hope that interior tomography can move from the ""drawing boards"" to practical medical imaging in the not so distant future. While there are still some open research problems, the results obtained recently show that the problems can be solved with a fairly high degree of confidence. If successful, this study will provide theoretically justified and practically applicable two and three-dimensional reconstruction algorithms for imaging a region of interest inside an object (e.g., the patient) from truncated data. The broader impact of the proposed research lies in the promise it holds for improvements in the practice of clinical medicine and biomedical science generally, as well as for industrial non-destructive testing. The most direct benefit is the reduction in the x-ray dose to the patient; other benefits include less expensive scanners, improved temporal resolution, increased scanner throughput, capability of imaging larger objects, reduced system cost, etc."

The dynamics exhibit highly disordered behavior, with long-ranged statistical correlations observed in direct numerical simulations. Yet most theoretical work has been based on deterministic methods such as mean field theories for the effective behavior. The primary goal of the supported work is to incorporate the role of noise in the dynamics into a systematic statistical theory for the effective dynamics of the interacting microswimmers. Two central issues to be addressed are: (1) a rational framework for parameterizing the noise of a sampled swimmer in a self-consistent statistical field theory, and (2) the incorporation of correlations between microswimmers in an effective statistical field theory.<br/><br/>Many complex systems use interactions or communication to produce an emergent behavior of the group. A key goal is to better understand how those interactions can change the effective dynamics of the individuals, and thereby the group. Examples include wide varieties of swarms of insects, colonies of bacteria, flocks of birds, herds of animals, as well as engineered systems such as autonomous robotic devices which communicate information and status to each other in pursuit of a goal or target. These applications involve not only the interaction of a large number of agents, but also typically noise in the environment, motion, and/or communication.  This grant supports research on a model system of suspensions of swimming microorganisms (microswimmers) which has the virtue of incorporating these central issues in a system where the governing dynamics have a clearly defined physical basis. This facilitates the development of the mathematical technology regarding the effective behavior of a group of nonlinearly interacting agents with noisy features. The research is also coupled with efforts on education and outreach. The supported graduate student will be co-mentored by the interdisciplinary team of PIs, exposing him or her to advanced mathematical methods, high quality computational simulations, and practical engineering applications.

Tomography techniques are also extensively used for industrial non-destructive testing, in geology and geophysics, astronomy, and in other areas. Lately, they have found important applications in homeland security. Over the last decades, several modalities have been developed and have became standard. Such are, for instance, the traditional X-ray CT scan, SPECT, MRI, Optical-, Ultrasound-, and Electrical Impedance Tomography, to name a few. However, such tasks as detection of small cancerous tumors in soft tissues or finding a small amount of nuclear material in a large container still present a significant challenge.  In recent years, revolutionary ""hybrid"" or ""multi-physics"" methods of medical imaging have been emerging. By combining two or three different types of waves (or physical fields) these methods overcome limitations of classical tomography techniques and deliver otherwise unavailable, potentially life-saving diagnostic information - at a lesser cost and with less health hazard to a patient. As a rule, the images in these modalities are obtained by complex mathematical procedures, rather than through direct acquisition. The corresponding mathematics is, mostly, at very early stages of development. Thus, the first part of the project addresses the central mathematical and numerical issues in several of the novel hybrid techniques, based on combinations of magnetic, electric, acoustic, and optical waves, and the general mathematical issues common to all of these techniques.      The second part of the projects is directed toward the improvement of the known methods and development of new tomographic techniques for homeland security problems. In particular, we will focus on the detection techniques for illicit weapons-grade nuclear materials in cargo, to be used at border crossings and harbors. In the third part these techniques will be used to resolve some outstanding problems in Synthetic Aperture Radar applications, radio tomography, ultrasound reflectometry, and other areas.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop new techniques of medical imaging, as well as efficient methods of detecting illicit nuclear materials at border crossings and in harbors.

The results will be disseminated through publications in high quality research journals, presentations at national and international conferences, and series of lectures at various venues. Graduate students will play a significant role in the project, which will prepare them for work in the exciting area at the junction of exact sciences, medicine, biology, and homeland security.

We allow for asynchronous dynamics (no global clock); specifically, nodes of the network may not be updated synchronously (at each time step). Of special interest is the further development of a very promising Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) network architecture that combines randomness (coming from node dynamics) with a loose (sloppy) asynchronous logic.  Overall, the research will use mathematical techniques developed in the study of statistical properties of dynamical systems with the mathematics of network dynamics and be guided by numerical simulation and experimentation.<br/><br/>Many physical, electrical and biological systems can be modeled by networks of interacting differential equations and maps. The most realistic models allow for randomness, discontinuity, time delays and asynchrony - there may be no global clock and so the nodes of the network may not be updated synchronously (by way of contrast, the motion of the planets round the sun is synchronous: all the planets continually move and interact, via gravity, with all the other planets).  Asynchrony is a characteristic feature of much recent technology as well as of complex biological systems, such as the brain.  The project will develop new models for network dynamics that involve a mix of random, asynchronous and deterministic dynamics. As part of the work, it is proposed to refine and develop existing novel visualization tools with the aim of identifying key dynamical features in complex network dynamics, such as patterns of synchronization in large networks.  Of great potential significance in applications is the development of new adaptive methods for high speed pattern recognition and learning."

This award will support (1) the exploration of the underlying integrable structure of ASEP using spectral methods, (2) the generalization of ASEP to multi-species where there are now second-class, third-class, etc. particles, and (3) ASEP on the half-line.  The integrable structure referred to commonly goes under the name ``Bethe Ansatz''; and in (3) this project will support the analysis of the new structures required in restricting to a half-line.  (Here the familiar sum over permutations in Bethe Ansatz is replaced by a sum over signed permutations.) A closely related model is the quantum spin model called the Heisenberg-Ising model.  This project will support the analysis of the domain wall problem in the Heisenberg-Ising chain.  A long-term goal of this project is the study of limit laws and their universality in these various models.<br/><br/>The Gaussian distribution (the familiar bell-shaped curve) is important because of its universality; that is, it applies to a wide variety of seemingly unrelated problems.  The underlying common theme for all these problems is the fact that the objects under study have some degree of ``independence'';  or stated in more physical terms, are non-interacting (or weakly interacting).  These types of problems are well-understood both physically and mathematically.  Current research involves processes which are strongly interacting; and as such, there is no satisfactory general theory as there exists for the non-interacting cases.  In the search for new universal laws, the ideas, methods and results of random matrix theory, interacting particle systems and their associated limit theorems; in particular, the Tracy-Widom (TW) distributions, have found an ever widening impact in science and engineering.  Since their initial discovery in random matrix theory, the TW distributions have been shown to describe the properties of a number of random systems including the fluctuations of a large class of growing interfaces and directed polymer systems.  These same TW distributions are now regularly used in multivariate statistical analysis where they have become a standard statistical tool for inferring population structure from genetic data.  Their use in engineering involving signal analysis and wireless communications is just beginning.  This project extends the scope of these theoretical investigations; and as such, will make available to a wider audience the resulting mathematical results."

There is a fundamental challenge to understand multiscale interactions between fine scales and coarse scales in clouds, from cloud droplets and turbulence (micrometers to meters) to turbulent updrafts (meters to kilometers). Both scales are of key importance in determining, for instance, how much solar radiation is reflected by clouds and how much (if any) precipitation is formed. To study these complex interactions, the principal investigator will employ multiscale asymptotic models and stochastic models, building on his previous work with these methodologies. Using multiscale asymptotic models, one of the questions of the project is the effect of the coarse-scale updrafts versus the intermediate-scale fluctuations from cloud pulses and thermals on  water transport from low altitudes to higher altitudes. Secondly, using stochastic modeling techniques in addition, the goal is to investigate relationships between aerosol and droplet-size distributions (fine scales) and cloud amount and lifetime (coarse scales). To model these processes across scales from micrometers to kilometers, the principal investigator will use stochastic models to represent the fine-scale interactions between turbulence and droplet evolution, and these fine-scale processes will then be coupled with the coarse-scale deterministic evolution of turbulent cloud updrafts.<br/><br/>This project will develop mathematical methods for the modeling of water and energy transport in clouds, which is of fundamental importance in weather prediction, climate science, and air pollution. At present, clouds are a primary source of uncertainty in projections of climate change, since it is still unclear whether increased cloud cover will cool the planet (due to increased reflection of incoming sunlight) or heat it (due to the capacity of clouds to store and redistribute thermal energy). In addition, clouds interact with aerosols and air pollution in various ways, influencing day to day local atmospheric phenomena. For both of these issues, the uncertain role of clouds is determined by the complex interplay of both cloud-scale properties (such as cloud amount and lifetime of a cloud) and smaller-scale properties (such as droplet size distribution and aerosol particles). The project will use modern mathematical techniques to shed light on these questions. Educational activities supported by this project will connect mathematics, cloud physics, and climate science, and they are aimed at high schools with a large percentage of students from underrepresented groups."

In a broader sense, LCs can be thought of as soft matter with orientational order, an emerging class of complex fluids. There are many experiments which show interesting flow phenomena in liquid crystals.  We focus on two of these, where vorticity, driven by external sources, creates material flow.  In the Janossy effect, dye molecules under photoexcitation in a liquid crystal host act as rotors of molecular motors, and generate vorticity and subsequent flow. In the Yokoyama-Tabe experiment, chiral molecules in a Langmuir monolayer are caused, by a transverse current of water vapor, to rotate and give rise to flow. This award will support work aimed at understanding such phenomena, where local torques, acting essentially as point sources of vorticity, give rise to macroscropic translation and flow.  The work will be carried out through an interdisciplinary collaboration involving applied mathematics and physics, with the goal of developing a sound mathematical model which is capable of predicting the dynamical behavior of orientationally ordered systems where flow plays an essential role; and building robust computational tools that will capture the essential features of the interplay between flow and microstructure. The mathematical model we propose has two important components. First, it is the use of the full orientational probability density function, rather than a few of its moments to characterize orientational order.  Second, the flow dynamics is included in the model. It is known that inhomogeneous flows play important roles in forming transient microstructures, thus the orientational state must be coupled with the macroscopic flow field. This will lay the framework for the study and design of other complex soft matter systems where flow and local vorticity play important roles. A novel aspect is the exploration of the effectiveness of peer mentoring by graduate students from applied mathematics and physics collaborating on this project.   <br/>  <br/>In the rapidly advancing field of materials science, complex fluids are emerging as an increasingly important class of materials.  They are capable of exhibiting a remarkably broad range of behavior in response to excitations, leading to a wide variety of applications.  This rich responsivity originates in physical processes which are made possible by complex internal structure.  Complex fluids range today from liquid crystals to micro- and nanocolloids, virus suspensions and active biofluids. A key component of many of these systems is orientational order of the constituents. Remarkable and unexpected behavior can result from the coupling between orientational order and translation; this includes rubber lasers and light driven plastic motors. This award will support work aimed at understanding such phenomena, with the goal of building computational tools to describe and to help to understand and utilize the responsible mechanisms. The broader impacts of the proposed work are the usefulness of the developed tools to the larger community in the design of photo-responsive soft matter, metamaterials for transformation optics and strategies for biological transport.  They include contributions to science and mathematics education at the graduate level. The two graduate students, one in applied mathematics and one in chemical physics, participating in this project will gain expertise in various aspects of this multifaceted work and will benefit from interactions with more senior members of the research team and each other.

One project is to develop a unified well-posedness framework for the Stefan problem in both presence and absence of surface tension. In the latter case, we will show how the regularity of the boundary is naturally tied to the norms weighted by the Neumann derivatives of the temperature. After obtaining the (singular) vanishing surface tension limit, we will understand the long-term non-linear behavior of initially small solutions in the absence of surface tension, combining the energy methods and  Harnack-type bounds to obtain sharp lower bounds for the time-decay of Neumann derivatives. We also focus on the dynamic instabilities arising in the Stefan problem with surface tension. In particular, we will try to rigorously describe the melting rates for the cavity-filling parabolic free-boundary flows, exploiting their connection to their natural scaling laws and developing robust energy techniques to perform the non-linear analysis.  Moreover, we will study the continuum limit behavior of the Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA), a probabilistic lattice model giving rise to various morphological patterns associated with the ill-posed nature of the Hele-Shaw problem with external injection. Finally, we will examine the dynamic stability of galaxies as described by the spherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov system, where the associated ADM-mass will be shown to be coercive on the set of measure preserving perturbations of galaxies with suitably small central red-shift, upon which we will investigate the full non-linear<br/>stability. <br/><br/>Free boundaries are ubiquitous in the description of various physical phenomena, such as melting, crystal growth, shocks, and nucleation. A detailed phenomenological understanding of instabilities, morphological changes, or stable regimes in such problems is thus of fundamental importance.The proposed investigation of the vanishing surface tension limit will establish a rigorous link between the micro-and the macro-scale version of the Stefan problem, while the study of long-term behavior of solutions will reveal an intricate stabilizing mechanism for parabolic phase transitions in absence of surface tension. The study of melting rates for the Stefan and Hele-Shaw problem aims at clarifying the link to their natural scaling invariances.  Moreover, inspired by the work of physicists Witten and Sander from 1980's, we will investigate the link between the lattice probabilistic evolution mentioned above, and its ill-posed continuum analog. DLA grows unstable patterns, that exhibit certain statistical universality typical of crystal growth---and it presents a challenge for a good continuum model description. The study of galaxy dynamics strives to rigorously confirm the stability scenario conjectured by the astrophysicist Zel'dovitch et al. back in the 1960's."

Such structures are characterized by a balance between energy input through suitable forcing and energy dissipation within the structure, and are common in many physical systems including fluids, nonlinear optics and reaction-diffusion equations. This proposal seeks to extend existing understanding of these structures to two and three spatial dimensions through mathematical analysis of global bifurcations in spatially reversible systems together with numerical continuation techniques. Systems with both variational and nonvariational structure will be studied, with a focus on understanding the growth and multiplicity of stationary or moving structures as parameters are varied.  Time-dependent localized structures will be studied through analysis of the bulk state and the motion of the front or boundary that confines it.  Collisions between moving structures and their trapping by external inhomogeneities will be investigated by direct numerical simulation. The results will be applied to several systems exhibiting thermally driven motion including binary fluid convection, doubly diffusive convection and rotating convection.<br/><br/>Spatially localized structures are common in physical systems. Familiar examples in fluids include localized convection, vortices, liquid drops and solitary waves. Additional examples are provided by spots in optical and chemical systems, localized buckling of slender structures under compression, pulses propagating along neural fibers and localized oscillations in vibrating granular media. Although these examples reach across many areas of the physical sciences the localized structures that appear have many properties in common. This proposal seeks to develop a mathematical understanding of the origin and properties of such structures focusing on changes that take place as the parameters of the system change, and aims to identify the properties that are shared by these different examples."

The first part of the project concerns the question of determining the internal properties of a medium by making electromagnetic (EM) measurements at the boundary. Challenging questions include recovering the shape information of electromagnetic inclusions and obstacles from boundary data, full reconstruction of EM parameters for an isotropic medium with incomplete boundary data, and the inverse problem for anisotropic media, where the unique reconstruction is possible only up to a change of variables. Such loss of uniqueness in the latter case leads to the second major topic of the project, namely, transformation-optics-based invisibility. The proposed study covers the regularized approximate electromagnetic cloaking scheme, whose limiting behavior provides important physical and mathematical implications for the singular structure required in an ideal cloaking design. The last part of the proposed project considers thermo-acoustic tomography (TAT), a hybrid medical imaging modality that combines low frequency electromagnetic waves with acoustic waves through the physical ""photo-acoustic' effect. In particular, the principal investigator plans to address the problem of reconstructing the electrical parameters and refractive indices of the medium from the internal absorbed radiation map. <br/><br/>The fundamental task of science is to probe the world around us. The most powerful tool to do this is to use waves (e.g., electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves, elastic waves), because waves can interact with different media in nonintrusive ways. Such nonintrusive investigation is greatly appreciated in many areas of science and technology, including medical imaging, geophysics, nondestructive testing, remote sensing, and so on. The fundamental mathematical theory behind such enhancement of ""visibility"" is the main topic of inverse problems, while another aspect is to hide an object from detection by waves, that is, to make it ""invisible."" The proposed project concerns both aspects, visibility and invisibility, for electromagnetic waves. For visibility, the proposer plans to develop mathematical techniques to address some of the challenging questions in inverse problems that will undoubtedly have real world applications in the future. For instance, the thermo-acoustic tomography (TAT) medical imaging modality has the potential to detect breast cancer cells at a much earlier stage than what is currently feasible. The development of mathematical theory of TAT will also shed light on a larger class of inverse problems with internal data such as PAT (photo-acoustic tomography), TE (transient elastography), UMT (ultrasound modulated electrical and optical impedance tomography), as well as other similar hybrid imaging modalities. The simultaneous improvement in contrast and resolution is the subject of intensive mathematical study and also of this project. As for invisibility, the development of ""meta-materials"" that have electromagnetic or acoustic properties not found in nature has inspired the transformation-optics based blueprint of the invisible cloak. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that invisibility is no longer just science fiction. This theoretical study seeks to understand and confront the difficulties under a realistic approximate scheme, which will benefit experimental endeavors. It provides an effective way to bridge the gap between reality and imagination that is still vast for current technology."

The goal is improved efficiency and performance and lower cost.  The physical system can be  described mathematically.  This project will develop numerical algorithms, computer software, and supporting mathematics that will enable scientists and engineers to take these mathematical descriptions and solve a number of  optimal control problems that they currently have great difficulty in solving. This will contribute to a number of areas of national need including more efficient industrial processes.  The initial areas of application of this research will be chemical processes, aerospace applications, and biomedical problems since those collaborations are already under way.  The long term impact is even wider than these areas since the need for increased efficiency and better performance is a driving need throughout science and technology.<br/> <br/><br/>Mathematical descriptions often involve differential equations.  Frequently there are physical or operational constraints on either the physical process or the means being used to control this process.  One of the more successful numerical approaches that is often used for complex optimal control problems is direct transcription where the problem is converted to a discrete problem  by various  programing techniques, and then iteratively solved on specially chosen refined grids until a high quality solution is found.  Direct transcription is a popular technique in industry.  Many challenging problems also have delays in either the state dynamics or the controls or both.  Delays can occur for several reasons including transmission delays, physical processes,  actuator delays, or human  operator induced delays.   State dependent delays are common in the chemical industry, for example.   These delays, to date, have posed challenges that have hindered the development of industrial grade direct transcription algorithms for the computation of the optimal solution of state and control constrained nonlinear systems with delays.  This  project will address this difficulty.  It is proposed to develop algorithms, efficient implementations, and supporting mathematical analysis for the direct transcription solution of state and control constrained optimal control problems with delays.  The proposed research will result in new algorithms and new theoretical understanding of numerical methods.  These types of algorithms tend to be very sophisticated.  Theory backed guidelines will be developed for both users and developers of these types of algorithms.  The proposed project will result in substantial advancement on a number of important problems in optimal control, the training of the next generation of researchers to work on these problems, and contributions to several areas of national need. Among the broad impacts are the  capability to more widely use constrained   mathematical descriptions  with delays which will permit easier simulation and optimization of a wide variety of physical systems resulting in reduced time needed for design and improved performance.  The implementation of the projects results into an industrial grade code will greatly hasten and broaden their impact across a number of industries."

The underlying theme of this proposal is the further development of a theoretical framework and body of mathematical results of these time-discrete dynamical systems over networks. The mathematics should be of interest in its own right, yet help advance applications involving discrete models and iterative computational algorithms. It will allow for better insight into validation aspects and general properties of algorithms from computational systems biology, which should lead to the construction of improved models and algorithms in this field and beyond. With the current developments in scientific computing and applications, this non-traditional area of applied mathematics is in a keen need of further advances. Moreover, the analysis and the results constitute natural underpinnings for the theory of stochastic GDSs, a construct of great interest to many application areas that is gaining popularity.<br/> <br/>The time-discrete dynamical systems over networks that the investigator studies arise in systems biology and scientific computing from gene networks, to data mining, to epidemiology. Not only are these systems popular as models, but many algorithms are built on top of these models. Such algorithms are frequently poorly understood, and algorithm validation is usually approached by way of numerical experiments that shed little light on the fundamental analytic properties of the algorithms. One basic question is how to relate the constituents of the system (e.g., function type, network structure, update mechanism) to the resulting dynamics, especially with regard to stability analysis. In this project, the investigator will primarily focus on two specific system aspects, function structure and update sequence. This effectively comes down to two classes of graph dynamical systems in which the investigator has expertise: (1) Boolean networks (synchronous), and (2) sequential dynamical systems (asynchronous). For each of these areas, the investigator has a specific plan for the theory to be developed, as well as a specific application from computational systems biology in mind. For this first area, the newly introduced concept of nested canalyzing depth of functions will be studied, and with the application of reverse engineering gene networks in mind. For the second area, the dependence on the update sequence and the initial states on the phase space structure will be studied, with the goal of using this to develop quantitative stability measures that can be applied to iterative algorithms such as gene annotative methods."

In a coordinate system that moves with the velocity of the wave, a traveling wave becomes a stationary solution.  This fact allows the stability of traveling waves to be studied by linearization. Thanks to recent work of Douglas Wright of Drexel University and Sabrina Selle of the University of Bielefeld, the stability of certain ""concatenated wave"" solutions -- solutions that look like one traveling wave at the left and another, with greater velocity, at the right -- can now be proved. However, their work views a concatenated wave solution as a sum of waves, an approach that does not seem to generalize to certain important situations. For example, if the common right state of the first wave and left state of the second wave is only marginally stable, the Wright-Selle approach expands this marginal stability, which should only be an issue in the center of the concatenated wave solution, to both ends. In this research project, such solutions are treated as concatenated waves rather than as sums of waves.  Here, analysis of stability starts with an approximate solution that consists of one wave at the left, another at the right, and an intermediate constant region where the approximate solution is the common right state of the first wave and left state of the second.  This project studies linearization at such an object using Laplace transforms, and the work aims to convert this sketch into a rigorous proof of nonlinear stability and to extend the approach to some important degenerate situations.<br/><br/>The proposed work is motivated in part by a familiar situation: if one lights a fuse in the middle, combustion fronts travel in both directions. A single combustion front is an example of a traveling wave: since it moves with a constant velocity, if one uses a coordinate system that moves with the same velocity, the wave is stationary. A traveling wave is called stable if a small perturbation of it has almost no effect; the wave quickly recovers its shape and continues with the same velocity.  Mathematically, the study of the stability of traveling waves is facilitated by using a coordinate system in which the wave is stationary.  There is a well-developed mathematical theory of the stability of traveling waves, which allows one to predict in advance what conditions will allow stable waves. However, when waves traveling with two different velocities are present (in the fuse example, one wave has negative velocity, the other has positive velocity), there is no convenient coordinate system to use, and so the mathematical theory of stability is much less developed.  In this project, the investigators will develop a rigorous approach to proving nonlinear stability of concatenated traveling waves that applies more broadly than the currently available theory. The work has potential application to study of traveling waves that occur in oil recovery methods and underground pollution cleanup."

Specifically, this award will support research in two interrelated areas: (1) development of more efficient numerical methods for characterizing the equilibrium orientational properties of liquid crystals in the large-scale regime (three space dimensions) and (2) refined analysis of the nature of the coupling between liquid crystal orientational order and electric fields.  The most commonly used models for liquid crystals at experimental and device scales are macroscopic continuum director models, which model local average orientation in terms of a unit-length vector field (the ""director field""). The principal investigator will use techniques from numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization (saddle point problems, nullspace methods, reduced Hessian methods, preconditioning) to develop efficient solvers that deal effectively with the pointwise unit-length constraint associated with discretizations of such models, for which current approaches are inadequate in large-scale settings.  Most liquid crystal devices and experiments utilize electric fields to control liquid crystal order, and the interaction between liquid crystal orientation and local electric field poses both numerical and analytical challenges (due to coupled equilibrium equations, free energies failing to be positive definite, and anomalous behavior of instability thresholds). The principal investigator will develop a variationally based, unified stability framework capable of providing computable local stability criteria for numerical solutions (in the discretized setting) and also capable of explaining anomalous instability thresholds (in the continuum setting).<br/><br/>Liquid crystal materials exist in a complex fluid phase that exhibits orientational order of molecular axes at the microscopic level, just like a crystal.  Virtually all of their material properties are anisotropic, that is, they are direction dependent (unlike ordinary liquids which look and behave the same in all directions).  The orientational properties can therefore be coupled to a variety of external fields (electromagnetic, optical, temperature gradients, acoustic waves, etc.). The well-known use of liquid crystals in optical displays makes use of this behavior. However, the special properties of these materials make them useful in a much wider range of technological applications, including also drug delivery systems, soft actuators, biosensors, and others.  Scientific computing is widely used in this area to optimize the performance of devices, to analyze experiments, and to validate the theory that is used to describe such devices.  This award will support the development of advanced computational techniques for the numerical exploration of equilibrium orientational properties of large, complicated, modern liquid crystal systems associated with realistic devices and experiments, especially those involving coupled electric fields.  Special attention is given to the nature of the coupling between the liquid crystal order and an applied electric field and to electric-field-induced instabilities of orientational order, which underlie the functioning of most devices and for which a deeper understanding is needed.  The research will be carried out in collaboration with interdisciplinary and international partners, and it will impact applications and technologies using liquid crystals through improved performance analysis tools and techniques for interpreting experiments.  The impact is expected to extend to the numerical modeling of ferromagnetic materials such as magnetic films used in hard drives, where models with similar features arise."

The project extends their recent results regarding existence and locality of energy cascades, and anomalous dissipation in physical scales of the flow.  The main goals are, on one hand, to present Onsager-critical Morrey-type conditions preventing anomalous dissipation in 3D incompressible flows and to discover a set of universal scaling laws -- reminiscent of the fundamental Kolmogorov K41 laws -- that naturally transpire from their theory of turbulent cascades in physical scales, and on the other hand, to present mathematical evidence of a geometric scenario closing the scaling gap in the regularity problem, that is, of the criticality of the 3D NSE problem for large data.  The key idea is to use a new ensemble-averaging process capable of detecting significant sign fluctuations of the physical density of interest at the given scale.  This approach is highly local in space and is applicable to flows that do not satisfy homogeneity and isotropy assumptions.  In addition, it provides a framework for the study of geometrically coherent structures in physical space. <br/><br/>     In 2000, the Clay Mathematical Institute identified seven ""Millennium Problems"" in mathematics, solutions to which would have a broad impact on society in the 21st century.  One of these problems is the task of providing a rigorous mathematical foundation (namely, addressing the possibilities of singularity formations) for the Navier-Stokes equations that describe the motion of fluids.  Existence of singularities is a fundamental issue for mathematical modeling of any real-life phenomenon.  In the case of Navier-Stokes equations this regularity problem is believed to be linked with the notion of turbulence.  Despite successes in empirical modeling and computational techniques used to study turbulence, this phenomenon remains one of the unresolved fundamental problems of modern physics.  Any measurable progress in understanding turbulence can have a broad impact in such areas as weather and climate modeling and engineering applications.  On one hand, suppressing turbulence is essential in designing and engineering more efficient vehicles, wind turbines, pipeline systems.  On the other hand, enhancing turbulent mixing is desired in a variety of nano-scale engineering designs, as well as in biomedical engineering -- one example being more efficient drug delivery systems.  The project helps advance understanding of how to better predict and detect turbulent behavior, as well as possibly control it.  The investigators engage graduate and undergraduate students in the project and present lectures on turbulence to local high school students."

This project attacks that deficit through ""structure"":  not in the traditional explicit computational sense, but rather in the sense of intrinsic geometry.  The investigator studies two overlapping mathematical strategies.  The first uses semi-algebraic geometry as a rich and natural model for the world of concrete optimization problems.  In that world, much of the technicality and pathology obscuring variational analysis for practitioners is transformed, leaving powerful stratification tools and simple access to ""generic"" properties in optimization.  The second strategy emphasizes partial smoothness, a powerful geometric property originating from the theory of optimality conditions and sensitivity analysis, but also in perfect resonance with active-set algorithms.  With these theoretical tools at hand, the investigator focuses foremost on two fresh and promising computational methods for nonsmooth optimization.  The first is, counter-intuitively, just the classical BFGS method for smooth optimization, mildly adjusted for the nonsmooth world.  BFGS is simple, intuitive, general-purpose, much easier to implement successfully than traditional ""bundle"" methods, and broadly effective in practical applications, notably in robust control.  Mysteriously, BFGS always (essentially) seems to converge linearly and to identify partly smooth structure.  The investigator seeks explanations.  The second focal computational method is a proximal algorithm for composite optimization that is simple, versatile, and, in contrast with BFGS, well-grounded theoretically.  This algorithm has proved successful on huge problems, such as compressed sensing, but is potentially slow.  Partial smoothness will strengthen convergence in theory, and speed it in practice.<br/><br/>The broader significance and importance of this project derive from the investigator's transformative goal of bridging the gulf between mathematical theory and data-driven practice in resource allocation problems beyond the reach of traditional calculus.  A particularly important example is the kind of robust control engineering underlying applications like modern aircraft electronics.  The investigator builds on a strong track-record of high-calibre publications, innovative scholarship and outreach, and intellectual leadership.  PhD students based in Cornell's highly ranked School of ORIE (where the investigator is Director) will engage all aspects of the project, publishing and presenting at professional meetings;  the investigator will engage more broadly through seminars and his award-winning teaching, as well as through graduate texts, survey articles, multidisciplinary collaboration, and prominent international lectures to broad scientific and engineering audiences."

These waves can be subsonic, supersonic or transonic; the PI aims to characterize all possible wave patterns, completing a partial list obtained by Fan, Lin and Wechselberger. The proposal also studies some related problems: phase transition and chemical reaction waves in porous media, stability of KPP-type waves in large bounded domains, multi-front wave patterns described by a concatenation of simple traveling waves, and numerical methods for computing traveling waves.<br/><br/>The main goal of this proposal is to study the liquid-vapor phase transition in liquid aerosols, suspensions of fine liquid droplets in a gas, such as the gasoline-air mixture in the fuel injection nozzle of a combustion engine cylinder.  The PI will investigate evaporation waves in conical nozzles as models of evaporation of fuel in injection nozzles of gasoline engines. Understanding the parameter regime for the existence and stability of such waves is important, and can help achieve a well-mixed fuel and air ratio before ignition, which in turn will help improve the fuel efficiency of the engine and reduce emission of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into the environment.  In addition, the PI will study some related problems on phase transition that have applications to fuel cell batteries and oil recovery processes."

A central configuration is a special set of positions where the force on each body due to gravity points in the opposite direction of that body's position vector (with respect to the center of mass).  Finding a central configuration involves solving a complicated system of nonlinear algebraic equations.  Central configurations are important since they lead to families of homographic and homothetic solutions in both the N-body and N-vortex problems.  Specific aims of the project include classifying five-body co-circular central configurations, studying relative equilibria in the four and five-vortex problems, using symmetry to simplify the study of central configurations for special choices of the masses, analyzing the linear stability of the corresponding relative equilibria, and describing certain symmetric families of solutions. These topics will be explored using a combination of analysis and modern and computational algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>The N-body problem concerns the motion of celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, even spaceships) interacting under their mutual gravitational attraction. Although inherently a mathematical discipline, applications to astronomy and spacecraft transport are plentiful.  For example, the recent astronomical discovery of an asteroid at a ``Trojan point'' in the Earth-Sun system came centuries after the mathematical work of Lagrange on three-body central configurations.  The N-vortex problem is a widely used model for understanding vorticity evolution in fluid dynamics. Some of the most important types of solutions in these problems are periodic in nature, returning to their initial configuration after some fixed amount of time.  Among this class of solutions are simple, rigidly rotating orbits, known as relative equilibria, where the size and shape of the configuration is unchanged throughout the motion.  Locating a relative equilibrium requires first finding a central configuration. Analyzing the structure and stability of relative equilibria leads to a greater understanding of the complexities in the full problem.  In celestial mechanics this study is useful for plotting spacecraft trajectories and for discovering inexpensive methods of exploring space. In addition, locating stable solutions provides key information about the orbits astronomers and other researchers expect to see in the universe. An important priority of the project is to mentor, support and collaborate with undergraduate researchers interested in the field."
