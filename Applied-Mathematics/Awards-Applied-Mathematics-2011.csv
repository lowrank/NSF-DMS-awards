"1108694","Collaborative research: Topics related to the solitary waves of the KP equation and physical applications","DMS","APPLIED MATHEMATICS","07/01/2011","06/09/2011","Sarbarish Chakravarty","CO","University of Colorado at Colorado Springs","Standard Grant","Henry Warchall","06/30/2016","$142,621.00","","chuck@math.uccs.edu","1420 AUSTIN BLUFFS PKWY","COLORADO SPRINGS","CO","809183733","7192553153","MPS","1266","9229","$0.00","This collaborative proposal concerns the investigation of nonlinear, dispersive wave phenomena described by the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and its physical applications, particularly in two-dimensional shallow water waves. The KP equation admits a particular solution called line-soliton, which is a steady propagating wave with high amplitude, like a beach wave. Broadly speaking, the project has two main goals that are interrelated, namely, (i) to study combinatorial and geometric aspects of the solution space of the KP solitons, and (ii) to develop an asymptotic theory where the KP equation as the leading order equation for real applications in two-dimensional wave phenomena. Detailed analytical and numerical studies of the interactions, stability and initial value problem of the KP solitons will be carried out in this project. The theoretical results will be carefully compared with experimental measurements. <br/><br/>Preliminary work suggests that some of these newly discovered solutions of the KP equation may have important physical applications such as the Mach reflection of an oblique incidence wave onto a vertical wall and in the generation of large amplitude ""rogue"" waves in shallow water near a beach. An objective of this research is to apply the results of this project in order to investigate possible mechanisms generating waves of extremely high elevations frequently observed in open seas and along coastlines, for example, tsunamis. Understanding the nature and dynamics of such extreme waves, and ultimately predicting such wave phenomena in oceans near highly populated coastal areas are significant and urgent tasks. The proposed research activities will involve several undergraduate and graduate students who will gain first-hand research experience in applied mathematics. Since the theory is shared by various other physical systems, it is anticipated that the results from the proposed work would provide insights into areas such as light waves in nonlinear optics, and spin waves in magnetic thin films."

This conference will bring together leading researchers in the world to discuss recent advances on Multiscale, Multiphysics, and Stochastic Modeling, Analysis and Computation of Direct, Inverse, and Imaging Problems and Applications. The conference focuses on three related topics. The first is the development of multi-scale, multiphysics modeling, analysis, and computation techniques that are critically important for the simulation and design of nano materials and fabrications. The second is the integration of inverse problem techniques with imaging analysis methods for important physical processes that arise in nondestructive testing, optical imaging, near-field microscopy, and nano/bio imaging.  The third is the uncertainty quantification of the large scale problems focusing on imaging and inverse problems in random media as well as numerical solutions of stochastic partial differential equations. There will be about three plenary speakers each day, giving 1-hour talks. While the plenary speakers are predominantly from a mathematical background, many of the local speakers will be form an experimental background. Also there will be three introductory talks which lay out the nature of the challenges in each area, and a forward looking session at the end of the conference. A poster session will be available to graduate students and postdocs for advertising their research results. The NSF fund will be used to support US-based scientists (mostly junior researchers) for attending the conference and exchanging new ideas in various application areas.  <br/><br/>Recent innovative developments of the multi-scale, multi-physics modeling and computational methods, inverse problem methods, and imaging techniques are applicable to describe many other physical processes and will have impact on the modeling and computation of the models in computational biology, multi-scale modeling of materials science, nano technology, and imaging science. Advances in these fields will greatly contribute to the development nano technologies for solar energy harvesting, medical imaging and therapeutics. Many physical systems, devices and processes of importance to science and engineering are not very well understood and controlled due to uncertainty in physical models and their parameters, multi-scale material properties, the operating environment, or measurement. While numerical simulations offer a viable alternative for critical decision making, simulation uncertainties from physical, analytical, or numerical errors must be characterized and managed. General and efficient mathematical models and novel computational algorithms must be developed for modeling multi-scale, multi-physics processes with appropriate control of uncertainty. The understanding of the role of stochastic effects on the direct, inverse, and imaging problems will have broad impact on the advancement of these key areas of scientific study. By combining these areas into a focused conference, and interspersing theoretical, applied, and computational talks, we hope to promote a cross-fertilization between scientists with various disciplinary backgrounds. By outlining the potential impact that theoretical tools can have on the most salient issues of our day, the workshop will influence and invigorate the educational efforts at the institutions of the speakers and workshop participants."

This higher order energy incorporates solvation and elastic energies to model the rich network structures produced by functionalized polymers in solvent.  The FCH energy supports a wider class of novel interfaces, including multi-parameter families of thin bi-layers, small radius pore structures, and small micelle networks.  The investigator addresses the convergence of the FCH energy to the classic Canham-Helfrich in sharp interface limit.  He reduces a class of mass-preserving gradient flows of the FCH energy to curvature-driven evolution for surfaces of co-dimension one and two.  The structured interfaces constructed in the unfolding of the original energies' critical point structures drive the geometric flows, with the interfacial structure coupling the interface's evolution.  The flexibility of the FCH energy lies in the freedom to assign positive or negative energies to different critical points, selectively driving growth of favored structures.  The investigator rigorously derives these geometric flow reductions via analysis of the linearized structures and an adaptation of his renormalization group approach.  He extends the FCH energy to model multicomponent mixtures of functionalized and neutral polymers in solvents, unfolding the bifurcation of bi-layer critical points from heteroclinic connections for potentials with multiple global minima.  The construction of small-radius pores as a connection problem between asymmetric wells is achieved via the constrained minimization approach developed for traveling waves in multi-wells.<br/><br/>     The US has a growing need for clean energy sources for the 21st century.  This involves capturing energy from the environment, either from solar or wind sources, and storing this energy either in batteries or in a concentrated chemical form.  These processes require membrane separators that permit ions of one charge to cross, but not ions of the opposite charge.  The investigator has developed a model that has the possibility to optimize the nanoscale structure of these membrane separators when they are cast from solvent form.  The analysis and numerical studies performed in this project elucidate the mechanisms underlying the formation of the nanoscale networks, and lead to the development of more energy-efficient conversion processes.  The project is funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Division of Materials Research."

The first equation is for the determining modes of a differential equation of Navier-Stokes type. A set of low modes is determining, if for any solution on the global attractor, the high modes of the solution for all time, can be produced from only the low modes (for all time). Extending this relationship to the Banach space of bounded functions from the reals into the low modes leads to a determining form, an evolution equation that is globally Lipschitz, and dissipative. The global attractor of the original differential equation is contained in the long time behavior of the determining form.  This provides an alternative to the theory of inertial forms which is not known to be applicable to the Navier-Stokes equations. The other evolution equation is for the radius of analyticity in the spatial variable.  We will use this equation to study the domain of analyticity for solutions on the global attractor and its effect on aspects of fluid flow such as intermittency.<br/><br/>Fluid motions at large scales, for instance in ocean and atmosphere, display erratic, seemingly incomprehensible (turbulent) features when viewed locally and for short times. However, over time, consistent global statistical patterns emerge. The purpose of this research is to develop a rigorous understanding of the nature and origin of such patterns, and of deviations from it, with a view towards diverse applications such as ocean modeling and weather forecasting. For instance, weather forecasting is done by solving a large system of equations which model the state of the atmosphere over a period of time.<br/>The current state of the atmosphere is needed as input in order to compute the state in the future.  As there are always limited measurements of the state of the system, this input inevitably contains some error. The inherent sensitivity of the system to such an error means that as time goes on the computed solution diverges from reality. The technique of data assimilation uses the limited measurements of the system at not just a single moment of time, but rather over an extended time period in the past, to arrive at a more accurate input.  This project applies recent mathematical discoveries to develop new variations on this technique. It will lead to new algorithms that will be implemented and tested by the research team.  Graduate students will play an essential role in this collaborative effort, thus serving to train future generation of scientists in the STEM disciplines."

The meeting will be held on the campus of Texas A&M University, May, 23-27, 2011.  There will also be a pre-conference workshop, specifically tailored to give graduate students and postdocs critical background material.  As expected from the conference title, there is an emphasis on applications and most talks will be motivated directly by questions in the physical, biological and engineering sciences. This makes this a ""not-to-be-missed"" meeting, especially for the junior researcher, and this proposal seeks travel funding to permit graduate student and postdoc attendance.  This will have significant broader impact as it exposes US junior researchers to state-of-the-art applications and mathematical techniques in a rapidly expanding area that has considerable technological importance for the health, economic welfare and security of the nation.  AIP-2011 is the sixth in a series of biennial meetings that are intended to be the comprehensive scientific conference for the area of inverse problems in partial differential equations and applications.  In addition to the 12 plenary talks, there will also be approximately 40 minisymposia plus contributed sessions and poster sessions.  The intent of the meeting is to achieve a balance among analysis, computation and modeling for applications.<br/><br/>The field of inverse problems has grown enormously within the last decade.  While the underlying model may be a partial differential equation, mathematical, computational and statistical tools are required that go far beyond this basis.  One consequence of this is the demand put on a researcher to have broad-based expertise and this particularly impacts beginning researchers.  For example, imaging is a ubiquitous tool in the modern world and the mathematical models arising from various modalities give rise to inverse problems.  While the familiar CAT scan comes from the Radon transform and gave rise to the field of (x-ray) tomography, modern imaging is extremely complex.  It not only uses different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (which have very different absorption and resolution properties) but also can involve longitudonal waves such as sound, or as is now common, hybrid versions to optimize against the twin evils of diffusion and lack of resolution.  While many of these methods have differential equations as their basis, reconstruction techniques require intensive computational analysis and statistical methods to optimize data use.  Even this sub-field has become so broad that no one individual can be expert on all aspects.  For this reason AIP-2011 will feature a pre-conference workshop primarily intended for graduate students and postdocs that will take place immediately prior to the main meeting.  The workshop will feature 10 talks from 5 well-known experts and will cover many of the basic tools that will be required for an understanding of the more in-depth talks of the meeting itself.  These include analytic/geometrical methods, Baysian techniques, inverse scattering, regularization techniques and tomographic methods in imaging.  Funding from this award will also allow attendance at the workshop and this in itself will have a broad educational impact in an area that is critical for the technological growth of the nation."

The first is the development of new methods for analysis of active scalar equations. These are nonlinear and nonlocal partial differential equations that, in particular, include classical two-dimensional Euler equation describing ideal fluid flow, and surface quasi-geostrophic equation arising in atmospheric science. Active scalars have been used to model a wide range of phenomena in nature, including formation of fronts in atmosphere, diffusion in porous medium and evolution of vortex sheets. Research will build on recent work of the principal investigator (PI) by finding more general maximum principles (bounds controlling solutions). A novel aspect of this research is that these bounds are nonlocal, which may be just the right fit for nonlocal equations like active scalars. New techniques are expected to provide progress on key questions in mathematical fluid mechanics involving structure of solutions to active scalar equations, their regularity and possible singularity formation. The second direction focuses on enhancement of diffusion by fluid flow. Numerous processes in nature and engineering, starting from nuclear burning in stars to combustion in engines to reactions in living organisms depend on this phenomenon. The goal is, building on the earlier research of the PI, to improve understanding of flows that are most efficient in speeding up diffusion and mixing. The problem is at the interface of partial differential equations, dynamical systems and Fourier analysis. The methods to be developed here will be relevant in a more general context. They apply in problems that involve convergence to equilibrium in systems that contain both dissipative and fast unitary parts of dynamics. The third direction, biomixing, is motivated by a problem of coral broadcast spawning that has been communicated to the PI by an oceanographer. It involves studying improvement of the efficiency of biological reactions by chemotaxis. A model is proposed that adds chemotaxis term to the previously studied models of the process. The effect chemotaxis has on fertilization rate is likely to be crucial for health of many biosystems. The goal of this direction of the project will be to better understand coral spawning process and quantify an important role chemotaxis plays in achieving the reproduction success.<br/><br/>The project focuses on several problems in fluid mechanics. In one direction, novel techniques are developed that will provide insight into behavior of solutions to equations modeling diverse phenomena from temperature evolution in the atmosphere to traffic flow dynamics. In other direction, the problem of mixing in fluid flow will be studied, and classes of flows that are most efficient mixers will be identified. The question of efficient mixing is of interest in many industries, including food processing and chemical engineering. Another direction of the project research improves reproduction models for a class of marine animals including corals. Coral atolls are important ecosystems that are under stress worldwide due to climate change and pollution. The models that will be developed in the project are important for better understanding of coral life cycle, and will be of interest in oceanography and ecology. The project has a significant and broad training component, and will involve a postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students working on problems related to the project research."

The failures of interest are those due to the formation of creases on the surface and also the creation and growth of microscopic holes, both on the surface and in the interior.  When external forces are applied these holes become visible, grow in size, and then combine to break the material.  Particular problems that are addressed in this project are: the creation of holes in thin films of soft adhesives; the initiation and growth of a solitary hole; and the formation of surface creases in elastomers that are subject to severe compressions.  The mathematical analysis of such phenomena involves: the existence and uniqueness of minimizers with and without singularities for problems in the calculus of variations; regularity and fine properties of singular minimizers; the physical relevance of multiple solutions to the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations; whether or not radial minimizers, which have been constructed in numerous places in the literature, are indeed the global minimizers of the energy, especially when nonradial perturbations are considered; and, the determination of whether known singular solutions to quasilinear elliptic systems are indeed minimizers of the corresponding problem in the calculus of variations.<br/><br/>     The focus of this project is the mathematical analysis of equations that arise in Materials Science.  Experiments on modern technologically sophisticated materials have uncovered alternative mechanisms of material failure, i.e., the way such materials break may not follow the usual expectations that engineers have developed for classical materials.  For example, while the metals used to make a traditional aircraft slowly fatigue, the composites used to construct a modern plane occasionally exhibit a more rapid degradation.  The goal of this project is to obtain a better understanding of two particular destructive mechanisms: the formation of defects (creases) on the surface of a material and the creation and growth of holes both on the surface and in the interior of a material.  The particular materials that are analyzed are thin films of adhesives and certain rubbery polymers that are known as elastomers."

The main focus is the study of magnetic- and electric-field-induced phase transitions in smectic materials in general, and chiral tilted smectic systems in particular. The approach is to study smectic liquid crystals as described by generalized phenomenological Landau-de Gennes energies, which take into account the complete electromechanical coupling, finite surface anchoring and added interaction coupling terms. The investigator studies effects observed in experiments: reentrant phases under electric fields, shrinkage of smectic layers that lead to folding instabilities at smectic C* transitions, undulation induced by applied fields, field-induced phase transformations, and the emergent display of macroscopic chiral properties in liquid crystals that are composed of achiral molecules. These effects arise in considering both the behavior of liquid crystals and issues associated with manufacturing smectic liquid crystal devices.  The approach uses a diverse collection of mathematical tools coming from nonlinear partial differential equations, including variational methods, asymptotic analysis and partial differential equation regularity theory. Part of the effort is to validate and refine the models that contain the essential features of the examined phenomena. <br/><br/>Smectic liquid crystals are less studied than nematic liquid crystals. As in nematic liquid crystals, the long molecules in smectic liquid crystals point in approximately the same direction, called the director; unlike nematic liquid crystals, the long molecules of smectic liquid crystals also are arranged approximately in planar layers. The tilt between the director and the normal to the layer, and the rotation of this tilt as one moves between layers, are involved in the switching properties of smectic liquid crystals.  Liquid crystals are well-known for their use in liquid crystal display technology, where devices at the moment are mostly based on nematic mesophases and operate very close to physical limits. The future of this important application resides in tilted chiral smectic mesophases, which due to their ferroelectric or antiferroelectric properties have superior operational speed and resolution. Commercial applications of ferroelectric liquid crystals include spatial light modulators, optical memory, optical computers and high-resolution microdisplays. Due to the importance of current and future applications of smectic materials, there is a need for validation and extension of the available theoretical models through mathematical analysis. By theoretically studying the properties of the solutions of the proposed models, and comparing them to experimental results, the project adds to the understanding of the nature of the liquid crystalline phase transitions, and the electrical and optical properties of soft condensed matter. This in turn leads to better ways of building liquid crystal based devices."

Emphasis is given to problems in mathematical and control-theoretic areas which are rather unexplored, such as: gas flow-structure interaction in aeroelasticity; elastic structure-flow interaction with moving interface; structural acoustic interaction with a non-shallow shell as active curved wall and a nonlinear acoustic Westervalt-Kuznetesov chamber (based on Fourier Law of Heat Flux) or Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson chamber (based on Maxwell-Cattaneo Law), both arising in High Intensity Ultrasound focusing.<br/><br/>Mathematical control theory injects in the study of differential equations the active viewpoint of an external agent or manipulator, who is not satisfied with just passively observing or contemplating the evolution of a natural phenomenon; but instead seeks to intervene as to influence and modify its dynamical behavior, in order to achieve a preassigned outcome. Celestial mechanics offers an established example of the passive, non-controlled viewpoint: The astronomer may calculate orbits, predict time and location of eclipses, but cannot alter these phenomena. In contrast, governmental action on social or economic issues---such as reducing unemployment or stimulating growth---illustrates the active, control-based strategy. Analysis versus synthesis. The present project applies the active control approach of synthesis to study complex multi-faceted phenomena or combined units---ubiquitous in the physical world---consisting of systems of strongly coupled partial differential equations, where the controlling authority has access only to the interface between two different media.  To suppress turbulence or flutter in fluid-structure or air/gas flow-structure interactions. Or to achieve noise reduction in an acoustic chamber, such as the interior of an aircraft. Or to obtain high intensity ultrasound focusing in medical applications, ranging from lithotripsy or thermo-therapy to ultrasound cleaning and welding."

These systems often exhibit dissipation that is considered to be negligible or weak. However, recent work by the investigators and recently published observations of dissipation rates of ocean swell, show that the models using weak dissipation provide an inadequate description of some aspects of the evolution of nonlinear surface water waves. Thus, a main emphasis of this research is to develop a theory from first principles for the propagation and evolution of nonlinear surface water waves on a viscous fluid, with no approximation on the size of dissipation. The research addresses several projects that build on this notion and/or are intended to apply the mathematical results to ocean applications. The projects fall into two categories: A) surface waves propagating on a viscous fluid and B) waves in shallow or finite-depth water. The investigators will approach these problems by combining their individual strengths in modeling and analysis, numerical simulations, and physical experiments to obtain a fundamental mathematical description of the physical phenomena. They will then use publicly available data from ocean observations to apply their results to ocean settings.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this research is to understand at a fundamental, mathematical level the propagation of waves on a surface of water, and to apply this understanding to observations of waves measured in the laboratory and in the oceans. Particular applications include the effects of dissipation on the generation of waves by wind, the subsequent propagation of ocean swell, and the development of rogue waves in shallow and deep water; predicting dangerous versus benign tsunamis given the Richter-scale measure of the magnitude of the responsible earthquake and some readily available information about the geology of its location; and modeling large-amplitude waves on beaches with variable bathymetry using the new mathematical approaches investigated here. In addition, the mathematical results are expected to describe nonlinear waves in several settings, including light waves in an optical fiber, spin waves in a thin magnetic film and others. Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored and involved in experimental studies and theoretical analysis; through this project they will receive training in interdisciplinary research."

Traditionally, the hydrostatic approximation balance, in the vertical momentum equation, has been applied to reduce the computational burden.  Recently, the investigators have made significant progress in the rigorous understanding of the properties of the solutions to these models.  However, it is still impossible to use present computing resources to simulate this large system for the wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  Therefore, there is a need to further simplify these models to focus on understanding and simulating certain localized smaller-scale phenomena, such as the geostrophic adjustment of frontal anomalies in a rotating continuously stratified fluid of strictly rectilinear fronts and jets, and rapidly rotating convection which, according to the Taylor-Proudman constraint, takes place in tall columnar structures.  The development of fast, accurate, and reliable numerical models of the climate system is key to understanding and predicting the magnitude and distribution of future climate variability.   The focus of this project is to provide rigorous justification to these simplified models of the dynamics of the atmosphere and the oceans, and to investigate their long-term behavior.  The investigators study the questions of existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on the initial data of the solutions to these models.  This is the first, and the most crucial step, in justifying the derivation of these models and their consistency with the physical observations.<br/><br/>     There are numerous governing equations to fully describe the dynamics of climate.  It is impossible to use present computing resources to simulate this large system for the wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  Indeed, in order to understand, for example, the mechanism of atmospheric and oceanic turbulence, and to properly predict the climate, it is necessary to provide simplified and reliable models that contain the main features of the underlying physical phenomena.   The investigators focus on the development of novel, theoretical and computational, mathematical tools for investigating these simplified models, and on justifying their derivation in order to enhance our understanding of fluid dynamics models and the climate system and its predictability.   The training of undergraduate and graduate students with analytical and computational skills is also achieved through this study."

Of particular note are:  First, new directions in image processing, object recognition and shape matching, involving combinations and comparisons of moving frame-based signatures and joint invariant histograms.  Second, analysis and classification of invariant variational problems and invariant curve and surface flows using moving frame techniques applied to the invariant variational bicomplex, motivated by applications in geometric (bio-)mechanics, image denoising and smoothing, interface dynamics, and integrable soliton differential equations.

The first equation is for the determining modes of a differential equation of Navier-Stokes type. A set of low modes is determining, if for any solution on the global attractor, the high modes of the solution for all time, can be produced from only the low modes (for all time). Extending this relationship to the Banach space of bounded functions from the reals into the low modes leads to a determining form, an evolution equation that is globally Lipschitz, and dissipative. The global attractor of the original differential equation is contained in the long time behavior of the determining form.  This provides an alternative to the theory of inertial forms which is not known to be applicable to the Navier-Stokes equations. The other evolution equation is for the radius of analyticity in the spatial variable.  We will use this equation to study the domain of analyticity for solutions on the global attractor and its effect on aspects of fluid flow such as intermittency.<br/><br/>Fluid motions at large scales, for instance in ocean and atmosphere, display erratic, seemingly incomprehensible (turbulent) features when viewed locally and for short times. However, over time, consistent global statistical patterns emerge. The purpose of this research is to develop a rigorous understanding of the nature and origin of such patterns, and of deviations from it, with a view towards diverse applications such as ocean modeling and weather forecasting. For instance, weather forecasting is done by solving a large system of equations which model the state of the atmosphere over a period of time.<br/>The current state of the atmosphere is needed as input in order to compute the state in the future.  As there are always limited measurements of the state of the system, this input inevitably contains some error. The inherent sensitivity of the system to such an error means that as time goes on the computed solution diverges from reality. The technique of data assimilation uses the limited measurements of the system at not just a single moment of time, but rather over an extended time period in the past, to arrive at a more accurate input.  This project applies recent mathematical discoveries to develop new variations on this technique. It will lead to new algorithms that will be implemented and tested by the research team.  Graduate students will play an essential role in this collaborative effort, thus serving to train future generation of scientists in the STEM disciplines."

Based on empirical data from a wide variety of physical phenomena, the family of stochastic processes called fractional Brownian motions is appropriate for stochastic models of physical phenomena.  However most of the members of this family of fractional Brownian motions do not possess the Markovian property or the semimartingale property that are usually assumed for stochastic models.  Since most controlled stochastic systems in continuous time have been described with a noise modeled by a Brownian motion there is demand to study control problems for stochastic systems with other fractional Brownian motions.  These control problems require significantly different methods for analysis than the well developed methods for the control of systems with Brownian motions.  These major differences have resulted in having few results available for the optimal control of linear systems driven by an arbitrary fractional Brownian motion.  The investigators for this grant have initiated a major study of these control problems for linear systems.  This study should not only provide results for an arbitrary fractional Brownian motion but also provide results for the control of linear systems driven by processes from a general family of square integrable continuous stochastic processes.  This work will develop further the investigators? initial work on finite time horizon, quadratic cost control of linear stochastic systems.  It is planned to expand this study to other cost functionals and to other types of systems, both finite and infinite dimensional.  Specifically this work is planned to determine explicit expressions for the optimal control and the optimal cost for an infinite time horizon ergodic (or long run average) quadratic cost functional.  Furthermore it is planned to study the control of linear stochastic partial differential equations for both finite and infinite time horizon control problems with a quadratic cost functional.  The noise stochastic process and the control for these equations are allowed to be restricted to the boundary of the domain.  Typically the controlled stochastic systems have unknown parameters so it is necessary to identify the parameters and control the system simultaneously.  This class of problems is called adaptive control and the investigators plan to extend their initial work on adaptive control for a scalar linear system to multidimensional linear systems with an arbitrary fractional Brownian motion.<br/> <br/>Many physical systems are controlled so the question of the determination of a best or optimal control arises.  This area of research is called optimal control.  Typically a mathematical model of a physical phenomena must account for perturbations of the system or unmodelled dynamics so a noise process is introduced in the model.  These models are called stochastic systems.  Given a controlled stochastic system and a cost for the use of control and the behavior of the system it is usually very difficult to obtain an explicit optimal control and the associated optimal cost.  Furthermore the controlled stochastic systems in continuous time have been restricted to using one specific stochastic process, Brownian motion (white noise) as the noise.  However empirical evidence from a wide variety of physical phenomena demonstrates a need for other noise processes, particularly for the family of fractional Brownian motions.  The investigators for this grant have recently initiated a study of the control of linear systems with cost functionals that are quadratic in the system state and the control.  They have obtained some results for explicit optimal controls for linear systems with an arbitrary fractional Brownian motion.  These investigators plan to extend this work to more general linear systems and to infinite time horizon control problems with models that have an arbitrary fractional Brownian motion or a more general stochastic process.  The optimal controls for these models can be used for control applications in many fields.  The usefulness of fractional Brownian motions has been demonstrated in hydrology, telecommunications, turbulence, epilepsy and cognition as well as other areas.  The optimal control results can be important in the use of effective controls for these physical phenomena.  These results should have an important impact on many fields."

This shearing motion causes the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and other poorly understood phenomena. Vortex sheets are produced by sharp corners of solid objects moving in a fluid, such as wings of accelerating aircraft or by interacting shock waves in compressible flow. Vortex sheets generally end in a spiral. Since computer simulation of vortex spirals is notoriously unstable, it is especially important investigating them with analytical tools from the theory of differential and integral equations. The project is aimed in particular at understanding and construction of certain classical spirals, followed by a generalization to compressible and viscous flow models.<br/><br/>Recent numerical experiments by the principal investigator and analytical results by others suggest that the Euler equation, a mathematical model of fluid flow that neglects viscosity and heat conduction, may suffer from non-uniqueness: the initial state of the fluid does not determine the state at later times unambiguously. This project will put these unclear results into a more satisfactory state by finding rigorous proofs for flows that have simpler structure and are physically relevant, namely Pullin's separated spirals. The non-uniqueness phenomenon surfaces not only in theory, but also in computer simulation and in physical experiments which are crucial for designing aircraft and other sensitive applications. Understanding non-uniqueness is important because it indicates that the theoretical predictions are less reliable than previously thought, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Broader impacts of this project include combining education with hands-on research in order to attract students, especially at the critical advanced undergraduate stage, to the fluid dynamics research. Classroom innovations and several undergraduate projects on computer simulation of compressible fluids, with emphasis on extensive independent study instruction, are planned; PhD students will be trained."

(iii) We will explore direct inversion methods for related inverse problems that share a common mathematical structure with optical tomography. In particular, we will develop and analyze reconstruction methods, based on inversion of the Born series, for electrical impedance tomography and for the Maxwell equations in the near-field.<br/><br/>One of the grand challenges in biomedical imaging is to develop high-resolution methods for imaging of physiological and molecular function.  The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the solution to this problem by developing the necessary mathematical tools. The ability to detect and characterize disease at much earlier stages than is currently possible would be transformative and is critically linked to the development of robust and accurate image reconstruction algorithms for functional imaging. Two graduate students and an undergraduate will be trained to function in this interdisciplinary environment. The results of the research will be broadly disseminated and computer codes will be made publicly available for noncommercial use."

Specifically my research will involve (1) proving decay of solutions to the initial-value problem for Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism and for gravitational waves, both in a Kerr rotating black hole geometry; (2) studying shock waves and expansion waves arising in general relativity; (3) magnetic rotating and non-rotating Newtonian stars. Part 1 continues previous work on decay results for the Dirac and scalar wave equations, to Maxwell's equations and to the linearized Einstein equations in a KBH background geometry. Part 2 deals with shock waves and expansion waves in general relativity, and applying these wave solutions to problems in astrophysics; e.g. the so-called anomalous acceleration of the universe, without needing dark energy or the cosmological constant. It is based on my rigorously obtained new solutions of the Einstein equations. Part 3 arises from my recent results on existence and stability results for rotating Newtonian stars and is aimed at extending these results to magnetic stars (like our sun). This study is motivated by an attempt to better understand sunspots and solar flares, from a rigorous mathematical point of view.<br/><br/>The proposal is focused on three areas of astrophysics. The first involves studying whether black holes are stable under electromagnetic and gravitational perturbation. That is, if one sends an electromagnetic or gravitational wave into a rotating black hole, will the black hole remain pretty much intact, or will it radiate away a good portion of its energy? The second is to continue my work on new solutions of Einstein's equations explaining the so-called anomalous acceleration of the universe. That is, the standard physical model modifies Einstein's equations in an ad hoc manner and involves the notion of ""dark energy"", an unobserved anti-gravitational force, in order to agree with astronomical observations. This approach has no physical basis whatsoever. The final area of interest to me is to study start with magnetic fields with an aim to getting a theoretical explanation of sunspots and solar flares. These phenomena remain highly mysterious, and are important since when they occur, they disrupt satellite as well as radio communication. It is not known how to predict sunspots and solar flares, and a firm mathematical understanding of the associated equations would be an important step in this direction."

This first project involves the simulation of grain boundary motion in two and three dimensions using our recently developed multiphase variational level set framework. It is planned to extend this formulation to allow for the possibility of arbitrary surface tension between grains. This will be accomplished by combining this formulation with minimizing movements. The second project concerns the efficient computation the semi-classical limit of the Schroedinger equation. The proposed algorithm is based on the observation that if one transforms the Schroedinger equation using a transformation inspired by Gaussian wave packets, one arrives at another Schroedinger equation that is much more amenable to computation in the semiclassical limit project. The third project concerns modeling and efficient simulation of epitaxial growth using kinetic  Monte Carlo (KMC).  We plan to model and simulate both liquid drop epitaxy and heteroepitaxial growth. In each of these cases we aim to develop highly efficient KMC algorithms to allow simulation on time and lengths not previously possible, thereby facilitating model development and allowing comparison with experiments.<br/><br/>Each of the proposed projects has the potential to have a significant impact on problems that are both fundamental and technologically important. Epitaxial growth is scientifically interesting since it has effects on both nanoscales and mesoscales.  It is technologically relevant since quantum dot materials are made in this way.  Our proposed techniques will greatly increase the simulation speed  thereby facilitating  model development. The study of grain boundary motion using curvature flow is a classic problem in applied and computational mathematics which has importance in material science  since  various properties of polycrystalline substances can crucially depend on the details of the grain patterns.  The fast simulation of the semi-classical limit of the Schroedinger equation could  provide deeper insight into chemical reaction dynamics, molecular-surface scattering, and photodissociation, for example."

(2) The application of such a general framework, in particular to the study of ionic fluids in cells and proteins. Complex fluids, including mixtures and solutions, are abundant in daily life. The complicated phenomena and properties exhibited by these materials reflect the coupling and competition between microscopic interactions and macroscopic dynamics.

Molecular biology has shown that understanding behavior of proteins and nucleic acids in biological plasma (ionic solutions) is essential for understanding and controlling many biological systems. Nearly all biological processes involve the transport of electrically charged ions. Ion channels are instrumental for a vast number of biological phenomena, with many diseases (such as cystic fibrosis) and drug treatments dependent on channel functioning. In mathematical analysis of these phenomena, variational methods show a great promise because they deal naturally with systems with many components that flow between definite boundaries. In this research we will apply energy variational methods to study biological plasma, ionic solutions of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions as they flow through specific protein channels."

Several specific projects will be undertaken.  The first will focus on the classic problem of community detection in networks and the development of compact objective functions for assessing community quality and effective strategies for their optimization.  The methods proposed improve on previous ones in being rigorously motivated, utilizing as much as possible of the information stored in a network, and avoiding some of the pitfalls of previous approaches, such as resolution limits.  A second project will develop methods for general structural inference in networks based on a combination of expectation--maximization (EM) algorithms with Monte Carlo and belief propagation methods.  A particular strength of these approaches is that, because they optimize marginal probabilities, they have the potential to avoid overfitting and offer strategies for solving model selection problems.  Several further projects focus on the extension of these techniques to more complex forms of network structure, including overlapping vertex classes, hierarchical structure, and dependence on general classes of hidden variables.<br/><br/><br/>Many systems of scientific interest can be represented as networks, from the Internet to biological networks to social networks.  In the last decade copious amounts of network data have become available in different fields, but in many cases these data are dense and bewildering, presenting a substantial challenge to the user trying to make sense of their structure.  The fundamental question addressed in this research is how we can gain new understanding about physical, biological, and social systems from their network structure.  For instance, the investigator and his collaborators will develop methods for detecting groups of closely interacting nodes in networks, such as cliques of individuals in social networks, or groups of related web sites on the web.  They will also tackle general questions of using network structure to deduce unknown properties of network nodes.  If, for instance, there are several different types of nodes in a network, such as classes of chemicals in a metabolic network in the cell, how can we identify the types from network structure alone, without measuring them directly (which may be difficult or costly)?  The funded research will create a range of mathematical tools that can be applied to problems in this area.  The methods to be developed have a number of possible applications, including new techniques to aid researchers working on biological and social networks, commercial applications in online social networks, and software applications in data visualization and automatic data summarization, among others."

This theory studies the properties of heterogeneous materials (primarily composites), which are of critical importance for modern technology.  Fundamental questions are raised in the process of modeling such materials -- primarily in the fields of PDEs and Calculus of Variations.  The work addresses special classes of homogenization problems where, in addition to the homogenization parameter, another small material parameter (e.g., the inverse Ginzburg-Landau parameter) is present.  The results and techniques developed for two-parameter homogenization problems essentially depend on the relation between these parameters, and several such relations are considered.  These problems are studied in the context of Ginzburg-Landau models for superconducting composites.  Specifically, the investigator and his collaborators study pinning by holes in small superconducting samples.  Here the main mathematical issue is the homogenization limit in a nonstandard discrete/continuum nonlinear finite-dimensional variational problem with integer constraints for the unknown family of degrees of vortices.  The investigator and his collaborators develop Gamma convergence techniques for such problems.  It is expected that the homogenization vorticity drastically depends on the relation between the geometrical parameters (size of the holes and distances between them) and the material parameter.  In particular, the investigator and his collaborators look for special scaling relations, which result in vortices with multiple degrees.  Also, the investigator and his collaborators develop novel techniques of Gamma-convergence for the study of nonlinear random homogenization problems.  Applications of these techniques for material science problems are considered.  One of the key issues is the identification of new effects due to randomness when compared to periodically located inclusions.<br/><br/>     The project is primarily motivated by the quest for energy-efficient materials that comprise a foundation for a new generation of superconductivity-based microelectronics.  It utilizes Ginzburg-Landau models of superconductivity, describing their ability to carry electric current without power loss.  In practical applications of superconductivity the passing current creates magnetic vortices that move, dissipate the energy, and destroy the superconducting state.  Thus the central problem for practical application is the problem of immobilization of vortices, known among specialists as the problem of vortex pinning.  The approach studied here offers an efficient tool to tackle this problem and to develop practical recipes for an artificial manufacturing pinning configuration in superconducting wires to crucially improve their performance.  The project has a direct impact on the education and future careers of graduate students.  They receive an interdisciplinary training through interactions with the investigator's collaborators at Argonne National Laboratory.  Additionally, the investigator continues involving undergraduate students in his NSF-supported research projects."

These systems often exhibit dissipation that is considered to be negligible or weak. However, recent work by the investigators and recently published observations of dissipation rates of ocean swell, show that the models using weak dissipation provide an inadequate description of some aspects of the evolution of nonlinear surface water waves. Thus, a main emphasis of this research is to develop a theory from first principles for the propagation and evolution of nonlinear surface water waves on a viscous fluid, with no approximation on the size of dissipation. The research addresses several projects that build on this notion and/or are intended to apply the mathematical results to ocean applications. The projects fall into two categories: A) surface waves propagating on a viscous fluid and B) waves in shallow or finite-depth water. The investigators will approach these problems by combining their individual strengths in modeling and analysis, numerical simulations, and physical experiments to obtain a fundamental mathematical description of the physical phenomena. They will then use publicly available data from ocean observations to apply their results to ocean settings.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this research is to understand at a fundamental, mathematical level the propagation of waves on a surface of water, and to apply this understanding to observations of waves measured in the laboratory and in the oceans. Particular applications include the effects of dissipation on the generation of waves by wind, the subsequent propagation of ocean swell, and the development of rogue waves in shallow and deep water; predicting dangerous versus benign tsunamis given the Richter-scale measure of the magnitude of the responsible earthquake and some readily available information about the geology of its location; and modeling large-amplitude waves on beaches with variable bathymetry using the new mathematical approaches investigated here. In addition, the mathematical results are expected to describe nonlinear waves in several settings, including light waves in an optical fiber, spin waves in a thin magnetic film and others. Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored and involved in experimental studies and theoretical analysis; through this project they will receive training in interdisciplinary research."

Here the main goal is to extend the theory available in linear-quadratic case, studying  more general nonlinear models with robustness properties.   A second main area of research is the control of set-valued evolutions. Models will be considered where the growth of a set can be influenced by a distributed control, or restrained by constructing barriers in real time.  In particular, the P.I. and a collaborator will study in which cases the set can be rendered uniformly bounded for all times, and which are the optimal confinement strategies.  <br/><br/>The primary motivation for the research on differential games  comes from economics. In a typical model that will be considered, the leading player--say, a government, or a central bank--announces its policy in advance, while a subordinate player--say, a private  company--chooses its strategy as a best reply, in order to maximize its own profit.  If the policy to be implemented makes reference to specific parameters that will be observed in the future, such as inflation or unemployment rates, determining the optimal choice for the leading player  leads to challenging mathematical problems.  These will be investigated within the present research.   As a further direction, the study of dynamic blocking problems is motivated by models describing the spatial  spreading of a forest fire, or of a chemical contamination.  The optimal allocation of resources, in the containment effort, poses novel mathematical questions which will also be  addressed by the present project."

The primary objective of the proposed research is to apply techniques of geometric optimal control theory to the control of the spin dynamics by magnetic fields in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Through interaction with a magnetic field, NMR involves the manipulation of nuclear spins. It has many potential applications extending from the determination of molecular structures (NMR spectroscopy) and quantum computing, where NMR remains one of the most promising road in the construction of a scalable quantum computer, to medical imagery (MRI).  The control technology developed over the past 50 years allows the use of sophisticated control fields and permits the implementation of complex quantum algorithms such as the Deutsh-Jozsa and the Grover algorithms. NMR is therefore an ideal experimental testbed for quantum control.  The proposed research will also impact the domain of quantum mechanics. First, solving the contrast imaging problem can potentially have a profound impact on how medical imaging is done in hospitals. Indeed, by designing magnetic fields to maximize the distance between the two spin we increase the image resolution and therefore improve its quality which improves patient care. Second, by using geometric techniques our approach will complement existing efficient numerical tools for pulse sequence optimization, such as the GRAPE (gradient ascent pulse engineering) by providing an understanding of the qualitative structures of the dynamics of the system. In particular, the physicists will gain insight about the control mechanism that lead to the optimal solutions.<br/><br/>Starting as a tool for characterization of organic molecules, the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has spread to areas as diverse as pharmaceutics, medical diagnostics (medical resonance imaging) and structural biology. The principles of NMR have served as a paradigm for other physical methods that rely on interaction between radiation and matter. It is therefore not surprising that experiments in NMR also serve as good model problems in control of quantum systems. Recent advancements on the study of spin dynamics strongly suggest the efficiency of geometric control theory to analyze the optimal synthesis.  Until now, the analysis of nonlinear optimal control has been mostly concerned with the class of single-input systems. Via this application in quantum control, it is proposed to extend the analysis to the multidimensional case.  The proposal research will also impact significantly the field of quantum mechanics. First, medical imagery can be drastically improved through the contrast problem which will directly impact patient care in hospitals. Second, by using geometric tools to develop optimal synthesis, we provide physicists with an additional understanding about the control mechanism of the optimal solutions which in turn will help developing improved numerical schemes.  We also propose an initiative to address the underrepresentation of minorities, and particularly of Native Hawaiian women, in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM disciplines) at UH Manoa and nationwide. The goal is to address the dual barriers of gender and ethnicity that Native Hawaiian females face in these fields."

Standard Fourier approaches and conventional sampling techniques are inapplicable in such problems.  The challenge resides in the requirement of rapid, accurate, and robust recovery.

This entails the further development of the theory of complex dimensions, along with the investigation of the underlying oscillatory phenomena,  of (approximately) self-similar fractals, multifractals, and associated nonlinear dynamical systems. This also entails the development and the use of new tools in noncommutative geometry and global analysis in order to study the geodesic flow and the geodesic metric of 'fractal manifolds'. A connecting thread throughout this project is provided by the interplay between fractal geometry and dynamical systems, from two main perspectives: (i) the use of (multivariable) complex dynamics in order to obtain a detailed understanding of the spectra of certain fractal drums, via a generalization of the classic decimation method. (ii)  The development of a theory of fractal billiards and (in the longer term) of corresponding trace formulas connecting the geometry (e.g., the geodesic  flow)  and spectra of the associated fractal drums. Computer-aided experiments as well as the interpretation of  physical experiments play a significant role in forming appropriate intuition in this context.<br/><br/>This projects aims at addressing the following question: ""Can one hear the shape of a fractal drum"" That is, how much information can one recover about the geometric contours of a rough or complex shape by making it vibrate and just listening to the resulting sounds? This question, even in the classical setting of smooth, Euclidean (or Riemannian) geometry, plays a central role in contemporary mathematics. Fractals are mathematical idealizations of many complex shapes occurring in nature, such as coastlines, river beds, trees, computer networks, networks of blood vessels, lungs, ore and oil distribution, etc. Understanding how waves propagate through these fractal shapes (or 'manifolds') or how light (and electromagnetic radiation) reflect on or off them, is a key scientific and mathematical problem. Potential applications of this work involve a variety of domains, including high technology (e.g, computer microchips, computer networks, and  fractal antenna for use in cell phone technology), mathematical  biology and medicine (cancer research, blood circulation), geology, applied and theoretical physics (microwaves cavities, random surfaces of use in models of quantum gravity),  astronomy (large-scale structure of the universe), and engineering (very efficient sound and heat insulators, catalysts in chemical reactions). The principal investigator, whose previous NSF supported research has already had a significant impact on this area (both in mathematics, physics and other sciences), plans to continue his broad integration of research and educational activities, via the continued mentoring of his many graduate students and postdocs, as well as of promising and creative undergraduate students. lecturing in many scientific venues and summer schools, the creation, teaching and supervision of new courses and seminars connected with this research area, as well as the writing of research and educational books and scientific papers connected with this field."

This equation is commonly regarded as the most fundamental kinetic collisional model for classic Coulomb plasmas. It was proposed to describe the infinite-particle limit for the evolution of a system of particles that interact with long-range (e.g., Coulomb) forces. However, there is no rigorous mathematical proof that the BGL equation is the correct limit. This situation has made it much harder to develop more general models for the physical situations, where the BGL equation is known not to be accurate (e.g., anomalous transport in fusion reactors). This project will aim to show that there is a deep connection between the BGL equation and the theory of fluctuations in collisionless plasmas about the Vlasov limit. Specifically, the goal is to show that the BGL equation is simply the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation associated with long-time particle dynamics in the Vlasov fluctuation field of a spatially homogeneous plasma. The centerpiece of the study will be a new stochastic process which describes, loosely speaking, long-time, self-consistent dynamics of particles traveling in a random force field generated by the fluctuations of the particles' density about the mean-field limit.<br/><br/>The Balescu-Lenard-Guernsey equation is pivotal in the theory of plasmas and gravitating systems; it has many applications, especially in the mathematical modeling of magnetically-confined fusion reactors. However, the existing body of mathematical knowledge about it is very small. The chief goal of the project is to construct a rigorous mathematical proof that this model provides a good approximation for describing the behavior of a large assembly of particles, such as those found in fusion plasmas. Such a proof will validate many theoretical calculations and numerical simulations based on the BLG model, as well as their applications in plasma physics. Having a better understanding of the mathematics involved will be indispensable for modeling more complicated physical phenomena that arise in very hot plasmas in a fusion reactor."

The project brings together a team of applied and computational mathematicians with expertise in constructing error estimates for solutions of partial differential equations and physicists with expertise in numerical solutions of the Einstein equation and gravitational wave data analysis.  The primary technical goal is to develop and analyze new mathematical and computational methods that can be used by the gravitational physics community to compute rigorous and reliably accurate estimates for the errors of numerical solutions of the Einstein equations and the gravitational waveforms that are determined from them.  In particular, this research explores the following issues:<br/>(1) Error quantification and a posteriori analysis using adjoint sensitivity techniques, and their associated numerical implementation;<br/>(2) Adaptive algorithms that are driven by goal-oriented error control, and their associated theoretical convergence analysis; and<br/>(3) The role of covariance symmetry and associated geometric structures in error analysis and the construction of numerical methods.<br/>As part of the a posteriori analysis, the project team will develop the basic theory of adjoint operators and duality for the Einstein equations. This will provide the foundation for future investigations into sensitivity analysis, data assimilation and uncertainty quantification for using LIGO data. It should be emphasized that the main thrusts of the proposed research are discretization-neutral, and therefore have broad applicability to the breadth of numerical relativity codes in existence.<br/><br/>The NSF-supported Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) can be successful only if highly accurate gravitational waveform models are available for use as part of the data analysis process, both for detecting gravitational waves and also for measuring the physical properties of any detected signals.  The strongest sources of gravitational waves are expected to be collisions between heavy, dense stars or black holes, which can only be modeled accurately using complex numerical simulations to calculate the anticipated gravitational waveforms.  Such waveforms are needed to construct the filters that allow detection of the weak gravitational-wave signals in the noisy detector, and such waveforms are also needed to measure the physical properties of the sources of any detected signals.  The waveform accuracy needed to accomplish the required data analysis tasks is quite high.  However, the numerical relativity community has yet to develop the analytic and computational tools needed to evaluate rigorously the accuracy of the numerical waveform models.  If the qualitative accuracy measures currently used by the numerical relativity community are too optimistic, the rigorous new methods developed by this project could make the difference between success and failure of LIGO.  If the current numerical waveforms are in fact accurate enough, the methods developed by this project could improve the computational efficiency of determining waveforms with a specified accuracy level, and thus reduce the cost of producing them."

Recently two far-reaching discoveries have been made that connected the nonlinear information (magnitudes of frame coefficients) to certain scalar products in larger embedding spaces.  Thus the initial problem, which is fundamentally nonlinear, is recast into a linear reconstruction problem coupled with a rank-one approximation problem.  When the linear redundant representation is associated with a group representation (such as Weyl-Heisenberg, or windowed Fourier transform), then the relevant tensor operators inherit this invariance property.  Thus a fast (nonlinear) reconstruction algorithm is possible.  This approach suggests a new signal representation model, where signals are not represented simply by vectors in a Hilbert space, but rather by operators in a larger dimensional Hilbert-Schmidt like-space, similar to the quantum state theory.  These methods use results from a wide range of mathematical areas such as harmonic analysis, operator theory, and polynomial algebras.<br/><br/>     Results of this project have a practical application to areas such as signal processing, optical communication, quantum computing, and X-ray crystallography.

Some of the results have led to instability criteria, whereas other results have led to index theorems relating the energy spectra to the (potentially) unstable linearized spectra. A common feature in all of this work is that the eigenvalue problems have been linear in the spectral parameter. This project is devoted to a study of a novel class of problems, the self-adjoint polynomial pencils, which are (a) a natural generalization of the self-adjoint linear pencils previously studied, and (b) arise quite naturally in the study of partial differential equations for which there are second-order or higher temporal derivatives.  In this research, index type theorems for these nonlinear eigenvalue problems, as well as instability criteria will be developed.  The mathematical tools that the Principal Investigator will use and refine are the analytic Evans function (e.g., the transmission coefficient in mathematical physics) and the recently developed meromorphic Krein matrix. Both of these tools have the property that eigenvalues for the linearized problem are realized as zeros (for the Krein matrix it is the zeros of the determinant). The successful conclusion of this project will shed light on how these tools relate to each other, and show ways that they can be jointly used to solve problems of interest to mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. Results of the research will be disseminated broadly through journal publications, and conference and seminar presentations.<br/> <br/>The results of this funded research will help both theoreticians and experimentalists better understand the dynamics of nonlinear waves in Hamiltonian systems, i.e., systems which conserve energy. Particular physical problems which are modeled by Hamiltonian systems include (a) the dynamics of matter waves in Bose-Einstein condensates, (b) wave propagation in fluids, and (c) light propagation in optical fibers. Much of the work funded by this grant will be collaborative, and colleagues, e.g., at Michigan State University, the University of Illinois, and the University of Kansas, will play an active role in the research.

These nonlinear filtering problems are non-Gaussian and can have large-dimensional state spaces.  DKF is based upon a particle filter and it does not suffer ensemble collapse because it has a built-in regeneration process in the parameterization of the diffusion process that defines the primary branches for prediction.  The method linearizes about branches of prediction, yet makes no Gaussian assumption in the analysis stage.  The EBV algorithm is used to find the best choices for branches of prediction, thus increasing the efficiency of the method significantly for application to important real-world problems such as oil spill modeling and pollution source identification, transport and dispersion of radioactive gases in the atmosphere, fish larvae transport and fishery connectivity, predicting sea ice motion, human colonization, mapping invasive species, and monitoring asteroid movements, to name a few.<br/><br/>     Observations of fluid flows and the trajectories of the flows are called Eulerian if the observations are taken from points fixed independent of the flows, and Lagrangian if they are taken from points that move with the flows themselves.  In the same way, a computational simulation of a flow is called Eulerian if the flow moves through a fixed computational grid, and Lagrangian if the grid moves with the flow.  The investigators develop a method to predict the trajectories of fluid flows, which are subject to random perturbations.  They apply the method to two problems where capturing features is critical: hurricane/typhoon tracking, and US Coast Guard search and rescue.  Both of these problems are of great societal importance because more optimal solutions with tighter error bars can save both lives and money.  For reasons of practicality they seek an efficient method that is also capable of (1) fusing multi-platform observations and numerical model simulations of ocean circulation for improving both the Eulerian, diagnostic variables of the model and prediction of Lagrangian trajectories, as well as the associated estimation uncertainties, and (2) handling already existing ensembles, fusing hurricane track forecast ensembles from the leading operational models (such as NCEP GFS, GFDL, UKMET, ECMWF, NOGAPS, others) to improve predictions of the path of tropical cyclones (hurricane, typhoon).  The method can help produce state-of-the-art uncertainty maps that are critical in search and rescue flight planning and for reducing the ""cone of uncertainty"" for operational hurricane predictions."

Despite its popularity, the search for near-optimal frames has been successful mostly in small dimensions, or it had to rely on specific group-representation properties, or the use of randomization principles.  In frame mechanics, the investigator is studying an alternative to the conventional, structured or random design methods by letting frames evolve under flows which drive them towards optimality, instead of constructing them directly.  The general objectives are to find (1) appropriate frame dynamics, (2) suitable initializations, and to obtain (3) deterministic control of the approximation error.  The envisioned outcome of the project includes leveraging recently established numerical results on the construction of equiangular tight frames for the verification of Zauner's conjecture (the existence of maximal Gabor frames in all finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces), constructing controlled approximations of Grassmannian frames and fusion frames for loss-insensitive transmissions in wireless or packet-based network communications, and the design of matrices for compressive sensing based on quantum chaotic dynamics which improve the restricted isometry properties of sensing matrices.<br/><br/>     The mathematics of redundant signal representations is called frame theory.  For practical purposes, a frame is a tool which incorporates or removes repetitive information when data is stored, transmitted or received.  Frames have become essential in many data-intensive areas of modern technology, because the repetitive information helps compensate errors of transmission devices and sensors.  However, over the last decades, progress in the optimal design of frames has been outpaced by the rapid growth of data generated by our hardware.  In frame mechanics, the investigator and his students explore a fundamentally new strategy to overcome this problem: The burden of constructing such optimal frames is put on the computer, which lets frames evolve in a way that drives them towards optimality.

The forcing will be chosen to mimic the global warming scenario. Therefore, the proposed research will elucidate the validity of stochastic parametrizations estimated from the present-day climate for other climatological conditions. We propose a novel technique for estimating parameters in stochastic parametrizations of small-scale processes from the data of the large (resolved) scales alone. In the course of the proposed research we will develop rigorous mathematical foundation for accurate estimation of parameters from the time-series of large scale.<br/><br/>Stochastic models (also known as stochastic parametrizations) play an important role in Global Circulation Models of the atmosphere and ocean. In particular, stochastic models represent small-scale physical  processes which cannot be sufficiently accurately resolved by modern  numerical methods. Typically, parameters in these stochastic models are estimated from the present-day climate. The key question is how stochastic parametrizations will change in response to global climate change.  In particular, estimation of stochastic models from time-series of large-scale structures can fail if the time-step of observation is too small. This is due to the fundamental differences between the trajectories of stochastic models and observed data. We will develop mathematical techniques to overcome this problem."

While there has been progress in describing these statistical properties for uniformly hyperbolic systems, uniform hyperbolicity seldom holds for physical systems and models based on non-uniform hyperbolicity are more realistic. Return time statistics quantify probabilities of a physical system transforming into or returning to a state in a certain period of time. Extreme value statistics give limit laws for successive maxima of a time series of observations on a system. Borel-Cantelli lemmas are a fundamental tool in establishing the almost-sure behavior of stochastic processes. The aim is to extend our understanding of these statistical properties to non-uniformly hyperbolic systems including those with polynomial correlation decay rate. A further goal is to obtain large deviation estimates for functions on dynamical systems with discontinuities (or singularities) or which give rise to multiplicative cocycles, such as matrix valued functions.<br/><br/><br/>Some physical systems are so complex that, although they may be modeled by mathematical equations, they are best described from the viewpoint of statistics. For example, knowing the probabilities of a hurricane located offshore affecting certain towns on the coast is useful information and more certain information usually cannot be given. However, it is a major problem that the classical statistical assumption of complete randomness (independence of successive observations) is seldom satisfied for realistic models of physical systems since successive observations are highly correlated.  Extreme value theory estimates the likelihood of observing an event of a certain magnitude, while large deviations estimates the probability of an outlier or rare event. This project aims to improve predictions of complex physical systems by providing an understanding of extreme value theory, large deviations and other statistics for a wide class of physically realistic mathematical models. The PI will also continue to work towards improving science education at all levels and by informing the public through outreach activities."

Recently, Coanda effect has been used in cardiology to describe the wall-hugging jets in mitral regurgitation: regurgitant blood flow through a leaky mitral valve sometimes hugs the wall of the left atrium which makes it difficult to assess the severity of mitral regurgitation using classical color Doppler imaging techniques.  Despite the large cardiovascular and biomedical literature reporting on the Coanda effect in echocardiography, a connection with the fluid dynamics studies that could help identify and understand the main features of the corresponding flow conditions is lacking. This project makes this connection and explores the fluid dynamics properties leading to the Coanda effect in a novel environment: moving geometries and time periodic flow conditions, which will include those encountered in patients with mitral regurgitation. The corresponding fluid dynamics problem is associated with the behavior of flow through an orifice at Reynolds numbers below turbulence. Coanda effect corresponds to the breaking of symmetry (a bifurcation) in the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations at certain Reynolds numbers and for certain orifice shapes. While flows through orifices have been extensively studied (numerically and experimentally) in the context of fixed orifices and fixed fluid domains, there have been no results that shed light on the flow conditions leading to Coanda effect in moving orifices under time-periodic pressure loads. This project addresses this problem by combining sophisticated computational methodology and analytical techniques associated with fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between a viscous, incompressible fluid, and an elastic structure. The methodology is based on a monolithic, semi-implicit algorithm to solve an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation of the underlying FSI problem, and on the corresponding energy estimates. Experimental validation of the mathematical models and computer simulations will be performed with the medical collaborators at the DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center in Houston.<br/><br/>Although over 50% of the US population has some degree of heart valve dysfunction, most cases do not require any medical treatment. In the cases when valve regurgitation is severe, failure of treatment can lead to arrhythmias, congestive heart failure and death. Doppler echocardiography is routinely used by physicians to diagnose and assess the severity of mitral valve regurgitation. The accurate assessment of valve regurgitation using echocardiography is, however, an ongoing challenge. In particular, regurgitant blood flow through a leaky mitral valve sometimes hugs the wall of the left atrium (known as the Coanda effect), which makes it difficult to see and measure the regurgitant volume. By using sophisticated mathematics, scientific computing, and experimental validation, the interdisciplinary team consisting of mathematicians and echocardiographic specialists, is investigating the blood flow conditions, and the shape of the regurgitant valves, that lead to the Coanda effect. This is a novel fluid-dynamics problem that has not been studied before due to the difficulties in resolving the interaction between blood flow and the moving regurgitant valve. By using a recently developed state-of-the-art computational algorithm that is capable of resolving this problem, and by developing novel mathematical techniques that will capture the bifurcation in the flow associated with Coanda effect, the results of this project will shed light on the complex intracardiac flow conditions associated with this phenomenon, and lead the way in designing novel protocols in echocardiographic assessment of mitral regurgitation. Students participate in all the aspects of this research. They are being trained in computer simulations, mathematical modeling, and in experimental validation of the mathematical models."

The first project aims at the characterization of limits of families of the vanishing viscosity, radial solutions to the multidimensional Euler equations with large, discontinuous data. The methods of compensated compactness will be adopted for systems of equations that do not possess invariant regions, using only the balance of total energy. In the second project the Principal Investigator will establish a new kinetic formulation for hyperbolic conservation laws. In this approach solutions of conservation laws are represented by probability measures on the phase space which, in turn, are represented as divergences of vector fields obtained as values of a  contraction semigroup on suitable Hilbert spaces.<br/><br/><br/>Hyperbolic systems of conservation laws are fundamental equations in physics. They model diverse  phenomena in dynamics of gases, elasticity, and electromagnetism. Because of their importance in applications these equations have been extensively studied. However, there is no complete theory that allows one solving the equations for generic data and describing properties of the solutions. The project introduces several innovative analytical tools to approach these issues and creates a theoretical basis for solving a large variety of equations of this type. The research will potentially have impact on the areas of computational and applied mathematics where the hyperbolic systems are involved.

Professor Hoffman will study the stability and interaction of coherent structures, i.e. exponentially localized traveling waves and pulses, in lattice differential equations (LDE).  This includes (i) multidimensional stability and interaction of planar fronts in discrete reaction diffusion equations; (ii) collision properties of solitary waves in Hamiltonian lattices such as the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice; (iii) strong interaction of coherent structures in dissipative systems such as annihilation of pulses in the discrete Fitzhugh-Nagumo equation; (iv) Stability of pushed fronts in unidirectional lattice differential equations such as those obtained from upwind discretization of advection-reaction equations or in cellular neural network models.  One advantage of working in the lattice setting is that existence and uniqueness is well-known, hence one can immediately turn to more detailed questions concerning the dynamics.  At the same time, the interaction between the continuous temporal dynamics and the discrete spatial structure can give rise to interesting and subtle phenomenon, such as fronts facing rational directions behaving differently from fronts facing irrational directions.<br/><br/>Nonlinear lattice differential equations are typically too complex to solve explicitly in the sense of writing down a formula in terms of known functions.  However, the methods of dynamical systems can be used to obtain less detailed information and this is often sufficient for the purposes of scientific inquiry.  For example, consider the following questions: As a crystal grows, what shape will it approach? As an alloy cools, how will its phase boundaries evolve? Given two signals propagating along the same fiber, how will they interact? At what rate will an invasive species encroach upon native habitat? The Principal Investigator is concerned with developing mathematical techniques to answer these and similar questions for idealized physical models that admit spatially discrete coherent structures.

Motivated by Kolmogorov's theory of turbulence, the project introduces a time-dependent dissipation wavenumber that separates low modes where the Euler dynamics is predominant from the high modes where the viscous forces take over. This frequency separation will be used to obtain new regularity criteria, uniqueness conditions, local wellposedness results, conditions preventing type I blow-up. The developed technique will also be applied to related equations. The methods to be used will combine harmonic analysis tools and classical techniques for the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations.<br/><br/>This research is devoted to several fundamental open questions concerning the equations of fluid motion. The equations were introduced almost two centuries ago but are still not well understood mathematically. Even though the equations are broadly used by physicists and engineers for real-life applications, and are widely believed to be an accurate representation of the physical phenomena involved, the existence and uniqueness of solutions is still not known. A mathematical proof of existence of solutions would justify the equations definitively. The proposed research is also expected to shed light on certain fundamental issues related to turbulence. Turbulence, often referred to as the last unsolved problem in classical physics, is a crucial phenomenon occurring in fluid flows around airplane bodies, vehicles, ships, and blades of turbines. A better mathematical understanding of turbulence will lead to improvements in the design of these objects."

Such singularities manifest themselves in mathematical equations when the underlying physical models lose validity on a given scale.  To study such systems, one must connect often quite disparate physical models arising at different length and time scales.  The investigator employs a combination of modern analytical and numerical methods introduced by him for the Onsager model of nematic liquid crystals and Keller-Segel model of bacterial chemotaxis.  In particular, he investigates liquid-crystalline systems such as polydisperse and biaxial nematics, smectics, and elastomers; phenomenon of formation and interaction of particle aggregates in bacterial chemotaxis.  He creates the Multiphysics Modeling Lab: a center for research and education in methods of mathematical modeling and computer simulations.

These nonlinear filtering problems are non-Gaussian and can have large-dimensional state spaces.  DKF is based upon a particle filter and it does not suffer ensemble collapse because it has a built-in regeneration process in the parameterization of the diffusion process that defines the primary branches for prediction.  The method linearizes about branches of prediction, yet makes no Gaussian assumption in the analysis stage.  The EBV algorithm is used to find the best choices for branches of prediction, thus increasing the efficiency of the method significantly for application to important real-world problems such as oil spill modeling and pollution source identification, transport and dispersion of radioactive gases in the atmosphere, fish larvae transport and fishery connectivity, predicting sea ice motion, human colonization, mapping invasive species, and monitoring asteroid movements, to name a few.<br/><br/>     Observations of fluid flows and the trajectories of the flows are called Eulerian if the observations are taken from points fixed independent of the flows, and Lagrangian if they are taken from points that move with the flows themselves.  In the same way, a computational simulation of a flow is called Eulerian if the flow moves through a fixed computational grid, and Lagrangian if the grid moves with the flow.  The investigators develop a method to predict the trajectories of fluid flows, which are subject to random perturbations.  They apply the method to two problems where capturing features is critical: hurricane/typhoon tracking, and US Coast Guard search and rescue.  Both of these problems are of great societal importance because more optimal solutions with tighter error bars can save both lives and money.  For reasons of practicality they seek an efficient method that is also capable of (1) fusing multi-platform observations and numerical model simulations of ocean circulation for improving both the Eulerian, diagnostic variables of the model and prediction of Lagrangian trajectories, as well as the associated estimation uncertainties, and (2) handling already existing ensembles, fusing hurricane track forecast ensembles from the leading operational models (such as NCEP GFS, GFDL, UKMET, ECMWF, NOGAPS, others) to improve predictions of the path of tropical cyclones (hurricane, typhoon).  The method can help produce state-of-the-art uncertainty maps that are critical in search and rescue flight planning and for reducing the ""cone of uncertainty"" for operational hurricane predictions."

If the current numerical waveforms are in fact accurate enough, the methods developed by this project could improve the computational efficiency of determining waveforms with a specified accuracy level, and thus reduce the cost of producing them."

This will include researchers from the US, Europe and Australia.  Further, a significant portion of the workshop attendees will include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty.  Researchers from lesser-known institutions within the southwestern US, specifically including members of the CalState system will be invited as well. In addition to the PI, Prof. W. McEneaney (UC San Diego), the organizers include Profs. W. Kang and A.J. Krener of the Naval Postgraduate School.  The website of the conference is http://www.nps.edu/Academics/Schools/GSEAS/Departments/Math/pdf_sources/MWCINC2.pdf .<br/><br/>Major developments in the theory of nonlinear control began taking place roughly a half-century ago. Of course, further advances in the theory have been made since. However, over the intervening decades, application of this theory has seriously lagged due to the lack of sufficiently fast and robust associated numerical methods. A particularly vexing problem has been the so-called curse-of-dimensionality, which loosely speaking, refers to the fact that standard numerical methods for these problems have been such that the computational requirements grow exponentially with problem complexity. In fact, numerous advances in control were partly motivated as means for avoiding this numerical bottleneck. In recent years, a number of remarkable new approaches have been developed to combat the fundamental computational difficulties. At this workshop, we will share ongoing developments in order to accelerate this progress."

This general framework includes the treatment of curl-free fields, divergence-free fields, symmetrized and higher order gradients, and fields that satisfy Maxwell's equations.  He studies necessary and sufficient conditions under which these functionals possess a minimizer, relaxation, supremal representation, homogenization, approximation via Gamma-convergence, and he investigates selected systems of partial differential equations that arise as the Aronsson equations associated to such functionals.  Previous work in this direction has been focused on the particular case where the admissible fields are gradients (curl-free); the corresponding issues for supremal functionals acting on fields subject to other differential constraints that appear naturally as balance laws have remained largely unaddressed.  An important goal of the project is to bridge this gap by pursuing a systematic study of supremal functionals in this generality.  The project aims to provide a unified view of the subject and, in particular, to reveal how the known properties of supremal functionals depending on gradients can be understood as a particular case in the broader context considered.  The analytical methods developed by the investigator and his collaborators are used to study selected problems in materials sciences that are described by means of explicit variational principles involving supremal functionals.  In particular, the project seeks to answer certain questions regarding the macroscopic behavior of polycrystals, and to elucidate several issues that come up in the study of granular materials, where new models are analyzed and used to study the flow of heterogeneous sand piles over given landscapes in the context of related Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problems. <br/><br/>     The project is motivated by specific questions about the behavior of polycrystalline and granular materials.  Such materials are very common: most metals found in nature are polycrystals; grains, coal, plastic, building materials (sand, gravel), and various powders and chemical compounds, are all examples of granular materials that are handled and stored on a daily basis.  Thus, understanding how to mix and transport them in an optimal fashion is an issue of natural interest.  Problems of practical importance where the more realistic approach is to minimize the supremum rather than the average of certain quantities are ubiquitous in many other areas, such as nonlinear elasticity, image processing, damage and fracture mechanics, plasticity, and semiconductor design.  It is expected that the methods developed within this project will be relevant to an extensive range of applications, beyond those considered here explicitly.  The broader impacts of the project are also achieved through training of graduate and undergraduate students, who are exposed to modern developments in applied analysis and are involved in projects related to the proposal, as well as through other educational and outreach activities."

The project will use nonlinear dynamics and complex network techniques and will be implemented through five complementary components of broad significance:  the development of (1) deterministic and (2) stochastic methods to identify rescues; the application of these methods to (3) mitigate extinction cascades in perturbed food-web networks, (4) recover lost cellular function in  defective metabolic networks, and (5) control cascading failures in power-grid networks.

The objective of an optimal stopping problem is to determine optimal decision timing to maximize reward in the face of uncertainty modeled by a stochastic process. The objective of a first passage problem is to determine the probability distribution of the first time a stochastic process passes through a boundary. These mathematical problems arise in a wide variety of applications in financial mathematics, including modeling credit risk (the risk of default of a borrower on its debt, such as a corporate bond), evaluating financial contracts with early exercise rights, such as American-style options and callable and convertible bonds, and real options. The class of Markov processes under study are jump-diffusion processes that can be constructed by stochastic time changes of one-dimensional diffusions. The methods developed in this project are based on representing conditional expectation operators associated with Markov processes by eigenfunction expansions. Efficient computational algorithms will be developed for Markov processes whose eigenfunctions are expressed in terms of orthogonal polynomials.  Many of the most important stochastic processes in financial mathematics belong to this category, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and constant elasticity of variance (CEV) diffusions, as well as pure jump and jump-diffusion processes arising from time changing these diffusions.<br/><br/>The novel analytical methods and computational algorithms developed in this project will be applied to a range of problems in financial mathematics in the areas of modeling credit risk and evaluating financial contracts with early exercise rights in a variety of markets, including bond markets, equity markets, commodities and energy markets, and to real options and irreversible investment decisions. The mathematical methods developed in this project will help financial institutions to accurately evaluate and manage the risk of a variety of financial transactions. They will also help non-financial firms make better managerial decisions by facilitating applications of real options analysis. The project is expected to have a broader mathematical impact on research on optimal stopping and first passage problems. The project will also have an impact on education and human resources development.

Applications to a number of significant problems, such as pattern-forming reaction-diffusion problems and drug delivery problems, will be investigated. Unlike regular diffusion, in anomalous diffusion the mean square displacement behaves as a power function of time. If the exponent is less than one the diffusion process is slower than normal diffusion (subdiffusion), and if the exponent is greater than one it is faster than normal (superdiffusion). Mathematical description of anomalous diffusion involves integro-differential operators which have to be derived from appropriate continuous time random walk models and leads to novel mathematical problems. Specifically, the investigators study<br/>(i) Pattern formation in growing domains, both for normal diffusion and anomalous diffusion, focusing on the singular perturbation case when some of the diffusion coefficients are asymptotically small;<br/>(ii) Turing pattern selection in reaction - anomalous diffusion systems, in particular, the stripes-spots selection;<br/>(iii)  Drug delivery problems which include development of an approximate analytic theory of subdiffusive problems with moving free boundaries; study of models of bioerodible controlled drug delivery devices governed by subdiffusive transport of the chemicals, transdermal drug release in the presence of an electric field i.e. accompanied by iontophoresis and others.<br/><br/>Controlled drug delivery has been attracting a great deal of attention in the medical community for years as an efficient way of providing treatment for a wide class of diseases. Various drug delivery devices are based on mass transfer of the given drug towards particular organs, in which either the mass transfer rate, or place, or both are prescribed according to certain medical protocols. Much progress has been achieved in the design and development of various controlled drug delivery systems, and many people routinely take medicine designed for controlled release. Mathematical modeling of drug delivery systems is very important since it can provide a better understanding and a quantitative description of the physical, chemical and biological processes governing the performance of the systems. On the basis of this description, better controlled drug delivery systems can be designed. There exists experimental evidence that drug diffusion toward the biological target is not normal but rather slow, so-called sub-diffusion, as the drug molecule has to diffuse through a very crowded environment. The investigators will study drug transport governed by sub-diffusion in order to obtain better understanding of drug delivery processes. In addition, the investigators will study problems of pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems where subdiffusion, as well as superdiffusion are important. The latter is typical of some processes in plasmas, semiconductors, surface reactions and many others. Training of a PhD student through this research is an integral part of the project."

The dynamics of these systems inevitably involve uncertainty. For example, in ecosystem modeling, the population dynamics of a general ecosystem possess two salient features: (i) there is day-to-day jitter that causes minor fluctuations as well as big population loss caused by rare events such as epidemics, earthquakes, and tsunamis; and (ii) there are qualitative changes in the system stemming from the fact that the growth rates and carrying capacities of many species often vary according to changes in nutrition, water supply, and/or food resources. Similar phenomena are observed in the dynamics of insurance risk processes, the price of a risky asset, and others. These features make the usual models in the literature inadequate in describing such complex systems. The proposed project aims to take into these inherent random forces and propose stochastic processes and related control problems that are general and flexible, yet mathematically tractable, in dealing with these real-world applications. It presents novel stochastic processes for modeling and analysis of complex systems, obtains long-time behavior of such systems, develops singular control theories, and designs numerical schemes for the control problems.

The<br/>investigator undertakes a long-term research program, with the<br/>scope of: deriving lower-dimensional shell theories through the<br/>methods of Gamma-convergence and understanding their connections<br/>with the geometry of the mid-surface, analyzing the<br/>(infinitesimal) isometries of surfaces and the effects of<br/>rigidity on the derived theories, studying nonlinear phenomena<br/>such as buckling and blistering for a given shell under<br/>compression (one application is related to plant growth).  The<br/>second set of questions in this project relates to fluid<br/>dynamics.  Boundary irregularities of various structures and<br/>scales are considered in the limit when the boundary behavior<br/>becomes degenerate.  Other problems concern traveling fronts in<br/>combustion in unbounded channels, and the dynamics of solutions<br/>with large initial data under the Navier boundary conditions in<br/>thin three-dimensional shells. <br/><br/>     Because elastic thin (or otherwise ""degenerate"") objects of<br/>various geometries are ubiquitous in the physical world, the<br/>precise understanding of laws governing their equilibria has many<br/>potential applications.  For example, many growing tissues<br/>(leaves, flowers, or marine invertebrates) exhibit complicated<br/>configurations during their free growth and one would like to<br/>reproduce them with man-made means.  A related long-standing<br/>problem in the mathematical theory of elasticity is to rigorously<br/>predict theories of such lower-dimensional objects starting from<br/>the nonlinear theory of full three-dimensional objects.  For<br/>plates, a very recent effort has lead to rigorous justification<br/>of a hierarchy of such theories, depending on the magnitude of<br/>the applied forces and resulting in stretching, crumpling,<br/>bending, or a combination of these.  For shells (when the<br/>mid-surface is curved), despite extensive use of their ad hoc<br/>generalizations in the literature and engineering applications,<br/>much less is known from the mathematical point of view.  The<br/>investigator identifies several nonlinear problems in continuum<br/>mechanics of solids and fluid dynamics, naturally posed in<br/>specific degenerate domains, with the intention of rigorously<br/>understanding the behavior of the system based on general<br/>principles.  At the heart of the program are interesting<br/>connections between calculus of variations, differential<br/>equations, geometry, material science, fluid dynamics, numerical<br/>analysis, and even biology.  They have a potential to deliver<br/>useful observations in e.g. structural mechanics, while<br/>integrating the goal of exposing scientific results to a broader<br/>community at various education levels. <br/>"

Subspace segmentation and clustering of high-dimensional data drawn from a union of subspaces are especially important with many practical applications in computer vision, image and signal processing, communications, and information theory.  For example, recent paradigms for reconstructing signals assume models that consist of union of subspaces, e.g., the reconstruction of signals with finite rates of innovation.  Another example is in compressed sampling where signals are assumed to be sparse in some basis or in some dictionary.  This assumption implies that the signals live in a union of subspaces.  The subspace clustering problem in computer vision is yet another important example in which data are drawn from a union of low-dimensional subspaces.  Thus, a mathematical framework for finding such models from observed data is fundamental.  In this project the investigator develops a mathematical framework together with algorithms for data modeling in terms of union of subspaces and manifolds.  The mathematical theory is connected to the geometry of Hilbert and Banach spaces, topology, nonlinear approximation, optimization, and probability.<br/><br/>     The investigator develops a mathematical framework and algorithms for describing data by representing them as composed of components that live in restricted sets of the data space, for instance, in subspaces or manifolds.

The first equation is for the determining modes of a differential equation of Navier-Stokes type. A set of low modes is determining, if for any solution on the global attractor, the high modes of the solution for all time, can be produced from only the low modes (for all time). Extending this relationship to the Banach space of bounded functions from the reals into the low modes leads to a determining form, an evolution equation that is globally Lipschitz, and dissipative. The global attractor of the original differential equation is contained in the long time behavior of the determining form.  This provides an alternative to the theory of inertial forms which is not known to be applicable to the Navier-Stokes equations. The other evolution equation is for the radius of analyticity in the spatial variable.  We will use this equation to study the domain of analyticity for solutions on the global attractor and its effect on aspects of fluid flow such as intermittency.<br/><br/>Fluid motions at large scales, for instance in ocean and atmosphere, display erratic, seemingly incomprehensible (turbulent) features when viewed locally and for short times.

The purpose of this research is to develop a rigorous understanding of the nature and origin of such patterns, and of deviations from it, with a view towards diverse applications such as ocean modeling and weather forecasting. For instance, weather forecasting is done by solving a large system of equations which model the state of the atmosphere over a period of time.<br/>The current state of the atmosphere is needed as input in order to compute the state in the future.  As there are always limited measurements of the state of the system, this input inevitably contains some error. The inherent sensitivity of the system to such an error means that as time goes on the computed solution diverges from reality. The technique of data assimilation uses the limited measurements of the system at not just a single moment of time, but rather over an extended time period in the past, to arrive at a more accurate input.  This project applies recent mathematical discoveries to develop new variations on this technique. It will lead to new algorithms that will be implemented and tested by the research team.

This general framework includes the treatment of curl-free fields, divergence-free fields, symmetrized and higher order gradients, and fields that satisfy Maxwell's equations.  He studies necessary and sufficient conditions under which these functionals possess a minimizer, relaxation, supremal representation, homogenization, approximation via Gamma-convergence, and he investigates selected systems of partial differential equations that arise as the Aronsson equations associated to such functionals.  Previous work in this direction has been focused on the particular case where the admissible fields are gradients (curl-free); the corresponding issues for supremal functionals acting on fields subject to other differential constraints that appear naturally as balance laws have remained largely unaddressed.  An important goal of the project is to bridge this gap by pursuing a systematic study of supremal functionals in this generality.  The project aims to provide a unified view of the subject and, in particular, to reveal how the known properties of supremal functionals depending on gradients can be understood as a particular case in the broader context considered.  The analytical methods developed by the investigator and his collaborators are used to study selected problems in materials sciences that are described by means of explicit variational principles involving supremal functionals.  In particular, the project seeks to answer certain questions regarding the macroscopic behavior of polycrystals, and to elucidate several issues that come up in the study of granular materials, where new models are analyzed and used to study the flow of heterogeneous sand piles over given landscapes in the context of related Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problems. <br/><br/>     The project is motivated by specific questions about the behavior of polycrystalline and granular materials.  Such materials are very common: most metals found in nature are polycrystals; grains, coal, plastic, building materials (sand, gravel), and various powders and chemical compounds, are all examples of granular materials that are handled and stored on a daily basis.  Thus, understanding how to mix and transport them in an optimal fashion is an issue of natural interest.  Problems of practical importance where the more realistic approach is to minimize the supremum rather than the average of certain quantities are ubiquitous in many other areas, such as nonlinear elasticity, image processing, damage and fracture mechanics, plasticity, and semiconductor design.  It is expected that the methods developed within this project will be relevant to an extensive range of applications, beyond those considered here explicitly.  The broader impacts of the project are also achieved through training of graduate and undergraduate students, who are exposed to modern developments in applied analysis and are involved in projects related to the proposal, as well as through other educational and outreach activities."

This proposal is concerned with a mathematical investigation of transmission eigenvalues in electromagnetic scattering theory and the application of these results to problems in nondestructive testing.  Until now research on transmission eigenvalues and their applications has concentrated on the case when the scatterer is a dielectric. Even in this restricted case, only partial results are available when the the scatterer has cavities, cracks  or inclusions (such situations are of course important in nondestructive testing). The investigators plan to  extend  these existing  results for dielectrics  to the case when the scatterer may have cavities, cracks or inclusions as well as being absorbing or dispersive.

Unfortunately, in many areas of national importance simple and effective methods for testing material for structural imperfections is still in its infancy.  In this proposal the investigators will mathematically  examine the possibility of using a newly discovered data set that can be obtained from the interrogation of materials by electromagnetic waves. This data set consists of what are called ""transmission eigenvalues""  and such eigenvalues carry information about the structural stability of the material being tested.  In order to utilize these eigenvalues for the nondestructive testing of realistic materials it is necessary to examine the case when the material being tested is partially conducting, i.e. can absorb energy from the interrogating electromagnetic wave as well as the case when the material properties are frequency dependent, i.e. the material is ""dispersive"".  This project is devoted to the problem of understanding 1) what information  transmission eigenvalues provide about absorbing and dispersive  material which may have imperfections and 2) how these transmission eigenvalues can be effectively determined from the measured scattering data."

In the case of radar imaging the receivers are passive; hence separating their motion from the active emitters allows receivers alone to be flown in an unsafe environment. In sonar, data collection involves the receivers towed behind the boat transmitting the sound source. In ultrasound tomography separate emitter and receiver can provide data sets, for example, of high angular resolution.

Such uncertainty may be caused by lack of reliable data, measurement errors, future and unobservable events, and so on. A common approach to tackling such uncertainty is by introducing a probability distribution on the parameters. The resulting problem is a stochastic variational inequality, which aims to find the ""average"" equilibrium status.  Stochastic variational inequalities have been used to model a wide variety of problems in energy market analysis, communication network modeling, transportation planning, inventory management, and other areas.

For long time scale events such as chemical reactions the investigator introduces a new branching process that focuses computational effort on reactive trajectories as well as new parallel-in-time techniques to better utilize today's massively parallel supercomputers on problems involving electronic structure calculations.  Finally the investigator rigorously establishes connections between various fine scale models of crystal relaxation and continuum descriptions.  Continuum descriptions offer the possibility of reaching much longer time scales computational by removing strongly correlated degrees of freedom.<br/><br/>     The investigator develops new techniques for studying phenomena that occur over long time scales or involve rare events.  The techniques are applied to important problems such as exoplanet discovery, the prediction of rare transitions of the Kuroshio current running along the eastern coast of Japan, crystal surface growth, and several challenging chemical and bio-chemical problems.  In general, techniques capable of reaching long time scales and simulating rare events have the potential to significantly impact many problems crucial to our national interests, e.g. drug design, global warming, hazard prediction for CO2 and nuclear waste storage, prediction of extreme geological events like earth quakes and volcanic eruptions, prediction of extreme weather events like hurricanes, prediction of extreme climate events like draughts, drug validation, deep time analysis (analysis of the geologic record), discovery of extra terrestrial life and life in extreme environments, and disease propagation.  Even with the massive computing power currently available these problems are not expected to be solved by conventional ""brute force"" techniques any time soon.  Techniques designed to directly interrogate the phenomena of interest and to make more efficient use of large-scale computing power are required.  The development and analysis of these techniques form the core of this project.<br/>"

The first equation is for the determining modes of a differential equation of Navier-Stokes type. A set of low modes is determining, if for any solution on the global attractor, the high modes of the solution for all time, can be produced from only the low modes (for all time). Extending this relationship to the Banach space of bounded functions from the reals into the low modes leads to a determining form, an evolution equation that is globally Lipschitz, and dissipative. The global attractor of the original differential equation is contained in the long time behavior of the determining form.  This provides an alternative to the theory of inertial forms which is not known to be applicable to the Navier-Stokes equations. The other evolution equation is for the radius of analyticity in the spatial variable.  We will use this equation to study the domain of analyticity for solutions on the global attractor and its effect on aspects of fluid flow such as intermittency.<br/><br/>Fluid motions at large scales, for instance in ocean and atmosphere, display erratic, seemingly incomprehensible (turbulent) features when viewed locally and for short times. However, over time, consistent global statistical patterns emerge. The purpose of this research is to develop a rigorous understanding of the nature and origin of such patterns, and of deviations from it, with a view towards diverse applications such as ocean modeling and weather forecasting. For instance, weather forecasting is done by solving a large system of equations which model the state of the atmosphere over a period of time.<br/>The current state of the atmosphere is needed as input in order to compute the state in the future.  As there are always limited measurements of the state of the system, this input inevitably contains some error. The inherent sensitivity of the system to such an error means that as time goes on the computed solution diverges from reality. The technique of data assimilation uses the limited measurements of the system at not just a single moment of time, but rather over an extended time period in the past, to arrive at a more accurate input.  This project applies recent mathematical discoveries to develop new variations on this technique. It will lead to new algorithms that will be implemented and tested by the research team.  Graduate students will play an essential role in this collaborative effort, thus serving to train future generation of scientists in the STEM disciplines."

The main objects studied in toric varieties are the equivariant Chow ring, the homogenous coordinate ring of a toric variety embedded by a very ample divisor, and toric codes. The questions are to better understand how combinatorics and geometry (of the fan defining the toric variety, or of the polytope defining the divisor) manifests in the Chow ring, in the homogeneous coordinate ring, and in the associated toric code. The main object studied in hyperplane arrangements is the module of logarithmic one forms. In particular, Terao's conjecture that the freeness of this module is combinatorially determined is one of the main open questions in the field. The PI will also study the LCS and Chen ranks of the fundamental group, and their connection to resonance varieties.<br/><br/>Two of the three toric projects have significant real world applications: the Chow ring of a toric variety is simply the ring of splines: such objects are central in numerical analysis (for example, in solving partial differential equations, which are crucial to much of applied mathematics), and in geometric modelling. Toric codes are a generalization of the Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller codes used in signal processing and data compression. Advances in coding theory could lead to more efficient transmission of data over noisy communication channels. Software will be developed for the NSF sponsored Macaulay2 platform, and made publicly available, benefitting researchers in many different areas. For example, toric varieties are widely used as test cases for mirror symmetry in mathematical physics.

Linear dispersive effects play a fundamental role in the study of a large number of physical scenarios and there has been an explosion of results concerning semi-linear dispersive equations.  Nevertheless there are situations in which the speed of propagation of a wave depends on the wave's frequency as well as its amplitude.  That is to say the mechanism which generates dispersion is nonlinear.  It is the purpose of this project to develop mathematically rigorous theory for such equations when the nonlinear dispersive effects are degenerate (i.e., they vanish very rapidly as the amplitude tends to zero). The degeneracy of the equations allows for the existence of classical solutions which are not smooth and there is substantial numerical and formal evidence that cases arise in which degenerate dispersion leads to catastrophic instability akin to that of a backwards heat equation.  Consequently, one of the principal goals of the project is to develop the existence theory for degenerate dispersive partial differential equations.<br/><br/>Degenerate dispersive equations arise as models for the dynamics of chains and lattices of hard spheres.  Experimental results demonstrate that such chains exhibit tightly focused pulses which are easily generated and highly tunable. These narrow pulses are expected to find uses in non-destructive testing, shock absorption, remote sensing and medical imaging.  At this time, there is no theoretically rigorous explanation for the stability and robust nature of these pulses. Though there are results concerning similar physical problems where the dispersive effects are not degenerate, they rely strongly on the fact that slow moving pulses are very wide and very small in amplitude.  In the case of hard spheres, the interesting pulse solutions have a fixed width, independent of speed and amplitude and it is not obvious how to extend the known results to this case.  A primary goal of the project is developing mathematical tools for the study of the stability and robustness of such pulses. The inclusion and training of graduate and undergraduate students is an integral part of this project. Among other projects, undergraduate students will be involved into investigation of an important application, models for traffic flow."

Traditionally, the hydrostatic approximation balance, in the vertical momentum equation, has been applied to reduce the computational burden.  Recently, the investigators have made significant progress in the rigorous understanding of the properties of the solutions to these models.  However, it is still impossible to use present computing resources to simulate this large system for the wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  Therefore, there is a need to further simplify these models to focus on understanding and simulating certain localized smaller-scale phenomena, such as the geostrophic adjustment of frontal anomalies in a rotating continuously stratified fluid of strictly rectilinear fronts and jets, and rapidly rotating convection which, according to the Taylor-Proudman constraint, takes place in tall columnar structures.  The development of fast, accurate, and reliable numerical models of the climate system is key to understanding and predicting the magnitude and distribution of future climate variability.   The focus of this project is to provide rigorous justification to these simplified models of the dynamics of the atmosphere and the oceans, and to investigate their long-term behavior.  The investigators study the questions of existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on the initial data of the solutions to these models.  This is the first, and the most crucial step, in justifying the derivation of these models and their consistency with the physical observations.<br/><br/>     There are numerous governing equations to fully describe the dynamics of climate.  It is impossible to use present computing resources to simulate this large system for the wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  Indeed, in order to understand, for example, the mechanism of atmospheric and oceanic turbulence, and to properly predict the climate, it is necessary to provide simplified and reliable models that contain the main features of the underlying physical phenomena.   The investigators focus on the development of novel, theoretical and computational, mathematical tools for investigating these simplified models, and on justifying their derivation in order to enhance our understanding of fluid dynamics models and the climate system and its predictability.   The training of undergraduate and graduate students with analytical and computational skills is also achieved through this study."

As a typical phenomenon, small organisms in the ocean called copepods let themselves slowly sink while agitating the fluid around them.  Copepods form massive colonies and their collective motion helps bringing up nutrients, which are crucial to the organisms' reproduction, from deeper layers of the ocean.  The stirring of a fluid by such swimming creatures is called biomixing. We will investigate biomixing from a variety of directions: we will model specific microorganisms, and use novel mathematical techniques to quantify their impact on fluid mixing.  We will also compare the motion of these organisms as they sink to the dynamics of sedimenting particles, to see which aspects of the accumulated knowledge on sedimenting particles carry over to microorganisms, and which new features are introduced.<br/><br/>It is well known that mixing is greatly enhanced by fluid motion--even the simple task of heating a house would be almost impossible without air convection.  Biomixing has a wide range of possible applications, beyond immediate relevance to the fluid dynamics of microswimmers.  An understanding of the impact of swimming microorganisms on mixing will help understanding phenomena such as oil breakup by bacteria, which is crucial in the aftermath of oil spills, or the life cycle of large colonies of organisms.  The well-being of these colonies has a profound impact on climate change, since they absorb vast amounts of greenhouse gases. In addition, there are potential applications to microfluidics, where stirring by microorganisms can assist mixing at small scales. The inclusion of graduate students into this research, and their interdisciplinary training are an integral part of this project."

The first project centers on reaction-diffusion models for chemical patterns involving waves, fronts, pulses, and spots. The theoretical framework of semi-strong interaction theory and renormalization group theory, which the PI helped develop, will be used to understand the dynamics of scattering and pinning in multi-component reaction-diffusion systems, as well as the stability of traveling waves in a reaction-diffusion-advection model of bioremediation.   In the second project, the PI will study R-D equations in two space dimensions with cut-off functions on the reaction terms. These cut-offs accurately model regions of low concentrations. The principal goal is to analyze the impact of these cut-offs on the speeds and stability of propagating fronts. This will build on the PI's pioneering use of geometric desingularization to find analytical formulas for wave speeds with cut-offs in 1-D, which match well the numerical data. In the third project, the PI will continue his long-term analysis and development of accurate model reduction methods.  These are used in large-scale combustion, chemical, and biochemical systems exhibiting multiple time scales, to find low-dimensional manifolds that govern the effective dynamics. The new research will build on the PI's earlier analysis of the most commonly-used model reduction methods including the ILDM and CSP methods and will take this project to the next level by developing and analyzing methods that find low-dimensional manifolds in the presence of diffusion. In the fourth project, the new phenomena of canards in PDEs will be investigated, as will the new phenomenon of torus canards in mathematical neuroscience models.<br/><br/><br/>The PI will conduct research on scientific problems exhibiting multiple time scales and multiple length scales, with the goals of explaining recent experiments, of analyzing computational methods, and of developing new mathematical theory. The first project centers on patterns and waves in chemical and biological systems, with the goal of modeling the interactions between stripes and spots. Traveling waves in models of bioremediation will also be studied. Bioremediation is the process by which microorganisms are induced to degrade environmentally-harmful organic compounds in soil. The PI has established fundamental properties of these traveling waves, and will determine the operating parameters, such as injection rates, that lead to stable bioremediation within the models. In the second project, the PI aims to model the more challenging and realistic problem of front propagation in two space dimensions in the presence of cut-offs. Determination of how cut-offs change the speeds and stability of the fronts will be useful in physics, in particular for many-particle systems in statistical physics. In the third project, the PI will focus on model reduction methods that are critical for combustion science, large-scale reaction networks in chemistry and biochemistry, and in gene regulatory modeling. Despite the ever-advancing speed of computational methods, understanding of these large-scale reaction systems depends critically on the analysis of tractable low-dimensional reduced models. In the fourth project, canards are solutions that stay near unstable system states for relatively long periods of time. The new types of canards to be studied are important in mathematical neuroscience for understanding the transitions between fundamental states, such as tonic spiking and bursting. All of the above planned research will have broader scientific impacts.  More than half of the PhD students and postdocs who will work on these projects are women, as is the case for the twenty PhD students and postdoctoral fellows whom the PI has supervised to date.

KMC is especially useful for exploring the dynamics of atomistic scale crystal growth problems, many of which have a significant bearing on nanotechnology.  The essence of the idea is to coarse-grain a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.  While MD is conceptually simple, robust, and faithful to the underlying physics, it is hopelessly slow in many instances.  This problem is particularly apparent when simulating the evolution of crystalline solids, where individual atoms hover for long periods of time in basins of attraction before making occasional transitions to neighboring configurations.  When the crystal is well defined, an alternative model that replaces the Newtonian dynamics with a Markov chain readily suggests itself: One replaces the original configuration space with an occupation array for a crystal lattice that idealizes the arrangement of the basins of attraction, and introduces transition probabilities based on transition state theory.  Clearly, such a scheme works best when the crystal is uniform -- free of dislocations, grain boundaries, impurities and surface structures.  Unlike MD, KMC models have to be carefully adapted to handle these sorts of irregularities.  While this is complicated and requires specialized simulation software in each case, the payoff is the ability to perform simulations on the scale of nano-devices -- something that is essentially impossible with MD.  In this project, the principal investigator addresses two specific challenges to KMC modeling of crystal growth.  The first is modeling of crystal-melt interfaces, melt-vapor interfaces and tri-junctions, with the aim of applying the model to the growth of nanowires.  The second is the motion of grain boundaries within a polycrystal.<br/><br/>     Technology, particularly within the micro-electronic industries, is increasingly focused on smaller and smaller devices.  As a result, it is now important to be able to simulate device manufacturing and performance on atomic length scales.  There are relatively few computational tools that can resolve the atomic scale behavior of a complicated system containing, say, a few thousand atoms.  One of the more promising approaches is kinetic Monte Carlo -- a model that approximates the atomic scale motion of atoms that have perfect stacking arrangements, i.e., that form perfect crystals.  Crystals are, however, idealizations, and they feature many defects that require special consideration.  Any atomic scale devices attached to crystals would similarly require special treatment.  This project is aimed at extending kinetic Monte Carlo models so that they can handle such irregularities.  The project is funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Division of Materials Research."

The project combines several topics: numerical analysis, discrete Fourier analysis, orthogonal polynomials, and approximation theory.  Two approaches are emphasized.  The first approach is based on a connection between cubature rules and discrete Fourier analysis with translation tiling.  The approach allows one to study, in several stages, cubature rules and interpolation by exponential functions on the fundamental domain of the translation tiling, by trigonometric functions on the fundamental simplex of the domain, and by algebraic polynomials on corresponding domains, and it yields results on cubature rules, interpolation, orthogonal polynomials and approximation.

This line of work is based on recent results of the investigator and his collaborators that for some problems it is necessary to work with these angles, even though their number is much larger than the dimension.<br/><br/>     Cubature rules, which are multidimensional numerical integration formulas, and approximation on regular domains in higher dimensional spaces are fundamental tools in a variety of applications, because most integrals can only be evaluated numerically and very few problems can be evaluated exactly.  At the current stage, in contrast to the situation in one dimension, many fundamental problems in these two areas have not been resolved, despite increasing need for them in applications.  The project aims at finding new methods to construct numerically efficient algorithms, such as accurate cubature rules with fewer nodes, fast discrete Fourier transforms, and approximation operators on regular domains such as cubes, balls, spheres and simplexes.  The algorithms have applications in scientific computing, imaging, statistics, and geosciences."

The study is divided into two independent projects. The first project concerns the stability properties of one-dimensional sources of reaction-diffusion systems that are temporally- and spatially-periodic traveling waves with defects. Pointwise Green function and Evans function techniques are exploited to investigate nonlinear stability and long-time dynamics of sources. The second project regards the vanishing viscosity limit problem of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of impermeable boundaries. Topics that will be addressed include the well-posedness of the Prandtl boundary-layer equation, the validity of asymptotic boundary-layer expansions, and fluid-structure interactions. The primary goal of these projects is to provide a mathematically rigorous investigation into these structural solutions and boundary-layer phenomena in fluid dynamics. <br/><br/>The mathematical research projects that will be undertaken are motivated by many scientific disciplines including oceanography, aerodynamics, fluid dynamics, and the dynamics of biological and chemical reactions. The objects of this study, namely traveling waves, boundary layers, and coherent structures, their stability properties and their dynamics are of fundamental importance in biology, engineering, and physics. The primary goal of this research is to provide mathematical understanding of the stability properties of these structural solutions and to develop analytical methods that can be of practical use in biology, engineering, physics, and manufacturing. Among many others, one particular practical use of the study of boundary layers is to provide fundamental principles that help engineers to calculate the friction drag of a ship, an airfoil, or the body of an airplane, and to help determining an efficient shape of the body in order to minimize the friction drag and to reduce turbulence. Another objective of this research is to study the effect of viscosity in fluid motion, and to mathematically justify phenomena related to boundary layers that have been observed in experiments. Results of this research will be disseminated through presentations at national and international conferences, seminars and publications in scientific journals."

For this purpose, the investigator makes use of suitable generalizations of the linear comparison homogenization methods for these material systems, incorporating the effects both of crystallographic texture and of morphological texture (as determined by the two-point correlations of the microstructures).  The main mathematical challenge arises as a consequence of the lack of convexity (or, more precisely, quasi-convexity) of the relevant energy functions.  It is known that this breakdown of convexity leads to the development of additional microstructures at the single crystal level, which lies at the heart of the shape-memory effect.  Because of this, linear comparison estimates are also developed for the ""relaxation"" (or quasi-convexification) of single-crystal shape-memory alloys (SMAs), exploiting a recently uncovered connection between homogenization at the polycrystal level and relaxation at the single-crystal level.  The project results in novel and highly efficient multi-scale modeling techniques capable of handling complex microstructures, coupled strongly nonlinear response, microstructure evolution, and the possible development of instabilities.  The mathematical techniques developed in this work are of broad application to large classes of polymeric, metallic, biological, and geological material systems, including multi-functional materials, and lend themselves to numerical implementation in constitutive subroutines for use with standard numerical packages.<br/><br/>     The shape-memory effect is the ability of certain materials to recover, upon heating, apparently permanent deformation sustained below a certain critical temperature.  This effect is usually accompanied by pseudo-elasticity whereby single-crystal samples of these materials are observed to undergo fairly large strains (in the order of 10%) at nearly constant stress, which is fully recovered upon unloading.  These two properties make shape-memory alloys (SMAs) very attractive as low-frequency, robust actuators and sensing devices for a variety of novel technological applications.  However, SMAs are normally used in polycrystalline form, typically as wires, or thin strips and films, where the shape-memory effect is much reduced.  For this reason, it is essential to understand and model the relations between the single-crystal behavior, the microstructure, and the macroscopic behavior of the polycrystals.  Improvements in the modeling of SMA polycrystals should result in improved performance for these materials, which are being used extensively in industry, as actuators, sensors, couplings, and electrical connectors, as well as in an ever increasing number of medical and robotics applications."

These systems often exhibit dissipation that is considered to be negligible or weak. However, recent work by the investigators and recently published observations of dissipation rates of ocean swell, show that the models using weak dissipation provide an inadequate description of some aspects of the evolution of nonlinear surface water waves. Thus, a main emphasis of this research is to develop a theory from first principles for the propagation and evolution of nonlinear surface water waves on a viscous fluid, with no approximation on the size of dissipation. The research addresses several projects that build on this notion and/or are intended to apply the mathematical results to ocean applications. The projects fall into two categories: A) surface waves propagating on a viscous fluid and B) waves in shallow or finite-depth water. The investigators will approach these problems by combining their individual strengths in modeling and analysis, numerical simulations, and physical experiments to obtain a fundamental mathematical description of the physical phenomena. They will then use publicly available data from ocean observations to apply their results to ocean settings.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this research is to understand at a fundamental, mathematical level the propagation of waves on a surface of water, and to apply this understanding to observations of waves measured in the laboratory and in the oceans. Particular applications include the effects of dissipation on the generation of waves by wind, the subsequent propagation of ocean swell, and the development of rogue waves in shallow and deep water; predicting dangerous versus benign tsunamis given the Richter-scale measure of the magnitude of the responsible earthquake and some readily available information about the geology of its location; and modeling large-amplitude waves on beaches with variable bathymetry using the new mathematical approaches investigated here. In addition, the mathematical results are expected to describe nonlinear waves in several settings, including light waves in an optical fiber, spin waves in a thin magnetic film and others. Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored and involved in experimental studies and theoretical analysis; through this project they will receive training in interdisciplinary research."

In particular, ramified optimal transportation is used to model the transport economy of scale in group transportation observed widely in both nature (e.g. trees, river channel networks) and efficiently designed transport systems of branching structures (e.g. railway configurations and postage delivery networks). The proposed optimal allocation problem is the prototype for a class of problems (e.g. optimal storage problem) arising in mathematical economics. It aims at finding an optimal allocation plan as well as an associated optimal allocation path to minimize overall cost of transporting commodity from factories to households. Also, the proposed dynamic model for mud cracking not only increases our understanding about mud cracking but also may be useful in predicting the position of future cracking of a similar material (e.g. a prediction of an earth quake), and hence provide increased public safety.

The project objective is to design efficient and robust valuation models that can be calibrated given market data and applied to construct the optimal risk management strategies consistent with the investor?s risk preferences. The research involves developing applicable mathematical tools to model, estimate, and analyze the complex risk structures of these derivatives, which have a significant bearing on their values. Moreover, the project includes the analytical and numerical studies of a number of stochastic control and optimal stopping problems that naturally arise in these valuation problems. By quantifying their risks and returns, the research will also shed light on some optimal contract design problems for these derivatives.<br/><br/>Employee stock options are an important component of compensation in the US. Concerned about their cost to shareholders, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board since 2004 has required firms to estimate and report the granting cost of ESOs. The central challenge of ESO valuation lies in the uncertain timing of option exercises, which depends on the employee's risk aversion and various contractual restrictions of the options. On the other hand, credit derivatives are financial instruments whose payoffs are contingent on the occurrence of default event(s), such as the bankruptcy of a firm. The trading volume of credit derivatives has grown dramatically in the past decade, but the valuation and risk management technologies have not kept up. The recent crisis in the credit markets reflects ineffective risk management of complex credit derivatives by major financial institutions. Hence, this research aims to develop a valuation framework that explicitly accounts for the investor's risk preferences, contractual features and market conditions, so as to accurately quantify the risks of these derivatives. These valuation problems are important not only for individual or institutional investors, but also for regulators."

The first project aims at understanding the solution structures of mixed (hyperbolic-elliptic) type systems of partial differential equations arising from multidimensional conservation laws. A distinctive feature of multidimensional conservation laws written in self-similar coordinates is that they change their type: they are hyperbolic far from the origin, and mixed near the origin. The latter confronts us with important problems in nonlinear equations of mixed types and free boundaries. In particular, when the waves are weak enough that the nonlinear acoustic waves dominate the nonlinear entropy and vorticity waves, shock polar analysis fails to explain the nature of shock reflection. This is the so called von Neumann paradox.  It is one of the main motivations of this project to address the failures of asymptotic and computational analysis to resolve certain paradoxes concerning the existence and the stability of solutions of multidimensional problems. Understanding the mathematical structure of multidimensional conservation laws is a crucial step in improving computational methods and in resolving such paradoxes. The project is directed at investigating these mixed type problems to gain new physical insights, to develop novel analytical tools, and to find the correct mathematical framework in which to pose the nonlinear conservation laws and to develop efficient numerical methods. The second project will investigate the feasibility of various wildfire spread models with sparse data, and development of efficient algorithms to solve the model problems. This project will be conducted in communication with the USDA Forest Fire Lab in Riverside, CA.  The wildfire spread models inherit scale separation of the local atmospheric dynamics (one kilometer and larger) and the local combustion dynamics (one meter and smaller). Also, available data are irregular and sometimes inaccurate. Existing extensive models, require complete data, are computationally intensive, and thus may not provide immediate results, which are crucial for effective fire-fighting plans.  The project will develop efficient algorithms for simplified models, which can be incorporated with sparse data, so that the fire-fighting could be planned immediately and as accurately as possible.<br/><br/>Multidimensional conservation laws are mathematical models for fundamental processes in physics and engineering, such as high-speed flows and supersonic jets. A deeper understanding of multidimensional conservation laws will provide efficient and effective methods for applications, such as compressible gas dynamics, thermodynamics, multi-phase flow and porous medium flow. Our wildfire modeling will contribute to effective fire-fighting planning and thus will have direct benefits for society. This project will take place at a Hispanic-serving institution, and involve undergraduate/master students in simulations of the model problems, thus preparing the students for further work in the design, implementation, and development of algorithms. This project will provide students with training to prepare them for their academic careers (as Ph.D. students), or their future jobs in the high tech industry in the greater Los Angeles area."
