The objectives are:  (a) The exploration of spatio-temporal   chaotic vibration phenomena for the one dimensional wave equation with   nonlinear boundary conditions;  (b) The use of boundary elements and   quasimonotone iteration techniques to analyze and compute controlled   coupled semilinear elliptic and parabolic systems with point observations   and inequality control constraints; (c) Visualization of state and control on   annular and dumbbell-shaped domains by varying the geometries involved   in order to understand the control effects.

The   ideas of local regularization developed by the P.I. naturally lead to a   ""predictor-corrector"" type of solution method.  The idea is that a regularized   solution is first obtained on a small part of the domain of the solution, after   which subsequent correction is applied in order to avoid oversmoothing.    This method has been seen to be as effective as standard Tikhonov   regularization for Volterra problems, with improved computational   performance.  In addition, the scheme naturally suggests a ""variable   regularization"" approach in which a functional regularization parameter is   used to apply more smoothing in some parts of the domain and less in   others.  In this project the P.I. plans to continue to develop the existing   theory for Volterra problems, and to extend this theory to non-Volterra   problems of the type arising in image reconstruction and image deblurring.    The design of a theoretically-sound adaptive process of selecting the   functional parameter is an essential and difficult part of this project.     Inverse problems naturally arise in numerous scientific applications,   including biomedical imaging (Magnetic Resonance Imaging and CAT   scans), the nondestructive thermal testing and analysis of materials, satellite   sensing of remote images, and geophysical applications such as seismic and   reservoir engineering.  These problems are of considerable challenge to   scientists because they often lead to very large computational problems   which are extremely sensitive to errors in data.  The aim of this project is to   develop new methods for the stable and efficient solution of such inverse   problems.  The successful attainment of this goal would have an important   impact on applications such as biotechnology, remote imaging, and    materials science."

The underlying equations are   those that arise in elasticity and viscoelasticity and the desired   singularities are point discontinuities.  Problems that will be   considered include: the existence of singular solutions to quasilinear   elliptic systems; the existence of, and admissibility criteria for,   singular solutions to hyperbolic systems; the existence of minimizers   with singularities for problems in the calculus of variations; and,   the determination of whether known discontinuous solutions to   quasilinear elliptic systems are in fact minimizers of the   corresponding problem in the calculus of variations.  %%%     The research area of this grant is the mathematical analysis of   equations that arise in Materials Science.  The most common way to   determine when a material will fail under the influence of external   forces is to subject a piece of the actual material to tensile   loading until failure occurs, i.e., ""pull on it"" until it breaks.    This is fine if one is interested only in the gross properties of   the material.  However, if one wants to understand the reasons for   material failure then one must have recourse to mathematical models   of the material.  Experiments on certain rubbery polymers, called   elastomers, have shown that when one pulls on an elastomer small   holes appear in the material.  These holes then grow in size and   combine to form cracks.  A similar phenomenon occurs in optical   fibers.  If one tries to send too much power through an optical   fiber then a series of holes can form in the core of the fiber.    These holes seriously degrade the ability of the fiber to transmit   information.   In this grant, the principal investigator will uncover   the mechanisms that cause the creation and growth  of holes in polymers   and glasses by examining systems of partial differential equations   from the theory of elasticity and viscoelasticity.    ***"

The goal of this special year is to develop some of   the new connections between nonlinear partial differential equations and   such diverse areas as fluid mechanics, phase transitions, free boundary   problems, materials science, and mean curvature flow. The focus of this   emphasis year will be an International Conference on Nonlinear Partial   Differential Equations and Applications in the Spring of 1998. During the   year, a series of visits of experts and junior researchers in the indicated   areas is planned.    Nonlinear partial differential equations arise in almost all areas of science   and engineering. In particular, they arise in materials science, biophysics,   environmental and global change processes, and industrial manufacturing   processes.  These equations are predominant in such areas as elasticity,   plasticity, semiconductors, biological transport of ions, phase transitions,   multi-phase processes, combustion, and etching and deposition  processes.   Understanding solutions of such nonlinear equations enables one to gain   new physical insights, to discover the intrinsic laws, and, in turn, to solve   some challenging problems in these areas.  The proposed project is intended   to bring together a diverse group of applied mathematicians and theoretical   analysts in partial differential equations and their applications who are able   to explore connections between their fields.  Individuals will be selected   who can share expertise with an eye toward applications in the indicated   areas in applied sciences and other mathematical areas represented by the   Northwestern faculty.  Researchers with such diverse expertise have often   unexplored common interests which, by means of fruitful exchanges, can   lead to novel results and discoveries.  Particular attention will be focused on   the p articipation of recent doctoral recipients and/or graduate students in   order to foster their interests in nonlinear partial differential equations and   applications in science and engineering."

Included in the   studies are a new class of localized multidimensional solutions which can   be related to a topological number; i.e. an index or winding number.    Associated with the self dual Yang-Mills equations is a novel class of   nonlinear ordinary differential equations, referred to as Darboux-Halphen   (DH) type systems. These equations can be integrated by associating them   with, and analyzing, certain linear monodromy problems. The linear   problems have monodromy data which are evolving.  The solutions of DH   systems can be extremely complicated, exhibiting natural boundaries and   dense branching in the complex plane.  In special cases the solutions are   expressed in terms of automorphic functions.  Frequently researchers use   numerical simulation to obtain approximations to solutions of nonlinear   wave equations. Research by the PI and collaborators has demonstrated that   computational chaos can be induced from truncation and roundoff errors.   Use of integrable systems is extremely important since analytical results can   be compared with numerical simulation.    The study of nonlinear wave equations has wide ranging applications in   physics and engineering. Intimately related to the studies in this proposal is   a class of equations, called integrable systems.  The mathematics of   integrable systems and their solutions have been shown to play an important   and fundamental role in our understanding of a variety of real world   phenomena.  Integrable systems usually admit a special class of extremely   stable, localized wave solutions, referred to as solitons, which arise   frequently in physical contexts. For example, in the study of fluid dynamics,   huge soliton internal ocean waves, sometimes a mile in length, and   hundreds of feet in amplitude, have been located in many parts of the ocean;   e.g. near the coast of  Oregon. Such waves can be devastating to anything   caught in their path, hence knowledge of where such internal solitons are   located in the ocean is of interest. Another application of solitons is in the   study and designing of efficient long distance communication systems.   Solitons eliminate the need for electronic signal regenerators which can   seriously inhibit data rates. Researchers have used solitons successfully in   the laboratory and currently they are being used in prototype   communication systems. It may well be that future high data rate   communications systems will be designed to propagate multiple soliton   waves."

One topic concerns the   study of a class of free boundary (free interface) problems which arise   naturally as simplified conceptual models of gasless combustion and fast   solidification. These free boundary problems demonstrate an amazing   variety of dynamical patterns that are essentially low-dimensional. The   qualitative behavior of these model problems will be investigated both    analytically and numerically. The principal focus will be on propagation in   two spatial dimensions. Another topic is drawn from the field of nonlinear   optics. It concerns the model laser dynamics which is described by the   Maxwell-Bloch system of partial differential equations. The main thrust of   the proposed research will be at establishing well-posedness for the   Maxwell-Bloch equations with detuning and broadening, evaluation of the   attractor dimension, and the rigorous study of the homoclinic chaos. A   numerical investigation of laser turbulence is also planned.    The proposed research is motivated by technological applications. One   immediately related technological process is the self-propagating high   temperature synthesis (SHS). The SHS process is currently being   investigated as a new method of manufacturing certain ceramic and metallic   alloys. The idea of the process is to combine the powdered ingredients and   bake them into the desired product by sending a flame wave through the   sample. The SHS process has a number of advantages over the traditional   manufacturing methods in which the mixture is baked in a furnace: more   uniform and pure products, shorter synthesis times, use of simpler and   cheaper equipment etc. The source of the second proposed research topic   lies in laser optics, namely basic dynamics of gaseous lasers that find a wide   variety of applications. The goal of the proposed mathematical    investigations is twofold.  On one hand, through the study of special extreme   regimes which are undesirable in technological applications, we propose to   develop simplified diagnostic tools that will allow to predict and avoid these   undesirable (chaotic) regimes. On the other hand, the study of the extreme   regimes will further the better understanding of  basic mechanisms that   govern the technological regimes and therefore will promote their better   control and utilization. The research will be conducted through a   combination of analytical methods and computer simulations. The analysis   will help to delineate crucial regimes and their logical structure, while the   simulations will uncover details which are not amenable to analytical   methods and, in their own turn, can lead to important mathematical   developments."

The most conspicuous examples are the  lamellipodia of spreading and migrating embryonic and metastatic  cells.  A variety of pathogenic bacteria also propel themselves by  constructing behind them a polymerized tail of cross-linked actin  filaments.  Collective cellular movements mediated by cell-cell  interactions can generate interesting spatial patterns.  These  patterns can shed light on intercellular communication and can be  used as novel assays for understanding the molecular mechanisms  of cell signaling.  The goal of this research is to understand at  the molecular level (i) the mechanochemical basis of force  generation by polymerizing and depolymerizing actin networks,  (ii) the mechanisms of spatio-angular cytoskeletal organization,  (iii) patterns of collective cell motion.  The investigator and  his colleagues formulate a mechanochemical theory of how the  thermal fluctuations of the filament tips and the membrane can be  rectified by actin polymerization to generate a propulsive force.  This force is controlled by soluble and transmembrane proteins  that stimulate actin polymerization.  The investigators also  formulate a theory for retrograde flow of lamellar cytoplasm.  This theory is based on two sources of contractile force: (i) the  contraction of the actin gel that must accompany  depolymerization, and (ii) actin filament contraction driven by  myosin.  The results of these models determine the relative roles  of actin polymerization and myosin crosslinking and contraction  during cell locomotion.  These studies help forge a link between  the basic biophysics of cell motility and the chemical control of  cell motion.       The crawling of cells over surfaces is the basis for the  vitally important phenomena of phagocytosis and the migration of  metastatic cells.  Despite the ubiquity of cellular motions, the  molecular mechanisms underlying these movements remain  mysterious.   The investigators undertake theoretical modeling that  provides a solid quantitative basis for understanding the  detailed working cycle of the cell's molecular engines.  This  description provides a new interdisciplinary level of  understanding cell movements and new methods of predicting cell  behavior in medically and technologically important situations."

The research  develops asymptotic methods to solve nonlinear boundary value  problems for both ordinary and partial differential equations  when solutions feature narrow boundary, shock, or transition  layer regions of rapid change.  The research will emphasize stiff  computation and dynamic metastability, through a consistently  hybrid asymptotic/numeric investigation.  Special notice will be  paid to asymptotically exponentially small terms, which have  previously received scant attention, since we are now well aware  that asymptotics beyond all orders can be of critical physical  significance.    Throughout science and engineering, problems often occur which  involve singularly perturbed boundary value problems.  The best  known example is fluid dynamical boundary layers.  Analytical  and numerical techniques must be combined to effectively attack  these important problems.  This work rests on a hybrid approach to  solving both ordinary and partial differential equations for  model problems motivated by application needs."

In  this case the measurements at the boundary are current and voltage  measurements, and one would like to determine the conductivity of the body.   The PI plans to consider the case of anisotropic conductivities and  non-smooth isotropic conductivities.

The basic  problem faced in geophysical fluid dynamics is that a  mathematical description based only on fundamental physical  principles, which will be called the ``Primitive Equations,'' is  often prohibitively expensive computationally, and hard to study  analytically.  More manageable approximate models, which should  represent the behavior of the physical system on time and length  scales of interest, are therefore used for making predictions  about the real world.  Naturally, the question of validity of  such simpler models arises.  The first theme of this project is  the justification of two prototypical models of shallow water,  called the ""Lake"" and the ""Great Lake"" equations, which describe  the long-time motion of an inviscid, incompressible fluid  contained in a shallow basin with a slowly spatially varying  bottom, a free upper surface and vertical side walls, under the  influence of gravity and in the limit of small characteristic  velocities and very small surface amplitude.  It is expected that  the shallow water approximation can be justified only for limited  intervals of time, the length of which can be estimated.  In  order to validate the long time behavior of fluid dynamical  models, one has to compare the statistical properties of their  attracting invariant sets, rather than compare individual  solutions.  To do so, it is necessary to focus on models that  include some mechanism of dissipation.  The second theme of this  project concerns damping as a possible ``smoothing''  mechanism---a mechanism that is weaker than the viscosity  normally considered.  Technically, the question is whether linear  damping is sufficient to assert existence of a smooth or even  analytic global attractor.  This is first investigated for the  nonlinear Schrodinger equation.  Although not a geophysical  model, it is an important prototype for which partial result s are  already available.  Next, the Stommel-Charney model for the Gulf  stream is considered, where the Coriolis force is expected to  play an important role as a second regularization mechanism.  Lastly, a model for Benard convection in a porous medium is  investigated.  Here the temperature is diffusive while the fluid  velocity is only linearly damped.       Computer predictions of phenomena on large or global scales,  for example weather or climate forecasts, need to compromise  between accuracy of the predictions and available computing  resources.  It is therefore a major scientific concern to devise  approximation schemes and models that are efficient as well as  trustworthy.  The first aspect of this project concerns the  validity of models of shallow water.  Oceans, for example, are  shallow in the sense that they are much wider than they are deep.  The shallowness is one of the features that are usually  exploited to obtain less complex models.  The project aims at the  justification of this procedure in the context of two examples  that are simple enough to allow detailed study, and yet contain  most of the difficulties found in more generic situations.  The  second aspect of the project concerns the long time behavior of  models in the presence of weak damping.  When a physical system is  modeled for long periods of time, the balance of energy input  (``driving'') and energy loss (``damping'') becomes very  important.  The project focuses on a particular mathematical  manifestation of damping, the so-called weak damping, and in  particular on how it influences the model for large times."

For pulses in use today, so-  called ""non-return-to-zero"" or NRZ pulses, fundamental issues consist of:    how do the pulses degrade?, and, what combination of fiber properties and   pulse features determine how much and where the pulse degrades?  The   principal investigator and Ken McLaughlin have studied these questions for   two particular transoceanic fibers in use today, with answers provided to the   above questions.  Proposed new research involves the description of pulse   propagation once degradation has begun; mathematically, these results   require generalization of integrable PDE methods in two fundamental ways.    First, one must provide detailed behavior of the solution after shock   formation, including how fast the ripples spread and evolve with the main   pulse; and second, there are no results to date for weak dispersive behavior   of the coupled NLS equations which apply when there are birefringent   effects, and there is no systematic construction of oscillatory solutions for   coupled NLS pdes.    Current data transmission questions in nonlinear fiber optics have to be   answered in order to achieve a robust, faithful communication link for the   various planned applications.  These questions relate to:  the type of fiber   one uses; for a given fiber, the type of data one sends as carriers of   information bits; for given fiber and data, how long can the transmission   line be before unacceptable errors occur as bits become distorted.    Remarkably for the applied mathematical community, each of these issues   can be framed in terms of cutting-edge questions in special nonlinear partial   differential equations called nearly integrable.  The pulse propagation in   modern nonlinear fibers is well-known to be approximated by the solution   of perturbed nonlinear  Schrodinger equations, special equations studied in   great detail by the principal investigator for twenty years.  The material   properties of the fiber give coefficients in the equations, the length of the   fiber dictates how long one must construct the solution, and the shape of the   data that is sent  along the fibers is the input for the solution.  The modeling   of pulse propagation and degradation involves two phases:  the   mathematical understanding and description of the solutions of these   equations for these special types of input data; and the transfer of the   mathematical insights and tools to practical understanding, identification of   problems, and suggestions for remedies.  The issues of how pulses degrade   and how to shape pulses to minimize degradation are fundamental   mathematical issues which form the core of the proposed research.  The P.I.   has and will continue to communicate with the technological community,   consisting thus far of visits and conversations with staff scientists at Lucent   Technologies and Corning,  Inc."

Liquid/vapor phase transitions are important phenomena in  science and engineering.  Traditional models for the  dynamics of phase  transition, exhibit gaps when compared with experiments.  We propose  to investigate the dynamics of liquid/vapor phase transitions through  an approach different from traditional models. The model is a system of  conservation laws with source terms (the system) based on equations for   two-phase reactive flows. Based our preliminary studies, this approach    promises to better fit experiment.  To accomplish our objective, the   following specific sub-objectives will be pursued:  1) Derive qualitative and quantitative  asymptotic models for the system.    2) Study issues such as basic wave patterns in the system and its asymptotic   models, e.g., traveling waves, admissibility criteria for  shocks and phase   boundaries, and the Riemann problem.    3) Develop algorithms to carry out numerical simulations on the system and  develop test problem to justify such computations.  Study issues related to  numerical schemes for the system   4) Study the well-posedness of the  system  or its simplified asymptotic   models.  The expectations are that, at the conclusion of the proposed period  of  support,  results will have been obtained  on qualitative and  quantitative behavior of the system, and numerical simulations will  have been carried out. Results on qualitative and  quantitative  behavior of the system  will be compared with experiments.  Based on  these comparisons, the adequateness of the modeling can be assessed,  and  the modeling can be further improved.  It is expected that the  results obtained will facilitate understanding of the dynamics of  liquid/vapor phase transitions.  Tools for numerical simulations of  such phenomena will also result from this work.    Most materials have four phase s: solid, liquid, vapor and plasma  phases.  Phase transition,  such as the change from water to vapor and  vice versa, is fundamental phenomena of materials that occur in  daily life and everywhere in our environment. Many manufacturing  processes, such as the growth of a single large crystal used in  semiconductor manufacturing, involve phase transitions.  Liquid/vapor  phase transitions happen during the flight of  airplane through clouds  and during underwater explosions.  Liquid/vapor phase changes also  occur at high speed moving parts of a vessel, such as the propeller of  a submarine, which consumes energy and makes noise detectable by  enemies' solar devices.  In summary, phase transitions are not only  fundamental scientific properties of materials but also vital to  industrial competitiveness and national security.  The proposed project  is to study the evolution of phase changes, in particular the rapid  liquid/vapor transitions induced by rapid moving body or waves.  The  objectives are to establish effective mathematical models for  liquid/vapor transitions that agree with experimental data, and to  develop numerical simulation tools for such phase transitions."

Most intriguingly, intercellular calcium  waves in mixed neuronal-glial cultures have been observed passing  from glial cells to neurons, and thus they may possibly have an  important role to play in information processing.  The  investigator uses mathematical models to study the mechanisms  involved in intercellular calcium waves.  The first part of the  work involves the study of the mechanisms underlying  intracellular calcium oscillations and waves in epithelial and  glial cells.  Secondly, in light of recent experimental evidence,  previous models are modified and used to study the mechanisms of  intercellular calcium wave propagation in glial cell cultures.  Finally, in hippocampal explant cultures the intercellular  calcium waves show a remarkable degree of spatial organisation,  forming propagating plane waves and rotating spirals.  The model  is used to determine the mechanisms by which intracellular  calcium waves can be coupled on a much larger space scale to form  intercellular calsium waves with such a high degree of  self-organisation.       Waves of calcium that travel between cells are one important  way in which cells can signal to their neighbours.  Such  intercellular communication, although not yet well understood, is  known to play a vital role in many physiological processes.  For  instance, the response of an epithelial cell layer to a wound is  governed (at least in part) by an intercellular calcium wave,  while, in the brain, waves of calcium can travel from glia to  neurons, and vice versa.  Thus, calcium waves very likely have an  important role to play in information processing.  For these  reasons, there is a great deal of interest in studying the  mechanisms that underly such waves.  Mathematics has an important  role to play in these studies.  By its very nature, wave  propagation is a complex phe nomenon, not easily understood by  intuition alone.  Although mathematics cannot provide answers to  all pertinent questions, when used in conjunction with  experimental results, it can be used to interpret and understand  existing results, while directing the course of future  experimemtal studies.  The investigator (a mathematician) and his  experimental colleagues propose a coordinated series of  theoretical and experimental investigations that will lead to a  greater understanding of how glial cells communicate by means of  calcium waves, and how such communication can coordinate activity  over large regions of the hippocampus.

The proposed research addresses and combines mathematical and computational   issues in the study of  ""liquid crystals"" and ""ferroic materials"", both    solids and  fluids, within the context of industrial applications.    One underlying theme of this proposal is to develop an understanding of static   and flow patterns observed in liquid crystals and ferroic materials in the   presence of external fields. (For instance, in dealing with ferroic solids, a   goal is to achieve lower critical values of  coercive fields in order to curb   dissipation;  in ferroelectric liquid crystals one also seeks to increase   device switching speed.) While the occurrence   of ""texture"" and ""defects"" tends to hinder the outcome of  structural manufacturing processes,  it may also bring out desirable  features in optic applications, such as improvement of the accuracy   and display memory of the devices. Within this framework, one can   formulate a relevant common problem in terms of the control of  texture and defects in solid and liquid crystal systems, with either   the intent to enhance such structures or to eliminate them. It is the   goal of this research team to contribute towards the understanding  of such questions by exploring a broad spectrum of methods and   techniques:  modeling, mathematical, computational and   experimental in liquid crystal and ferroic systems as a whole.   It is planned to revise and, perhaps, unify some of the available descriptions   so that the ferroelectric nature can be understood in a more universal  manner. Such a study could  ultimately suggest  a way of designing new and   better ferroelectric materials (solids and/or liquid crystals) with   ""large polarization"" and  ""small coerci ve fields"".  This  proposal also addresses  aspects of (non-Newtonian) liquid crystal   flow such as defects and instabilities of various regimes.  Special   attention will be devoted to the analysis of processing flows  of thin films as well as to the study of  free-boundary problems.  Results from singularity and bifurcation theory, and an appreciation   of the role played by symmetry, have been integrated within the   finite-element technique to establish the fundamental instability   mechanisms of a number of classical Newtonian flows.    These numerical techniques are now mature enough to apply to the study   of more technologically important flows with more complex physics and   multiple parameters.    The proposed research deals with mathematical and computational  modeling of ""liquid crystals"" and ""ferroic materials"" (both, solids  and liquids), within the context of their industrial applications.  In  dealing with liquid crystals we intend to construct and analyze  mathematical models of ""smart display devices"", involving  ferroelectric systems as well as composites. The main goal is to  preserve good optical resolution with increasing display sizes, and  achieve low switching values of electricor magnetic fields. As part of  our research plan, we intend to draw already existing  mathematical  and physical information from the field of ferroic solids, in order to   help us in the studies of ferroelectric liquid crystals. In turn, the ordering   properties and larger degrees of freedom of liquid molecules may  provide good feedback for improving the modeling and design of  ferroelectric ""sensors"" and ""transducers"", with the special aim  towards miniaturization of such devices. One of the main issues of   our research is to study how to use  polymeric liquid crystal  materials to design typically solid devices. (The former materials are  often cheaper to manufacture and to activate). From a different point  of view,  mathematical problems in flow modeling  of ferroelectric liquids  arise  in the manufacturing processes of such  materials, and bring a whole new class of mathematical questions that  relate to those that traditionally arise in  studies of Newtonian  fluid flow. Overall, we intend to bring together independent fields of  research and carry out a transfer of mathematical and   computational methods among them based on  exploiting physical and   phenomenological analogies."

Two basic flow sets, namely the  Taylor-Couette flow and vortex breakdown flow, have been chosen in  order to develop a general understanding of the complex hydrodynamics  and control strategies. These generic flows are attractive because the  degree of complexity can be precisely controlled by relatively simple  changes in the flow state or boundary conditions, and at the same time  they possess rich dynamics which are representative of a wide class of  general hydrodynamic systems that may respond to dynamic control in a  complex manner. In particular, these classes of flows may respond  resonantly to the parametric excitation of the applied control. An  investigation of the behavior of these generic flows will help to form  a better understanding of more general time-dependent hydrodynamic  systems. The interplay between dynamic control mechanisms and  parametric resonance will be investigated using (linear) Floquet theory  as a first step in understanding the dynamics at the point of  transition or bifurcation. Flows beyond the validity of the Floquet  analysis will be studied using three different nonlinear computational  approaches, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Their  combined implementation is capable of resolving a wide range of  problems and addressing distinct issues within each problem. The  results from the experiment will be used to refine the analysis and  control implementation.    This research will not only result in a deeper understanding of the  complex spatio-temporal dynamics of hydrodynamic systems, but will also  make a significant practical impact. For example, in the aerodynamics  industry, the control strategies will aid in drag reduction a nd reduced  fatigue due to aero-acoustic structural resonances; in fact, parametric  excitation in the form of span-wise oscillations of the boundary has  recently been demonstrated experimentally to reduce drag in turbulent  boundary layers by researchers at the University of Texas and others.  In the materials and chemical processing industries, many of the  manufacturing processes rely on an effective control of transitions and  instabilities. The new fundamental and practical insights on control  dynamics of complex systems anticipated from this research can provide  U.S. industry with a competitive edge."

In the classical theory, PDOs are assumed to  have infinitely differentiable symbols. Although this is frequently the  case, the assumption about smoothness is very restrictive and does not  allow one to address important practical problems. Two cases where this  assumption is especially restrictive are as follows: limited-angle  local tomography and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)  with nonsmooth attenuation. Here one is interested in recovery of the  wave front of a distribution knowing only the result of applying a PDO  with nonsmooth symbol to that distribution. Known results on PDOs,  symbols of which have limited smoothness, do not apply because of  specific nature of the singularities of the occurring symbols. Main  objectives of the proposed research are as follows (1) To develop a  theory of certain classes of PDOs with nonsmooth symbols which occur in  tomography; (2) To develop algorithms for analysis of the limited-angle  tomographic data and SPECT data when the attenuation coefficient is not  smooth. In the case of the limited-angle data, our goal is to be able  to recover as much of the visible singularities with minimal  distortions as possible. This is especially important for the  singularities which are located close to the boundary of the visibility  range. In the case of SPECT, our goal is to demonstrate that local  tomography can be used in the case of nonsmooth attenuation; and (3) To  test the algorithms on numerical experiments.  Significance of the proposed research is twofold. First, the expected  results will advance our understanding of how PDOs with nonsmooth  symbols transform wave fronts of distributions. Second, the expected  results will help solve important practical problems. SPECT is a  popular tool for noninvasive medical imaging. It is  used in cerebral,  cardiac, and other kinds of medical imaging.  SPECT is based on  reconstructing distribution of  radionuclides inside a patient knowing  counts of photons emitted from the patient along different directions  on a plane. Depending on what kind of the radiopharmaceutical is used,  the distribution provides different types of medical information about  the patient.  The main difficulty in analyzing the SPECT data comes  from the fact that, in general, the photons emitted inside a patient  are attenuated in a complicated, nonuniform manner. In this case, no  inversion formula is known. Therefore, even though the photons are  attenuated nonuniformly inside the patient, practically all current  algorithms must assume  that the attenuation coefficient is either zero  or a constant. This results in attenuation artifacts, which remain a  significant obstacle in the analysis of SPECT images. Even most recent  approaches, that are based on the idea of local tomography and take  into account variable attenuation, fail to consider the case of  nonsmooth attenuation. Our results will provide for more accurate  quantitation of SPECT images even when the attenuation coefficient  varies from point to point and has discontinuities. It appears that our  study will be the first to investigate theoretically effects of  discontinuous attenuation on SPECT images.    Research related to limited-angle local tomography is of importance in  applications involving nondestructive evaluation of big pieces of  equipment, where a scanning device cannot be rotated 360 degrees around  the object.  Examples are scanning of exit cones of rockets located on  a gantry, jet engines, turbines, etc."

In research in a different area,  analytical and numerical methods will be employed to study the  morphological changes and instabilities that result from curvature driven  mass diffusion within the bounding surfaces of solid bodies.  Among the  topics to be investigated are (i) the evolution and stability of  axisymmetric surfaces and of planar curves in the theory of curvature  driven diffusion and (ii) the evolution of pit-like defects in otherwise  flat films.            Much is yet to be learned about the modes of action of proteins  that are known to bind to and induce deformations in DNA. There are cases  in which one can discuss the action of DNA bending proteins by treating a  DNA molecule as an elastic rod.  Recent research has shown that one can use  exact solutions of the equations of equilibrium for elastic rods to  investigate the nature of the dependence of the configuration of a segment  of DNA on conditions imposed at its end points.  Several of the problems  that are investigated in this way are important for understanding  mechanisms of gene regulation. The work on curvature driven mass diffusion  within the bounding surfaces of solids is expected to have significant  applications in materials science.  As the effects of surface diffusion  increase in importance as dimensions become small,  the theory of such  diffusion can be applied to obtain insight and quan titative results in the  following research areas: the formation of thermal grooves, i.e., the  development of surface indentations at grain boundaries in heated metals;  the stability of field-emitter cathodes, of interconnecting elements in  microelectronic circuits,  and of moving parts in micro-electromechanical  devices; fiber spheroidization in metallic composites; and the pitting of  thin films at grain boundary vertices."

Falk      Abstract:    The first main area of study of this project is the finite element  approximation of plate and shell models.  One objective is to develop methods  which avoid the ``locking'' problem which leads, for standard approximations,  to poor results for thin shells and plates.  A second part of the project is  to design and analyze effective multigrid preconditioners for least squares  and mixed finite element approximations to second order elliptic boundary  value problems.  A third general area of study, using both computational and  analytical techniques, is to understand the predictions of mathematical models  which are concerned with stress driven instability of recrystallizable rods  and films and with curvature driven surface diffusion.  The last part of the  project will attempt to develop finite element methods for first order linear  hyperbolic systems and also for the approximation of simplified versions of  the Einstein equations.    Many problems in solid mechanics can be studied by using mathematical models.  These models offer a cost-effective way to make quantitative predictions about  how mechanical systems will change under various conditions, such as the  application of external forces. In particular, they offer an alternative to  the use of costly or difficult experiments.  Typically, when realistic  mathematical models are formulated, they are in terms of equations whose  solutions, which represent physical quantities of interest to engineers and  scientists, are not able to be determined analytically, i.e., in a simple form  one can easily write down.  However, by employing numerical methods, good  approximations to the physical quantities which are described by the  mathematical models may still be found. Typically, these numerical methods use  high-speed computers to do the large number of calculations involved.  This  project is concerned with the  design and analysis of numerical approximation  schemes for a number of important mathematical models used in mechanics.  Among the mathematical models considered are those for thin shells and films."

As far as direct problems are concerned, the   effective boundary layer behavior encountered in connection with PDE's   with rapidly oscillating coefficients will be investigated. PDE's of this form   are used to model the behavior of composite materials. Other   ``homogenization"" problems for composite materials, for example, certain   problems associated with the relationship between microscopic and   macroscopic failure (including debonding of closely spaced fibers and   delamination) will be studied.

Part of   this research is concerned with determining the sufficiency of the proposed   boundary data for the various identifications (proving uniqueness and   continuous dependence results). Another part of this research involves the   design of effective algorithms, for instance for the detection and location of   cracks and inhomogeneities in metal components as well as for the   determination of the level of oxidation of thin films (gas sensors) using real   experimental data.

These include 1) Solitary waves in  nonlinear dispersive media, including lattice dynamics and water waves;  2) A recently discovered class of localized nonradial solutions of  nonlinear Schrodinger equations in 2+1 dimensions; and 3) Internal waves  in fluids near the liquid-vapor critical point.  The methods under  development involve improving the use of: a) Evans functions to analyze  eigenvalue problems in two dimensions with symmetries; b) singular  perturbation theory for resolvent operators, to study how stability  results for integrable systems persist in nonintegrable systems for  lattice dynamics and water waves; c) infinite-dimensional center  manifold theory in ill-posed systems, to study the existence of  traveling water waves in three dimensions; d) zero-Mach-number  asymptotic analysis of low-velocity flows, to study hydrodynamic  phenomena near the critical point, specifically: damping rates of  internal waves about a strongly stratified equilibrium, and possible  capillary effects in one-phase flows of near-critical fluids.    The general goal of the first part of this research is to understand how  ""robust"" are nonlinear wave phenomena. Nonlinear waves in rare,  so-called ""integrable"" systems can be very well understood due to what  seems miraculous -- they can be solved in closed form. But most  realistic systems are not integrable, so one needs to know what  phenomena depend on integrability and what do not. An important  infrastructural technology where nonlinear waves are important and are  not completely understood is long-distance communication via optical  fiber. The second part of the work was motivated by physics experiments  carried out on the spa ce shuttle; also, the use of supercritical fluids  in materials processing is extensive and growing. The behavior of flows  of such fluids near the critical point is unusual and little understood,  and this has led to costly failures in experimental design in the past.  Fundamental investigations are needed to build the knowledge base about  such flows that can serve as the foundation for the development of  applications."

Models are based upon a slender-body approximation  that is valid for rapidly spreading films which nearly wet the underlying   substrate. The asymptotic technique has been tested on a simple model   of liquid phase epitaxy where the dominant mechanism of film growth is   solidification. Approximate solutions representing steady planar   spreading have been compared to numerical solutions of the exact problem.  We find that the boundary conditions at a contact line may be applied  directly to the asymptotic equations describing the spreading film   even though the slender-body approximation is not valid there (this is due   to the presence of a weak gradient singularity). For steadily spreading  films these contact angle conditions select the spreading rate.  The asymptotic equations are used to test the linear stability of a   planar film and it is found to be stable.    The technology behind thin film deposition is of principal importance  to the development of new and more compact semiconductor devices.  Moreover, this technology is unusual in that it is extremely sensitive   to frontier research in materials science. We propose to  examine the conditions that are applied at a tri-junction between a solid   film, its nutrient phase, and its substrate, and determine the role that   these contact conditions play in influencing the rate of growth and the   morphology of spreading solid films. Our preliminary results suggest  that contact conditions significantly influence both. A basic knowledge  of the connection between the contact conditions and the growth and  morphology of thin solid films will aid in controlling the deposition  process."

They are typically dissipative and often the different components  have a fixed feedback relation to other components.  Systems of  competitive or cooperative type and monotone cyclic feedback  systems often arise.  In this project the investigator exploits  these special features, particularly monotonicity properties, in  order to describe the asymptotic behavior of the system.  He  explores the possibility that some classes of systems with  definite feedback relations between components have simpler  long-term dynamics than their dimension implies.  For example, the  asymptotic behavior of cooperative systems of differential  equations is convergence to equilibrium, while competitive  systems behave like general systems of one less dimension and  monotone cyclic feedback systems satisfy the Poincare-Bendixson  trichotomy whatever their dimension.  The application of these  ideas to mathematical models of microbial cultures in  bio-reactors is pursued.  Of particular interest is a model of  microbial competition for limiting resource in a distributed  environment mimicking the large intestine of a mammal.  The  central questions of interest to physiologists are what factors  determine the set of micro-organisms able to colonize the gut and  what are the chief factors determining the stability of the  colony to invasion by ingested organisms.  Modeling issues arise  in order to model both advection of the lumen and the effects of  bacterial adherence to the intestinal walls.  The model is  intended to focus on these questions.  In a different direction,  the investigator continues earlier work aimed at simplifying  complicated structured population models (those models that take  account of biological structure such as age, size, physiological  state, etc of a population) to simpler mode ls consisting of delay  differential systems, possibly state dependent.  The rationale is  that there are fewer tools that apply to the hyperbolic partial  differential equations that arise in structured population models  than there are for delay differential equations.  As a particular  example, a model of microbial growth in a chemostat incorporating  effects of cell-cycle phase is investigated.       Mathematical models play a major role in the theoretical  understanding of many issues in the biological sciences.  Mathematical models, as simple caricatures of the real phenomena,  allow an investigator to more easily and inexpensively answer the  kinds of questions: ""what if we change this to that?""  Many such  models that arise in physiology, population biology,  bioengineering and epidemiology take the form of differential  equations where it is important for understanding the  applications to determine what happens to the solutions of these  equations over the long run.  The equations that arise in the  biological sciences typically have special features not found in  mathematical models in the physical sciences.  This project aims  at developing methods that exploit these special features to  determine the long-time behavior of the solutions and to apply  these methods to problems of current interest in biotechnology,  population biology and physiology.  Improved methods will lead to  more accurate predictions from existing mathematical models and  the ability to analyze more complicated, realistic models.  As  one example among several to be considered in the proposed work,  the investigator and P.  Waltman propose to study a mathematical  model of microbial growth and competition for nutrients taking  place in the large intestine of a mammal.  As the intestines are  often a source of infection from micro-organisms, it is important  to understand the factors involved in determining the kinds of  bacteria normally present in the intestine and the factors that  determine whether an invadin g organism (e..g. a pathogen) can  successfully establish itself as a member of the colony.  They  intend to construct a mathematical model based on a flow reactor  that will exhibit the main features of the intestine (flow of  lumen through the intestine and bacterial adherence to the walls  of the intestine) in order to better understand the answers to  the questions posed above."

Cooperative Games: How should the common costs be allocated fairly  among the benefeciaries of a joint enterprise is a basic problem  widespread in both private firms and in public enterprises. While  cost accountants and practitioners have stuck to a few cost  allocation practises , these procedures are being questioned by  researchers especially by game theorists who would like the  procedures to be fair, equitable and reflective of the decision  makers power and influence in steering the course of actions.  Cooperative game theory addresses precisely these issues.  Till recently game theorists have been proposing many solutions  without any efficient solution technique to solve for them.  Often many practical cost allocation problems and profit sharing  problems can be modeled as games whose essential coalitions grow  only polynomially with he size of the player set.  The project is aimed at developing efficient  algorithms  that will  solve for the nucleolus and the Shapley value for  many models.  Stochastic games: In the area of stochastic games  the aim is to  study non-zero sum games in limiting average payoffs for finite  and arbitrary state spaces and to look for correlated and Nash  equilibria.  Unlike zero-sum games, non-zero sum  structured  stochastic games may not possess even epsilon -stationary  Nash equilibria in limiting average payoff. Even more important  is to develop allgorithms to locate Nash equilibria, at least  for structured stochastic games.    Increasingly industries and organizations and even federal  funding agencies want to measure the contributions of joint  efforts. In environmental  problems accurately allocating costs or  fines for industrial pollutions will be possible with  cooperative game theoretic solutions. In civil law suits and in  divorce law suits, the ad hoc but intuitively appealing decisions   by judges based on the individual cases can be backed up by  quantifiable approaches using cooperative game theoretic solutions.  The strategic behavior of price wars by airlines,  the tax evasion and auditing by tax offices, auto manufacturing  competitions can  all be analyzed using stochastic game theoretic  methods and models. The solutions backed up  by efficient algorithms  for computation is essential for the applicability of Game Theory  to real life problems."

The first area of   research is the control of hybrid systems of partial differential equations and   ordinary differential equations, with applications in bioremediation and   population modeling.  The second area is optimal control of the obstacle in   variational inequalities, with elliptic or fourth order operators (involving   biharmonic operators). The third area is the investigation of optimal   chemotherapy strategies in HIV models.  First, the existence of an optimal   control must be shown for the models and objective functionals appropriate   to each application area.  Secondly, this optimal control must be   characterized through necessary conditions from the derivation of an   optimality system, which is the state system coupled with an adjoint system.    Due to the variety of systems treated, existence, uniqueness, and   characterization of the optimal control requires new and different a priori   estimates and convergence arguments.

The first application area is control of a bioremediation model   for encouraging the remediation of contaminants by metabolism of bacteria.    The level of the nutrient inputs is controlled to optimally run a bioreactor.    The approach will be lab tested on a gas phase bioreactor with pseudomonas   putida bacteria degrading paraxylene.

In this method, the base functions are constructed in  such a way that they contain the local microscopic properties of the  differential operators. These oscillatory bases are independent from  each other and can be constructed independently. In effect, we  break a large scale computation into many smaller and independent pieces,  which can be carried out perfectly in parallel. Thus, the size of  the computation is drastically reduced. Due to this drastic memory saving,  numerical computations of practical problems with  many small scales, which were previously unobtainable using a  traditional finite element method, now become possible using our method.  An advantage of our approach is that it can handle general multiscale  problems without the requirement of scale separation, a property which is very  important for practical applications. Several numerical examples are included  to demonstrate this effect. We will perform a careful numerical error analysis   of our method. The effect of grid resonance, and geometric singularities  of local inclusions, such as corners, cusps, will be analyzed.    Effective numerical simulations of multiscale phenomena play an essential  role in many engineering and industrial applications. A direct numerical   solution of the multiple scale problems is difficult even with modern   supercomputers. The major difficulty of direct solutions is the scale of   computation.  For oil reservoir simulations, it is common that millions of   grid blocks are involved, with each block having a dimension of tens of   meters, whereas the permeability measured from cores is at a scale of several   centimeters. This gives more th an hundred thousands of degrees of freedom per  spatial dimension in the computation.  Therefore, a tremendous amount  of  computer memory and CPU time are required, and they can easily exceed  the limit of today's computing resources. The goal of this proposed research   is to provide a coarsened reservoir model which gives simulation results in   close agreement with those of the original fine scale description but at   considerable computational savings. Many existing up-scaling methods   currently used in the oil industry are based on the homogenization theory  with periodic structures and separable scales. There is no guarantee that   they work for general random permeability without scale separation. In  comparison, our approach is more systematic and general.  We are very hopeful that this proposed research will provide an  effective alternative to perform oil reservoir simulations."

In some ways the experimental   situation in chemistry today bears a strong resemblance to the experimental   situation in fluid mechanics in the late 1970`s. At that time new laser based   experimental techniques were developed that resulted in global, real time   dynamical data from fluid flows. Such data played a key role in the   dynamical systems analyses of fluid flows. In fact, one could make the case   that these experimental advances were the reason that fluid mechanics   became (probably) the main application area for dynamical sy stems theory   throughout the 1980`s. Today we are in an analogous situation for   theoretical chemistry vis- -vis the relation of  experimental advances in   fluid mechanics and dynamical systems theory in the late 1970`s.

The work will span several fields, and will include    *  fundamental investigations of epitaxial YBCO film growth    *  development of predictive models for MOCVD of YBCO based on fundamental principles,    *  simulation-driven design and construction of an advanced, prototype MOCVD reactor with integrated sensing and control    *  and development and experimental validation of model-based process  control strategies.    Funding for this activity will be provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, the NSF Engineering Directorate, and by DARPA."

The understanding of these  processes is a basic thrust of present day materials science.  In the  face of little known basic physics, mathematical models are continually  being proposed in the hopes of shedding insight.  The present proposal  focusses attention on certain classes of continuum models for the  spatio-temporal variation of phase transformations.  In typical cases,  this variation consists of motion of an interface between two phases  or between more general types of states. Different models do not  always predict the same thing, an example being the detailed nature of  the motion of the interface in anisotropic media.  One aim in the  proposed work will be to better elucidate the differing assumptions of  important classes of models, and to tie these different assumptions  more clearly with their predictions. Special attention, in comparing  these models, will be paid to nonlocal ones. Finally, a mysterious  specific type of phase transformation for solid binary alloys known as  discontinuous precipitation or cellular precipitation will be further  modeled and analyzed.     The development of new high performance materials is vital to economic  and other national interests.  Among the many properties of materials  which are relevant to their performance is  the possibility of  progressive phase change and the development of  interfaces between  alternate solid phases or crystalline variants. There is need for a  great deal more basic understanding of the processes by which such  interfaces are formed and move.  This research will contribute to this  understanding by the development, comparison, and analysis of  mathematical models of these phen omena based on physical laws."

However, many   researchers in these areas are not able to use the existing results and proof   techniques in matrix theory to develop their theory effectively because their   expertise is not in matrix theory and there is a lack of communication between   them and researchers on matrix theory. The principal investigators have   considerable experience in matrix inequalities and have developed from   scratch, adapted, or borrowed many techniques to study the subject. In this   project, they plan to develop and apply the theory of matrix inequalities to   different problems that arise from applications.  In particular, the emphasis   will be on proving matrix inequalities by conceptual rather than computational   techniques, and putting them in more general and accessible settings, so that   the results can be readily used by non-specialists.     It is worth mentioning that this project has strong connections with a number   of areas of Federal strategic interest.  For example, in high-performance   computing, one needs to be able to do computation efficiently and accurately.    In many situations, computations are very sensitive to round-off error   introduced by the machine itself. The design of fast convergent methods in   these cases is greatly facilitated by the theory of matrix inequalities.  As   mentioned in the first paragraph, matrix inequalities are important tools in   control theory, a regime that is crucial to the design of manufacturing   plants, aircraft, automobiles, etc.  Applications of matrix inequalities in   other subjects, including quantum physics and semi-definite programming are   proposed , and problems arising in economics, statistics and psychology will   also be considered."

The first problem  will combine homogenization theory, bounds on the effective moduli  of composites and Young measure techniques in order to study the  relaxation of the ill-posed optimization problems with  weakly discontinuous objective functionals. The method yields an answer  for a class of quadratic functionals.  The second project will seek out the exact relations for the effective behavior  of polycrystalline composites using a new technique that combines  PDE theory and variational principles. The method is successful in  at least one such problem.  The third project will study the critical behavior of high contrast  composites near the percolation threshold by utilizing the analogy  between the phase transitions in Ising ferromagnets and the random  resistor networks near the percolation threshold on the one hand,  and recent results on the high contrast continuum composites away  from the critical point on the other.    Composite materials are media that look homogeneous but in fact have  complex structure when viewed under a microscope. These materials are  finding their way into our everyday lives in objects such as skis, golf  clubs, automobiles, aircraft, computers, cement, construction components  of buildings and bridges, sensors and many many more. The idea of  composite materials is to combine beneficial properties of its simple  but imperfect constituents. The difficulty here is that the properties  of composites (called effective properties) depend not only on what you  mix but on how you mix it. In other words, they depend on the geometry  of what you see under a microscope (called microgeometry). Therefore  the goal is to specify which microgeometries produce the best composites  provided you use the same materials in prescribed proportions. In general  this is an ill-posed problem. That is, it may not be solved in its raw  form  by the most powerful computers. The first part of this proposal aims to  reformulate the problem into a form suitable for solution on a computer  (into a well-posed problem). The second part of this proposal will  seek out and investigate the very special cases when some effective  properties of polycrystalline composites do not depend on the microgeometry.   This work may have applications for the design of underwater sensors  based on piezoelectric polycrystals. The last part of this proposal  constitutes a long term project on studying ""nature's composites""  like porous rocks or sea ice (consisting of ice with brine inclusions).  The problem here is that the two constituents comprising the composite  have extremely different properties (like air and rock, or brine and ice).  Modeling the properties of such composites presents a formidable  mathematical problem. The progress here would enhance our understanding  and give us more control of a diverse array of problems ranging from   extraction of oil from porous rocks to global climate change (that depends  to a great extent on what is happening to Arctic and Antarctic sea ice)."

The research component will focus on the   theoretical understanding of fluid phenomena. Specifically, these research   efforts outline the study of turbulent transport and scalar intermittency, the   numerical calculation of enhanced burning speeds in premixed combustion,   and theoretical and computational studies of weakly  compressible transport   phenomena. An underlying theme in this effort is the isolation of how fluid   flow properties affect transport phenomena, which may include enhanced   mixing rates, enhanced rare event probability, enhanced burning speeds, and   enhanced anelastic heat transport. These studies involve a sophisticated   integration of modern asymptotic, numerical, and probabilistic techniques.   Additionally, this award will support the continued curriculum development   of an advanced undergraduate/ graduate level Mathematical Fluid Dynamics   course.  Such a course is designed to present the student with the essential   mathematical tools necessary to understand fluid mechanics and to quickly   equip the student with essential techniques for attacking research problems   in Applied Mathematics.  Additionally, a small demonstration fluids   laboratory will be developed to offer visualization of many fluid   phenomena.    This Faculty Early Career Development Award will provide the principal   investigator the opportunity to pursue his research efforts in the   understanding of many fluid transport phenomena while additionally   developing new educational curricula. Developing sound theories for fluid   transport is fundamental in many ways.  The experimental understanding of   fluid turbulence typically involves the tracking of passive dye, and,   consequently, the quantification of how fluid flow properties affect the   mixing of such dye is critical.  Further, the development of sound transport   theories naturally will yield insight into a va riety of mixing applications   such as the tracking of atmospheric pollutants.  Perhaps most importantly is   the potential information such theories may offer to large-scale   computational fluids, combustion and climate models in which a common   difficulty regards how to treat unresolvable length and time scales.  It is an   accepted fact in computational fluid dynamics that important, non-  negligible, complex fluid phenomena exist which are simply not resolvable   on even the largest supercomputers.  These sub-grid effects play a dramatic   role in many fluids applications such as weather prediction. They cannot be   ignored, and a standard approach is to replace them by something simpler--   an effective mixing coefficient.  In many applications, the transport theories   developed here offer sound justification and quantification of these   coefficients, and potentially may offer improvements to existing   computational models.  Finally, the curriculum effort will involve the   development of a small fluids laboratory including a demonstration water   tunnel.  Through this lab, a student studying the theory of fluids will find   exciting visual contact with real fluids phenomena typically unavailable in   mathematics coursework, and this visualization will lead to greater   excitement and appreciation for the usefulness of mathematical theory in the   understanding of observable phenomena.    The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early   development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The   Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-  wide  program that provides for the support of junior faculty within the   context of their overall career development.  It combines in a single   program the support of quality research and education in the broadest sense   and the full participation of those traditionally underrepresented in science   and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the importance   the Foundation places on  the development of full, balanced academic   careers which include both research and education."

The program involves a synergism of analytical and numerical   studies of problems in combustion and flame propagation, which has been   successful in elucidating solution behavior of the highly nonlinear systems   of PDEs which we study. In particular, interest centers on problems exhibiting   complex spatiotemporal dynamics in gaseous combustion as well as in solid fuel   combustion. In gaseous combustion, we consider four different problem areas:   (a) flames with sequential reactions, (b) flames in stretched flows,   (c) flames stabilized on a burner, and (d) flames in gas filled tubes.  We also consider problems in solid fuel combustion, in which  combustion waves are used to synthesize advanced materials. In this  relatively new and innovative technological process, which appears to  enjoy many advantages over conventional technology, the combustion  wave propagates through the sample, converting unreacted solid powder  mixture to solid product. Our analytical studies are based on  bifurcation and nonlinear stability theories, which employ asymptotic   analysis and singular perturbation theory in the neighborhood of  bifurcation or other transition points, resulting in a local  description of the solution in a neighborhood of the appropriate  critical point. Then an adaptive pseudo-spectral method, developed by  the proposer and A. Bayliss, is employed for large scale   scientific computations, with which the local description is globally   extended. The solutions of the problems considered exhibit layer type  behavior, i.e., localized regions in which the solution varies very  rapidly. It is a challenge to numerical methods to accurately and   efficiently resolve such behavior. The adaptive pseudo-spectral method  has been shown to successfully meet this challenge. As critical  parameters of the problem are exceeded, transitions to   states with successively greater degrees of  spatio-temporal complexity occur.    Our goal is to describe the transitions as well as the resulting   spatio-temporal patterns. The analytical studies, in addition to  elucidating system behavior, e.g., parameter dependencies, also serve  as benchmarks for the ensuing numerical computations. Codes are thus   validated not only for simple solutions, but for complex  spatio-temporal behavior as well. In addition to studying specific   combustion problems, we contribute to the development of both analytical and   numerical methodology for the investigation of these and other  problems. Finally, where possible, comparisons to relevant  experimental observations will be made.    We investigate mathematical problems describing combustion processes. The   primary concern in these studies is the understanding of basic mechanisms,   including cause and effect, influencing combustion,  which is a necessary   prerequisite to any attempt to control the combustion process. In particular,   we study the characteristics, e.g., structure, propagation speed, stability,   etc., of combustion waves.  An example of the problems considered is the use   of combustion waves to synthesize advanced materials. In the conventional   technology, a powder mixture of components is placed in a furnace and ""baked""   until it is well done. In combustion synthesis the mixture is pressed into a   solid and ignited at one end. A combustion wave then propagates through the  solid converting it to desired product. The process is significantly  faster and cheaper than the conventional technology. The nature of the  product is determined by the manner of propagation of the combustion  wave, which is the subject of our investigation."

The problems  that will be addressed are related to phenomena that have been observed  experimentally and are not yet completely understood. They fall in two  categories: the first class of problems is concerned with premixed flames  propagating in tubes, while the second class is concerned with diffusion  flames (non-premixed combustion) that result from evaporating liquid fuels.  The mathematical formulation of these problems can be reduced to a single,  or a couple, of evolution equations that contain the main ingredients of  the physical problem and are to be solved numerically. For premixed flames  propagating in tubes the evolution equation takes the form of an  integro-differential equation that describes the instantaneous shape and  location of the flame front. For the burning of liquid films one finds, in  general, two equations: one for the dynamics of the interface between the  liquid and gas phases, and the other for the diffusion flame sheet which is  the interface where the fuel vapor burns with the ambient oxidant.      Combustion processes are extremely complicated; they encompass subjects  concerned with energy generation and heat transfer, rates and mechanisms of  chemical reactions, fluid flow and mass transport. They cover a broad range  of important engineering technologies as well as topics of primary societal  and environmental concerns. A fundamental way to gain understanding into  the complex phenomena that one observe in various combustion systems is  through mathematical modeling. This approach enables one to identify the  underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomenon, to  study the interaction between the various physical parameters and to  explore whether this interaction leads to the observed behavior. A deep  understandin g often leadq to suggestions of new directions for experiments  and design. The problems in this study are concerned with premixed flames,  relevant to internal combustion engines and aerospace propulsion systems  where the fuel and oxidant are intimately mixed prior to ignition, and  combustion of liquid fuels, relevant to accidental spillage and fire spread  where, under special circumstances, burning may occur with the available  ambient oxidant."

It will  begin with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation that relates surface height  to spatial data collected by Synthetic Aperture Radar.  The  characteristic curves for this radar equation ""flow"" in one direction  like time dependent phenomena.  Due to a monotonicity property of the  Hamiltonian, one can establish -- for some cases -- a unique physical  solution for discontinuous data as the limit of continuous data  approximation viscosity solutions.  One can also prove that this  unique solution can be simulated by monotone numerical schemes.  The  first goal of this project is to combine viscosity solution theory  for Hamilton Jacobi equations with the theory of generalized  characteristics from Conservation Law theory to establish the  uniqueness of the solution for most (or all) cases.  The second goal  is to establish a unique limit for the case of surface reconstruction  from discontinuous optical data.  The optical data equation does not  have ""flowing"" characteristics and therefore requires Dirichlet, as  opposed to Cauchy, boundary conditions.  Generalized characteristics  are inappropriate for Dirichlet conditions, but recent Control Theory  approaches appear to work well in their place.  The Hamiltonian is no  longer monotonic, but it is now convex, which, it is hoped, can be  exploited in a similar manner to the monotonicity property.  Finally,  these methods will be applied to classes of Conservation Laws with  discontinuous media that correspond to the classes of Hamilton-Jacobi  equations previously studied.    Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is used extensively by NASA (who, for  example, collected SAR data for most of the surface of Venus in 1990  using the Magellan probe) and the military.  Ideally, one would like  to reconstruct a surface from the collected radar data.  Thi s  reconstruction (called Shape from Shading) can -- from previous   work -- be accomplished very quickly for noiseless, continuous  radar data.  For discontinuous data, which occurs in the presence of  ridges (e.g., mountains, cliffs, tank edges, building edges, etc.),  it is unknown (a) if only one surface corresponds to the SAR data and  (b) if the surface is computable.  Previous work has shown  that for a number of surfaces there is only one physically likely  surface and it is easy to compute.  First, this project hopes to show  that this is the case for all surfaces.  The next goal of the project  is to extend this result to optical data (i.e., reconstructing a 3-D  surface from a 2-D photograph), which has numerous applications both  in industry and in the military (where it is typically referred to as  ""computer vision"").  The final goal of this project is to apply these  results to Conservation Laws with discontinuous media (e.g.,  describing chemical separation with two or more solvents, describing  two phase flow, etc.), which is of interest, for example, to Chemical  Engineers, who must be able to compute simulations for these  situations to maximize chemical conversions effectively in industrial  processes."

Traditional signal processing   approaches have generally relied upon the assumption that systems are   either periodic/quasi-periodic or random.  The NLD forecasting approach   attempts to bridge the gap between these approaches by assuming that there   may be a deterministic component which is responsible for the observed   complex behavior.  Prior work on a test case has shown that it is possible to   use NLD forecasting to predict seismic background noise sufficiently well   that it is possible to reduce the noise by over an order of magnitude, making   it possible to see hidden teleseismic events.  In other applications, NLD   forecasting has been used to unmask secure chaotic communication   schemes by predicting the dynamics of the chaotic carrier with sufficient   accuracy that the hidden messages may be extracted.  The proposed research   will expand the use of multi-step forecasting methods so that predictions   can be made for longer times, and so that signal extraction may be   improved.  Resumming techniques will also be studied, where a series of   short-term predictions will be used to rebuild the hidden signals.  Seismic   data from various sites will be examined to explore the limits of   predictability, and an attempt will be made to develop real-time processing   techniques which will aid in monitoring of nuclear treaties.  The link   between spectral signal processing methods and NLD processing will be   studied so that the tools can be used in a complementary and integrated   manner.  Curvature-based methods of NLD processing will be developed   for time series where it is difficult to get a nice phase space reconstruction.    NLD forecasting will be used to create statistical ensembles which can then   be considered from a statistical processing perspective.  Success in these   research areas will represent significant progress in the developme nt of   NLD signal processing as an important new technology.    This project will attempt to develop a new signal processing technology   based on nonlinear dynamic (NLD) forecasting. Traditional signal   processing approaches have generally relied upon the assumption that   systems are either periodic or random.  NLD signal processing recognizes   that many systems which appear to be random may be produced by   processes which are inherently predictable, at least in the short-term.  In   fact, it is the ability to make accurate short-term predictions which   distinguishes nonlinear dynamic systems (also known as chaotic systems)   from typical random systems.  These NLD prediction techniques have   already been used on a test case of seismic background noise provided by   the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), where it was shown   that the background noise could be predicted so well that after the predicted   background was removed, one could clearly see the presence of hidden   signals which were essentially equivalent to distant nuclear test detonations.    In another application, NLD prediction techniques have been used to extract   hidden messages from chaotic communication systems, where the   predictions about the behavior of the chaotic carrier signal were so accurate   that when they were removed, the hidden message signal could be observed.    The proposed research will expand these NLD forecasting methods to   improve the extraction of signals from noisy environments.  The seismic   problem will be examined using various data sources to determine the limits   of predictability, and a parallel processing implementation will be used to   attempt to develop a real-time processing system which may be useful for   monitoring of nuclear treaties.  Further research will examine the   connection between NLD techniques and traditional signal processing   techniques.  Success in these research areas will represent significant   progress in the development of NLD signal processing  as an important new   technology."

The principal   investigator plans to show that questions regarding knot types, mechanisms   for knotting and unknotting, stability of knot formations and classification   of knots by means of standard representatives can be effectively addressed   in this context. The two main tools that will be used are the periodic theory   of relevant integrable equations (among which are the Continuous   Heisenberg Model, the focusing Nonlinear Schroedinger and the sine-  Gordon equations) with periodic boundary conditions, and the theory of   Backlund transformations. The PI will use constructive methods for   multiphase solutions to generate large classes of knot representatives and   will study a precise relation between their knot type and the associated   Floquet spectrum both theoretically and computationally. Backlund   transformations will be used to investigate possible mechanisms for   topological changes, to construct self-intersecting curves that represent   transitions between different knot types and to produce examples of knots   that are realized by curves with special properties (such as curves of   constant torsion).    Complex structures in the form of knotted and linked loops are present in   many phenomena of the physical world: tornadoes, plasma loops and   magnetic arches in stellar atmospheres display complicated vortex   formations; mitochondrial DNA is a coiled, often knotted, molecule;   bacteria strands are found to form tangled loops; links and knots are   observed in certain stable mixtures of chemical media. This project   concerns the connection between evolution equations whose structure is   well-understood and the properties of knotted loops which arise in the study   of vortex filament dynamics and DNA modeling. The principal goal of this   inve stigation is the development of the mathematical tools necessary to   effectively address questions regarding the mechanisms for knotting and   unknotting, the stability of knot formations and the classification of knots   and links. Such issues are gaining great importance in a number of applied   fields: for example, an understanding of the complex vortex structures in the   solar crown can provide information on how the sun's magnetic activity   affects the earth's climate, while topological changes such as loop creation,   knotting and unknotting appear to be at the heart of the replication   mechanism of the DNA molecule, a fundamental question in cancer   research."

Capillarity effects are commonly observed in the shape of the surface of water or other liquid in a glass. For narrower containers, such as a test tube or drinking straw, the capillary forces make the surface of the liquid  more curved and lift the liquid up the sides of the container.  Interest is growing in this topic which has applications in areas as diverse as fluid management in low gravity, semiconductor manufacturing, behavior of liquids in porous rocks, and many other situations in which surface forces predominate over gravity.  A significant parameter in capillarity phenomena is the angle that the liquid makes with a solid surface, this angle is called the contact angle.  The angle depends on the liquid and the properties of the solid surface.  The principle investigator has shown that in the presence of a corner, the height of the capillary surface in the corner depends, in a discontinuous way, on the relation between the angle of the corner and the contact angle. One aspect of this research will be applicable to finding new ways of determining the contact angle.  The mathematical questions to be investigated will require new and as yet untested ideas for their resolution.  The problems are exciting, relating formal mathematics directly to physics and leading to experimental verification.

While the vast majority of interior point methods for linear  programming (LP) have proven polynomial complexity, this is not the  case for SDP. The iteration complexity of interior point algorithms for  SDP and its dependence on the search direction as well as on the  central path neighborhood used by the algorithm will be investigated.  Locally superlinearly convergent algorithms will be identified within  the class of interior point methods for SDP with proven polynomial  complexity. Superlinear convergence is especially important for SDP  since no finite termination schemes exist for such problems. The local  convergence analysis for interior point algorithms for SDP is much more  challenging than those for LP and it will be a major focus point of the  project.  A C++ package for solving large-scale SDP problems will be  developed. The code will efficiently handle different sparsity patterns  arising in applications, and will provide refined infeasibility  detectors.    Semidefinite programming (SDP) represents one of the most important  classes of optimization problems with many applications in science and  engineering especially related to optimal control (in electrical  engineering), optimal allocation of resources (in economics and  manufacturing), structural optimization (in civil engineeering), etc.  According to a recent survey paper, semidefinite programming is ``the  most exciting development in mathematical programming in the 1990's''.  Until recently no efficient methods were known for solving general  semidefinite programming problems. In the late 80's it has been  realized that interior point methods, initially developed for linear  programming, can be successfully used  for solving semidefinite  programming problems. The advent of interior point methods has created  new opportunities for the application of SDP in science and  engineering. In order for these opportunities to materialize it is  important to provide the scientific community with a good theoretical  understanding of the behaviour of interior point methods for SDP and  with reliable and efficient software capable of solving large-scale SDP  problems.  The project will investigate some of the most critical  issues in the theory of semidefinite programming and will lead to the  design of efficient practical algorithms. The software resulting from  this project is likely to have a positive impact on several application  areas in science and technology."

The goal of the theory is to develop criteria for measuring effectiveness  and efficiency of various algorithms and difficulty of various problems.  The term ``complexity'' refers to the amount of resources required by a   computation. In this proposal, running time or number of arithmetic  operations is the major resource of interest.  The aim of the proposal is to further develop the complexity theory of  linear programming (LP). In particular, we analyze ``condition'' numbers that  determine the degree of difficulty of an LP problem, and ``precondition'' the  problem using Partial Knowledge. Therefore, we study whether or not certain  kinds of partial knowledge could help in solving this problem and how they  impact the complexity of the problem. If such knowledge is helpful and  available, then an experienced owner of LP problem instances might be able  to use it to solve them more effectively.     In general, progress in the area of developing efficient algorithms for  solving large-scale optimization problems will be of great importance in  improving the efficiency of manufacturing systems, communication networks,  aircraft routing, multiple-flow operations, and resources planning.   Strengthening research in this area will contribute to the national interest  in industrial competitiveness and scientific knowledge.   Businesses, large and small, use LP models to optimize telecommunication  networks, to schedule traffic flows, to control manufacturing processes,   to plan financial investments, to minimize production costs, etc. LP has  been the mostly used applied mathematics and computation tool. Historically,  research developments on LP have dramatically widened the scope of its  applications. Many problems, which were ""unsolvable"" 15 years ago, are now  solved in few minutes and in real time.

From the perspective of human   physiology it is critical to understand transport phenomena in complex   biological systems. This project addresses areas where improved knowledge   of transport properties for  multi-phase systems will have a large impact on   technology. A significant part of this project focuses on the behavior of   composites with imperfectly bonded components. Imperfect bonding   between constituents is often the rule. Imperfect bonds are frequently the   result of damage to the structure incurred during use. The first project treats   the design of fiber reinforced materials in the presence of imperfect bonding   between the fiber and the matrix material. The goal is to provide rigorous   design rules for the optimal performance of imperfectly bonded fiber   reinforced structures. We consider next the transmission of oscillating   electric signals through structural materials possessing imperfectly bonded   constituents. We look for new mathematical methods that will deliver   structural information from the transmitted signal. These methods will rely   on the physics of the imperfect bond  separating the constituents. The third   project treats  the transport of ions in a biological system. The goal is to   understand the effect of cell geometry on the ionic transport within living   tissue. Last, the small geometries necessary for the layout of very large   scale integrated circuits incur high concentrations of the electric field along   conducting paths. These concentrations often result in the failure of an   electronic devise such as a microprocessor. The conducting paths are often   made from aluminum alloys of three or more materials. We seek the best   geometries among multi- phase conductors so as to minimize electric field   concentrations.    The analysis and o ptimal design of multi-phase materials is central to the   development of advanced materials for use in electronics, transportation   systems, and aerospace structures. From the perspective of human   physiology it is critical to understand transport phenomena in complex   biological structures. This project addresses areas where improved   knowledge of transport properties for multi-phase structures will have   impact on technology and medicine. Fiber reinforced structures appear in   many applications ranging from golf clubs to the rotors on windmills. Over   time the adhesion between the fibers and the surrounding material is   compromised by use. We investigate the optimal design of such structures   taking into account the imperfect adhesion between fiber and surrounding   material. Our goal is to design more durable products that last longer than   conventional fiber reinforced products. Next, we investigate how to reduce   the failure of microelectronic devices due to high concentrations of electric   current. The small geometries used in the layout of integrated circuits   require very narrow strips of metal to conduct electric currents. These strips   often fail because of the  high volume of current that they carry. The   conducting strips are often made from a mixture of Aluminum, Copper , and   Silicon. We seek the best deployment of the  Copper and Silicon in the   metal strip to prevent failure. Last, we attempt an improved characterization    of inter cellular ionic transport. From the stand point of human physiology,   an  understanding of such transport for human brain cells may offer early   detection of the extent of damage caused by stroke."

It   deals with optimal control of diffusion processes by means of a free   boundary as well as optimal control at a reflection boundary of the   stochastic process.  This type of control naturally appears in the problems in   which there is no natural restriction on the rates of control and the optimal   control rates are infinite. (This type of control model serves also as a good   approximation for the situations when the rates are bounded but very large.)    The optimal policy is then to reflect the process from an a priori unknown   boundary. Natural models where such type of action arises are related to the    problems with additive input, where there are no a priori limits on the   control rates or as an approximation for the problems with optimal policy of   a ""bang-bang"" type. The proposed research consists of developing the   theory of the related PDE with gradient constraints, studying optimal   reflecting barriers in multidimensional cases, and applying the results to   different mechanical, manufacturing and financial models.    This research should provide a sound theoretical base for developing   optimal control algorithms for an automatic cruise control of a missile    subject to uncertain wind conditions or a space vehicle subject to small   perturbations in mechanical units. The developed technique will enable one   to calculate the position when the maximal correction force should be   applied as well as the optimal direction of this force. At the ""ground level""   this theory will give a tool to derive optimal inventory levels for complex   flexible manufacturing systems as well as optimal timings for changes in   the  manufacturing processes. In the financial world this theory will provide   a method for finding optimal levels of funds for financial companies whose   assets are subject to random fluctuations. For example, in the case of a large   insurance company whose liquid assets  are constantly fluctuating due to   uncertainty in the times and amounts of incoming claims, it will be  possible   to calculate the optimal level of the reserve which should be maintained in   order to have the optimal balance between the risk and profit potential."

A directional solidification set-up  is considered to study the coupling between the distributions  of temperature and concentrations, fluid flow due to particle  movement, convection, solute segregation, interfacial deformations  and particle presence near the moving interface. The mathematical  model, based on the conservation equations of energy, solute, mass and  momentum, is complemented by a set of appropriate boundary conditions.  The resulting non-dimensional system displays several dimensionless  groupings, all of which have a role in the subsequent analysis.  This will predict the dominant crystal morphology, stability criteria  for interface shape, convection and density advection effects  and  determine the threshold parameter values that separate pushing  and capture of particles. A weakly nonlinear bifurcation analysis  will be used to determine if the theoretical predictions can  be verified experimentally. The methodology requires the use  of perturbation techniques, asymptotic analysis, the bispherical  coordinate system, bifurcation methods  appropriate to weakly nonlinear  analysis, and some numerical methods.         As we approach the twenty-first century, scientists and  technologists are under increasing pressures to satisfy  society's need for materials of lower weight and higher reliability.  For instance, in the aerospace industry, a reduced weight facilitates  an increased payload capacity in flight, operating cost savings, higher  speeds and longer range flights. However, lighter materials need to be  strengthened by the addition of tiny particles of a different  substance. This in turn complicates the manufacturing process.  The final cast should have these particles uniformly distributed  but, in practical terms, this is difficult to achieve. Imperfections  arise due to the migration  of the particles in the melt during  the solidification process, and are detrimental to the quality of the  end product. Some indications of how to overcome these difficulties  have been provided by experimental work. In view of the large number  of processing and physical variables, these partial solutions  are unable to clearly relate the processing history to the constitution  of the cast. There remains the crucial task of quantifying the  influence of the various processing parameters on the final cast,  and this is the aim of our analytical work."

Shape-memory materials are  materials that are extremely malleable in the martensite phase below a  transformation temperature, but that return to a `remembered' original  shape when heated above the transformation temperature.   Coherent phase transitions of crystalline solids lead to mixtures of  distinct phases or phase variants with characteristic fine-scale  structures. The main issues addressed in this project are the characteristic  scales, the generation and the propagation of the   microstructures. A nonlocal theory involving integro-differential  evolutionary equations is proposed to answer these questions.  This theory lies between the traditional microscopic quantum theory which   uses Schodinger's equation and the macroscopic elasticity theory which uses  elliptic and hyperbolic partial differential equations. In the study of  the  characteristic scales, a periodic solution of a stationary nonlocal equation  is needed. But the  equation seems to have multiple solutions. The `right'  periodic solution should be selected by a suitable least energy  principle. Another intriguing question is to find a `generalized' traveling  wave solution of a dynamic nonlocal equation, which describes the propagation  of microstructures. This solution should have an oscillatory structure  at one end, constant value at the other end, and as time increases the  uniform-to-oscillatory transition region should advance in a periodic  manner. Such a solution can also be viewed as a heteroclinic orbit in an  infinitely dimensional function space connecting a periodic stationary  solution to a constant stationary solution.       Materials and processing are critical to the success of industries such as the  aerospace, automotive, biomaterials, chemical, electronics, energy, metals,  and telecommunications industries. This project is concerned with shape memory  materials and  martensite transformations. The mathematical theory in this  project is aimed at understanding the characteristic scales, the generation  and the propagation of the microstructures during shape memory materials'  phase transformations. The study of stationary periodic solutions ald  uniform-to-oscillatory waves of the integro-differential evolutionary equations  used in this nonlocal mathematical theory is at the cutting edge of  mathematical analysis and computation."

Because flow changes are  coupled to these instabilities, it now appears to be the case  that this reaction-infiltration mechanism plays an important role  in many strategically significant problems (see below).  The  investigator models such phenomena as coupled nonlinear  partial-ordinary differential equations and as moving free  boundary problems and investigates the importance of the role  played by dispersive effects, geomechanical effects, boundary and  inertial effects, layered and random media, concentration  dependent diffusivity and permeability and surface reactions.  Basic existence, uniqueness and regularity of the coupled system  of equations are studied as well as the sharp interface limit.  The loss of stability of high-symmetry solutions is studied using  bifurcation theory and numerical simulation.       These mathematical models of goechemical processes and the  results listed above have direct application to many problems in  the petroleum, mining and waste management industries.  For  example, in enhanced oil recovery, the loss of stability of the  spherical reaction front at the injection well often leads to  fingering of the reactants directly to the removal site  completely bypassing the oil.  Moreover the dissolution and  reprecipitation of the porous media by the reactants can  sometimes lead to complete plugging at the injection well  requiring expensive redrilling.  Similar processes can explain  observed reductions in the effectiveness of bioremediation of  environmental wastes or predict the observed, but previously  unexpected, rapid encroachment of nuclear and chemical wastes on  sensitive environments.  By calculating the shape of redox fronts,  these methods can also be used (avoiding expensive drilling) to  locate lens-shaped (roll-front) uranium deposits.

This proposal involves research on two topics:  (a) the study of   interfaces, and (b) the use of renormalization and scaling methods to   study systems of parabolic differential equations.  The study of   interfaces proceeds along the lines of previous work that utilizes the   phase field model.  The study of alloys is particularly important in   terms of the ''freezing in'' of solute into the solid.  This is an area   in which mathematics can make a substantial contribution since the   models necessarily involve differential equations that are degenerate,   as the diffusivity is close to zero in the solid phase.  In the second   part of the study, the PI will utilize renormalization and scaling   methods to obtaing results on systems of parabolic differential   equations in which an asymptotic self-similarity can be expected.    The work involves an extension of the PI's work that used these   methods to compute anomalous exponents in nonlinear diffusion   equations.  The objective is to extend these results to systems of   parabolic differential equations, thereby adding a powerful tool to the   methodology of these systems.  Finally, the study will apply these   methods to reaction-diffusion systems such as the phase field   equations in order to extract key features of global behavior.      This study will provide a formalism for studying complicated   problems involving materials science. In particular, interface   problems arise in many industrial applications and pose important   challenges in terms of theory and large scale computation. The   development of a consistent set of equations and methodology for   high speed computation is valuable as a starting point for many   industrial applications such as casting of alloys. The study will also   utilize renormalization techniques that have been so successful in   understanding subtle behavior in  thermodynamics. With the   development of these   techniques in this dynamical context, an extremely complicated   engineering problem can potentially be understood in terms of   manageable parts with particular characteristic behavior."

The investigator  studies whether principles developed for cellular automata models apply to  the more realistic semi-discrete case.  He considers specific models  developed from experimental data to give quantitative descriptions of  neural behavior.  A model of special interest is that of Morris and Lecar,  describing voltage oscillations in barnacle muscle fiber.

Recently, the principal investigator and a   collaborator systematically investigated the dynamics of various types of   almost periodic differential equations. Fundamental dynamical issues such   as the existence of almost periodic and almost automorphic solutions,   asymptotic behavior of bounded solutions, the structure of omega limit sets,   etc. have received a considerable amount of attention.  The principal   investigator and her collaborators also studied the global dynamics of some    almost periodic differential equations arising from biology and physics by   utilizing both the general  approach and theory established in the principal   investigator's joint works with Yi.  The principal investigator plans to   continue her research in almost periodic differential equations.  In   particular, she intends  to explore the global  dynamics of various almost   periodic population models such as migration-selection models and multiple   species competition models; to study almost periodically forced oscillators   such as  van der Pol oscillators and Josephson junctions;  to consider   spatially almost periodic parabolic equations; to find conditions on the   existence of almost periodic dynamics;  and to investigate  almost   automorphic dynamics in general differential equations.  In her recent work   and also in joint works with her collaborators, she studied the stability of   standing and traveling waves and the existence of chaotic dynamics in   lattice dynamical systems.  Among the results, an existence criterion for   chaotic dynamics in coupled map lattices is found; a moving coordinate   approach, which is different from but analogous to the traditional moving   coordinate approach in partial differential equations, is introduced to deal   with traveling waves; and various dynamics such as spatial chaos,   propagation failure, traveling waves, etc., are shown  to exist in  a discrete   Nagumo equation. The above works provide some insight into the complex   behavior of lattice dynamical systems.  Continuing her commitments in   lattice dynamical systemq, she would like to study the following problems    in the near future:  other possible routes such as bifurcations to chaotic   dynamics; existence and stability of traveling waves and the appearance of   synchronization.  Moreover, she intends to continue the analysis of the   dynamics in the discrete Nagumo equation; and to explore the dynamics in   lattice  population models.    Both almost periodic differential equations and lattice dynamical systems   are widely used as models for many  physical and biological problems.  For   example, in the population dynamics of a single species, the dynamics of   the species is described by an almost periodic reaction diffusion equation if   a continuous environment is inhabited, seasonal variation is accounted for   (note that  seasonal variation may  not be exactly periodic but rather almost   periodic) and there is another inherent periodic variation.  If the species   inhabits a patchy environment, then its dynamics are described by a lattice   ordinary differential equation.  Furthermore, if each individual of the   species migrates from patch to patch in a discrete time manner, then the   dynamics are characterized by a coupled map lattice.  Numerous other   examples are found in electric circuits, climate dynamics, image processing   and pattern recognition, material sciences, etc.  It is therefore of great   importance to study almost periodic differential equations and lattice   dynamical systems.  Though much research has been done, many scenarios   appearing in both areas are far from being well understood.  The principal   investigator proposes to do research in these two areas.  In particular, based   on her previous experience, she plans to study various models arising from   physics and biology such as competition models, almost periodically fo rced   oscillators, etc.  The proposed research is intended to be a mathematical   contribution to the qualitative and quantitative theory of almost periodic   differential equations and lattice dynamical systems, resulting in a better   understanding of complex behavior in these systems."

One is that of   instabilities and modes, and the other is that of bifurcations of orbits. The   work is analytical and is based on the approximation that galaxies are   collisionless stellar systems. That approximation is based on the belief that   most of the mass of galaxies is in the form of stars and dark matter, which   move, without mutual collisions, on orbits whose form is determined by the   total gravity field of the galaxy. N-body simulations of galaxies have shown   that both instabilities and large-scale modes of oscillation do occur, and that   their occurrence depends on the orbital  population of the galaxy. Modes   occur when all the orbits pulsate in a coherent manner, while instability   occurs when the collective response of the orbital population to a   disturbance is to reinforce it and make it grow. The principal investigator   will seek detailed descriptions of these possibilities to help explain the   underlying dynamics.  He has developed a new technique for the accurate   location and tracking of modes and instabilities. The bifurcations to be   investigated are those at which the form and stability of orbits change. The   nature of the orbits is crucial to the structure of a galaxy. Though the two   classes of phenomena are to be investigated separately, they are likely    interrelated.    Galaxies are of interest because they are the fundamental building blocks of   the Universe. A typical galaxy is composed of hundreds of billions of stars,   each of which moves on its own individual orbit according to well-known   physical laws of dynamics. The primary interest of the principal investigator   is in the stability of such systems, and a secondary interest is in the nature of   the orbits and the ways in which they can change. One determines whether   or not a system is stable by studying how it responds when it is pertur bed.   The response may be a mode in which all the orbits manage to pulsate   regularly in unison. Alternatively, disturbances dissipate and decay when   there is stability, or reinforce and grow when there is instability. Each type   of behavior has been observed in computer experiments. What this work   seeks is theoretical understanding of underlying causes. It will be carried   out using mathematical models, which are of necessity statistical because of   the large number of stars to be represented, and a combination of   mathematical analysis and computation. Galaxies are known to have existed   over a large fraction of the age of the Universe, and hence should be free of   all but the mildest instabilities. Hence any findings concerning the   requirements for stability is in principle testable against observations of the   present day dynamical structure of galaxies."

The aims  for this project are to explore what can be learned about these  problems from the theoretical and computational viewpoints, using  the dynamical systems approach to turbulence.  More specifically  the investigators and their colleagues intend: (i)  to develop  new efficient computational algorithms taking into account the  physics of turbulence and well adapted to the current evolution  of large scale computing towards parallel computing; (ii)  to  devote special attention to the problems related to the study of  the climate and global changes.  For (i), new multilevel  algorithms related to the concept of attractor and approximate  inertial manifolds have been introduced during the past years.  The analysis of these algorithms is developed, their performances  improved, and their range of application extended, in particular  towards problems of practical relevance.  During the period of  this grant a book will be published on this subject, describing  the state of the art on the theoretical side, and including many  aspects of their actual implementation on parallel computers.

Involved models based on the primitive equations are considered,  as well as simpler models such as multilayer or quasi-geostrophic  models.  The study includes the development of the models and the  mathematical and numerical problems that they raise.       The interaction of meteorology and mathematics has very long  traditions going back to such famous names as Leonard da Vinci,  Pierre Simon Laplace or, in this century, after WWII, John Von  Neumann.  At a more  modest level, the investigators pursue a  program of research initiated a few years ago and aimed at  developing interactions between geosciences and mathematics.  These interactions can be mutually beneficial.  Meteorology and  oceanography raise very challenging mathematical problems very  useful for mathematicians and other scientists (for example  scientists have learned much from the experience of E.  Lorenz in  chaos).  Conversely, mathematicians might help scientists of the  geoscience communities in choosing their models by determining if  they are well posed.  In the long range they might help also  develop new efficient numerical procedures; although the codes  (programs) used in meteorology and oceanography are very involved  codes written over a long period of time, eventually new codes  will be written responding to new needs or new opportunities, and  new insights could become useful; it is hoped to contribute to  this daunting task."

They  are the phase transition problem, magnetostriction, and hydrodynamic models  of semiconductors. The phase transition problems are a fundamental problem  in physics and an important research area in engineering. Some of the  materials undergoing the phase transition are called ``smart materials.''  Typical examples are shape memory alloys. In the phase transition problem we  examine the compatibility of the entropy rate admissibility criterion and  the entropy condition. Then, we discuss the existence of global weak  solutions and numerical analysis. We need a careful analysis of the  interaction between phase boundary and elementary waves (shock waves and  rarefaction waves). I believe that this research will bring a better  understanding of the phase transitions. The magnetostriction is the  combination of wave equations for elasticity and the Landau-Lifshitz  equations for the magnetic moment. We can regard them as nonlinear wave  equations with rate equations, where the rate equations have a special  structure. This gives an interesting dynamics. We consider the traveling  wave solutions, the smooth and weak solutions, numerical analysis, and etc.  We also consider the Ericksen bar. Some magnetic materials undergo phase  transition. This research may bring an insight to it. Also, this research  may be useful to study the hysteretic behavior observed in some magnetic  materials. The semiconductors are important materials or devices in  industry. Recently, the hydrodynamic models are becoming more popular. The  equations we discuss consist of the hydrodynamic equations for electrons and  the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential. We consider mainly the  stability of steady state solutions. The stability issue is an important  subject especially when there are multiple steady state solutions.    I study mathematical aspects of materials science. One goal is to have  better understanding of t he phase transitions. In phase transition problems  we discuss the change of various properties of materials due to change in  factors such as temperature. A typical example is water which changes to  vapor or ice depending on temperature. The phase transitions take place in  magnetic materials too. The phase transitions in magnetic materials are used  for various switching devices or recording devices. A very good example of  magnetic material is a videorecording tape. It is important to understand  the mechanisms of phase transitions so that we can construct better devices.  In some such materials, it is important to consider both elastic and  magnetic effects as both influence the ways in which the phase transitions  occurs. By elastic effects we mean the effects associated with compressing  or pulling the material. There are mathematical models describing the phase  transitions. I plan to study how various effects such as above influence  each other. I would like to study these mathematical models analytically as  well as numerically. I also study hydrodynamic models of semiconductors. In  these types of models we regard the electric current as ``fluid'' and study  how this ``fluid'' flows in semiconductors. Semiconductors are used in PCs  and other electric devices. To study how the electric current runs in the  semiconductors is very important and interesting. There are a few  hydrodynamic models depending on what kind of effects one wants to consider.  An important effect that has not been considered is temperature.

The approach employed here differs from  many others, in that it enlarges from the outset the collection of  deformations that a body can undergo to include non-classical  ""structured deformations.""  The present, ""front-end"" approach provides  flexibility in modelling and gives simple and direct predictions of  important phenomena such as yielding, hysteresis, and dissipation for a  variety of microstructures.  The key mathematical idea employed is that  the limit of a sequence of derivatives of functions may differ from the  derivative of the limit of the sequence of func- tions.  The difference  between these two quantities gives a concrete measure of the amount of  deformation due to ""disarrangements"" at small length scales.  Existing  theories of crystalline solids, liquid crystals, polycrystalline metals,  and granular materials introduce measures of such deformations via  ""internal variables"" or ""directors"", e.g.,  plastic deformation,  molecular orientation, or void fraction.  Although these variables have  natural physical interpretations, in standard approaches they must be  accepted as primitive objects within a theory; for structured  deformations, counterparts of these variables can be calculated directly  as limits of averages of geometrical changes at the microlevel.  The  proposed research will provide precise definitions and useful formulas  for kinematical quantitities such as ""velocity and stretching due to  slip"" and ""velocity and stretching without slip"", will achieve new  refinements of general balance laws and dissipation inequalities, and  will obtain parallel refinements of specific constitutive relations that  distinguish one material body from another.        A principal challenge faced by applied mathematicians who model complex  phenomena such as the bending of a metal bar, t he appearance of  contrasting optical fields on a liquid crystal display, and the flow of  sand through a hopper is that of incorporating into the mathematical  equations the influence of the microscopic structure of each substance.   Considerable success has been achieved in individual cases of  technological importance, but there is lacking a clear and useful  language for systematically including microstructure.  As a result,  shifting, say, from studies of deformations in a bar to studies of sand  flowing through a hopper requires starting nearly from the beginning of  the modelling process.  The proposed research is part of an ongoing  program to provide a new, relatively simple mathematical language that  will permit a more efficient and economical procedure for modelling  these and other phenomena.  The initial successes of this program help  to provide simple and useful answeres to questions such as why a paper  clip springs back to a complex, curved shape when removed from a stack  of papers and does not spring back to the simple, straight shape that it  may have assumed early in its manufacture.  The proposed research will  continue the quest for a more unified and efficient approach toward   understanding and predicting complex phenomena based on knowledge of  microstructure."

Another question concerns parabolic effects, which require a  variant using different scalings in different directions. Another  question concerns the taking into account of oscillating initial data in  studying the propagation of oscillations and concentration effects for  general hyperbolic systems with variable coefficients, a particular  emphasis being put on questions of Elasticity in connection with seismic  problems.

The Principal Investigator has developed under NSF grants a new approach  to general questions of Continuum Mechanics and Physics, which  corresponds to explaining how waves can appear to behave like particles.

As an   important tool for such investigations, it is also proposed to further develop   a basic theory and a calculus of subdifferentials.

This effort focuses on the dynamics of internal-wave   groups, particularly the coupling of the short-scale carrier   oscillations with the envelope of the group.  This is a fully nonlinear   mechanism that plays an important part in the generation of   gravity-capillary solitary waves on deep water and in the radiation of   oscillatory tails by nonlinear wave groups.

The results of this research effort are expected to be useful in   detecting and controlling the propagation of nonlinear wave disturbances   in various applications.  In the ocean environment, for instance,   knowledge of internal-wave activity is important in under-sea navigation   and in the design of deep-water offshore facilities.

Particular emphasis will be paid to three dimensional shear flows.  Among the issues that will be investigated are:  (a) the mechanism(s)  that cause instabilities in viscoelastic flows (b) what rheological and  hydrodynamical factors are responsible for the instabilities and (c)  the nature of bifurcations that occur once instability has set in. Of  great interest will be to asses the role of rheological factors such  as  first and second normal stress differences,  and shear thinning in  the onset and development of instabilities. The importance of  hydrodynamical and geometrical factors like inertia, surface tension  and aspect ratios will also be investigated.  To this end we shall  consider shear flows in different geometries and will employ a number  of different constitutive models such as  the Oldroyd--B, Phan--Thien  Tanner, Johnson Segalman and the Giesekus models. The results of our  analysis will be compared with available experimental results. In  addition to providing qualitative as well as quantitative results on  instabilities and bifurcations our results will also provide valuable  information on how well different constitutive models describe not only  simple shear flows but complex flows as well.    Non--Newtonian (or viscoelastic) fluids which are the subject of this  project include materials used in a wide ranging number of industrial  and scientific applications.  Examples are polymers (used in the  plastic industry), paints, industrial inks, suspensions, emulsions and  biological fluids.  The nature and behavior of these fluids can be  radically different from ordinary fluids such as water (Newtonian  fluids) with which we are much more familiar. During industrial  processing and scientific experiments thes e fluids are subjected to  shearing motions. For example in order to determine the properties of  new materials they are placed in instruments called rheometers and  sheared. Data obtained from the subsequent motion are then used in  determining the relevant material properties. It is known from  applications and experiments that when viscoelastic fluids undergo  shearing the nature of the flow may change drastically in ways that may  lead to unpredictable results. These drastic changes are termed  instabilities. Because these instabilities can have undesirable as well  as unexpected consequences during industrial processing with great  economic implications,  it is important for us to understand the  factors that cause and sustain them.  Such an understanding will  provide a means  of predicting when such instabilities will occur and  what the effect will be on the flow when they occur. This will enable  us to set parameters during experiments and industrial processing so  that instabilities can be prevented. In this project we will try to  provide answers to these and other related issues by studying and  analyzing mathematical equations that describe the flow of viscoelastic  fluids.  This work will be an important contribution to the Federal  Government's strategic initiatives in the areas of materials and  manufacturing."

The method is  based on the Poincare   inequalities (spectral gap), logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and some entropy estimates.   The third project concerns the scaling limit of a quantum particle in a random potential.   There are two limiting cases: the low density  limit and the weak coupling limit. In both   cases, the phase space density of the quantum evolution  defined through  the Wigner   transform or the coherent state is expected to converge weakly to  a linear  Boltzmann   equation with  collision kernel given by the quantum   scattering  cross section.   This research addresses in particular the following two questions: (1) What is the   typical behavior of an individual particle in a fluid? Though the collective behavior of fluid    has been studied intensively, the important  question of the propagation of individual    particles in the fluid has not. The project will study this question with stochastic models   which are believed to capture the essential behavior of  the fluid.  (2) How does a wave   travel in random media. It is believed that  with high disorder, a wave in random media    becomes loca lized. The important question is to analyze the low disorder region when a   wave propagates. This can be considered as a model for conduction  of current in a   semiconductor, or propagation of radio waves or seismic waves. The practical  equation   governing all these diverse phenomena  is the  Boltzmann equation. This study will try to   validate the Boltzmann equation from more basic models involving  wave equations in   random media and to understand its next order corrections or fluctuations."

This result will be new even for   standard (positive definite) finite horizon cost problems.  In addition, we   would like to investigate conditions for solvability of certain differential   Riccati equations which are  related to certain nonlinear optimal control   problems.  (2)  Develop a minimax Riccati theory for indefinite cost problems, after   first developing the standard Riccati theory (i.e., the case where there are no   disturbances present in the system).  (3)  Verify various assumptions required by the minimax theory (which we   have developed previously) for various shell models.    The abstract problems that are being considered arise out of the   mathematical modeling of problems in mechanics and structural design.  In   particular, the focus is on large vibrating structures such as satellite dishes,   aircraft, antennae, etc.  By necessity, the modeling of the movement of these   structures results in systems of partial differential equations.  Ways will be   investigated in which to damp out (i.e., control) unwanted vibrations of   these structures. In addition, the project seeks to address the control of   vibrating structures in the presence of outside disturbances (e.g., external   forces on aircraft wings). The project's goal is to contribute in filling a large   gap in the literature on optimization problems for large flexible structures."

Continuing work on the MHD dynamo problem  will focus on the dynamical fate of intense small-scale magnetic  structure creating duing the kinematic phase of fast dynamo action.  This question is important since observations of galactic magnetic  fields indicate that the equilibrated fields have no dominant  small-scale structure. A second project deals with separation in the  corner region of Prandtl-Batchelor flows within a domain (such as a   rectangle), where the Euler limit has boundary stagnation points. The   breakdown of boundary layer theory due to the presence of  boundary stagnation points can be investigated in the limit of  large Reynolds number R by imposing wall data which is within  close to that of the  Euler limit with core vorticity 1. A third con-  tinuing study deals with an experiment in non-Boussinesq convec-  tion at high Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers and an analysis of the  large-scale motion which occurs in this flow.  In a new research initiative, we will study analytical and numerical   modeling of high-lift mechanisms in flapping insect flight, with  particular emphasis on hovering. We will study by simulation the  shedding of vortices from a sharp edge in time-dependent 2D Navier-Stokes  flows at Reynolds numbers of several thousand. We shall analyze the   significance and implication of the Kutta condition, the optimal use  of shed vortices in the production of lift, and applications  within conical symmetry to 3D flapping motions.    The Universe is pervaded by magnetic fields, threading through  galaxies, and surrounding stars and planets. However, the origin of  these fields is not well understood. In particular the galactic fields  pose many unanswered questions. This reseapch concerns the dynamo theory of  this magnetism. This unifying theory proposes that all fields  originate from amplification of a seed magnetic field developed during  the big  bang. The process of amplification, dynamo action,  resembles the laboratory dynamo effect but is more complicated because  it occurs in free fluid motion, usually turbulent motion. Our research  is attempting to understand the processes underlying this  amplification and the structure of the fields which result, especially how  this structure is developed by the natural processes available in turbulence.  Other parts of our research program deal with aspects of classical  fluid dynamics of importance in the convective flows within planets  and stars. It is flows of these kinds which are often  responsible for the dynamo effect. For example, convection within the   Earth's fluid core is believed to drive the Earth's dipolar magnetic  field. A new initiative in our research program will deal with the  fluid mechanics of insect hovering flight. Our ilterest  is in utilizing lifting mechanisms of flapping insect hoverers in the  design of small unmanned airborne vehicles. These mechanisms utilize   vortices which are shed into the fluid near the flyer, and interact  with it so as to augment the lift. We shall study the basic  process of shedding of vorticity from surfaces, the optimization of  the resulting lift, and the numerical simulation of the flows in two   dimensions. Important three-dimensional effects will be modeled using   conical symmetry of the flow field."

The mathematical objective is to quantify relationships between  spatial structure, instability, and dynamics as pertains to wave  behavior in nonlinear PDE systems.  In all of the proposed projects,  the model equations involve coupled PDE systems where the wave  behavior is strongly coupled to other background influences.  The  complexity of these models requires the development of new methods for  nonlinear waves which combine the techniques of asymptotic analysis,  modern dynamical systems theory, and numerical simulation.  These  projects focus on the understanding of nonlinear waves through the  identification of solutions representing the primary wave modes, along  with their dynamics and interaction properties -- while remaining  relevant within the underlying physical context.      Change in nature is often mediated by waves -- a process in which  spatial features evolve over time.  Familiar examples are outward  spreading of ripples in a pond and waves in the form of atmospheric  turbulence, which result in the ""bumpy"" flights experienced by  aircraft.

One area is the mathematical analysis of nonlinear  waves and fronts, particularly multidimensional shocks.  Another area  is control of systems governed by hyperbolic partial differential equations  (wave propagation equations) and discrete ``lumped parameter'' approximations  to them that would be used in numerical computation of optimal controls.  Two main computational areas are: 1: anisotropic adaptive refinement  methods for multidimensional approximation and finite element computation, and  2: Monte Carlo methods for computing quantum mechanical properties  of systems of interacting electrons.  Several other areas, including  the research of graduate students under my supervision are discussed.    There are several projects described here, most involving collaborations  with colleagues, postdoctoral trainees, or graduate students.  The project  on control of systems governed by hyperbolic differential equations   is about methods for removing acoustic noise from structures.  This has  applications in aircraft and submarine technology and in other places.  It fits in with a larger effort to design ""smart materials"" and ""smart  structures"".  Modern sensors, actuators, and computers are fast enough  to react to individual sound waves.  The mathematical problem is to design   good computational ""control strategies"" that use this ability effectively.    The existing mathematical theory of control was developed with smaller,   simpler systems in mind and does not apply directly to control of systems   where acoustic waves (sound waves) are propagating.  We hope that our theory   of control will apply to such problems.  A more computational project is the  attempt to compute the ""electronic structure"" of molecules from quantum   mechanics.  The equation to be solved (the Schrodin ger equation) has been   known since 1926.  Still in 1997, there is no reliable way to solve the  Schrodinger equation for systems involving more than one electron (an oxygen  atom has 8).  The ability to do this would have enormous scientific and   technological impact, with applications ranging from superconductivity  to drug design."

Both  projects study resonance among geophysical waves, in very  different scales: the former considers energy transfer through  the self-similar inertial range, from the long waves beyond which  the system is forced, to the short waves below which dissipative  mechanisms take over, and the latter concentrates on the very  long waves, comparable to the radius of the Earth, where forcing  plays an important role.  In fact, the resonance between long  equatorial waves could be considered as a starting point for the  resonant energy transfer toward shorter waves.  Once the scales  become relatively small, detailed information on the nature of  the forces is lost, and a statistically self-similar regime  arises, further carrying the energy through a wide range of  scales toward the very short waves.  The educational component of  this proposal involves developing a curriculum which blends  applied mathematics and geophysical fluid dynamics.  Particular  efforts are devoted to integrate experimental and numerical work  into both graduate and undergraduate education.  This is  facilitated by the building of a Laboratory for Fluid Dynamics at  the Courant Institute, scheduled to open in the Spring of 1997.  Two new graduate courses in the mathematical modeling of  geophysical waves are developed, one introductory and the other  more advanced, the latter focused on nonlinear mechanisms of  energy transfer among geophysical waves.  Numerical modeling and  desk-top experimentation are integrated into advanced  undergraduate mathematical courses, with the goal of introducing  undergraduate students to the lure and potential of  interdisciplinary work.       The Ocean and Atmospheric  Sciences have reached a degree of  maturity such that the accurate prediction of the weather and  even of longer term climatological changes appears to be within  reach.  A basic understanding of many of the fundamental processes  underlying the prevailing winds and currents has been developed  over the last few decades; and the computational power brought  about by the computer revolution makes it possible to run global  models with relatively fine grids.  However, the dynamics of the  weather and climate has a tremendous complexity, with phenomena  taking place in a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  This  complexity makes it hopeless to resolve all the relevant  phenomena without appealing to strong simplifying assumptions.  Applied Mathematics provides powerful tools that may help clarify  the validity of the various assumptions and shed light on many  phenomena not yet fully understood.  The two proposed subjects of  this research are examples of fields where this contribution  should be particularly fruitful.  The dynamics of equatorial waves  is known to strongly affect the global weather and climate;  phenomena such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and its global  effects exemplify this.  In order to study phenomena of this kind,  one needs to go beyond the time scale of the order of days of the  waves, to the months or years where small effects accumulate to  yield substantial changes in the amplitude and behavior of the  waves.  Asymptotic multiple-scale analysis is an ideal applied  mathematical tool to achieve this.  As for the other line of  research, understanding the transfer of energy among scales in  the Ocean and Atmosphere is fundamental to predict the long-time  effects that a change in forcing, such as the one brought about  by the release of chemicals in the Atmosphere and the Ocean, may  produce on our weather.  Involving students in these lines of  research, and bringing research-related results and methods into  their classroom education, also helps develop a  generation of  scientists better equipped to understand the difficult and  important problems of atmosphere and ocean interactions."

However, despite the efforts of several   independent groups, a useful FOSLS  formulation of the elasticity problems   for general boundary conditions is still a major problem.  The overlapping   grid method has proven itself an effective tool for problems set in regions   with complicated geometry.  Further, the analysis of these methods has been   lacking until a recent breakthrough for difference equations of positive type.   Since there are limitations on the order of accuracy of such difference   methods there is a need for further analysis. Spectral Collocation methods   are extremely accurate and very badly conditioned.  Hence preconditioning   strategies are essential. There are over twenty-five years of experience and   study of preconditioning methods. And, still, there is a need for better   approaches.  Moreover, the mathematical justification for some of these   methods is incomplete.    The basic theme of this research can be stated simply ""Find effective   numerical methods to solve the important boundary-value problems of   mechanics and material science, and provide mathematical proofs of their   validity.""  In the problems of elasticity most of the methods now in use are   expensive to implement.  Hence, a new formulation is sought which will   provide accurate approximations which can be computed at a reasonable   cost. In the other two cases one is dealing with established methods which   are either difficult to impleme nt or whose mathematical basis is incomplete.   This research is aimed at a more complete mathematical understanding   which will both clarify the existing methods and provide a basis for the   development of new, more effective methods."

Such systems arise naturally in a variety of   applications. The proposal focuses on the study of the consequences of   weak system symmetry--breaking perturbations for pattern formation in two   and three dimensions. In doing so it seeks to identify those aspects of   equivariant dynamics that are robust under symmetry-breaking   ""imperfections"". The approach promises to extend the applicability of   equivariant bifurcation theory to more realistic situations and is an   important step towards a theory of pattern formation in two and three   dimensions. Applications to a number of continuum systems are envisaged,   including pattern formation by the Faraday and Turing instabilities, and   acoustically driven shape oscillations of drops and bubbles.    This project will involve the study of the spontaneous formation of structure   in systems with symmetry. Such systems occur naturally in a variety of   applications, and may reflect the geometry of the system or a convenient   idealization. Symmetries are known to have a profound effect on the typical   behavior of the system. Near onset the process of structure or pattern   formation can be described by simplified equations called amplitude   equations. The form of these equations is dictated by the symmetries of the   system. Often the symmetries constrain these equations to such an extent   that only one possibility exists. The analysis of the resulting equations then   provides a complete understanding of the structure formation process, and   can be used to predict the type of structure that will form as the parameters   of the system are varied. Since in nature the assumed symmetries are   usually an idealization the proposal seeks to identify those aspects of the   structure formation process that are insensitive to small symmetry-breaking   imperfections, i.e., it seeks to identify those aspects that are robust. The a im   of the proposal is thus to extend the applicability of this type of theory to   realistic problems in both two and three dimensions. As examples of this   approach we shall study pattern formation in vibration-induced surface   waves, structure formation in chemical and biological systems via the   Turing instability, and the patterns on the surface of an acoustically excited   drop or bubble. An understanding of these relatively simple systems is a   prerequisite for extending the techniques to more complex systems."

For example, small noise   can eliminate chaotic behavior in slow-fast dynamics. Recently the principal   investigator has developed a new approach for studying these systems in   terms of probability densities. These techniques will be adapted to   investigate small noise effects in delay phenomena in excitable systems and   chemical reactions. Comparison of these problems will provide a basis for   characterizing a variety of noisy phenomena. The second objective is to   discover conditions for spatially localized oscillations in systems of coupled   oscillators. In particular, the principal investigator will consider bistability   of localized and nonlocalized dynamics in laser arrays and structural   dynamics. Numerical simulations and singular perturbation methods are   combined to  explore competing influences of the system parameters, initial   conditions, and resonance. The third objective is to explore pattern   dynamics in reaction-diffusion systems.  Complementary analytical   numerical methods are used to derive evolution equations and study the   dynamics and stability of modulated patterns. These techniques will be   applied in general reaction-diffusion problems and a specific application of   burner-stabilized flames. They will also be applied to investigate modulated   nonequilateral hexagonal patterns and transitions of two- dimensional   patterns in spatially inhomogeneous systems.    The first objective of this project is motivated by the dramatic effects of   small fluctuations in systems with interacting components. In some   examples of chaotic interactions, such as convection, waves in plasma,   turbulence and laser dynamics, small noise causes nearly periodic behavior   to replace large fluctuations and chaos. Noise can also change the transition   from a flat state to an oscillatory state in the propagation of nerve impulses   an d in laser intensities. When a time variation in a system parameter   controls the transition, there can be a delay or lag in the transition. The   introduction of small, rapid fluctuations in the control parameter reduces   this delay, as observed experimentally. Realizing the first objective will   facilitate the development of mathematical models which account for   system noise and describe realistic physical behavior. The second goal is   motivated by the effects of localized behavior in several examples of   interacting oscillations. Oscillating quantities include chemical   concentrations and  electrical currents which act as timing or reaction   mechanisms in biological and chemical systems. Localization of these   oscillations can limit the propagation of an electrical impulse or chemical   reaction. Coupled oscillators also model fluctuations in laser arrays, used   for applications which require a high optical power output, such as space   communications and high speed optical recording. The power of coupled   lasers is influenced by variations in intensities and synchronization, which   occur in localized oscillations about a steady intensity. Vibrations in   repetitive engineering structures are also coupled oscillations, such as in   large space structures and bladed disk and beam assemblies. Irregularities in   engineering structures can cause vibrations to be spatially localized.   Localization can result in increased local stresses and cracking or serve as a   desirable damping of energy. Understanding the causes of localization   allows the control of the phenomena by adjusting the physical system. The   third objective of this project focuses on the dynamics of two dimensional   patterns which occur away from equilibrium in many physical or chemical   systems, including convection, chemical reactions, and sedimentation in   rivers. Patterns occur as superpositions of periodic waves of components   such as temperature, concentration or velocity.  Spatial variation of   geometry  or physical control parameters can cause spatial intermittency of   the patterns. For example, in a meandering river, rippled sediment deposits   are found in certain regions and not in others. In reaction-diffusion systems,   slight spatial variation of control species causes periodic variation of   chemical concentration in limited regions of the reaction. Since the   equations describing pattern evolution appear in a variety of applications,   understanding these patterns in one application leads to the understanding   of patterns in others."

Meyer       TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION. This project focuses on issues from three computational  areas in applied mathematics.    1.  The first set of problems concerns the analysis and computation of      eigensystems of stochastic matrices and associated Markov chain models.      Special attention is devoted to nearly uncoupled Markov chains. These are      large systems comprised of collections of loosely coupled subsystems, and      the purpose is to analyze and compute the stability and steady state nature      of such systems with aggregation/disaggregation (or A/D) algorithms.      Specific goals are to provide a more concrete foundation for analyzing (A/D)      errors through the use of ergodicity coefficients instead of tradition norm      based bounds; to provide a better understanding of the nature of errors in      multilevel A/D processes thereby facilitating improvements in the      development and performance of multilevel A/D algorithms; and to develop new      techniques for uncoupling the eigensystems for stochastic matrices.  2.  The second set of problems focuses on the development and analysis of direct      projection and implicit factorization algorithms used to solve large sparse      systems of linear algebraic equations encountered in the numerical solution      of partial and ordinary differential equations. Specific goals are to gain      an advantage when solving positive definite systems by means of      conjugate gradient-like methods on high-performance vector and parallel      computers by utilizing implicit factorization algorithms to construct      explicit approximate inverse preconditioners.  3.  The third set of problems stems from manufacturing applications involving      the necessity to describe or measure a manufactured item at various points      on its surface in order to build an accurate computer model so that the item      can be machined by automatic tooling devices. When these description s or      measurements are used in the manufacturing process, constraints are      automatically generated by computer codes to account for complex geometries,      to insure smoothness, and to account for material variability in the      surfaces being tooled. But these computer codes usually generate many      redundant constraints, and it is a significant problem is to distinguish      the necessary constraints from the redundant ones. This facet of the      project is dedicated to developing new numerical algorithms for making such      distinctions. The strategy is to improve on costly rank-revealing      techniques currently used to identify redundancies by developing new      sparsity-preserving, row-action algorithms for estimating      the smallest singular value/vector of a matrix.                        NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION. This project focuses on issues from three  computational areas in applied mathematics.    1.  The first set of problems concerns computations involving stochastic      matrices and associated Markov chains. The theory and application of Markov      chain models is a recurring theme in many problems from engineering,      economics, and physical and  social science. In particular, analyzing and      computing steady-state probabilities associated with large-scale Markov      chains is a fundamental concern in areas such as queueing models and      networks, telecommunications, computer performance evaluation, economic      modeling and forecasting, manufacturing systems modeling, and more      generally, in applications where discrete models are used to understand and      analyze the dynamics of large evolutionary systems. This project emphasizes      computational as well as theoretical issues, and special attention is      devoted to nearly uncoupled problems. These are large systems comprised of      collections of loosely coupled subsystems (e.g., the economy of the United      States), and the purpose is to analyze and compute the stability and      stea dy-state nature of such systems with techniques known as      aggregation/disaggregation. Specific goals are to sharpen and extend the      theory of errors in aggregation/disaggregation processes and to develop new      aggregation/disaggregation algorithms for estimating steady-state behavior      in nearly uncoupled systems.  2.  The second set of problems focuses on the development and analysis of      a new class of algorithms for solving systems of linear algebraic equations      arising in the numerical solution of partial and ordinary differential      equations of the type typically encountered in solving large-scale problems      in engineering and physical science. The algorithms under development are      aimed at high-performance multiprocessor computers  3.  The third set of problems stems from manufacturing applications involving      the necessity to describe or measure a manufactured item at various points      on its surface in order to build an accurate computer model so that the item      can be machined by automatic tooling devices. When these descriptions or      measurements are used in the manufacturing process, constraints are      automatically generated by computer codes to account for complex geometries,      to insure smoothness, and to account for material variability in the      surfaces being tooled.

The case is considered in which a   vortex ring is formed by ejecting an amount of fluid from an opening.  In the first   part of the project, the focus will be on the initial formation process of   axisymmetric rings.  Viscous effects dominate the flow in an initial time interval   and affect the vortex trajectory and total shed circulation.  The effects of viscosity   by adapting a successful 2-dimensional Navier Stokes solver for high Reynolds   number flow to the axisymmetric case will be investigated.  Inviscid effects of the   flow using a vortex sheet model will also be studied in order to determine whether   present similarity theory predictions can be adjusted to better predict the initial   flow.  The second part of the project concerns 3-dimensional dynamics of vortex   rings formed at an opening.  The development of a numerical method to compute   3-dimensional vortex sheet separation at an edge will enable the study of the   stability of these flows, as well as the effects of nonaxisymmetric openings and   nonaxisymmetric forcing.  For this purpose, a 3-dimensional vortex filament   method will be developed which incorporates vortex separation at a sharp edge   and implements a fast summation algorithm to enable high resolution calculations.    Understanding the dynamics of vortex rings is essential to understand more   complicated flows such as those that occur in combustion processes, or in the   airborne vortex structures presenting a hazard to aircraft.  An inviscid numerical   model has been developed for axisymmetric vortex rings generated at a circular   opening.  This model was proven by comparison with experiment to recover   detailed information about the real flow.  In the present work, this model will be   extended to 3-dimensional flows, and will be used to study the stability of the   flows, the effects of non-axisymme tric openings and nonaxisymmetric forcing, as   well as the potential applicability of present theoretical results to predict the flow.    Several of these aspects of the flow are difficult to understand experimentally or   analytically, and the computations promise to give a deeper insight into the flow   dynamics. In order to perform this work, current numerical tools available for   2-dimensional flows will be expanded to 3-dimensions."

In the model, the crack is  viewed as proceeding through a network of grain boundaries, causing  failure when the crack percolates through the material.  The first phase of this project will be to compare various   models for interface energy.  This analysis will largely  be a statistical analysis of data obtained from cracked  samples, followed by a comparison and modification of the   existing interfacial energy models.  Next, the model will   be used to compare the resistance to cracking of various   microstructures.  The microstructures to be tested will   include random textures, textures simulated through   numerical models of annealing, and textures from actual   materials measured by Brent Adams' experimental group at   Carnegie Mellon University.  The results for textures from   simulated processing models will predict the net effect of  material processing on material performance.    The lifetime of many engineering materials (for example,   metals and metal alloys) is seriously limited by   their susceptibility to the phenomenon called stress   corrosion cracking.  This type of failure occurs when  the material is subject to a combination of tensile   stress and a corrosive element, leading to a crack which   propagates through the material and causes it to break.  The main objective of the proposed research is to develop  and analyze a new model of intergranular stress corrosion  cracking.  This model is used to predict the growth of cracks   in metals and metal alloys, and it is unique in that it  incorporates measurable microstructural information from   the material.  Because stress corrosion cracking is a common   and catastrophic phenomenon in certain materials, it would be  invaluable for engineers to be able to estimate a material's  susceptibility to cracking by measuring microstructure  and u sing the model.  In addition, if one can correlate given   processing techniques with the resulting microstructures,    one could then use this model to prescribe processes which   would enhance resistance to stress corrosion cracking."

We will study flows  modelled by nonlinear evolution equations which encounter  finite-time singularities as interfaces touch and a change in  topology takes place. An example is the breakup of a liquid  jet into droplets. A paradigm problem of physical interest is  the compound jet comprised of a core fluid surrounded by a second  immiscible annular fluid. Breakup under the capillary instability  usually produces compound spherical particles and analysis of  the local singular phenomenon is of value in both designing  experiments and incorporation into and testing of hybrid large scale  simulations. In addition we will study the motion and management  of bubbles in surfactant solutions (fluid phases with impurities).  Of particular theoretical importance is the prediction of parameter  ranges where the bubble is remobilized after its bouyant or  thermocapillary motion is arrested or retarded by surfactant build-up  at the back end of the spherical bubble. In many cases system parameters  are large and asymptotic solutions of the singular perturbation  type will be constructed and analyzed.    We study two related classes of fundamental problems  encountered in several key technological and  manufacturing situations. A common feature is the presence of interfaces  separating fluids. These have important effects on how the fluids move  and the mathematical and computational analysis of such models is  extremely useful in diverse manufacturing processes as well as on-going  experiments in microgravity environments (for instance parabolic flights  as well as in the space shuttle). Using tools of mathematical  analysis and modern computational methods will enable us to identify  important physical regimes which would perhaps be prohibitively  expensive in the laboratory or in space. In addition, the use of mathematical  analy sis is imperative in extreme situations (which are more the rule  rather than the exception in many processes - for instance the  breakup of a liquid jet into droplets). Besides their intrinsic usefulness,  such mathematical solutions can be used to make large scale computations  more accurate and efficient as well as test the accuracy of existing codes.  Liquid jet breakup has many modern applications in addition to the more  traditional ones of printing and fuel injection systems. Compound jets  are useful in the manufacture of compound particles used for slow drug release,  the manufacture of fibres used to reinforce mechanical or aerodynamic  components, and color printing with environmentally friendly inks and dyes.  Our studies of bubble dynamics should lead to identification of efficient  operational regimes in large scale purification systems (contaminated liquids  are often purified by passing large numbers of gas bubbles through them),  provide theoretical guidelines for the design of safe agricultural sprays,  and produce theories that can be compared to experiments done in space  aiming at the production of sophisticated materials in  containerless microgravity environments."

The principal investigator plans to develop techniques that are   specifically geared to solving important problems in optical pulse   propagation and mixing attendant to mesoscale ocean structures. In optical    communications, lasers, and fiber couplers a key issue is the support of   multiple pulses. These pulses may be separated in time, by polarization,   frequency or live on distinct but coupled fibers. Based on needed extensions   of the current mathematical technology,  techniques will be developed that   promise a major contribution to these issues through stability calculations of   pulses found by homoclinic bifurcation theory and other related methods.   For mixing in ocean structures, perturbations of the quasigeostrophic   models will be used to assess the efficacy of the added mechanisms to   promoting Lagrangian transport. This has already been successful in   studying the effects of viscosity and, using this analysis as a starting point,   the plan is to incorporate other effects and ascertain their role in what is   now known to be a significant phenomenon in ocean  transport, namely the   advection of fluid particles due to the splitting of separatrices.    The importance of the work in this project lies both in the significance of   the applications and the promise of building a body of techniques that can   be used in other areas. The capacity of optical communication systems is   limited by the ability of the fiber to carry, simultaneously, multiple pieces of   information. Many scenarios have been proposed but most require the   resolution of difficult mathematical problems concerning the stability of   these pulses and assessment of their interactions. Envisioned in the work of   this project is  the development of techniques for addressing these difficult   questions. The second application  to be considered is quite different. To    understand the distribution of fluid properties, such as salinity and   temperature, in regions of the ocean governed by well-known currents, such   as the Gulf Stream, is central in understanding, for instance, the origin and   progress of weather patterns. The key to determining these distributions are   the transport mechanisms associated with well-defined structures within   these currents. The flows are, however, so complex that the elucidation of   these transport scenarios remains a formidable challenge. The work under   this project will be to implement analytic approaches aimed at isolating the   underlying physical mechanisms responsible for certain observed types of   transport and thus lead to more effective predictability of fluid   redistribution near such currents and other ocean structures."

This includes the  time-dependent evolution of an interface that is severely  deformed and contains many excited wavelengths.  Attention will be focused  on a simple model system, namely the  displacement of a viscous fluid by a less viscous  fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell (a cell consisting of  two closely spaced glass plates). The interface   between the fluids is subject to the Saffman-Taylor  instability and develops a finger-like pattern.  This system serves as a model for flow through porous media.    Moreover, since the Saffman-Taylor instability is  an undesirable phenomena in crude  oil recovery, the problem is industrially important.  The main emphasis will be on examining  the effects  of surfactants on   steady and time-dependent finger patterns,  and their role in enhancing or suppressing  finger-tip splitting and side-branching instabilities.  This differs from studies of surfactant effects  in most other systems, since typically the free surfaces  are assumed to be fixed in space or only slightly deformed,  or close to a steady state configuration.  Methods  employed will include asymptotic analysis  and numerical simulation. The practical goal  of such studies is to control the size  and shape of fingers, in the hopes of enhancing  oil recovery.    Free surface motions, such as waves on water or bubbles rising  in a liquid, are important in many areas of science and  engineering. A number of modern technological processes  involve free surface flows. Examples include coating processes,   ink jet printing processes, and oil recovery.  The presence of surfactant  on a free surface can significantly  affect the properties of the   surface.  Common surfactants include detergents,  fatty acids, and alcohols.  Even very small amounts of surfactant can  cause significant variation in the value of surface tension  at a fluid-fluid interface.

It was discovered recently that the junctions   occur naturally in certain crystals where superconducting layers interlace   with insulating layers. It is  proposed to derive and to study a mathematical   model of such crystals and to develop theory of traveling waves in discrete   media.  In the second part of the project it is proposed to produce the   qualitative analysis of systems of relaxation oscillators of a recently   discovered type. The third part of the project deals with various applications   of the investigator's recent observation on the role of curvature in high-  frequency averaging. These applications include the study of the motion of   rigid bodies (such as particles embedded in fluid) or coupled systems of   particles, such as molecules subjected to rapidly varying force fields.   Another application includes the behavior of a resonant medium subjected   to an electromagnetic pulse.  Finally, the last part of the  project deals with   establishing a connection between two classes of systems:   the geodesic   motion on a surface on the one hand and the billiard motion inside that   surface on the  other.     The first of the four parts of the project deals with the study of Josephson   junctions -- superconducting devices whose properties offer great potential   for applications. The advantages of Josephson junctions lie in their small   size and in low energy consumption, which allow for a great reduction of   the circuit size, but the disadvantage is the low power output. To overcome   that disadvantage, the junctions can be put in arrays. Remarkably, such   arrays occur naturally: some crystals were discovered to consist of stacked   Josephson junction layers. This recent discovery offers potential new   applications, notably   for use in interfaces between ultrafast optical   communication lines and electric circuits as well as for generation of high    frequency oscillations for use in communications and radio-astronomical   observations. Understanding the behavior of such arrays takes on a crucial   importance.  The project proposed here aims at such understanding.   The   second part of the project addresses relaxation oscillators - these occur in   biological and electronic systems whose oscillations consist of slow drifts   punctuated by fast jumps.  A large class of such oscillators exhibiting   chaotic behavior was discovered recently, and an isolated oscillator   analyzed. Understanding  systems of coupled oscillators (the goal of this   project) offers great challenges and is of importance in some biological and   electric systems.  In the third part of this effort, the dynamical effects of   high-frequency oscillations will be explored. Such effects underlie the   operation of the Paul trap (the inventor was awarded a Nobel prize) and the   more recent ""laser tweezers"" which allow to move objects inside the cell   without damaging it. This research will extend mathematical analysis of   these phenomena with the aim of possible applications which include   vibrational control as well as environmental applications such as separation   processes (removing particles from the air, etc.)   In the fourth part of the   project it is proposed to establish a connection between two century-old   geometry problems which were developed in parallel but without a direct   connection, by showing that one is a limiting case of another.  Both of these   problems played a central role in the development of the theory of   dynamical systems, and thus indirectly but crucially in  the development of   particle accelerators, in astronomy and in optics."

Recent work has demonstrated the   utilization of symbolic dynamics representation of controlled chaotic orbits   for communications with chaotic signal generators. The evolution of   trajectories of a chaotic dynamical system is  equivalent to symbolic   dynamics in an appropriate symbol space.  The recent advent of controlling   chaos using the OGY (Ott, Grebogi, and Yorke) technique and a variety of   targeting algorithms, with physical applications, has demonstrated that   chaos can be mastered, and inherent instabilities can be used as an   advantage in allowing small deliberate perturbations to cause large signal   variations. Coupling control of chaos through small perturbations with   learning the grammar of the corresponding symbol dynamics means that the   control perturbations are actually a coding scheme on the original dynamics.    Controlling symbol dynamics using a map based description of the   dynamics  requires resolution of the following issues: learning the response   of map iterates to variations in the control parameters, learning the semi-  conjugacy, or coding function, between the dynamics of the map on the   attractor and the grammar of the corresponding symbol dynamics, and   finding the minimal grammar which is dependent on the appropriate choice   of  the partition in phase space. In particular, extensions include on-going   work on communicating in higher dimensional dynamical systems.     Investigations include issues of practical noisy environment control versus   bandwidth trade-off and issues of ergodicity,  learning system response to   controls, and symbol dynamics of a chaotic dynamical system which is   known only by time-series embedding of experimental data, and the further   development of practical grammar learning algorithms.    This new field of nonlinear communication theory promises to develop into   a  new paradigm offe ring a  general information transmission technique,   useful to both electronic and optical media, which should find wide   applications in civil and military  communications infrastructures.  A great   deal of recent research in applied and theoretical dynamical systems has   been focused on taking advantage of the fact that a chaotic dynamical   system can be controlled.  The sensitive dependence characteristic of chaos   is actually advantageous to building a highly agile control system in which   a small  deliberate system variations can cause a large response; the so   called ``butterfly effect"" allows us to steer the system responses with   extremely small powered controls.  Ergodic theory tells us that a chaotic   system can be considered as an unlimited information source; and control of   chaos allows us to manipulate this information flow with extremely  low-powered controls.   An example application is  a high-powered signal   generator (e.g. an electronic circuit), which operates intentionally in the   chaotic regime, so that a small-scaled piggy-back controller circuit,  on the   micro-chip scale, has the ability to accurately manipulate high-powered   message bearing signals. This method is in contrast to standard linear   communication techniques, in which a high powered electronic circuit   requires an equally large-scaled switching device to affect the large power   variations required to transmit a high powered message.  Not only is   communicating through control of chaos applicable to one-dimensional   dynamics, as previously demonstrated, but also applies to the more widely   typical class of higher dimensional chaotic dynamics found in nature.    Communicating by control of chaos promises numerous practical   applications including the engineering of new and simple electronic   communications devices, and new and simple optical communications   devices, as well as the modeling of phenomenon in biology, chemistry, and   cognitive science."

Stability   problems for a variety of other kinds of waves, including breathers, solitary  waves   and dispersive waves, will also be explored.  Energy conserving waves of  marginal   stability will be emphasized, and methods of mathematical analysis will be  employed in   the investigations.

The first equation is a free-boundary value problem which  models the deposition of surfactant on a surface by a liquid droplet.   There is a complex interaction between the motion of the droplet on the  surface and the deposition of surfactant. The second equation is a system  of reaction-diffusion equations which models an islet of beta-cells in  the pancreas. The aim of Professor Hunter's research is to understand the  collective dynamics of the beta-cells and the formation of spatial  patterns in an islet.  The third equation is a two dimensional Burgers  equation which models the diffraction and reflection of weak shock waves  in two space dimensions, where there are longstanding discrepancies  between theory and experiment.

The  proposed research involves the study of a number of mathematical  models of systems of importance in engineering, biology, and basic  science. One model describes the deposition of surfactant on a surface by  droplets.  Surface deposition has many applications in materials science,  including the printing of very small structures on surfaces for the  control of fluids, and as an experimental means of preparing liquid  crystal display screens. A second model describes the collective  behavior of beta-cells in the pancreas. These cells produce insulin and  play a central role in diseases like diabetes. A third model describes  the propagation of shock waves, which  are generated by transonic or  supersonic aircraft, in turbines, and in many other high-speed fluid  flows.  The mathematical theory of shock waves remains very poorly  understood. The fourth model is a set of equations which describe the  propagation of nonlinear gravitational waves in Einstein's general theory  of relativity.  The general theory of relativity is the fundamental  physical theory of gravity, and it describes the large scale cosmological  structure of the universe.  The main obstacle to understanding the  predictions of the theory is the nonlinearity of the Einstein equations.  This work is directed towards an increased understanding of the effects  of this nonlinearity."

The aim of the proposed research is to   develop novel analytic and numerical methods of analysis of frequency   spectra depending on geometric and physical characteristics of the band-gap   material.

It is   expected that creation of such a material would bring about a technological   revolution in optics, laser technology, computing, information transmission,   and other areas. Significant increase in efficiency of laser devices, highly   efficient planar antennas, optics protecting against enemy's laser beams,   perfect mirrors, laser diodes, memories, switches, and lossless optical   information transmission lines are among numerous applications.

The solution to the Skorokhod Problem defines what   might be considered the input/output map for a number of exact and approximate models   in   queueing, communication, economics, and other areas. Except in special cases, little is   known about the analytical properties of this mapping. This research will build on prior   work of the investigator and H. Ishii which takes a geometric approach to obtaining   regularity conditions for the Skorokhod Problem. The main thrust of the present work is   the   development and application of methods based on convex duality.  The second part of the   project studies large deviations for queueing networks. The main topic here is the   formulation and analysis of risk sensitive criteria for the control and regulation of queueing   networks. In almost all models for networks there are errors, approximations, and model   uncertainty, and one would like to design control schemes that are insensitive to such   errors. Using the duality between exponential integrals and the relative entropy function,   one can (at least in the context of diffusions) give a precise quantitative characterization of   the  additional robustness properties that are obtained when a risk sensitive criteria is used.   The investigator will formulate and analyze via large deviation techniques such criteria in a   queueing context. The final part of the project considers cmmputational methods for   deterministic optimal control problems. The main emphasis here is on the development of   practical algorithms with good qualitative properties. This will be done for a class of   problems with very similar features that arise in large deviation for diffusions, certain   problems fr om computer vision, and robust nonlinear control and robust filtering.   Modern communication, computer, and queueing systems are very complicated,   and   in fact too complicated to analyze in complete detail. As systems become more and more   heterogeneous (e.g., different data classes, different quality of service requirements, etc.)   the control and regulation of these systems becomes more difficult and less intuitive. The   first two parts of this project investigate two approaches to dealing with such systems.   When analyzing queueing and communication systems one needs (relatively) simple   system   models which capture the most important aspects of the true system. Linear systems are   unable to capture the system behavior caused by hard constraints (non-negativity of queue   lengths, limits on buffer sizes, etc.) and discontinuities that occur naturally in well   designed   routing and service protocols. Part of this research is to look at alternatives to linear   systems. The second part focuses on the study of risk sensitive criteria for such systems.   Risk sensitive and robust criteria provide alternatives to traditional criteria for the   evaluation of system performance, and it is now understood that they are very useful in   situations where model uncertainty and robustness against modeling errors are important.   Such robustness properties are always important for communication and manufacturing   systems. The aim here is to properly formulate and analyze risk-sensitive criteria for   random   networks, and to quantify the robustness properties when compared to traditional criteria.   The last part of the project is devoted to the development of usable and efficient   computational methods for deterministic optimal control problems, and in particular to the   class of problems that arise in the second part of the proposal."

The two main topics of research are: 1.  Averaging over fast  gravity waves for geophysical flows. 2.  Front wave propagation in  reactive flows.  The investigator combines formal asymptotic  analysis and rigorous mathematical theory of physical models,  together with the numerical analysis of simplified problems.  In  the first topic he studies the limiting dynamics of several  geophysical fluid dynamical systems that include the rotating  shallow water equations and the rotating Boussinesq equations for  stably stratified flow.  In the physically relevant regimes of low  Froude number or low Rossby number the equations evolve with two  separated scales; the slow modes are associated with  quasi-geostrophic flows, and the fast modes correspond to gravity  waves.  The investigator derives simplified equations for the  limiting dynamics of geophysical flows at low Froude or low  Rossby number by averaging over the fast gravity waves.  These  limiting equations are applicable even when the flow is not in  geostrophic balance initially.  The investigator studies the  resulting simplified dynamics equations, which include in natural  and systematic manner the important effects of three-wave  resonant interactions of three fast gravity waves, or two gravity  waves and a vortical mode.  In the second topic he studies the  propagation of fronts in the presence of an underlying advective  velocity field.  This velocity field involves several space-time  scales, describing large variations both at the integral scale,  as well as rapid fluctuations at a scale intermediate between the  integral scale and the front thickness.  The investigator works on  the derivation and analysis of effective large scale equations  for the propagation of fronts in the physical limit of fast  reaction, slow diffusion, and fast velocity fluctuations at the  intermediate scale.  He applies  these results to study the  interaction of either premixed or diffusive flames with the  turbulent velocity field, and to study moist convection in  clouds.       The research on the limiting dynamics of geophysical flows  and the role of the fast gravity waves has potential applications  in atmospheric and oceanic sciences.  As the demand for more  accurate numerical weather predictions increases, it is necessary  to gain better understanding of the effect of the unavoidable  fast gravity waves that pollute all calculations.  Similarly, the  need for long range forecasting also requires a better  understanding of the accumulative effects of the fast gravity  waves.  Additionally, this work is relevant in the area of  stratified turbulence, where the simplified dynamics equations  can help to explain some of the universal features observed in  the velocity spectrum in the atmosphere and the ocean.  The  research on front wave propagation has potential applications in  combustion design, guiding the engineer in evaluating the  reliability of the simplified advection algorithms currently used  in flame front propagation.  This work is also relevant to cloud  physics.  Clouds are a key ingredient in the radiative balance of  the earth and also a key variable in the study of weather  forecasting and global climate.  Currently, in large-scale  numerical simulations of the atmosphere, the important effects of  the small-scale cloud physics cannot be modelled in detail.  This  work gives insight into ways of incorporating the small-scale  effects of the interaction of moisture and convective currents in  clouds into these large-scale calculations."

One can not remove the  capsule without damaging the nerve, so many questions about the  voltage distribution along the nerve underneath the capsule can  not be answered experimentally.  Since one can only take neural  measurements where the nerve emerges from the capsule after  applying displacement stimuli to the capsule surface, how does  voltage there depend on various neural parameters along the  unexposed nerve?

The project undertakes mathematical modeling to address  these physiologically valuable questions.       Our bodies receive mechanical stimuli continuously, but the  stimuli must be processed into neural signals that the brain can  interpret.  This involves receptors called mechanoreceptors.  Be  they hair cells in the inner ear, or Pacinian corpuscles in the  skin, there are properties that are nearly impossible to  establish experimentally, so the investigator uses sophisticated  mathematical models to help predict responses to given stimuli,  as well as establish internal receptor properties.  For example,  the above mentioned skin receptor is a nerve ending which is  protected by a bulb of membranes and fluid.  Physiologically one  can not separate the mechanical bulb (the capsule) from the nerve  ending without sever damage to the nerve membrane.  But with a  good mathematical model one can determine respective  contributions each component makes to response behavior.  Also ,  the model can suggest ways of taking extra neural measurements  outside the capsule which will aid in finding biologically  unreachable parameter values inside the corpuscle.  Analysis  increases our understanding of the transduction process in the  mammalian tactile system, and the analytic methodology transcends  the particular model case considered here."

Gene conversion is any process in biology that  causes a segment of DNA to be copied to another DNA segment.  Gene  conversion is an important process in evolution, and also has  consequences for human health.  For example, it can cause the  transference of pathogenic traits between bacteria and parts of  viral genomes between viruses.  Statistical tests for detecting  gene conversion in aligned DNA or amino acid sequences are  studied and extended.  Particular emphasis is given to permutation  or permutation-like tests that can evaluate unusually long  segments on which two sequences are similar, or else on which a  single sequence is unusually divergent. (This includes tests of  Karlin-Altschul type, which are faster to perform but are not as  accurate as permutation tests.) Some specific aims of the  proposal are: (i) to extend these tests to allow occasional  mismatches and alignment gaps by finding high-scoring segments  for a similarity score rather than segment length, (ii) develop  ways to improve the power and effectiveness of these tests, (iii)  compare statistical procedures for detecting gene conversion in  regards to efficiency and power, and (iv) make the resulting  improved software available to the biological community on a Web  site.       Human HIV and influenza viruses belong to a family of  viruses (RNA retroviruses) that not only are highly changeable,  but can also exchange pieces of genetic material among  themselves.  Viruses that can exchange blocks of genetic material  are more dangerous since the more adaptive parts of the virus can  spread rapidly, and since vaccines that target only part of the  virus can become rapidly obsolete.  There are also several  families of plant viruses in this viral family that cause damage  to food crops of economic importance.  The project extends a  statistical test that can detect a history of such exchanges from  a sample of genetic sequ ences and assign measures of statistical  likelihood to the most likely events.  This will help to  understand the nature of the evolution of these particular  viruses.  The work extends earlier work of the investigator that  looked for possible exchange events in aligned DNA sequences  under the assumption that the exchanged material had not  undergone later mutation.  This assumption does not hold for these  highly mutable viruses.  In addition, recent work has shown that  the earlier test has biases in some of its procedures that can  hide evidence for some exchange (or gene conversion) events.  This  bias is removed.  Finally, computer software that implements the  improved procedures, including listing the most likely exchange  events and their statistical likelihood, is made more available  on the internet for the biological community. (Software that  implements the earlier procedures has been widely used.)"

Perhaps the most celebrated problem in this context is the derivation of the   hydrodynamic and kinetic equations from small scale dynamics governed by the Newton's   second law. This problem is still wide open but some variants have been recently treated.   The investigator's research concerns the analysis of particle systems modeling fluids and   gas. Recently the investigator in collaboration with James Tarver has derived a Boltzmann   type equation for the macroscopic particle densities of a class stochastic particle systems   modeling dilute gases. Roughly speaking one shows that after a suitable scaling the   microscopic particle density converges to a solution of a Boltzmann type equation. The   investigator also shows that the convergence is exponentially fast and derives an explicit   expression for the exponential rate of convergence. This result allows us to go beyond the   macroscopic description given by the Boltzmann equation and obtain some valuable   insight about the microscopic structure of the particle system under study.   Our world appears differently at different scales. For example a fluid or a gas is a   collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move   erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to organize   themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale? Roughly the reason is   that the local conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy impose constraints not   immediately visible on the microscopic scale. The investigator's research concerns the   relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids and   gases. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of interacting   particles has proved to be useful in understanding  the intricate behavior of fluids and   gases. Moreover, interacting particle systems turn out to be the most efficient way of   simulating the flow patterns of dilute gases."

In discrete tomography there is a  domain --- which may itself be discrete (such as a set of ordered  pairs of integers) or continuous (such as Euclidean space) ---  and an unknown function whose range is known to be a given  discrete set (usually of real numbers).  The problems of discrete  tomography have to do with determining the function (perhaps only  partially or approximately) from weighted sums over subsets of  its domain in the discrete case and from weighted integrals over  subspaces of its domain in the continuous case.  The essential  aspect of discrete tomography is that knowing the discrete range  of the function may allow determining its value at points where  without this knowledge it could not be determined.  Discrete  tomography is full of mathematically fascinating questions (e.g.,  what shapes are uniquely determined by their x-rays?) and it has  many interesting applications (e.g., electron microscopy and  nondestructive testing).       The investigator studies how to determine three-dimensional  objects from physically measured (and hence only approximate)  values of what are essentially averages along one-dimensional  slices of the objects.  Mathematically, this is the problem of  determining functions defined over ordinary three-dimensional  space from approximate values of their line integrals.  Such  physical measurements may be taken of biological macromolecules  using an electron microscope or of industrial objects using high  energy x-rays.  What is shared by these two (and many other)  applications is that the object to be determined may be known to  have only finitely many possible values.  The distinguishing  feature of discrete tomography is that by making use of such  knowledge we may succeed in determining the structure of th e  object from data that is not in itself sufficient for determining  the structure without the prior information.  While the emphasis  of the project is on the development of an appropriate  mathematical theory (including computational procedures for the  solution of specific instances of the general problems under  investigation), these will be developed so that they can be  applied in the field of recovering the structure of biological  macromolecules from sets of electron microscopic images by making  use of the truly discrete nature of the objects to be  reconstructed.  What this boils done to is the following: certain  methods of data collection do not allow us to determine the  structure of a totally unknown object (e.g., the electron  microscopes destroys a macromolecule before sufficient data can  be collected).  Discrete tomography allows us to overcome such a  technical difficulty in those cases when the object is known to  have only finitely many values.

The investigator and his collaborator make a theoretical  and numerical study of this problem from situations modeled by  the parabolic/diffusion equation using a novel approach -- the  Elliptic Systems Method (ESM).  The ESM involves the derivation  and solution of a system of coupled elliptic partial differential  equations with boundary conditions developed from a normalized  form of the temporal data.  The diffusion and absorption  coefficients of the medium are then reconstructed from the above  normalized solution, yielding the composition.  This project  involves a number of explorations, extensions, improvements and  testing of this new method applied to a variety of situations.  It  provides a fast and accurate new approach to the important  problem of reconstructing images from scattered data.       In a recently published report by the National Research  Council (Mathematics and Physics of Emerging Biomedical Imaging),  a call is made for the development of new effective medical  imaging algorithms.  An example is the early imaging of small  cancerous breast tumors using optical (near infrared laser)  methods.  Cancerous tumors are more light-absorbing than the bulk  of breast tissue, leading to an increased interest in developing  early detection methods by ""optical"" mammography.

Data and models from a    small invertebrate neural network, the stomatogastric ganglion of    lobsters, guide the work and provide case studies.  Phenomena    observed in the stomatogastric ganglion, such as bursting    oscillations and spike frequency adaptation, can best be modeled    as dynamical systems with multiple time scales.  Previous    mathematical analyses of qualitative properties of multiple time    scale dynamical systems have dealt mainly with local phenomena    that occur in low dimensions.  The dynamics of neural systems    raise questions that are not addressed by existing theories of    multiple time scale systems.  The aim here is to extend the theory    by classifying qualitative features of the global dynamics and    bifurcations for systems with two time scales.  This is an    ambitious endeavor to extend theories of nonlinear dynamical    systems and singularly perturbed systems of ordinary differential    equations that have been developed over the past thirty years.    Using numerical investigations as a guide, the dictionary of    patterns that occur in this setting is described and their    analytical properties are characterized.  This work draws heavily    upon the theories of bifurcations of dynamical systems and models    of hybrid dynamical systems that combine continuous and discrete    components.  As needed, numerical algorithms are developed that    facilitate the simulation and analysis of multiple time scale    systems.  The initial emphasis of the mathematical work is upon    systems that have two slow variables and two fast variables.    Numerical investigations of conductance-based models for the    stomatogastric ganglion also are performed.  The results of these    studies are compared with data and used to guide the refinement    of the models.         Nervous systems of animals regulate and control muscular    activi ty such as locomotion.  Well developed theories enable the    construction of models for the electrical properties of nerve    membranes in these processes, but there is little understanding    of the dynamical principles used by organisms.  This project    investigates dynamical models of a small neural system consisting    of fourteen neurons that control rhythmic motions of the foregut    of lobsters.  This system is used because it is small enough that    unique properties of each neuron within the system have been    identified, but large enough that the network architecture of the    interactions among neurons is also important.  The system displays    a rich repertoire of rhythmic behavior.  The focus of this project    is on features of the behavior that involve different time    scales.  Mathematical theories have been successful at describing    universal properties of the dynamics observed in an astounding    array of physical and natural systems, but these theories need to    be extended to systems with more than one time scale.  The goal is    to construct classifications of dynamical patterns that are the    components from which the complex behaviors of neural systems are    formed.  Models of these systems are also complex.  Computational    investigations are required to predict their dynamical behavior.    This project seeks to implement algorithms that improve our    ability to extract useful information from the models and guide    the improvement of their fidelity.  Both the theoretical analysis    and the numerical methods that are developed encompass all models    of dynamical systems with multiple time scales and can be used    far beyond the context of the neural system that is the focus of    this study."

The class includes  the Z-Z estimator. Preliminary estimates indicate that these methods do  not work for problems on polygonal domains where pollution effects  dominate. We propose cures which we shall analyze.(2) We propose to  investigate a unifying theory for superconvergence which includes  several previously developed by the proposer and co-authors.  We shall  focus on a theory which is applicable to smooth and nonsmooth  problems.(3) We will investigate an a priori ""universal"" mesh grading  algorithm which can be used to provide  optimal relative error for  problems with power type singularities.These meshes should be  particularly useful for elliptic problems on three dimensional  polyhedral domains where the optimal meshes are highly anisotropic.

This project is oriented toward suggesting and analyzing new  methods for the efficient and accurate solution of such problems.We  shall seek better approximations by enlarging the theory of sup  erconvergence and investigate a means of universally grading meshes for  problems on domains with corners which arise very often in industry.

Dose-rate effects are not only very important in themselves but give insight into the underlying biochemical mechanisms and kinetics of damage formation. For ionizing radiation, DNA repair usually leads to direct dose-rate effects, i.e. less damage if a given dose is prolonged. But, for dynamic cell populations, inverse dose-rate effects, with more damage for prolonged irradiation, also occur. The inverse dose-rate effects are due to the first part of a prolonged dose delivery preferentially killing the more sensitive cells in a diverse cell population, and biological processes then driving the preferentially spared, more resistant cells into more sensitive states, where the remainder of the dose can act upon them more effectively. Such resensitization is often due to redistribution of the cell population attendant on movement through the cell cycle. The investigator studies dose-rate effects for induced damage to a heterogeneous, dynamic population, by combining standard models for cell population dynamics with standard models for cell damage. Various population dynamics models are be used, having the common feature that there is a well-defined asymptotic growth rate and an asymptotically stable population structure. Recent resensitization theorems on the killing of cycling cells are extended to theorems on cell populations having additional diversity. Biologically important examples under investigation include: (a) populations consisting of more than one age-structured subpopulation, (b) maturity-structured populations (with cell cycle synchrony loss ascribed to variable age progression over time), and (c) populations subjected to environmental stochasticity. Quantitative models, developed in p reliminary studies, of the inverse dose-rate effect for in vitro transformation, an indicator of cellular mutagenesis are generalized. Adverse effects of radiation (or chemicals) in the environment often occur at low dose rates over long periods of time. For practical reasons, laboratory studies of the parameters that govern the adverse effects normally use much shorter time periods and much higher dose rates. To bridge this gap, modeling of dose-rate effects is needed. One dose-rate effect is observable for populations, e.g. of cells, that possess any sort of susceptibility variation over time to toxic insults. Under these conditions, prolonging the delivery of a fixed total dose e.g., by halving the intensity (or concentration) and doubling the exposure time will not have neutral effect but will instead change the efficacy of that fixed total exposure. This is because more of the population members, as they undergo their sensitivity variations naturally over time, will now have the opportunity to display their more susceptible states in time to be affected by the exposure. This pattern is different from that anticipated in most laboratory studies. Over a wide range of conditions, the difference can in fact make a given dose more damaging when delivered over a prolonged period rather than rapidly, but for some other conditions, the opposite result can be expected. Mathematical theorems are developed to elucidate these dependencies. Important implications of this investigation include the prediction of cellular mutagenesis and transformation frequencies due to ambient, long-duration stress conditions."

Mifflin Abstract for DMS-9703952 Abstract for Space Decomposition Methods in Nonsmooth Optimization The proposed research concerns developing theory and methods for implicitly combining polyhedral and quadratic approximation to produce a rapidly convergent algorithm for minimizing a nonsmooth function of many variables. The idea is to use a bundle method to determine a so-called VU-space decomposition such that on V-space the cutting-plane aspect of bundling works fast and on U-space a quasi-Newton approximation of a Hessian of a U-Lagrangian can be employed. Such methods can be used to solve large or complicated optimization models via separation of variables or constraints. For example, a water pressure control problem of finding values for flow rates and pump pressure gaps to minimize pumping cost subject to maintaining water pressures in allowable ranges at all points in a pipe network can be solved via separation of the variables. If the flow rates are fixed then the subproblem of finding optimal values for the pressure gaps is an easy-to- solve linear minimization problem. With this approach the outer problem of finding optimal values for the flow variables is a nonsmooth problem whose solution can be found efficiently via the techniques to be developed. The computational methods proposed for development are significant because they can be applied in many practical decision-making situations. These include decomposition of large or complicated models such as those occurring in allocation of scarce resources, traffic assignment, manufacturing, structural engineering, logistics and strategic planning. The pipe network problem in the first paragraph is an important example occurring in civil infrastructure design. It illustrates the need to make trade-off decisions when considering conflicting design criteria such as simultaneously having high reliability and low cost. Another area of applica tion is in power system planning subject to environmental protection constraints. These decision models will increase in importance as deregulation of the energy supply sector takes effect. These problems naturally decompose into higher level problems of deciding which types and sizes of power generation plants to build and lower level problems of deciding how best to operate the various units to meet daily energy demand. Additionally, this research fits in well with ongoing efforts in high-performance computing, because its methods will utilize parallel processing to solve larger or more complex decision- making problems than are currently possible to solve."

The research uses methods of dynamical systems to understand how properties at the cellular level (intrinsic membrane dynamics) and the interconnections among the cells (synaptic properties) affect the network behavior. The research focuses on two kinds of problems. The first concerns the mechanisms by which networks synchronize or partially synchronize. These problems mainly concern cortical networks in which there are large numbers of similar cells. The other class, motivated mainly by smaller invertebrate networks, is concerned with the determination and regulation of network frequency and relative phases among cells in the network. In both classes of problems, the work is motivated by specific networks of neurons, but the techniques are broad enough to allow generalization of the results beyond the motivating examples. The dynamical systems methods to be used and developed exploit the many different times scales associated with the intrinsic and synaptic dynamical processes of the cells. One goal is to understand how network behavior is modulated by changing parameters that alter which subset of dynamical processes is most important in producing the network output. Networks of neurons producing rhythmic output are found in neural systems governing motor control, sensory processing, and in both sleeping and awake states. Rhythmic activity in the nervous system is also seen in pathological states, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Though there is much detailed information about the physiology of participating cells, it is not understood how networks that make use of dynamically complicated components are constructed to carry out their appropriate tasks. This research aims to identify mechanisms by which coherence, frequency and phase relationships of the rhythmic network output are regulated. Such identification can potentially allow scientists a deeper understanding of how the nervous sytem uses rhythms to produce appropriate behavior, as well as techniques for removing rhythmic activity that produces pathological states, including tremor."

The sulfide evaporates into the atmosphere and redissolves in moisture that has condensed on the portions of the pipe above the wastewater. Microorganisms in this environment convert the sulfide to sulfuric acid. The acid reacts with calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate in the cement, producing sulfate minerals and causing the concrete to corrode. The investigators develop a mathematical model of the corrosion process that is tuned, tested, identified and validated via field data and laboratory experiment. The effort includes the analysis of the model equations (which take the form of a system of coupled partial differential equations with moving or free boundaries) from the point of view of well-posedness (existence, uniqueness, regularity of weak, strong, local, global solutions, etc.) and the sensitivity of solutions with respect to parameters. It also includes the development, analysis and testing of efficient, convergent and robust numerical integration schemes for numerical simulation, parameter estimation and control. In addition to using available field data to verify the model, a laboratory test-bed to provide additional data for model verification and parameter estimation is designed and fabricated. Electrochemical techniques applied to instrumented concrete samples are used to (i) characterize the concrete structures using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and (ii) sense the diffusion profiles of corrosive species. Correlation of the results of these two studies allows investigation of relationships between concrete microstructure and diffusion processes. Computational schemes are developed to use the field and laboratory data to identify unmeasurable parameters that appear in the model, and to test corrosion slowing control schemes based upon the model. Sulfide corrosion causes millions of dollars in damage in the U.S. each year. Attempts have been made to control sulfide corrosion in sewers. Most try to prevent the release of hydrogen sulfide into the pipe atmosphere. Strong base has been used to kill the biofilm, and cleaning has been used to remove it. The addition of trace metals precipitates the sulfide, preventing its release to the atmosphere. However, the biofilms are tenacious, and grow back rapidly, requiring additional treatment. Any anti-biofilm treatment is constrained because it must not damage the similar microorganisms that are the basis of the wastewater treatment system. Chemical precipitation requires continuous treatment. Any effort involving chemical addition must contend with the very large volumes of water flowing through wastewater collection systems: no matter how cheap the chemical, the colossal amounts that must be purchased and fed into the system are expensive. Thus an effort to first understand and to then interrupt (i.e. control) the corrosion process is needed, and may provide the only possible remedy for some cases. The results of the study should yield a deeper understanding of the corrosion process, and provide a powerful tool for engineers to use in the design of concrete wastewater systems and in the formulation, testing, tuning and evaluation of corrosion abatement procedures. The model and results should guide improvements in protection techniques where sulfide corrosion is a problem, and provide insight into the corrosion processes of other concrete structures and the substantial damage caused. They could also potentially reduce maintenance costs. The modeling ideas developed as a part of this project should be transferable to other corrosion problems, and the analytical and computational techniques that result should be of use in the area of moving boundary problems, their analysis, numerical solution, identification and control."

Wavelets have been established as a rich and useful family of expansion functions. The investigator studies further the recovery of functions (in particular representations of visual images) from their wavelet transforms. Issues of stability and complexity, which have not up to now been addressed in his proof of the Marr conjecture and related analysis of the Mallat conjecture, are studied. An important current question regards the complexity of such networks (i.e., their essential size) for the completion of desired tasks. The investigator studies two types, so-called functional and logical networks. Functional networks have received a good deal of attention, and a coherent theory has established that they are essentially orthogonal (or more general) expansion engines. The homology between the structure of networks and expansion tasks has allowed establishing the connection of wavelet convergence results with network complexity issues. The investigator examines the class of so-called logical networks as a needed completion of available network architectures for the execution of intelligent tasks. In addition he works to show that wavelet-based neural networks achieve lower bounds on complexities of neural nets for given tasks. These results move toward a general complexity theory for neural nets on the order of current computational complexity theory for serial and parallel computer architectures. Such a complexity theory is expected to be a hybrid of current discrete and continuous computational complexity theories. The global purpose of this project is a mathematical study of neural network architectures that implement some of the theoretical complexity results that the investigator obtains. Neural networks as models of parallel distributed computing are currently the leading architectures holdi ng a promise of artificially emulating intelligent systems, as has been indicated in many of their current applications (including mortgage decisions, commercial stock market analysis applications, chemical and thermal homeostasis control systems, satellite image analysis, etc.). A major unanswered question in the development of such systems is the fundamental issue of how large a network needs to be in order to perform specific intelligent functions. One type of task that current so-called ""functional"" neural architectures have difficulty in dealing with is artificial visual recognition and related tasks involved in the general area of robotics. This difficulty seems to be an inherent part of the functional neural architectures under current study, and the investigator develops architectures involving so-called ""logical"" components, which act essentially as algorithmic engines. In particular such network architectures are necessary for artificial vision tasks, and prototypes of such tasks are simulated computationally with the aid of graduate students working on the project. Wavelets are currently considered to be one of the most useful tools for representing the types of input-output functions implemented in neural networks. A more general question regarding the complexity and size of neural networks accomplishing real-world tasks is addressed through application of wavelet techniques to network construction. In particular, functional neural networks may achieve their optimal performance using wavelets as activation functions. There is a larger question here regarding whether wavelet techniques are the best possible for the implementation of functional neural network architectures, which is a conjecture the investigator has made and investigates. The computational aspects of the project are aided by associated groups at Howard University and Bryn Mawr College, the Howard group involving a number of graduate students."

Three problem areas are addressed: sequence alignment, phylogeny construction and genetic mapping. Although diverse and individually well developed, these problems can be unified under a common statistical framework. In each problem, a graph-valued random variable is of primary interest. Hierarchical Bayesian models are developed for each problem with an emphasis on common features. The techniques used to compute posterior probabilities from these models are Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. This computational approach is neccessary because analytic solutions for these problems are not attainable. The overall goal of this project is to develop an inference framework that is of general utility in a variety of problems. Toward this end, simple models are considered first. The simple models are generalized to the extent that it is feasible. This project does not solve all of the problems of computational molecular biology. The purpose of investigating a broad range of problems is to develop a common framework for statistical inference. This project develops new methods for the analysis of data that arise in molecular biology and genetics. These statistical methods have a wide variety of applications and are motivated by the dramatic increase in molecular data due to the expansion of biotechnology and the human genome project. Ultimately this leads to a deeper understanding of evolution and the relationships among different groups of organisms and their individual genes. It also addresses the problem of locating the genes that affect specific traits in humans, plants and animals. The greatest potential impact is on gene mapping in agricultural plants, due to ongoing collaborations with plant breeders at Cornell University. Although the project emphasizes statistical theory underlying the analysis of data, the methods are implemented in softw are that is useful to other researchers."
