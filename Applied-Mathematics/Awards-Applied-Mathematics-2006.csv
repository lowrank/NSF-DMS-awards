In one type of problem, output data is available only at discrete times, so sampled-data control is used instead of continuous-time control.  Projects include how to design sampled-data controllers for partial differential equations; an analysis of which systems can be stabilized by a simple sampled-data controller; how to modify continuous-time feedback controllers so that they are effective sampled-data controllers; an analysis of how the performance of a sampled-data controller compares to that of related continuous time controllers; and the design of sampled-data controllers which track an external reference signals, even when very little information about the plant is available.   In these projects, the interest lies not only in what can be done with sampled-data control design, but also its limitations.  Since a discrete time controller can operate with only limited frequency response, and infinite-dimensional systems often have high frequency effects which cannot be ignored, sampled-data and discrete-time control of infinite-dimensional systems is very delicate.  In addition, population dynamics problems modeled by infinite-dimensional discrete-time systems, such as integro-difference equations, are considered.  Most such problems in population ecology have highly uncertain data, and we will analyze how growth or decay is affected by the data uncertainties.<br/><br/>The development of sampled-data control is motivated in part by advances in digital electronics, which has led increasingly to sampled-data design and implementation of control algorithms.  Furthermore, in many practical applications output data from a system is often only available at discrete times rather than in continuous time, so it is of practical value to know how to deal with such data.  The proposed research will address basic questions about the capabilities of sampled-data control design for infinite-dimensional systems.  Conservation problems in population ecology typically have very uncertain data, and the growth or decay of an endangered or invasive species can be dramatically affected by this uncertainty.  Infinite-dimensional models are used to model spatial spread of a population or in cases where the growth stages are continuously distributed.  This research will develop new techniques, and use techniques from robust control theory, to analyze the effect of uncertain data on long-term population growth.  These techniques will be available and accessible for use on similar population problems.   Undergraduate and graduate researchers will be incorporated into this research program."

The first part studies how to translate the observability of infinite-dimensional systems into the finite-dimensional framework from where observer construction is facilitated via topological equivalence approach. The goal is to characterize the asymptotic behaviors of nonlinear distributed parameter systems that have finite-dimensional attractors by a system of ordinary differential equations. The second part pays particular attention to the observer design for aeroengines and chemical reactions, whose systems are governed by nonlinear partial differential equations. The goal is to provide technical methods for the estimation of disturbed flows in aeroengines as well as the estimation of the states of chemical reactions. The last part is devoted to enhancement of the multidisciplinary program at PI's institute.<br/><br/>Technical limitations and/or prohibitively high costs associated with current sensor technology create a situation where all process state variables for direct on-line measurements are not able to be measured.  Examples include the monitoring of chemical processes and the estimation of disturbed flows in aeroengines, systems which can mathematically be described by nonlinear evolution equations.  Existing theories must be developed and expended to meet these challenges.  This project focuses on the development of a mathematical methodology that will be adequate for the analytical and computational needs of state estimations.  The research outcome of this project will contribute to the improvement of the safety and efficiency of aeroengine operations and the advancement of the control of various chemical reactions."

Such systems comprise a coupling of distinct PDE dynamics, each of these typically evolving on its own domain with boundary, and with the coupling typically being accomplished via the various boundary interfaces. The project investigator shall consider the problem of uniform stabilization for a fluid-structure interaction in three dimensions; this PDE constitutes a coupling of Stokes flow and a system of elasticity. In particular, the investigator will attempt to show that the asymptotic behavior of such fluid-structure PDEs can be uniformly controlled by boundary functions, enacted on the boundary of the structure (or possibly of the fluid, although boundary control via the structure has a direct pharmacological interpretation). Having gained some understanding of the boundary control process for this linearized dynamics, the research will in turn be directed to full-blown, nonlinear fluid-structure dynamics, this involving a coupling of the Navier-Stokes equations with systems of elasticity. In addition, research efforts will be made to understand controllability and optimal control theoretic properties of so-called composite ""sandwich"" plate models, three dimensional structural acoustic systems, and thermoelastic PDEs which come into contact with a moving obstacle and for which there will be a nonlinear generation of frictional heat.<br/><br/>The principal intent of this research is to gain a large and precise understanding of those partial differential equations (PDE's) which fall within the class of so-called hybrid structures; such understanding will eventually have implications in control engineering and design. A hybrid structure--which typically describes some given physical phenomenon--is an equation which comprises two or more distinct PDE dynamics, usually by means of some sophisticated coupling mechanism which is intrinsic to the underlying physical modelling. These coupled systems have attracted, and will probably continue to attract, large interest within the mathematical community, inasmuch as such equations model physical interactions which are observed in the realms of science and engineering: specific examples include those under consideration in this project; namely, fluid-structure interactions, structural acoustic interactions, thin plates under the influence of thermal effects and frictional contact, and the ""sandwich"" plate models used to describe certain structures in material sciences.  Qualitative information gleaned from a mathematical study of such hybrid PDEs can in fact have broader impacts upon other disciplines. For example, part of the project will deal with a three dimensional structural acoustic PDE, as it appears in the modelling of certain engineering design methodologies for the control of external engine noise entering the fuselage of an aircraft. The control design process involves the placement of piezoelectric devices on part of the aircraft wall; a voltage is subsequently applied through these devices to attenuate said noise. The principal investigator is aiming for results for three dimensional structural acoustic systems which will suggest the precise configuration the fuselage should take, so as to attain optimal noise attenuation.<br/><br/>"

This project will focus on boundary controllability and internal controllability as well as stabilizability.  The evolution of the electromagnetic field in a medium is governed by Maxwell's equations.  These equations relate the two electric field quantities, the displacement and the electric field intensity, and the two magnetic field quantities, the magnetic induction and the magnetic field intensity.  A medium is electrically anisotropic if the two electric field quantities point in different directions.  The mathematical analysis of the anisotropic Maxwell equations poses a number of challenging problems.  Contrary to the isotropic case, when the electric quantities and the magnetic quantities point into the same direction, Maxwell's equations cannot be reduced to the second order linear wave equation.  Maxwell's equations form a first order system of partial differential equations.  Closely connected with the study of optimal control properties is an ill-posed Cauchy problem.  Another objective of this project is the investigation of ill-posed Cauchy problems for elliptic first order systems of partial differential equations.<br/><br/>Problems arising optimal control are both mathematically challenging and of practical relevance.  For example, in the boundary control problem, the goal is to construct a current flux in the boundary of the medium that will drive the electromagnetic field to a desired target state.  The significance of this project lies in the importance of anisotropic electromagnetic materials.  Practically all metals and composite materials used in the production of microchips are anisotropic materials.  Further examples include synthetic sapphire and some ceramics such as piezoelectric materials, which give off a measurable electrical discharge when acted upon by a mechanical force and stretch or bend when subjected to an electrical current.  Most of the research conducted will also be relevant to other systems of mathematical physics such as the system of anisotropic elasticity, a problem of great importance in geophysics."

Over<br/>time, many modalities have been developed, such as X-ray<br/>tomography (usual CAT scan), MRI, Emission Tomography, Optical<br/>Tomography (OT) and Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), to<br/>name only a few.  All of them have their advantages and<br/>disadvantages in terms of contrast between different biological<br/>tissues, resolution, cost of devices and procedures, and safety<br/>of the patient.  For instance, cheap and safe procedures like EIT<br/>and OT are plagued by low resolution.  Recent years have brought<br/>novel methods of imaging that intend to overcome these problems<br/>and have a high potential for becoming cheap, safe and effective<br/>diagnostic tools.

Mathematical issues are among the most<br/>crucial in development of these methods, because images have to<br/>be obtained by sophisticated mathematical procedures rather than<br/>by direct acquisition as in the standard (non-tomographic) X-ray<br/>imaging.

A graph equipped with such an operator is generally referred to as a ""quantum graph.""  The research has two central themes: investigating the correlations between the eigenvalues of quantum graphs, and understanding the morphology of their eigenfunctions.  For generic families of graphs the eigenvalues appear to be correlated like eigenvalues of large random matrices.  For non-generic graphs, different correlations are expected.  The present project will improve the understanding of how these correlations arise both from a mathematical and physical point of view.  The results obtained will be useful in understanding the appearance of correlations in the eigenvalues of other differential operators arising in mathematical physics.  The second theme of the project is to understand the statistical properties of eigenfunctions of quantum graphs.  For generic graphs, it is expected that the eigenfunctions should exhibit some equidistribution properties similar to those already proved to exist in other systems.  A central objective of the project is to formulate an analogous theory for eigenfunctions of quantum graphs.  It is also suspected that a sparse sequence of eigenfunctions may become localized (scarred) rather than equidistributed.  Another part of the project will be to discover whether this can, in fact, occur, and the conditions under which it may do so. <br/><br/><br><br><br/><br/>Quantum graphs are part of a new branch of mathematics, sometimes called ``nanomathematics'', which contains within its scope areas such as transport in nanostructures, quantum information, and superconductivity.  In this context, our study of quantum graphs is part of an effort to understand the theory of quantum mechanics as it relates to classical Newtonian dynamics (so-called ""quantum chaology"").  The wave-based theory of quantum mechanics is unavoidable on scales of the order of magnitude of present microchip manufacturing.  The shapes and frequencies of waves appearing in complex quantum mechanical systems can be understood by looking at similar questions for oscillations on networks.  The results of the project will be relevant to current research in many diverse areas of mesoscopic physics and engineering.  In order to draw new researchers into the field, part of the project will be used as topics for an undergraduate research experience program, and an introductory graduate text will be written.  <br/>"

In particular,<br/>controlling the onset and evolution of step bunching, meandering,<br/>and faceting, as well as phase segregation and chemical ordering<br/>during the growth of self-organizing films, paves the way to the<br/>systematic production of nanostructures, e.g., quantum wires and<br/>dots, various two-dimensional nanoscale patterns, etc.  The<br/>overall objective of this project is four-fold.  Its first part<br/>is concerned with a novel instability during single-species<br/>epitaxy that results from the presence of a nonstandard term, the<br/>jump in the terrace grand canonical potential, in the step<br/>evolution equations.  The goal here is to characterize this<br/>instability both in one and two dimensions and to determine if it<br/>can be offset by anisotropic step and terrace kinetics.  In the<br/>second part, the focus is on an instability triggered during the<br/>growth of binary compounds where surface chemistry plays a<br/>genuine role.  This instability differs from that resulting from<br/>the presence of impurities and is not due to an effective inverse<br/>Ehrlich--Schwoebel barrier for one of the two deposited species. <br/>Hence the need to better understand its underlying mechanisms and<br/>to identify, via phase diagrams, the unstable regimes in<br/>parameter-space.  The third part is based on experimental<br/>evidence of step faceting.  The goal there is to derive, in a<br/>dissipative setting, a thermodynamically consistent regularized<br/>model that captures the features of this faceting instability<br/>both during growth and sublimation.  This is followed by the<br/>numerical investigation of the resulting free-boundary problem<br/>via algorithms recently developed to tackle the problems of<br/>faceting and coarsening at the mesoscale.  The last part deals<br/>with intermixing, phase separation, and domain coarsening during<br/>the step-flow growth of multicomponent films, with emphasis on<br/>binary substitutional alloys.  In contrast with existing<br/>theories, the microstructure of the vicinal surface is explicitly<br/>accounted for.  Moreover, novel boundary conditions at the<br/>evolving steps are carefully derived and used to complement the<br/>Cahn--Hilliard PDE's that govern atomic bulk diffusion.  The<br/>proposed model captures the multifaceted physics (surface<br/>kinetics, bulk elasticity and atomic diffusion, phase separation,<br/>etc.) that underlies growth and is multiscale in that the film is<br/>modeled as a layered structure, a view that permits the<br/>resolution of the disparate length scales in the lateral and<br/>epitaxial directions.  Finally, its finite-element implementation<br/>yields much needed insight into the interplay between step flow<br/>and alloying/segregation/ordering.  <br/><br/>     With the advent of nanotechnologies, it has become feasible<br/>to manufacture devices at the nanoscale, from quantum computers<br/>to nano-electro-mechanical systems for biomedical applications. <br/>This has generated a wealth of experimental and theoretical work<br/>which, importantly, is interdisciplinary in nature, involving<br/>materials engineers, condensed-matter physicists, and applied<br/>mathematicians.  At the nanoscale, much more so than at the<br/>macroscopic one, theory is an indispensable guide to experiment<br/>by providing a sound basis for experimental observations and,<br/>more ambitiously, by predicting the behavior of material systems<br/>under experimentally uncharted conditions.   Of central<br/>importance are instabilities in the film morphology and<br/>composition, as they lead to the self-assembly of, e.g., quantum<br/>wires and dots.  Controlling these instabilities is therefore<br/>crucial to the production of various nanostructures.  This in<br/>turn requires a mathematical understanding of the physical and<br/>chemical mechanisms underlying the onset and evolution of<br/>instabilities.  The investigator develops and analyzes<br/>mathematical models showing the evolution of nanostructures in<br/>films of materials.  His effort combines mathematical modeling,<br/>analysis, and computation, and relies on knowledge of the<br/>underlying physics and thermodynamics.  The work has the<br/>potential of yielding a better understanding of growth<br/>instabilities.  Finally, the project involves the training of a<br/>doctoral student for whom this experience serves as an<br/>introduction to physical applied mathematics, mechanics, and<br/>mathematics of materials.  <br/>"

These phenomena are characteristic of current<br/>wireless systems driven by data-intensive applications such as<br/>multimedia, WWW, and real-time interactions.  The heavy traffic<br/>approach is a powerful way to analyze queuing systems at near<br/>capacity, yielding complex, yet tractable limit models that<br/>retain the essential features of the actual queuing system.  But<br/>most of the existing literature on heavy traffic analysis,<br/>including wireless systems, is based on short-range dependent<br/>(Markovian-like) models and light tails.  In the case of heavy<br/>tails only, the focus is on extending the perturbed test function<br/>method, based on the martingale problem, for showing weak<br/>convergence to a queuing model expected to be driven by stable<br/>Levy motion.  When long-range dependence characteristics are also<br/>present, the focus is on developing a powerful alternative<br/>approach based on the Poisson random measure representation of<br/>traffic processes.  In this case, weak convergence to a queuing<br/>model driven by fractional Brownian motion is expected.  The<br/>power control problem associated with wireless systems is studied<br/>along with the convergence analysis to the limit queue model. <br/>This is done for given controls, as stochastic control analysis<br/>for stable Levy motion or fractional Brownian motion is currently<br/>undeveloped. <br/><br/>     The focus of the project is on analyzing wireless systems<br/>characterized by high capacity applications such as multimedia. <br/>Such systems are ever more relevant with an increasing number of<br/>wireless users (personal and military) and their demand for<br/>data-intensive applications.  For example, military applications<br/>include the use of video in battlefield settings for conferencing<br/>and providing information to troops.

This approach supposes that<br/>the wireless system is near its capacity, which is the case in<br/>practice where applications make high demands on a limited<br/>bandwidth.  This assumption allows obtaining good models that<br/>retain the essential features of the actual system while being<br/>tractable.  The models are useful for obtaining an understanding<br/>of system characteristics that is needed for the design of an<br/>efficient wireless network.  Furthermore, obtaining these models<br/>is an important first step toward developing stochastic control<br/>methods for these emerging applications to optimize resource<br/>allocations (for example, power) to the queues for transmissions. <br/>"

The dynamics and stability of these waves is of paramount importance to understanding the underlying physical properties and behavior of a given physical system.  Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines asymptotic and perturbation methods, scientific computation, and rigorous mathematical analysis with models which are based on experimental observations of nonlinear phenomena, a fundamental understanding can be achieved of specific optical and atomic systems.  In conjunction with the modeling efforts, the mathematical objectives are to further develop and extend modern methods utilized for quantifying and understanding the wave dynamics of nonlinear, dispersive partial differential equations.  In particular, a variety of methods for reducing the governing equations to more easily handled partial and ordinary differential equation systems is pursued.   Of specific interest to all the atomic and optical systems considered here is the stability and persistence of localized solutions that often result from soliton-type solutions of some underlying Hamiltonian (integrable) system.<br/><br/>The stability of localized solutions, or pulses, is of fundamental importance in optical and atomic physics.  In optical physics, the stability of pulse solutions is critical for determining the operating regimes of the so-called, mode-locked laser.  In the past decade, mode-locking technologies have gone from a fundamental science to a commercially viable technology with applications in imaging, medical sciences, and telecommunications.  Characterizing, improving, and understanding the operational limits of these lasers is a central focus of the proposal. Additionally, emerging photonic technologies are predicated on the existence and stability of pulse structures as they form the basis for optical bits in all-optical signal processing and switching. A more fundamental investigation of pulse stability lies in the area of atomic physics where Bose-Einstein condensates have realized experimentally the existence of matter waves.  Such matter waves have a direct analog to mode-locking technologies, allowing for the possibility of creating a pulsed matter laser.<br/>"

We will also focus more directly on applications including the vestibular system (in particular, the network of connections between neurons of the six semicircular canals in the ears and eight neck muscle groups), the development of a frequency filter/amplifier associated to synchrony breaking Hopf bifurcation in a simple feedforward network, and `cortical songs' obtained from different dynamical patterns in coupled phase oscillators.<br/><br/>The biologist J.B.S.

In addition, the tools should be adapted to dynamic graph data.  They should learn a model of the graph from historical data.

All forms of communication amongst entities give rise to graph data, including the communication of source and destination IP addresses via IP packets in the Internet, people sending email to one another, web pages referring to one another, or proteins interacting with one another in large biological systems.  Many scientific, engineering, and medical applications depend on our abilities to model, to analyze, to process, and to synthesize this type of data quickly, in the face of changes to the data, and under imperfect information.  Indeed, our security and the security of the Internet may hinge upon our understanding of how entities (be they people or IP addresses) interact with one another.  Our current statistical and algorithmic tools for relational data are not adequate for massive graphs.  They have not kept pace with our ability to collect enormous amounts of data and our need to accurately and efficiently analyze that data.

It investigates the stability of black holes under electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations.  Such understanding is of great importance for predicting the nature of gravitational radiation originating in outer space.  The stability problem will be considered in a manner parallel to the observations made by astronomers, leading to a better theoretical understanding of numerical modeling of solutions of Einstein's equations.  The project also aims to put the question of extracting energy from a rotating black hole on a firm theoretical basis.  The extraction of energy from a rotating black hole was proposed in 1968, but until recently the question was far too difficult to be studied.

In part I, a geometrical approach to the problem of parametric resonance aims at gaining new insight into the model that arises in numerous applications in mechanics, physics, engineering, and plays an important role inmathematics. The problem of parametric resonance has been extensively studied by analysts, but recent numerical observations suggest that a topological approach may give a principally new insight. This problem is treated in many texts in mathematics, physics and engineering; basic new insight into the problem will be of considerable interest. It is hoped that this research will shed new light on Stark effect (splitting of atomic spectral lines). Part II of proposed research addresses study of systems with imposed rapid vibrations. <br/>Stabilization by vibration is used in particle acclerators, in particle traps and in laser ``tweezers"". Underlying geometry of the phenomenon was understood only recently. The author proposes to extend his earlier work to broader physical contexts, and to further explore the fruitful connection between differential geometry, mechanics and averaging theory. This work will show how concepts from differential geometry (curvature, normal family) find their manifestations in mechanics. Part III of proposed research deals with Arnold diffusion -- a fundamental aspect of stability of Hamiltonian systems. The researcher's goal is two-fold: first, to develop variational techniques for time--dependent Hamiltonian systems, and second, to shed new light on the problem of Arnold diffusion in specific examples motivated by physics or geometry. <br/><br/>The unifying theme of proposed research is to establish new connections between abstract mathematical concepts on the one hand and their physical manifestations (e.g., in mechanics) on the other. Such connections enrich mathematics and benefit applications by providing the latter with tools for better understanding physical phenomena. A recent example of such mutually beneficial interaction was the author's use of differential geometry to provide new insight into the functioning of the Paul trap -- a device used to suspend charged particles by electric field. In 1989 W. Paul was awarded <br/>Nobel prize for his invention. Proposed research should give new insights into <br/>some resonance phenomena of basic importance in mechanics, quantum mechanics and engineering. It is hoped that some results of proposed research will make their way into upper undergraduate and graduate texts in differential equations, engineering and mechanics. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be closely involved with this research. <br/>"

One mechanism for generating rogue waves in deep water is <br/>the Benjamin-Feir (BF) instability and nonlinear focusing. In an earlier numerical study of a higher order nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation we found that a chaotic background greatly increases the likelihood of rogue wave formation and that enhanced  focusing occurs due to chaotically generated optimal phase modulations. In this research project we investigate the following questions: (1) persistence of large amplitude homoclinic structures in the HONLS equation; (2) whether the notion of ""proximity"" to instabilities and homoclinic data of the NLS can be used to develop a robust criterium for predicting the occurence of rogue waves; (3) whether coalesced modes and rogue waves can be linked to the presence of higher order phase singularities; (4) the effect of damping on the early developmentof rogue waves; (5) their experimental validation.

Secondly, a spike variation technique for FBSDEs will be developed and used to derive a Pontryagin type maximum principle that is satisfied by optimal controls of FBSDEs.  Finally, coupled linear FBSDEs with random coefficients and mixed initial and terminal conditions will be studied by introducing decoupling techniques and related linear-quadratic optimal control problems will be solved using stochastic Riccati equations.  The theory derived in this project will substantially enrich the existing theory of FBSDEs, and will deeply extend the classical stochastic optimal control theory. <br/><br/>Maximizing return and minimizing risks are very common in the world of investment (including stock market, mutual funds, retirement accounts, insurance, social security, etc.).  It is well understood that high return is associated with high risks.  Careful study shows that people's preferences towards return/risks are usually not linear.  The well-known Allais/Ellsberg type paradoxes, which show that decisions made in the presence of high risk are inconsistent with expected utility theory, are excellent counterexamples for this.  To compensate for this, some nonlinear preferences (also called nonlinear expectation) can be introduced via the so-called backward stochastic differential equations.  Therefore, when such kind of expectation is used, optimal investment problem naturally becomes an optimal control problem for forward-backward stochastic differential equations.  A similar situation happens for investment involving contingent claims (such as discount bonds, insurance claims, options, etc.), markets (including financial markets, energy markets, etc.) with large investors (such as some big hedge funds, a main feature of which is the dependence of the price processes on the positions and trading strategies of the large investors), and so on.  The theory established in this project will help us to answer, at least in part, the following types of questions:  How do the nonlinear preferences affect the optimal trading strategies for an investment?  What will be the optimal trading strategies when some contingent claims are allowed to trade?  How do the large investors influence the market?"

The kinetic equations that describe systems of particles interacting via gravitational (Newton) or electrostatic (Coulomb) forces are crucially important in astrophysics and plasma physics, but they have been quite impervious to mathematical analysis. The investigation builds on some recent breakthroughs by the PI and follows two lines of attack:<br/>1) The mathematical properties of spatially homogeneous equations of the (linear or nonlinear) Fokker-Planck type are being studied via a master equation approach, in which a kinetic equation is approximated as the infinite-particle limit of a linear Kolmogorov equation for a carefully selected $N$-body stochastic process.  This latter replaces the (much more complex) underlying Hamiltonian dynamics of the ``physical'' $N$-body system and makes it possible to extract new information about existence of solutions to a kinetic equation, their rate of decay to equilibrium etc.  2) This project also explores the application of orbit-averaging methods to the spatially inhomogeneous Vlasov-Landau-Poisson equations that arise in astrophysics and plasma physics.  These methods take advantage of different time scales present in certain physical systems in order to greatly reduce the number of independent variables and thus facilitate the mathematical analysis of the equations.<br/><br/>Kinetic equations describe the evolution of many-body systems such as gases, plasmas and clusters of stars. Equations of this type play an essential role in many applications, ranging from gas dynamics to fusion plasma, from astrophysics to physical chemistry, from traffic flow to semiconductors.  This research project focuses on those situations in which the particles in the system interact via long-range forces, as is the case for ionized gases (plasmas) and for stars.  In these cases, the mathematical analysisis greatly complicated by the fact that long-range forces allow many particles to interact with each other at the same time, whereas ordinary gases are driven just by ""binary"" (one-on-one) collisions between pairs of particles. The main goal of the project is to obtain precise mathematical estimates of the behavior of solutions to these equations.  For instance, when studying a laboratory plasma it is very desirable to know that the mathematical model being used has well-defined solutions, and also to estimate how quickly external disturbances will fade away etc. Beside their intrinsic mathematical value, results of this type also aid the development (and support the validity) of the numerical simulations that play an important role in the study of fusion reactors, of the earth's magnetosphere, of globular clusters of stars and many other applications.  <br/><br/>"

We also propose to study pattern formation in various physical and biological applications such as in reaction-diffusion systems and the Benard problem for a heated fluid. It is expected that the pattern of nonlinear instabilities in these system can be characterized by the finitely many fastest growing modes for the corresponding linear system, over the time of instability formation.

These `particles' can be as small as gas molecules or charged ions or electrons in a plasma, or enormous objects such as stars in galaxies.   Such kind of dilute charged gases (plasma) dominates our outer space, and plays the crucial role in our fusion research. We propose to study the long-time dynamics of these dilute gases form a mathematical standpoint. Furthermore, we propose to study stability of the galaxy models and predict their long-time dynamics.

Much progress has been made to characterize the individual local production unit: Discrete event and agent based models are routinely developed to study the dynamics of flows through such networks.  However, due to the stochastic nature of the processes involved and due to the complexity of the networks, such simulations are prohibitively expensive to maintain and are not equipped well to answer questions on the behavior of the networks as a whole.  The goal of this proposal is to generate the mathematical foundation for a link between the local and fast time scales and the global long-term time scales in complex production networks.  Based on this link we will derive continuum simulation models of network production flows based on continuum approximations for product as well as production stages, leading to partial differential equation models related to traffic flow models.  Comparisons between the continuum models and large-scale discrete event simulations will be performed.  As an additional tool linking small-scale simulation to large-scale simulation we will also explore an equation-free modeling approach to these production systems.<br/><br/>There is a huge need for fast and accurate simulations of production flows in factories and even more so at the enterprise level or at the whole supply chain level allowing the user to vary policies and business scenarios and ask ""what if"" questions. This is typically true for example in semiconductor factories or car manufacturing.  Currently, these simulations suffer from the fact that the complexity of the systems, the number of parts involved and the stochastic nature of production does not allow the simulations to be performed as part of a decision tool.  Instead, simulation scenarios are typically done off-line and the results discussed in planning meetings. Answering a new question typically requires a detailed off-line recalculation.  Our approach has the potential to develop the fundamental models to describe such flows through a scalable and fast simulation and discuss their validity and limitations. Overall we are developing the theory and the tools for a much better strategy-planning and business-evaluation environment.<br/>"

One aspect of this project is the development of the mathematical description of systems involving very many particles.  Another aspect is the study of systems of bosonic particles, such as helium, whose low-temperature behavior has recently attracted much attention.  We will consider geometric approaches where quantum particles are represented by space-time trajectories with arbitrary winding numbers.

The project<br/>is divided into three main lines of interconnected research: (i)<br/>the analysis and modeling of elastic growth in soft materials,<br/>such as biological tissue; (ii) the biomechanics of microbial<br/>systems including the study of force-driven penetration<br/>mechanisms, such as those arising in fungi that destroy crops;<br/>and (iii) the dynamics and stability of various elastic rods,<br/>cables, and pipes having important engineering applications.  For<br/>the first theme, the investigators and their students study the<br/>mechanical consequences of growth and its potential to either<br/>generate instabilities through changes in geometry and stresses,<br/>or to act as a mechanism to stabilize and regulate physical<br/>properties.  The goal of these studies is to gain insight into<br/>the fundamental coupling between growth and stress in many<br/>biological systems.  The second theme of microbial biomechanics<br/>involves the mathematical modeling of both bacterial and fungal<br/>systems.  The investigators formulate and analyze mechanical<br/>models of growing micro-organisms in order to understand their<br/>overall structure (e.g. the formation of appressoria in the<br/>rice-blast fungus) and their ability to invade host tissues by<br/>penetration (as found in many fungi), as well as the growth and<br/>structural changes exhibited by filamentary bacteria, such as<br/>those that are a natural source of antibiotics.  The description<br/>of these organisms combines a general formulation of membrane<br/>growth (based on the first research theme), the elastic modeling<br/>of cell walls undergoing large deformations, and the use of<br/>plasticity and fracture theory to describe penetration processes. <br/>The third theme of elastic rod dynamics involves the study of<br/>elastic tubes conveying fluids, and the dynamics of rods with<br/>constitutive coupling between twist and tension (hemitropic rods)<br/>-- a functionality that is relevant to the design of crane cable<br/>and other braided structures.  The analysis of filament<br/>instabilities is carried out through the use and extension of the<br/>nonlinear analysis techniques developed by the investigators in<br/>their previous work. <br/><br/>     The project concerns the dynamics of filamentary structures<br/>such as pipes and rods and the physical analysis of growth<br/>mechanisms and invasion appearing in biological systems.  It is<br/>highly interdisciplinary in nature, cutting across the fields of<br/>applied mathematics, mechanical engineering, microbiology, and<br/>biomechanics, and addresses questions of both practical<br/>importance and mathematical interest.  The themes have a broad<br/>range of applicability in biology (morphogenesis), in biomedical<br/>engineering (analysis of soft tissues, their mechanical<br/>regulation and function), in understanding fundamental processes<br/>in biological invasion such as fungal penetration of tissues, and<br/>in classical engineering problems (pipes conveying fluids,<br/>instabilities in drilling).  The project also provides many<br/>attractive training experiences at different levels suitable for<br/>graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. <br/>These include opportunities to synthesize mathematical modeling<br/>with hands-on experimentation through the use of the Applied<br/>Mathematics Program's unique experimental facilities."

The goal of the theory is to develop criteria for measuring effectiveness of various computational algorithms.  The term ''complexity'' refers to the amount of resources required by a computation.  In this project, running time or number of arithmetic operations is the major resource of interest.  Linear programming (LP) has been an important computational problem in complexity analysis.  Due to the relentless research effort in LP algorithms, a linear program can be solved today one million times faster than it was done twenty years ago.  Businesses, large and small, now use LP models to control manufacture inventories, price commodities, design civil/communication networks, and plan investments. LP even becomes a popular subject taught in under/graduate and MBA curriculums, advancing human knowledge and promoting science education. Now many other important computational problems are emerging or reemerging. In particular, there has been a growing trend in models, theories, and algorithms on problems arisen in Internet economics, information network, auction/game pricing, as well as social organization issues enabled through World Wide Web. The aim of the project is to further develop and extend complexity theories and efficient methods to responding these emergencies, where there is strong interest in solving them faster and more accurate due to their wide applications in today's US service economy, such as trade, auction, negotiation, and information aggregation.  More specifically, the following research objectives and activities are proposed:  Exchange market equilibrium: develop the algorithmic and complexity research on solving several exchange market price equilibrium problems, including the Nash equilibrium, where many challenging questions are open and need answerers; Auction-game mechanism design: propose and analyze a convex pari-mutuel call auction pricing mechanism for contingent claim markets and to develop a forecast model for some uncertain future events; Real-time or dynamic pricing: conduct research for pricing real-time or dynamic auctions, such as innovative auction markets in key-word search to sell advertisements for Internet search business.<br/><br/>The proposed research will deepen our understanding of complexities of these emerging computational price equilibrium problems and possibly resolve important open questions on whether or not they admit high efficient algorithms. The research activities have an influence on society by the project's very nature: improved market trading systems and economic pricing mechanism. Progress in the areas of developing efficient algorithms for solving large-scale game/equilibrium problems will be of great significance in improving the efficiency of Internet/information systems and on-line/network business service management. Strengthening research in this area will contribute to the national interest in industrial competitiveness, scientific understanding, technology innovation, and human knowledge.

Theory, models, analysis, and numerical<br/>algorithms are undertaken to explain these phenomena, to explore<br/>the most perplexing observations, to map out parameter domains of<br/>robust film flows, and to characterize the conductivity and<br/>mechanical effective property tensors.   The key object across<br/>all projects is the orientational probability distribution<br/>function (PDF) of the nano-particle ensemble.

Glycerol must be added to whole blood to prevent cell damage when it is frozen and must be removed before the blood is transfused.  Current removal strategies require procedures that are too lengthy for emergencies or military applications.  Using mathematical modeling (which includes models that couple fluid flow, convection diffusion, and transport across semipermeable membranes), optimization theory and numerical methods, the project will scale up laboratory tested removal protocols for medical use.  The research on optimal morphing uses differential geometry and elasticity theory to obtain cost functionals for minimal strain morphing.  Minima over admissible sets of deformations (diffeomorphisms between compact hypersurfaces) will be proved to exist using the calculus of variations, and numerical methods will be developed to approximate these minima.  The existence and stability of surface waves produced by flow over flat plates will be proved using fluid dynamical modeling and the theory of free boundary problems.  In addition, the mathematical analysis will be complemented with numerical simulations of a physical system.  Mathematical models of two-body interaction, where forces propagate with finite speeds, will be derived.  Such models consist of systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations coupled with ordinary differential equations, or hybrid systems of differential equations and delay equations.  The well-posedness and qualitative dynamics of the two types of models will be determined and models of this type will be applied to understand synchronization phenomena for acoustical surface wave sensors.<br/><br/><br><br><br/><br/>The research project has two main purposes: the application of mathematics to advance understanding in four fields of physical science and the training of four Ph.D. students in these important areas of applied mathematics.  The first project has direct applications in the health sciences and medicine.  Living cells, for example blood cells, can be preserved for long periods of time by freezing; and, they can later be thawed for use in transfusions.  To freeze and thaw living cells requires a complex technology including the addition of chemicals called cryoprotectants to the insides of the cells so they will not be damaged during this process.  These chemicals must be removed before blood is transfused.  Methods are available for doing this, but current methods require a long time to implement.  Thus, frozen blood is not available for emergency use (for example, in military conflicts or natural disasters).  Fast removal of cryoprotectants has been proved to be possible at the level of single cells; the purpose of the research in to design (optimal) methods that can be used for fast removal on the larger scale necessary for practical application in medicine.  The second project has applications in materials science.  A sheet of metal is to be bent and stretched into a desired shape.  The desired shape can be achieved by many different deformation processes (for example, the sheet can first be stretched then bent or it can be stretched in one direction while being bent in another, among many other possibilities).  Which method uses the least energy? This problem and others of the same type will be solved using mathematical analysis.  The third project will determine the stability of the surface waves often formed by a fluid (for example water) moving over a plate.  Surface waves are known to exist and have a particular shape.  Also, experiments show that when the waves are disturbed, they return rapidly to that particular shape.  But, the mechanism for this remarkable stability property is not known at present.  The research project will determine the reason for the observed stability.  The fourth research project is concerned with the theory of two-body interactions in physics and engineering.  A practical example occurs in applied acoustics.  Electrical currents applied to electrodes embedded in the surface of a silicon wafer causes acoustic surface waves to propagate across the wafer.  A second set of electrodes (transducers), embedded in the wafer, can transform these waves back to electrical currents.  When the electrodes and transducers are connected to an appropriate electrical circuit, such surface waves can be constantly produced and amplified by the circuit.  If a second set of electrodes and transducers are embedded in the surface on the same wafer, a second set of waves can be produced.  The two circuits can be tuned so that the waves oscillate in perfect synchrony.  A very sensitive detector can be constructed by covering half of the wafer (with one pair of electrodes and transducers) and exposing the other half to the environment.  If the surface of the second half is disturbed (for example, by the deposition of a hazardous biological agent) the synchrony is broken and this occurrence can be instantly detected by a computer connected to the circuits.  A goal of this research is to provide the mathematical theory for understanding the behavior of these devices.<br/>"

Recent theoretical work has brought out a new class of gravity-capillary lumps, and there is experimental evidence that these lumps can be driven by wind blowing over water. While previous studies have focused on the existence of steady lumps, the present investigation will tackle the question of how such lumps may arise from general initial conditions and by external forcing. The second problem to be addressed is a resonance mechanism by which three-dimensional internal gravity wavepackets can transfer energy to higher-mode obliquely propagating long waves, thus contributing to the generation of smaller vertical scales and enhancing the fine vertical structure of the background mean flow fields (density, velocity, etc).<br/><br/>Gravity-capillary lumps are likely to contribute significantly to the small-scale roughness of the ocean surface. Understanding their dynamics may thus prove useful in interpreting satellite images of the ocean surface. Moreover, similar lumps are expected to arise on floating ice sheets due to loads moving on top of the ice, a problem with several applications, including the use of vehicles on floating ice. Shedding light, on the other hand, on how internal gravity waves in a stratified fluid contribute to the fine vertical structure of the background flow is an important issue in understanding how mixing occurs in the ocean, which in turn is believed to affect climate dynamics, biological productivity and waste disposal.<br/><br/>"

The intermolecular interaction of excluded<br/>volume effects, which is responsible for the isotropic-nematic<br/>phase transition, is modeled by a mean-field potential.  Both the<br/>Mayer-Saupe and the Onsager potentials are used.  The main purpose<br/>of the project is a rigorous study of the dynamics and rheological<br/>properties of such systems.  The problems to be addressed include<br/>bifurcation analysis of both the equilibrium and the shear flow<br/>case, and questions arising in the treatment of the equations by<br/>means of the classical theory of infinite dimensional systems. <br/>One of the central problems is the question of the existence of<br/>inertial manifolds on which the partial differential equation<br/>reduces to a finite system of ordinary differential equations, the<br/>so-called inertial form.  The starting point of the project is<br/>recent results in which the isotropic-nematic phase transition was<br/>resolved for the Smoluchowski equation using the Mayer-Saupe<br/>potential in the equilibrium case (no external flow), as well as<br/>the existence of absorbing balls (cones) in Gevrey spaces of<br/>analytic functions.  These questions remain open for the Onsager<br/>potential, and are addressed in the study.  In the absence of the<br/>flow, the Smoluchowski equation is a gradient system that<br/>preserves uniaxial symmetry, and as such it exhibits fairly simple<br/>dynamical behavior.  However, even a passive interaction with a<br/>symmetry-breaking shear flow introduces complicated dynamical<br/>features, such as different kinds of periodic solutions (tumbling,<br/>kayaking, log-rolling), and even chaos.  These are characteristic<br/>for intermediate shear rates.  At low and high shear rates flow<br/>aligning takes place.  A rigorous investigation of these dynamical<br/>features is conducted in the project. <br/><br/>     The main goal of the project is a mathematical understanding<br/>of the transition that occurs in a class of polymeric materials<br/>containing anisotropic molecules known as mesogens to a so-called<br/>liquid crystal phase.  Due to their anisotropy, the molecules<br/>interact with each other, resulting in alignment.  This long-range<br/>orientational order resembles the one found in solid crystals,<br/>while, unlike solid crystals, the material retains fluidity due to<br/>the absence of the long-range positional order of molecules.  The<br/>transition to such a phase is induced by changes in the<br/>temperature and the concentration of the mesogens in the solution. <br/>The distribution of the molecules can be described by a partial<br/>differential equation known as the Smoluchowski equation, which is<br/>the main subject of this project.  It was already employed<br/>successfully to explain the transition to the liquid crystal phase<br/>under some very special conditions, with many unanswered questions<br/>still remaining.  The significance of these liquid crystalline<br/>polymers lies in the fact that crystal-like properties, combined<br/>with many of the useful and versatile properties of polymers, make<br/>these materials suitable for a wide range of important<br/>applications.  For example, liquid crystalline polymers are<br/>abundant in living systems such as DNA, polypeptides, and cell<br/>membranes.  Accordingly, they attract particular attention in the<br/>field of biomimetic chemistry.  An application of liquid<br/>crystalline polymers that has been successfully developed for<br/>industry is the area of high strength fibers.  Kevlar, which is<br/>used to make such things as helmets and bullet-proof vests, is<br/>just one example of the use of polymer liquid crystals in<br/>applications calling for strong, light-weight materials.  The<br/>optical properties of liquid crystalline polymers lead to<br/>applications in optical imaging and the display industry.  Liquid<br/>crystalline polymers can be used to coat drugs in the<br/>pharmaceutical industry.  However, as very complex materials,<br/>liquid crystalline polymers exhibit very complex behavior, and<br/>many of the actual and potential applications of these materials<br/>depend on multidisciplinary research.  A better mathematical<br/>understanding of the process of aligning is essential for better<br/>understanding of the behavior of liquid crystalline polymers. <br/>This project addresses some of the central questions regarding<br/>this process. <br/>"

Here ""strong"" refers to effects that substantially change<br/>the overall dynamics of the fluid system when compared to the<br/>standard deterministic setting.  In general, wave-mean<br/>interaction theory describes the nonlinear interactions between<br/>small-scale waves and the large-scale mean flows on which the<br/>waves are propagating.  There exists a substantial body of<br/>classical wave-mean interaction that is based on deterministic<br/>waves, but very little has been done on the stochastic version of<br/>the problem.  The present work combines a number of projects<br/>aimed at extending the classical theory in this direction. <br/>Examples include the use of stochastic theory for wave dynamics<br/>and nonlinear wave breaking, for two-dimensional wave-vortex<br/>turbulence, and for the derivation of effective mean-flow<br/>equations for stratified flows subject to high-frequency<br/>oscillatory forcing. <br/><br/>     Interactions between waves and mean currents include the<br/>driving of long-shore currents and vortical motions such as rip<br/>currents by breaking waves on a beach (important for civil<br/>engineering and naval operations), the creation of clear-air<br/>turbulence by breaking waves in the stratosphere (important for<br/>aviation and the environment), and the driving of the global air<br/>circulation by breaking waves in the mesosphere, above 60km<br/>altitude or so (important for climate evolution).  These<br/>processes are far too small in spatial scale to be resolvable in<br/>numerical models for atmosphere-ocean dynamics, which means that<br/>in these models their impact must be put in by hand based on<br/>theory and observations.  This is called the ""parametrization""<br/>problem for unresolvable processes, and even on the biggest<br/>supercomputers it will remain a bottleneck problem for decades to<br/>come.  Now, in the classical ""deterministic"" theory in this area,<br/>the prevailing conditions are assumed to be simple and perfectly<br/>known.  However, in reality, the prevailing conditions are often<br/>complex and poorly known.  Stochastic theory addresses this by<br/>allowing for uncertain, or random, components of the situation. <br/>This project brings modern stochastic theory to bear on the kind<br/>of wave-mean interaction problems that are relevant to<br/>atmosphere-ocean science.  There are two principal project aims:<br/>first, finding new effects that are missed by the deterministic<br/>theory; and second, laying the foundation for a more realistic<br/>representation of wave-mean interactions in numerical models for<br/>use in climate prediction, aviation, and near-shore civil<br/>engineering. <br/>"

Such problems arise in a number of important military, imaging, signal processing, biomedical, remote-sensing, and geological applications.  Inverse problems are ill-posed in the sense that a small error in measurement can lead to large errors in the estimated quantities.  The regularization techniques used to obtain stable solutions to inverse problems give rise to general nonlinear programming problems.  In special cases, such as imaging and signal processing, the inverse problem can be reformulated as a tractable convex programming problem.  In most cases, e.g. shape optimization, however, a non-convex optimization problem needs to be solved.<br/>     Robust optimization is an approach for modeling and managing uncertainty in an optimization context.  Here, rather than solving a parameter identification problem, one is concerned with constrained optimization problems in which the parameters are data and, due to measurement or estimation errors, are only known to lie within bounded uncertainty sets.  In ambiguous chance-constrained (robust) optimization it is assumed the parameters are random variables with an uncertain distribution that is only known to lie within an uncertainty set of probability measures.  Fortunately, for certain classes of uncertainty sets, robust optimization problems give rise to tractable convex programming problems as long as the non-robust versions of the problems are themselves convex.  These problems arise in areas as diverse as engineering design, portfolio selection, and the design of service networks. <br/>     MPECs have their roots in game theory and bi-level optimization. They are optimization problems in which some of the constraints are parametric variational inequalities or complementarity systems that arise from the optimality conditions for a lower-level optimization problem.  MPECs are a good model for a number of important economic problems, where the equilibrium constraints arise from competitive forces, and optimal engineering design problems.  Consequently, developing scalable solution algorithms for MPECs is of considerable practical importance.<br/>     In general, solving problems from any of these three classes is quite difficult and requires significant computational resources.  At first glance, these three modeling paradigms appear quite distinct.  Consequently, there has been very little interaction between the algorithmic developments that have occurred in these three areas.  While all of the paradigms have a unique structure and a special set of issues, they have much in common.  Besides their formal analytical similarity, depending on the context all three paradigms are often used to model the same application.  A goal of this project is to leverage the common features of these paradigms to develop new and more efficient solution methods.  A second goal is to provide interdisciplinary training in inverse problems, robust optimization, and MPECs through the development of new doctoral courses and involvement of students in theoretical research and software development."

However, in exceptional<br/>situations, exact relations exist that are<br/>microstructure-independent.  These express fundamental<br/>invariances in a given physical setting.  Exact relations have<br/>been extensively studied, but the classical approach has been<br/>heavily dependent on the physical context.  In the late 1990's,<br/>an abstract theory of exact relations was originated by Grabovsky<br/>and greatly extended by Grabovsky, Milton, and the investigator. <br/>It has proved to be enormously powerful.  Indeed, by reducing the<br/>search for exact relations to a purely algebraic problem<br/>involving group representation theory, it has led to complete<br/>lists of all rotationally invariant exact relations for<br/>three-dimensional thermopiezoelectric composites, which include<br/>all exact relations for elasticity, thermoelasticity, and<br/>piezoelectricity as special cases.  This new approach has been<br/>responsible for a great leap forward in this area of material<br/>science.  However, the theory is by no means complete.  The<br/>purpose of this project is to complete the theory of exact<br/>relations by addressing the three remaining major open questions. <br/>First, previous work has given complete lists of exact relations<br/>only in relatively simple physical contexts.  The investigator<br/>studies highly coupled problems with the ultimate goal of finding<br/>an explicit parameterization of exact relations for the physical<br/>problem with any number of temperature, electric, and elastic<br/>fields.  The second project is the exploration of the<br/>relationship between lamination and homogenization for exact<br/>relations.  The basic question is whether there exist exact<br/>relations that are stable under lamination, but not under<br/>homogenization.  Third, the investigator undertakes a detailed<br/>study of the algebraic structures associated with exact<br/>relations.  In particular, questions about exact relations may be<br/>reformulated in terms of algebraic objects called Jordan<br/>algebras.  This approach seems very promising, and it is<br/>considered to be crucial for progress on the two problems<br/>described previously.<br/><br/>     Composite materials are everywhere in the modern world. <br/>They are used in the manufacture of products ranging from skis to<br/>airplanes and from tennis rackets to cell phones.  It is<br/>accordingly of great technological importance to understand how<br/>physical properties (such as conductivity and elasticity) of a<br/>composite are related to the properties of its constituents. <br/>This is difficult in general because the way in which the<br/>constituents are put together strongly influences the end result. <br/>For example, take two materials, one soft and one hard.  If the<br/>hard material is embedded in the soft substance, the composite<br/>will be compressible.  On the other hand, if the soft material<br/>lies in a matrix of the hard material, the composite will be<br/>rigid.  However, in certain situations, this typical variability<br/>is greatly reduced.  The goal of this project is to understand<br/>and classify these situations.  From a practical point of view,<br/>the project establishes ""impossibility theorems"" in engineering,<br/>i.e. results showing that a composite with desired properties<br/>cannot be constructed from a given set of starting materials. <br/>The proposal thus has significant implications for industrial<br/>research and development.<br/>"

This necessitates the use of various approximate macroscopic models, of which kinetic equations constitute an important class.  However, the passage from microscopic wave equations to large-scale kinetics is a complicated problem in itself.  The goal of the first part of the project is two-fold: on one hand, to develop new tools and better understanding of kinetic limits, and second, to consider the applications of kinetic methods to the inverse problems of wave propagation, finding sources and scatterers in a cluttered environment. The second part of the project investigates the qualitative behavior of solutions of reaction-diffusion-advection equations, with the main focus on the effect of a fluid flow. We will investigate the interaction of the mixing, dynamic, and geometric properties of the underlying flow and the effects of diffusion and reaction.  The problem becomes especially complex in the situations where the feedback from the reaction process on the fluid flow cannot be ignored.  The project addresses the quantitative study of the transport of the energy, momentum, and the reactants in a Boussinesq reactive system.<br/><br/><br><br><br/><br/>This project carries out mathematical studies of wave propagation in complex media and of reaction-diffusion equations.  The mathematical models are relevant to several branches of science, ranging from biomedical imaging questions to geophysics, fluid dynamics, and astrophysics.  Imaging in a cluttered environment, whether it is a human body, earth interior, or foliage, is inherently unstable because of media complexity.  An objective of this project is to develop imaging methods that are less sensitive to unpredictable fluctuations of the clutter.  We will strive to understand the universality and the limits of applicability of macroscopic models and develop inversion algorithms that arise from the macroscopic rather than detailed microscopic models and that are therefore inherently more stable with respect to fluctuations of the environment.  Another area of this project concerns the mathematical description of the effect of a fluid flow on chemical reactions. Turbulent fluid flow plays an important role in many reaction phenomena: it may drastically enhance the rate of reaction, leading to higher efficiency, or, in some situations, extinguish the chemical process.  The mathematical theory is far from complete, due to the inherent complexity and richness of the phenomena.  The project will address these issues in simpler mathematical models to illuminate the mechanisms present in the full problem. <br/>"

Particular emphasis will be put on applications to valuation and hedging of credit derivatives, with focus on credit default swaps and basket credit derivatives, as well on applications to valuation and hedging of convertible bonds.  One goal of the project is therefore development of a sound mathematical theory of basket credit derivatives and convertible bonds and related issues of hedging, valuation, and management of credit risk and convertible risk. This in particular will require new results in representation for stochastic processes, as well as new results for modeling of stochastic dependence between random processes.  Thus, another goal of the project will be to use stochastic analysis in finite and infinite dimensions for studying of dependence between stochastic processes. In particular, a new theory of semimartingale copulae and Markov copulae will be worked out and applied.  Moreover, new applications of stochastic analysis will be developed, in particular with regard to martingale representations and backward stochastic differential equations with reflections (also driven by jump martingales).<br/><br/>This research project will be of fundamental importance for several reasons, both from the applications point of view as well as from the purely theoretical perspective. First, the booming credit derivative industry will benefit from it, as development of tractable mathematical tools for the purpose of valuing and managing of basket credit derivatives, such as basket swaps, collateralized debt obligations, and credit indices, will provide the industry with new methodologically sound procedures. Likewise, the convertible bond industry will benefit from this research as our new decomposition results specified for the regime switching market model should provide a better quantitative tools for this industry, which suffered great losses in the Spring of 2005 -- possibly because the nature of such complex hybrid derivatives as convertible bonds was not really well understood.  In addition, valuation and hedging of credit default swaps, which is essential for the finance industry, will be specifically emphasized and new analytical tools will be developed for this purpose. On theoretical side, project will also be of fundamental importance for several reasons.  First, if true, then an analog of Sklar's theorem for the case of probability measures on canonical spaces of stochastic processes will be an important extension of the classical theorem of A. Sklar (1959), which was proved for real valued random variables.  Perhaps, an analog of Sklar's theorem for probability measures on some general vector spaces (such as Polish spaces) will be derived in the process. Second, for those semimartingale processes for which their local characteristics determine their laws it will be important to study the following question: what is the class of multivariate (vector valued) semimartingales with given univariate local characteristics. Given the strategic importance of basket products for financial industry there will be a practical importance of studying of the above problems in view of potential applications, such as valuation and hedging of basket derivatives (basket options, basket credit derivatives, etc.)."

These include chemical reactions, nucleation events, and conformational changes of bio-molecules.  These events are rare but they have a profound impact on the system.  As a result of such events, the system transforms from one metastable state to another.  The question of interest is the mechanism of such transitions and the transition rates.  Classical transition-state theory works very well for systems with relatively simple energy landscapes.  In this case, the most probable transition path is the so-called minimal energy path (MEP).  Once this path is found, the transition rate can be calculated by various linearization procedures.  However, often the systems of interest in applications have very complex energy landscapes, and the notion of MEP becomes irrelevant.<br/><br/>In the last several years, Weinan E, Eric Vanden-Eijnden, and I have developed a theoretical framework (the transition-path theory) as well as efficient numerical tools (finite-temperature string method) for dealing with such rare events in systems with complex energy landscapes.  The theoretical framework can be viewed as a statistical-mechanics framework for paths.  We think of the transition paths in configuration space.  This allows us to make use of the Fokker-Planck formalism and the associated variational principles, which in turn can be used to reduce the complex many-body problem in a Fokker-Planck formalism to a system of coupled one-body problems, much in the same way as in density functional theory, which reduces the quantum many-body problem to coupled one-body problems.<br/><br/>The numerical methods have been sucessfully applied to a variety of problems and proven to be efficient.  However, a systematic study of the numerical issues in the methods is still lacking.  In the proposed work, I will study the convergence and accuracy of the finite-temperature string method, as well as its dependence on the input parameters.  Our aim is to make the method robust and more efficient.  In the meanwhile, I will also apply the method to study problems arising from solids and chemical reactions which are of practical interest."

We plan to devise theoretically justified and computationally effective strategies for describing the statistical average behavior of a few relevant variables for such systems without resolving all of the variables involved in their underlying deterministic dynamics. In this general context a principal objective is to formulate statistical closure schemes for Hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom. The key new ingredient is a statistical closure scheme that selects an optimal approximation to the Liouville equation among nonequilibrium ensembles parameterized by a few relevant variables. Our implementation of these ideas will emphasize large deviation analysis, ensemble equivalence, phase transitions, nonlinear stability of most probable states, and computations. The main applications that drive the research are systems that are weakly turbulent in the sense that they exhibit coherent behavior on large scales and essentially random fluctuations on small scales. The two main examples to be considered are dispersive wave turbulence governed by generalized nonlinear Schroedinger equations and geophysical fluid flows governed by potential vorticity transport equations.<br/><br/><br><br><br/><br/>This project addresses one of the major challenges in science today, which is to predict the behavior of complex systems. Among the important physical systems whose complexity currently exceeds our predictive capacity are molecular dynamical systems, fully-developed turbulent fluids, and the Earth's ocean-atmosphere system. The intractability of such systems to analysis and computation stems not from the absence of underlying dynamical models, but from the high dimensionality of their governing dynamical systems coupled with lack of information or data needed to specify the solutions of those systems. What is needed in theoretical and practical treatments of these systems is an effective way to predict the behavior of a few relevant macroscopic variables without completely resolving all the dynamical variables. In this endeavor, statistical mechanics supplies the dominant paradigms.  One of the main goals of this research project is to address these issues by adapting the methods of statistical mechanics to a wide class of nonequilibrium systems that are both physically applicable and computationally tractable. <br/>"

The investigator uses techniques from modern numerical<br/>bifurcation analysis together with the theories of singularities<br/>and bifurcations in the presence of symmetry to study the full<br/>bifurcation and phase behavior of recent mean-field models for<br/>biaxial materials, along with models that he and collaborators<br/>are developing for the important new class of bent-core<br/>materials.  The investigator adapts and extends methods from<br/>computational fluids with moving and deforming bodies (""moving<br/>overset grid methods"") to provide effective techniques to<br/>accurately model challenging problems involving the dynamics and<br/>statics of point defects in macroscopic liquid-crystal director<br/>models, with application to surprising recent physical<br/>experiments on defect-pair annihilation in capillaries filled<br/>with a liquid-crystal material. <br/><br/>     Liquid crystals are complex fluids that possess partial<br/>molecular orientational order.  They can be used to control<br/>light, and this feature underlies many of their significant<br/>technological applications.  In recent years, new liquid-crystal<br/>molecules have been synthesized that exhibit certain special<br/>phases.  These new phases are termed ""biaxial,"" because they have<br/>secondary ordering properties in addition to those of the more<br/>common ""uniaxial"" materials.  The liquid-crystal community has<br/>high hopes for potential new applications of these new materials. <br/>The theoretical and experimental study of biaxial liquid crystals<br/>is at a relatively early stage.  In this project the investigator<br/>analyzes a mathematical model for such materials that<br/>characterizes the bulk equilibrium state of the system and<br/>associated transitions, as a function of control parameters such<br/>as temperature.  This study requires both mathematical and<br/>numerical techniques.  In addition, the investigator and<br/>collaborators develop new models for the special sub-class of<br/>""bent core"" liquid crystals, which are of high current interest. <br/>The merits of this work are two-fold: (1) validation of the<br/>models and (2) the development of predictive tools to aid in the<br/>design of experiments and in the identification of parameter<br/>ranges for technological applications.  The second main topic of<br/>the project concerns the numerical modeling of the dynamics of<br/>defects in liquid crystals (isolated singularities in the fields<br/>that characterize the orientational properties of the medium). <br/>Defects are ubiquitous in liquid-crystal systems, and they cause<br/>considerable difficulty both from mathematical and numerical<br/>points of view.  The investigator and co-workers apply numerical<br/>procedures from other areas of computational fluid dynamics, both<br/>to model numerically a target problem involving the annihilation<br/>of a pair of point defects in a capillary tube filled with liquid<br/>crystal and to compare these numerical results to recently<br/>published experimental data.

However, every question answered only drives us to ask more difficult questions, pushing the limits of this computational power.  Our desire to increase the prediction lead-time of weather over the United States is just such an endeavor.  Research has shown that our ability to make medium-range (two-week) forecasts is impaired by our inability to understand the manner in which tropical weather phenomena impact midlatitudes.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, computational models are themselves limited by the enormous number of temporal and spatial scales, and thereby the enormous number of computed variables, inherent in the global weather system.  Furthermore, since computers can only perform computations on a finite number of variables, some of the infinite number of variables in the weather system must be discarded.  Careful mathematical analysis, using a technique called multi-scale asymptotics, can often be used to simplify the equations governing the weather system by isolating essential phenomena before costly computations are performed. <br/><br/>In previous work, Biello (along with A. Majda at the Courant Institute) has used just such an analysis to isolate a particular resonant interaction between tropical waves, which are guided by tropical storm systems, and mid-latitude waves, which drive and interact with high- and low-pressure systems over North America.  In other work using these techniques, Biello and Majda have developed a theory for the structure of a large-scale pattern of tropical weather organization called the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).<br/><br/>Biello first proposes to extend his work on tropical/midlatitude connections to account for the effects of moisture and clouds on the existing theory.  Since tropical dynamics are driven by moisture through condensation and rain, this will be an important step in making the original model more useful to the numerical simulation community.  Second, Biello proposes to study tropical/midlatitude interactions on smaller scales (mesoscale) where the previously dominant effect of the Earth's rotation is less important than wind shear and condensation.  Finally, the effect on midlatitudes of the breakup of the MJO will be studied, and this will be achieved by bridging the gap in spatial and temporal scales between the Biello/Majda theory of the MJO and that of tropical/midlatitude connections."

Such states can be viewed in terms of homoclinic or heteroclinic connections in phase space, with one spatial coordinate playing the role of time. In many cases the presence of such states is related to a phemenon called homoclinic snaking. In this proposal we shall investigate different mechanisms leading to the formation of spatially localized structures and their stability with respect to both one and two-dimensional perturbations. The study will employ the techniques of spatial dynamics for reversible systems coupled with detailed numerics, and will focus on several fourth order partial differential equations of importance in the physical sciences. The theory will be extended to systems in which reversibility is weakly broken.<br/><br/>This proposal focuses on the origin and properties of spatially localized structures in partial differential equations of importance in the physical sciences. Such structures are observed in experiments in optics, ferrofluids in a uniform magnetic field and in convection, and take the form of isolated bumps in an otherwise uniform background, or a front connecting two different uniform states.  Spatially localized oscillations, called oscillons, are observed in vibrating granular media and in chemical reactions. Techniques will be developed to explain the origin of these states, and their stability properties. The theory will be extended to study the formation of related states in systems placed on a slight incline.<br/>"

The research is focused on theoretical and numerical studies of statistically stable imaging methods in such media, in regimes of significant interaction of the waves with the inhomogeneities in the clutter.  Explicitly, we consider a coherent interferometric imaging approach that uses statistical smoothing techniques for suppressing the unwanted clutter effects and emphasizing the coherent part of the data, which can then be processed to get robust images that are independent of the realization of the clutter.  The research has the following main parts:  (1) Theoretical studies of both statistical stability and resolution of coherent interferometric imaging in random media, for particular wave scattering regimes.  (2) Development of algorithms that are capable of estimating adaptively the needed amount of smoothing, without any a priori knowledge of the statistics of the clutter.

When the interaction of the waves with the clutter is weak, there is a lot of coherence in the scattered echoes, and classic migration (radar) imaging techniques work well.

One research project focuses on the modeling and analysis of locust swarms. Locusts can operate in either a solitary (neighbor-avoiding) or gregarious (neighbor-seeking) phase. The investigator constructs a PDE model incorporating social aspects of behavior as well as environmental variables and random motion in order to understand how each of these factors affects the dynamics of phase change, the spatial patterns of the locust population, and the nucleation of gregarious groups. A second model describes the rolling motion of migrating gregarious groups. The high-dimensional ODE model incorporates social interactions, gravity, wind, and the boundary formed by the ground. The models are studied with tools from dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, analysis of PDE, and numerical simulation. Another project examines the control of Turing patterns in chemical reaction-diffusion systems. Inspired by recent experiments which controlled chemical Turing patterns by using an external light field, the investigator develops a framework for manipulating reaction-diffusion patterns via periodic spatiotemporal forcing. The study is built around a symmetry-based analysis of normal forms, a perturbation analysis of reaction-diffusion type PDE, and numerical simulations, all of which reveal how pattern stability is affected by the applied forcing.<br/><br/>Spatiotemporal pattern formation occurs spontaneously in myriad natural systems. Key challenges include the development of mathematical models of these systems, the analysis of the models, and the development of methods for controlling the patterns.

Locusts are an important pattern-forming biological systems because their destructive swarms have severe environmental and economic impacts. Some results are general enough to shed light on other social biological aggregations such as bird flocks and fish schools. The research on Turing patterns in chemical systems addresses the third challenge. The results explain experimental observations and suggest control strategies that can be tested in the lab. Furthermore, some of the results apply to other Turing patterns, which occur in such diverse contexts as biological morphogenesis, population dynamics, neuroscience, ecology, and materials science.

These stochastic processes include the Airy process, <br/>the Pearcey process and its higher order generalizations, a nonintersecting <br/>Brownian excursion path model, and a class of interacting particle systems <br/>called the asymmetric exclusion process. The main methods to be employed <br/>are a combination of the ideas and techniques coming from random matrix <br/>theory, integrable systems, and operator theory. <br/><br/>Random matrix theory lies at the intersection of several branches of mathematics, e.g. probability theory, number theory, combinatorics; with applications ranging from physics (quantum chaos, condensed matter physics) <br/>to electrical engineering (wireless communications) to statistics (high dimensional data analysis). Particularly important for these applications have been <br/>the discovery of new universal limit laws. These limit laws are described by <br/>distribution functions which are now computable in terms of special ""integrable"" functions. This project will further analyze these various limit laws, <br/>describe circumstances in which other laws arise, and provide computational <br/>methods to implement these laws. <br/>"

The first project concerns the Oya-Vallochi model of bioremediation, a system of advection, reaction, diffusion equations for the concentrations of the substrate to be degraded, the nutrient, and the active bacteria. Numerical simulations and mathematical analysis will be carried out to determine parameter domains in which stable traveling waves exist, as well as which instabilities develop on the boundaries of these domains. The second project involves reduction methods for chemical reaction and diffusion problems arising in biochemistry, chemical engineering, combustion, and air pollution engineering. These reactions typically involve 30-100 species, 50-400 reactions, and time scales ranging from nanoseconds to seconds. Moreover, these reactions typically occur in reactive flows, over extended domains, so that one must model the chemistry in each part of the domain. Reduction methods are indispensable to the analysis of this large amount of data, because they identify key progress variables and low-dimensional manifolds on which the long-term dynamics play out. The third project concerns pattern formation in activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion equations, specifically the analysis of competing instabilities of spot patterns, self-replicating spots, newly-discovered `separator' solutions that govern the scattering of pulses and spots. Also, nonlinear stability of strongly interacting pulses will be established using a novel renormalization group approach the PI and collaborators have developed.<br/><br/><br><br><br/><br/>This applied mathematics research project concerns mathematical methods for key applications of multiple-scale reaction diffusion systems in engineering and science. The goals of these projects are to explain recent experiments, to improve computational methods, and to develop new mathematical theory that will be essential for the next-generation of engineering techniques. The first project concerns bioremediation, a process in which microorganisms in soil are induced to degrade environmentally-harmful organic compounds. Operating conditions in which remediation takes place in a regular and optimal fashion will be identified. The second project concerns reduction methods that are essential for understanding complex chemical reactions in biochemistry, chemical engineering, combustion, and air pollution engineering. The mathematical theory the PI has developed to date has helped to improve reduction methods currently used by engineers, and the proposed new theory will help the development of the next generation of faster and more accurate reduction methods. The third project centers on the dynamics and stability of chemical patterns involving spots and interacting coherent structures. Mathematical methods from dynamical systems theory, singular perturbations, and differential equations will be used, and new mathematical techniques will also be developed. The projects also involve PhD students and postdoctoral fellows, a significant percentage of whom are women, as well as collaborations at Argonne National Laboratory and foreign universities."
