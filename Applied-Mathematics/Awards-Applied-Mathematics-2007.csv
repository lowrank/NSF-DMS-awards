The program assembles a<br/>large international group of mathematicians and physicists<br/>interested in graph models arising in widely disparate areas of<br/>high practical and theoretical importance.   Analysis on graphs<br/>has been developing very quickly in the last decades, due to<br/>needs of number theory, algebra, probability theory, and spectral<br/>geometry.  This area has experienced recently a surge of new<br/>important applications, new methods, and new models.  New<br/>objects, such as quantum graphs (quantum networks) or<br/>differential operators on fractals, have emerged, which provide<br/>simplified models of complex systems and help with studying<br/>difficult issues such as, for instance, Anderson localization and<br/>quantum chaos.  All these developments have sparked the interest<br/>of experts in other areas of sciences and mathematics in analysis<br/>on graphs and in the diversity of methods employed.   The program<br/>starts with a tutorial workshop where young researchers and<br/>students are introduced to the basics of analysis on graphs,<br/>quantum graphs, and fractals.  Then two workshops follow devoted<br/>to spectral analysis and quantum chaos on quantum graphs and<br/>graph models for nanotechnology, chemistry, optics,<br/>microelectronics, and other areas.  The third workshop addresses<br/>algebraic aspects of analysis on graphs and fractals.  Besides<br/>workshop participation, longer term visits of both established<br/>and young researchers are arranged.  <br/><br/>     Analysis on graphs has experienced sharp growth in recent<br/>years, due to many new applications that sweep throughout a wide<br/>scientific landscape: computer graphics, information technology,<br/>Internet studies, nanotechnology, microelectronics,<br/>superconductivity, optics, chemistry, and material science. <br/>Researchers in these areas meet problems that are similar to<br/>those faced by mathematicians in areas like number theory,<br/>combinatorics, differential equations, and spectral theory.  The<br/>program facilitates the urgently needed communication and<br/>cooperation among researchers in different areas of mathematics<br/>and sciences.  It thus accelerates progress in this new area that<br/>has extensive applications in crucial scientific and technology<br/>fields, such as nanotechnology, photonics, and material science. <br/>It alsos help to increase participation and visibility of US<br/>researchers in these fields.  Significant training for junior<br/>researchers and graduate students is provided, including<br/>specially designed tutorials, seminars, and open problems<br/>sessions.  A proceedings volume is planned to be published.   The<br/>grant supports US-based participants in the program, mostly US<br/>students, postdocs, junior faculty, women, and other<br/>underrepresented groups.  <br/>"

The models are physically realistic but are so difficult that direct numerical simulations are not able to faithfully reproduce the processes they are intended to describe.  Our research objective is to provide a more in-depth analysis, and this invariably involves integrating modeling, computations, and analysis with contemporary experimental research.<br/><br/>The core of our program is mentored participation of students and postdocs in an interdisciplinary research team.  At the same time, the activities we will develop will reach a wide audience and combine research, mentoring, and broad education experiences.  Specific examples are Applied Math Days and mini-symposia.  Also included in this effort will be innovative curricular changes that will provide mentored transitions that will both increase the number of students interested in, and prepared for, graduate school in mathematics and which will also prepare our graduate students and postdoctoral associates for careers in academia or industry.  In addition we will develop innovative recruitment and retention components, as well as careful management and assessment of the program."

Kaper","10/31/2008","$65,799.00","","hks0015@auburn.edu","400 HARVEY MITCHELL PKWY S STE 3","COLLEGE STATION","TX","778454375","9798626777","MPS","1266","0000, OTHR","$0.00","This proposal is focused on problems in applied mathematics which may be attacked using algebraic methods. There are three themes:  (1) Information transmission and coding theory, (2) Rational surface modeling and implicitization, and (3) Approximation theory and multidimensional splines.  The main goal of the project is to bring the full power of abstract machinery to bear on these themes; frequently the key to solving an applied problem is to view it from a different perspective.  For example, in past work, the PI has used spectral sequences and local cohomology to study splines; in coding theory the PI has used toric geometry and Cayley-Bacharach theory to obtain good bounds on certain codes obtained from algebraic geometry. The coding theory portion of the project will focus on finding optimal codes from toric varieties of dimension three or more; on the spline front the PI will investigate splines on polyhedral complexes, as well as the efficacy of the Groebner basis algorithm as a symbolic algebra front end for spline computations. Finally, an exciting new interaction between computer science (specifically, computer vision and animation) and algebra involves rational surface modeling: if a map is defined from the plane to three-space by three rational functions, what is the (unique) polynomial vanishing on the image? Here there is again a fruitful interplay with commutative algebra; the most efficient way to determine the polynomial involves syzygies (relations among the functions which define the map); the aim is to obtain fast algorithms to determine the polynomial vanishing on the image.<br/><br/>One of the fundamental problems in information theory is that of signal transmission; applications range from CD systems to space communication. In a perfect world, the signal sent from point A and the signal which arrives at point B are identical. In the real world, the medium over which the signal is transmitted is not perfect (there is noise), and so errors are introduced into the signal. In signal processing jargon, the transmitted signal consists of code words, and the study of how to clean up the signal is called ``coding theory''. So the problem is simple: how does one catch the errors? The solution is to introduce some additional information into the transmission, so that the receiver at point B can strip off the errors and recover the original signal. It turns out that codes which are obtained from certain geometric objects can sometimes be optimal (that is, not too much redundant information needs to be added). One aim of this proposal is to discover more such codes. A second theme of the proposal involves computer vision and animation. Given a surface and a point in space, the goal is to decide if the point lies on the surface (this arises, for example, in plotting the image of a character in an animated movie). This is easy to do if the surface is given by an equation f(x,y,z)=0 and the point p=(a,b,c); simply check if f(a,b,c)=0. The goal is to find efficient algorithms to determine f(x,y,z), which is typically unknown. The final theme of the proposal is to study ``splines'', which are objects used by companies like Boeing to model surfaces.  The PI will work to determine theoretical bounds on the number of splines on certain objects and will also analyze the complexity of a symbolic algebra algorithm (not currently used in the area) for computing splines. Accomplishing either of these goals could lead to an actual speed up in the software used to generate splines."

The family of gradient flows<br/>associated to the interfacial energy are compelling fourth and<br/>sixth order extensions of the familiar Allen-Cahn and<br/>Cahn-Hilliard operators with rich new structure.  The<br/>investigator rigorously derives sharp interface limits for the<br/>gradient flows associated with pore formation.  The exclusion<br/>potential that separates the protonic defects from the anions<br/>generates a novel equilibrium charge distribution within the<br/>phase separated membrane, modifying the classic Gouy-Chapmann<br/>diffusive double layer.  A multiscale analysis of the elliptic<br/>equations governing the charge distribution quantifies the impact<br/>of the exclusion potential on the structure of the electrostatic<br/>double layer, and the impact of the electrostatic pressure upon<br/>the phase separation.  The solvent pore network within the<br/>polymer electrolyte is a novel high-contrast conductive composite<br/>media.  For local minimizers of the phase separation arising from<br/>interfacial and electrostatic energies, the investigator exploits<br/>the high contrast afforded by the permittivity and exclusion<br/>potential to derive the effective conductivity of polymer<br/>network.  This entails asymptotic analysis of the saddle point<br/>structure of charge distribution at channel junctions and<br/>development of a variational characterization of the effective<br/>protonic conductivity. <br/><br/>Polymer electrolytes are comprised of long hydrophobic polymers<br/>(essentially Teflon) with short acidic side-chains attached, like<br/>a single pole ladder.  They form a rich structure that phase<br/>separates in the presence of water, forming intricate nanoscale<br/>geometries lined with pendant acid groups and filled with charged<br/>fluid.  Such structures are the workhorses of ion transport,<br/>generating the selectivity of ion channels in cell membranes, the<br/>complex biochemical processes that occur within the pores of<br/>lipid membranes, and the motivation of this project: the<br/>transport of charge within polymer electrolyte membranes of fuel<br/>cells.  This project analyzes the mathematical underpinnings of a<br/>novel Conductive Polymer Electrolyte (CPE) model for phase<br/>separation and ion transport in polymer electrolyte solutions. <br/>The fundamental understanding of pore formation and ion<br/>conduction in these materials is essential to the development of<br/>high-temperature membranes for fuel cell vehicles.  High<br/>temperature membranes are a key step in the transition to a<br/>hydrogen economy, as higher fuel cell operating temperatures will<br/>greatly reduce costs associated with platinum catalyst loading<br/>and radiative cooling of the engine."

A typical feature which distinguishes the field of nonlinear waves from many other fields of pure mathematics is a case study, many problems demonstrate very similar features but they do not rely on any common theory. In the recent years a particular theme appeared recurrently in two close fields - nonlinear waves and integrable systems. It is useful to consider a problem in a space which allows existence of states with 'negative' energy. These states then may lead to instabilities of coherent structures. For stable structures these negative energy states must be either not active or completely eliminated.

These subjects govern a broad spectrum of applications arising from industry, engineering, economics, biology, and many others fields.  In the last decade, more applications pointed toward combining both continuous-time and discrete-time systems which resulted in the birth of two different fields: Systems over time scales and impulsive hybrid systems.  Nowadays they are two of the most rapidly growing areas of current research in dynamical systems theory. Results for either type of system are challenging, due to the discrepancies between the continuous and discrete settings and to their combined complexities.  The objective of this investigation is to address key challenges in four topics of applied mathematics: optimal controls over time scales or over impulsive systems, nonsmooth analysis, and infinite dimensional optimization. More specifically, the aim of the proposal is four-fold. (i) To launch the field of optimal controls over time scales in which constraints are allowed.  (ii) To build a bridge between optimal controls over time scales and that over impulsive systems.<br/>(iii) To introduce derivative- and Hessian- like objects for infinite dimensional ""nonsmooth"" functions that approximate such functions by linear and bilinear operators and that actually possess all the properties required from such  sets; as was the case with  Clarke's generalized Jacobian and Hessian in finite dimension.  (iv) To develop in terms of those objects, optimality criteria for infinite dimensional nonsmooth optimization problems with constraints.  In order execute these projects, a mixed bag of new and known techniques is needed such as nonsmooth and variational analysis techniques, optimization methods, Dubovitskii-Milyutin-type approach, dynamic programming- type techniques, time scales tools etc.<br/><br/>Optimal control is a field whose mere existence is the product of applications arising from fields such as: aerospace, mechanical and electrical engineering, automatics, robotics, automotive electronics, economics, biology, and more.  Therefore, important systematic developments of this research program have a significant impact on those fields. The outcome of this project will be a fundamental breakthrough leading to a new methodology in approaching some hybrid systems, and a new incentive to further advance optimal controls over time scales.  The investigator integrates her research into education by incorporating her findings into her two graduate courses, which are well attended by engineering students, and by crafting a capstone course at the undergraduate level in which the applications of optimal control theory to the above disciplines are enhanced.  Such an activity contributes greatly in training K-12 science and math teachers who graduate from MSU.<br/>"

This theory deals with<br/>the properties of heterogeneous materials, which are of critical<br/>importance for modern technology.  Modeling of such materials<br/>raises fundamental mathematical questions, primarily in partial<br/>differential equations and Calculus of Variations.  The project<br/>focuses on two areas, with homogenization and multiscale analysis<br/>as their common themes. <br/> Area A.  Ginzburg-Landau models: homogenization, well-posedness,<br/>and near-boundary vortices.  Vortices of the minimizers of the<br/>Ginzburg-Landau energy functional capture essential features of<br/>superconductors and superfluids.  They have many common features<br/>with vortices in fluids, defects in liquid crystals, dislocations<br/>in solids, etc.  The investigator studies the homogenization and<br/>rise of a special type of near-boundary vortex for the<br/>Ginzburg-Landau functional in the class of maps with the degree<br/>(winding number) prescribed on the boundary of a<br/>multiply-connected domain.  In this problem, he establishes novel<br/>local minimizers that have near-boundary vortices with bounded<br/>energy. <br/> Area B.  Homogenization of an elasticity problem with many<br/>nonseparated scales and the Cauchy-Born rule.  Homogenization<br/>(upscaling) in the presence of many nonseparated spatial scales<br/>is far from understood from a mathematical standpoint and it<br/>arises in the study of turbulence, soils, biological tissues,<br/>etc.  The investigator studies such a problem for elasticity<br/>equations and constructs an approximate (upscaled) solution<br/>belonging to a finite-dimensional functional space.  The<br/>classical Cauchy-Born rule is a postulate that allows the passage<br/>from atomistic to continuum models in monoatomic crystals.  The<br/>investigator uses the above approximate solution to derive a<br/>generalized Cauchy-Born rule for strongly heterogeneous<br/>materials. <br/><br/>     The investigator focuses on the development of novel<br/>techniques of applied analysis to address the needs of modern<br/>technology.  The Ginzburg-Landau equations arose in modeling<br/>superconductivity but have wider implications.  In this project,<br/>the investigator's work on this topic has potential applications<br/>in the design of superconducting materials (which at certain<br/>temperatures conduct electric current with no resistance) and<br/>ferromagnetic materials.  Additionally it addresses the<br/>understanding of vortex behavior, which is one of the major<br/>challenges for the science of superconductivity and its<br/>technological applications.  For the second topic, homogenization<br/>of elasticity problems with nonseparated scales, he aims to<br/>develop novel, efficient computational tools suitable for<br/>modeling strongly heterogeneous (disordered) materials, both<br/>natural and man-made.

Despite recent developments, fundamental questions remain open in understanding fluid flow and elastic  behavior in solids, in particular with respect to turbulence, elastic wave propagation, and singularity formation. A main goal is to obtain qualitative, but physically relevant, information from properties of solutions to the underlying differential equations. The complex phenomena observed in physical  systems correspond to ill-posedness of the equations, in the form of instability, irregularity, and non-uniqueness of the corresponding solutions.  Microlocal and Fourier analysis have proven effective tools for this investigation, as they encode the smoothness, size, and oscillations in a signal accurately and efficiently.   Microlocal analysis provides crucial directional information in the presence of complex geometries, such as corners and cracks. Three main problems will be addressed.  The first is dissipation of enstrophy, the mean square of vorticity, for incompressible 2D and quasi-geostrophic flows, and local decay of the energy spectrum for incompressible 3D flows using the Wigner transform.  The second is<br/>anisotropic static elasticity on curved polyhedral domains with cracks.  The third is identification of  density and anisotropic elastic constants in the interior of a body from dynamic surface displacement-traction measurements. <br/><br/>The proposed research consists of problems where the exchange between mathematics and other sciences has been fruitful.  Fluid turbulence is a fundamental occurrence, which still lacks a complete understanding.  It affects the way fluids transport and mix other substances with implications in global climate models, fish migration, and industrial design, for example. The mechanism by which vortices form and transfer energy at different length scales is central to turbulence and is one of the problems under study.  Modeling of slow crack formation is important for structural stability in engineering.   Mathematical analysis proposed in the second problem under study validates the results of computer simulations, which can be used to predict failure in elastic materials under mechanical stress.   Identification of elastic response in materials from remote measurements gives rise to non-invasive, diagnostic  imaging of the human body, and imaging of the earth's crust in seismology and oil exploration. The investigation proposed in the third problem aims at determining a priori when sufficient information in the data exists for image reconstruction.<br/>The overall goal of the proposal is to exploit mathematical results to advance understanding of physical phenomena with impact on real-life applications. <br/>"

A prominent example occurs in the Hamiltonian or symplectic case, where these ""invariant tori"" persist---even for nearly-integrable motion, as is explained by ""KAM theory.""  The destruction of tori in the two-dimensional case is explained by Aubry-Mather theory and renormalization results.  However, a concomitant understanding of the destruction of tori upon perturbation in higher dimensions has proved elusive. In this proposal, the implications of integrability, due to symmetries and invariants, of volume-preserving dynamics will be investigated.  The loss of integrability under perturbation will be studied by a combination of analytical (Aubry's anti-integrable limit, Fourier series) and numerical (invariant manifold and continuation) techniques.  Tori are both created and destroyed by bifurcations, and a study of the normal forms for codimension-one and two bifurcations of fixed points will lead to classification possible phenomena.  Transport will be investigated numerically with the goal of developing analytical measures of flux and transport distributions.  In a second project, the PI will investigate bifurcations in nonsmooth systems appropriate to the modeling of chemical reactions, the systematic simplification of these systems by center manifold reduction, as well as the study of transport caused by weak coupling of chaotic motion to regular motion.<br/><br/>Conservative dynamical models are used in designing particle accelerators, obtaining rates for simple chemical reactions, calculating confinement times in plasma fusion devices, understanding the spectra of highly excited atomic systems, and designing efficient spacecraft trajectories.  Dynamics in such systems is often chaotic and prediction of individual trajectories is difficult; nevertheless, chaos can be profitably utilized, for example, to improve efficiency of spacecraft trajectories, by judiciously applying small course corrections, or to enhance the lifetimes of particles in confinement devices and the rates of chemical reactions.  Volume-preserving dynamics models the flow of incompressible fluids and magnetic fields and a quantitative understanding of chaos in these systems is crucial for the development of efficient mixing in microscale bioreactors as well as of predictive planetary scale weather models.  Most of our current theoretical understanding is limited to the two-dimensional case that is appropriate for flows in rapidly rotating or thin layers of fluid.  While this has been useful in the understanding of such phenomena as the trapping of nutrients in gulf stream rings, the formation of the ozone hole and the creation of vortex-induced mixing in sinuous tubes, even in these systems, three-dimensional, chaos-induced transport needs to be understood.  The PI seeks to develop analytical and computational methods for the study of regular and chaotic volume-preserving motion both to contribute broadly to our fundamental understanding of the richness of the behavior of low-dimensional deterministic evolution, and, to relate it to mixing and transport.<br/>"

These systems are usually dissipative, but the dissipation might be weak. This proposal focusses on nonlinear dispersive waves in the presence of weak dissipation, with special emphasis on surface water waves. Recent  work by the PIs of this proposal and others has shown that even weak  dissipation can profoundly affect the stability of nonlinear dispersive  waves in certain situations.  The overall theme of this proposal is to study nonlinear dispersive waves in the presence of weak dissipation.  We will use a state-of-the-art laboratory facility to conduct experiments on waves on deep water. These experiments will guide the development of mathematical models and test their validity. Questions we will explore include (a) How does weak dissipation affect the stability and properties of surface wave patterns that are more complicated than ordinary plane waves? (b) What causes the downshifting of the peak of a narrow-banded spectrum of nonlinear, dispersive waves, as observed in experiments on water waves and in optics?  (c) Does this theoretical and laboratory work apply to actual ocean waves? (d) What causes the dissipation in surface water waves?<br/><br/>Particular goals of this research include obtaining better predictive models of the dynamics of large-amplitude ocean waves, and of exchange processes that occur at the ocean-atmosphere boundary. Accurate models of  these exchange processes will be essential in predicting global warming and related global phenomena.  In addition, accurate models of wave dynamics might prove useful in understanding extreme waves such as rogue waves.  Much of the work to be conducted is fundamental in nature and the mathematics is shared by many physical systems, so the results obtained for water waves could affect our understanding of many physical systems. These other systems include light waves in an optical fiber, spin waves in a thin magnetic film and others."

Mucus transport by cilia in the respiratory tract, sperm penetration of the oocyte in fertilization, and peristaltic contractions of the oviduct are examples of such interactions. Many biological fluids are actually complex; that is they are not liquids or mixtures of a simple molecular structure that yields Newtonian responses, but instead have complicated non-Newtonian mechanical responses that arise, usually, because they have suspended microstructure.  While much progress has been made in the development of mathematical models and numerical methods for fluid-structure interactions in a Newtonian fluid, much work needs to be done in the case of complex fluids. This focused research group will use a combination of analytical, computational and experimental tools to investigate the dynamics of elastic structures coupled to a complex fluid. Accurate and robust numerical methods for viscoelastic fluids coupled to moving and flexible  boundaries will be developed that build upon classical immersed boundary methods and particle methods previously designed for Newtonian fluids. Continuum descriptions of the viscoelastic fluid will be implemented, as well as models that track discrete viscoelastic microstructure of the fluid. While the methods developed will be widely applicable, the team will focus upon the biofluidmechanics of reproduction, nematode motility in microfluidic chambers, as well as mucus-ciliary transport. Computational models will be coordinated with physical and biological experiments performed at the Applied Mathematics Lab at the Courant Institute.<br/><br/>Mathematics has had a huge impact on engineering and the physical sciences through its development of theoretical analyses and numerical methods for Newtonian fluid flows.  The dynamics of complex fluids is emerging as another such opportunity, and is one which draws some of its richest problems from new areas in biophysics and engineering, medicine and reproductive health, and from core biology. The integration of mathematical and computational analysis into biological science presents educational challenges and great opportunities. This research project embraces these challenges, and is based upon collaborations of investigators at four institutions - Tulane University, New York University, Washington State University and the University of California, Los Angeles.  A central component of this project is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  This FRG project will sponsor two summer programs, where the postdoctoral researchers and graduate students will spend six weeks at the Applied Mathematics Lab at Courant Institute.

While a great deal of research has been done for plate and wave dynamics and other so-called flat geometries, very little is known as far as rigorous control theory for shell models. This particularly refers to problems such as controllability, stabilization and optimal control problems.  On the other hand, from the point of view of applications this is precisely the more interesting case -- for example an airplane or helicopter cabin is curved, so the structural acoustic case is naturally modeled with shells.  While the interest in studying shells need not be defended on physical/application grounds, the mathematical analysis (in particular in the context of control theory) is poorly understood with many challenges. In fact, methods developed for flat geometries are no longer applicable, and approaches such as microlocal analysis or geometric optics had to be introduced in order to resolve the problem.  The geometry of the problem is responsible for these problems, and the idea pursued in this research is that a solid understanding of that geometry is the key to surmounting these obstacles. The goal of this project is to capture this geometry through the correct modeling and exploit it in the proofs.  The research builds upon recently developed ""intrinsic"" models due to Michel Delfour and Jean-Paul Zolesio which are coordinate free. This very fact, together with an appropriately developed calculus rooted in geometry, provides a tool for deriving the appropriate inequalities.<br/><br/>In previously funded work, models based on the intrinsic geometry have been developed for linear, nonlinear, and thermoelastic shells.  Answers to questions such as stabilization, control, and well-posedness for these models have been established, and the linear model has been numerically verified to be accurate.  The objective for the current research is to further investigate control and numerical analysis of the nonlinear intrinsic shell model.  As such, the following issues will be addressed:  Model verification for the nonlinear shell; error analysis in order to derive the optimal rates of convergence for the finite element approximation to the nonlinear shell model; control theory for shells (i.e., issues of stability and/or stabilizibility of the nonlinear model, long time behavior and attractors, and exact controllability from the boundary); and numerical analysis of control problems.  In part, the intellectual merit of this work lies in the construction of a complete theory of the control of shell structures.  However, the methods involved are themselves of independent interest as very special inverse-type inequalities are derived in the proofs which have applications to other problems as well.  In addition, the numerical libraries developed can be applied to many different types of problem. The issue of the shell is an issue of geometry, and the geometrical and topological aspects of this work are very rich.  The broader impact of this work will be seen in the integration of education and research, participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics, technology transfer and cross-fertilization with industry."

At a fixed wave number, the phenomenon of evanescence limits the dimension of the linear space of propagating waves (far fields) in terms of the size of the (support of the) source.

Evanescence refers to the fact that the components of the wave which carry the information necessary for high spatial resolution decay so rapidly with distance from an object, that they are effectively invisible from afar. In this project, we are developing methods to use evanescence as a tool, rather than accepting it as a limitation. Based on the frequencies that we do not see (the evanescent modes) in a radiation pattern at a radar or sonar array, we can calculate the position and estimate the size of the object that emitted or reflected that radiation pattern. <br/><br/>"

This project is to justify rigorously some of these simplified models, and to prove existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on the initial data of their solutions; and to investigate the long-term behavior for these models. This is the first and the most crucial step in justifying the derivation of these models and their consistency with physical observations for the relevant spatial and time scales. This project involves the development of novel and sophisticated mathematical techniques for the analytical study of these models and of new sub-grid scale models of oceanic turbulent flows. The latter are being proposed as new analytical parametrization models for ocean circulation dynamics. Furthermore, we propose to investigate the qualitative and statistical approximation behavior of a new class of inviscid regularizing schemes/models for oceanic and atmospheric dynamics, and to implement them computationally. The advantage of these new schemes, which are globally (in time) regular, is that they do not require addition boundary conditions, unlike the standard hyper-viscous regularization, which is commonly used in geophysical computations to suppress the numerical, non-physical, small scale instabilities.<br/><br/>Due to the developments in modern technology, the ever increasing computational power, and the sophisticated mathematical analysis of the ocean and atmosphere dynamics models we are able predict the weather only for a few days.  Reliable long time numerical simulations of the exact equations that govern the climate dynamics are still out of reach, even for the most powerful state-of-the-art computers. Geophysicists have introduced more simplified models for climate dynamics to be implemented computationally. It is therefore essential to justify, rigorously, the validity of these models.  Development of computational and theoretical tools to further understanding of the climate system and its predictability will be the major focus of this project. The approach of this project involves a combination of mathematical, numerical and statistical tools."

The PI aims to study nonlinear stability of periodic traveling waves in one dimension.   Singular perturbation problems form a very challenging class of dynamical systems involving multi-scales. The presence of turning points for some singularly perturbed problems relates to a loss of stability of the dynamical structures. The PI plans to investigate stability issues of this dynamical system. Spectral theory links spectral properties of operators to the geometry and topology of the underlying manifold, so it is critical to have a fine spectral theory. The PI proposes to develop a refinement of the Sacker-Sell spectral theory and moreover investigate the relation of the refinement to other spectral theories. <br/><br/>Qualitative information of differential equations that are commonly used to model interesting phenomena in various areas of science and engineering is highly desirable from the point of view of physical applications, since it is practically impossible to find exact solutions of the differential equations modeling the applications.  Stability and spectral theory can provide this information. The questions considered in the project have broad applications, so their resolution holds great promise for widespread use in many areas of science and engineering.  Such work would further the understanding of the dynamical properties and provide more insight into the processes where they arise.<br/>"

The project highlights scientific challenges in the domain of MR data acquisition and reconstruction, including image formation from sparse and/or non-uniformly collected data, restoration of data corrupted by system imperfections, as well as rapid and robust image  construction from data acquired by multiple receivers.  The crosscutting expertise of the research team is enabling development of rigorous tools for addressing these challenges, providing the underpinnings for provable results, quantifiable measures of performance, and efficient algorithms.

In the second order Reed Muller code, pairs of phase coded waveforms associated with Rudin-Shapiro sequences enable instantaneous radar polarimetry which provides concurrent and coherent access to all four dimensions of the polarization scattering matrix rather than serial and non-coherent access as is the case today.

The first class of problems concerns the effect that the solubility of a surfactant in the bulk flow of immiscible fluids can have on the deformation and breakup of liquid drops, bubbles, and jets.  A significant difficulty is introduced by the slow diffusion (or large Peclet number) of surfactant in the bulk flow, which causes a large gradient in concentration of surfactant to occur across a thin layer adjacent to the interface between immiscible fluids.  Resolving the surfactant gradient near the interface must be accomplished with great accuracy to determine the interface's dynamics but presents a significant challenge for traditional numerical methods.  In this project, the slenderness of the layer will be used to develop fast and accurate 'hybrid' numerical methods that incorporate a separate analytical reduction of the layer's dynamics into numerical solution of the interfacial free boundary problem.  The second class of problems concerns the deformation of a slender elastic fiber or filament when it is influenced by capillary forces at a fluid interface.  This project will develop a robust and efficient numerical method that uses one-dimensional integral equations from slender body theory to describe the fiber's dynamics and takes into account the interaction between fluid, filament, and free surface.<br/><br/>Surfactants, such as alcohols, sulfates, and detergents, are widely used to control the dynamics of emulsification or blending of fluid systems in applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  At a fundamental level, the emulsification process occurs via the behavior of single fluid drops and jets as they break up by bursting or tip-streaming in a straining flow.  This project seeks to determine details of the mode of breakup that are important in practice but have so far been difficult to capture accurately by traditional numerical methods.  Similarly, sticking and stiction of slender elastic filaments and cantilevers is important in the proper operation of specific micro-electromechanical devices, and filament-fluid interfacial forces are being investigated as a means to assemble filaments into larger structures, such as nanotube rings and biological filamented structures.  This project seeks to elucidate fundamental effects that occur in such processes by incorporating analytical techniques for the resolution of small-scale structures into fast and accurate, robust numerical methods.<br/>"

The overall theme of this proposal is to <br/>study nonlinear dispersive waves in the presence of weak dissipation.  We will use a state-of-the-art laboratory facility to conduct experiments on waves on deep water. These experiments will guide the development of mathematical models and test their validity. Questions we will explore include (a) How does weak dissipation affect the stability and properties of surface wave patterns that are more complicated than ordinary plane waves? (b) What causes the downshifting of the peak of a narrow-banded spectrum of nonlinear, dispersive waves, as observed in experiments on water waves and in optics?  (c) Does this theoretical and laboratory work apply to actual ocean waves? (d) What causes the dissipation in surface water waves?<br/><br/>Particular goals of this research include obtaining better predictive models of the dynamics of large-amplitude ocean waves, and of exchange processes that occur at the ocean-atmosphere boundary. Accurate models of  these exchange processes will be essential in predicting global warming and related global phenomena.  In addition, accurate models of wave dynamics might prove useful in understanding extreme waves such as rogue waves.  Much of the work to be conducted is fundamental in nature and the mathematics is shared by many physical systems, so the results obtained for water waves could affect our understanding of many physical systems.

The first part consists of a family of problems coming from the study of phase transition equations. Such equations model several types of phenomena, including superconductors, superfluids, Bose-Einstein condensates, and liquid crystals. These models form interesting defects in singular asymptotic regimes, in which the equations simplify substantially. This simplification is useful for improved numerical techniques and qualitative understanding. The first part of the project studies the behavior of these defects in both static and time dependent situations with techniques developed from the calculus of variations and harmonic analysis. The second part of the proposals centers on examining the stability of free boundaries in fluid equations with nontrivial vorticity in the fluid. The equations that model such fluids have both geometrical and physical components. The primary aim of this part of the project is to study the stability of such fluids under perturbations. The techniques used to analyze these problems come from energy methods, spectral theory, and harmonic analysis.<br/><br/>Helium, when cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero, becomes a liquid with unusual characteristics. The liquid loses all internal friction, and if stirred, will rotate without end. Such liquids are called superfluids. If the stirring is too strong, little eddies (or vortices) form with quantized momentum, each of which are no longer in the superfluid state. Knowledge of the behavior and location of the vortices is the fundamental piece of information needed to describe the superfluid. The first part of this proposal studies properties of such vortices in superfluids, superconductors, and other related physics problems where quantum mechanical effects appear in large scales. Such physics problems are of increasing use in applications. The second part of the proposal centers on understanding the behavior of regular fluids with free boundaries, such as the surface of the ocean and the surface of stars. The equations that model these problems are complicated; however, since these problems arise with great frequency that their analysis is important <br/>"

One research project focuses on the modeling and analysis of locust swarms. Locusts can operate in either a solitary (neighbor-avoiding) or gregarious (neighbor-seeking) phase. The investigator constructs a PDE model incorporating social aspects of behavior as well as environmental variables and random motion in order to understand how each of these factors affects the dynamics of phase change, the spatial patterns of the locust population, and the nucleation of gregarious groups. A second model describes the rolling motion of migrating gregarious groups. The high-dimensional ODE model incorporates social interactions, gravity, wind, and the boundary formed by the ground. The models are studied with tools from dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, analysis of PDE, and numerical simulation. Another project examines the control of Turing patterns in chemical reaction-diffusion systems. Inspired by recent experiments which controlled chemical Turing patterns by using an external light field, the investigator develops a framework for manipulating reaction-diffusion patterns via periodic spatiotemporal forcing. The study is built around a symmetry-based analysis of normal forms, a perturbation analysis of reaction-diffusion type PDE, and numerical simulations, all of which reveal how pattern stability is affected by the applied forcing.<br/><br/>Spatiotemporal pattern formation occurs spontaneously in myriad natural systems. Key challenges include the development of mathematical models of these systems, the analysis of the models, and the development of methods for controlling the patterns. The investigator's research on locust plagues primarily addresses the first two challenges. Locusts are an important pattern-forming biological systems because their destructive swarms have severe environmental and economic impacts. Some results are general enough to shed light on other social biological aggregations such as bird flocks and fish schools. The research on Turing patterns in chemical systems addresses the third challenge. The results explain experimental observations and suggest control strategies that can be tested in the lab. Furthermore, some of the results apply to other Turing patterns, which occur in such diverse contexts as biological morphogenesis, population dynamics, neuroscience, ecology, and materials science. The training and mentoring of research students and the development of math and science instruction using novel pedagogical techniques all play a key role in the investigator's program.<br/>"

In particular, variational and viscosity solution methods will be adapted to treat the fundamental questions of existence and uniqueness that remain open for many of these problems. The free boundaries will be obtained as the solutions to a new set of integral and integro-differential equations whose structures are motivated by the original financial problem. A full spectrum of methods from mathematical analysis (functional, asymptotic and numerical) will be developed to study the solutions. Of special interest will be the development of accurate analytical approximations, and fast robust numerical schemes, for the location of the free boundaries. In many cases, basic properties of the free boundaries such as regularity, monotonicity, convexity, etc., are open.  These issues will be addressed not only because they are of fundamental mathematical interest but also because they play a key role in making rigorous, and in simplifying, the proofs of the results mentioned above.  Because of the wide variety of financial applications of interest in the equity, bond, mortgage, credit, and energy markets, special attention will be paid to ensure that the development of these methods will apply to all of the various stochastic processes that might arise as underliers: Uhlenbeck-Ornstein, geometric Brownian motion, mean reversion, jump-diffusion, stochastic volatility, variance gamma, etc.<br/><br/>The prototype, and most widely studied, free boundary in Finance is the early exercise boundary for an American put option; i.e., for any time before expiry of the option, the free boundary is the stock price below which it is optimal to exercise the option early. In spite of the enormous amount of attention already paid to this problem, the convexity of this early exercise boundary, and its use to obtain a global analytic estimate for its location, is still lacking when the stock pays a dividend.  Also under study is the free boundary problem that arises in determining the optimal interest rate for prepaying a mortgage or for converting a variable rate mortgage to a fixed rate one. Existing strategies are based on using only today's yield curve whereas this free boundary approach incorporates one's anticipation of future yields. Not only will this provide a more accurate decision tool for individual mortgage holders but also lead to more accurate pricing in the mortgage backed securities (MBS) sector.  Energy prices are modeled using jump-diffusion and stochastic volatility processes and the methods will be extended to this framework in order to price financial derivatives like options on forward contracts and swing options. Free boundaries arise in the credit sector in a completely different manner. A firm defaults when its total value decreases below a prescribed barrier. Matching a firm's time-dependent default barrier to the probability of default assigned to the firm by a rating agency leads to another type of free boundary problem for its default barrier. This provides a context for the rigorous comparison of default correlation among several firms in this value-of-firms model with the other, currently popular, copula approach and hence will lead to a better understanding and pricing of credit debt obligations (CDOs). By changing the underlying risky process to a pure jump or an extreme value model, a similar analysis will lead to a better understanding of the catastrophic risks associated with high impact / low probability weather or terrorist related events. A strategically important goal is to use this information to develop insurance products in this catastrophic insurance sector."

The project explores the computational modeling of fluid-solid interactions from suspensions phenomena obeying simple rules between interacting solids, to flows where key features can be effectively approximated by distributed Lagrange multiplier (DLM) techniques.  In studying suspensions, the ""sort-and-sweep"" simulation method developed by the PI will be employed and extended to investigate sedimentation instabilities, including some analogous to classic fluid instabilities (e.g., the Rayleigh-Taylor heavy-over-light instability) and others that appear to be special to suspensions (e.g., in electrophoretic levitation and breakup of particle-laden drops).  A main goal is testing macroscopic models of sedimentation processes. Model DLM calculations will be extended to explore important hydrodynamic phenomena at the scale of interaction between small numbers of rigid, jointed, or deformable solids, including investigation of natural and artificial modes of propulsion in liquids at small but non-zero Reynolds numbers.  Research and mentoring activities are bridged in this project through Research Experiences for Undergraduates in networks science, including tools for identifying hierarchical community structures and the application of such tools to novel datasets, including the potential of investigating effective networks of hydrodynamically-interacting components.  The project also includes extensive curriculum development aimed at optimizing the set of mathematical tools covered in courses for undergraduate students majoring in biology and the health sciences.<br/><br/>Continuing advances in capabilities for developing micro- and nano-systems and machines lead to design questions about fluid dynamics at small scales that must be addressed with different tools than those used at large scales.

Also important are interactions between solids and the complex viscoelastic fluids in which they are suspended, a common occurrence in biological situations.  Developing computational tools for more efficiently and effectively handling such interactions is a goal.  Other fundamental fluid-dynamic phenomena are further investigated, both for their own importance and for the validation of the proposed computational approaches to these regimes.

Success of inversion typically hinges on the practicality of solving wave or hyperbolic equations, or proper approximations thereof, on a massive computational scale. To this end, the PIs propose to revisit computational wave propagation in smooth media, in two and three space dimensions, in order to bring the complexity down to asymptotically linear in the size of the initial data, up to log factors and reasonable constants. In this low-complexity regime, precomputations involving the Green's function become the main focus of the numerical effort. To this end, the PIs propose to design, implement, test and analyze the following numerical methods: (1) an efficient algorithm for Fourier Integral Operators (FIO), using techniques such as phase-space partitionings, geometric downsamplings, directional interpolation, and low rank matrix approximations via random sampling, (2) an efficient algorithm for linear hyperbolic PDE with smooth coefficients, based on the above algorithm for FIO, and also using techniques such as the phase-flow method for travel times, separation and random samplings of pseudodifferential symbols, and special<br/>quadratures that exploit the microlocal geometry of wave propagation, and (3) an efficient algorithm for Kirchhoff migration in seismic imaging, based on the above algorithm for FIO, and also on a high-dimensional compression technique for the kinematics of the imaging operator. In a separate effort, the PIs will explore more general situations of physical interest such as phase blowups and multipathing, for which new ideas will be required.<br/><br/>The proposed research is directly motivated by the need for new, efficient inversion methods in reflection seismology. In turn, improved seismic imaging techniques (1) could help discover new physics and settle existing debates in geophysics (for instance concerning convection phenomena in the Earth's mantle), and (2) could provide a better map of the Earth's upper crust, for industrial exploration purposes. The PIs plan on working closely with seismologists in the later phases of the project, to deliver operational codes and disseminate ideas in the geophysics community. Alternatively, transmission electron microscopy is another curvilinear tomography imaging problem for which the proposed algorithms will provide a fresh outlook towards novel, accurate inversion methods, with applications in biology and medical imaging.<br/><br/><br/>"

As such, the rigorous study of these systems is warranted.  Due to their intrinsically nonsmooth characteristics, such a study defies classical dynamical systems theory and requires novel mathematical analysis, computational and design tools.  This proposed project is devoted to the investigation of challenging issues in the analysis and control of complementarity systems.  We propose to apply state-of-art techniques from mathematical programming, convex analysis, systems theory, and control theory to tackle these problems.  On the analytical side, we will address several fundamental and critical issues of system behavior, e.g., existence and uniqueness of solutions and Zeno property, which are directly related to numerical computation and system analysis.  Moreover, we aim at studying controllability and observability and developing control algorithms that will be applied to robot motion planning, multi-body systems subject to unilateral constraints, and constrained dynamic optimization problems.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems modeled by ODEs provide a powerful mathematical and computational framework for the study and understanding of a wide range of time-dependent physical phenomena that naturally occur in many engineering applications.

A trivial example of such constraints is a falling object before and after hitting the ground.  At the instant where the object touches the ground, an impact occurs followed by a rebounce of the object that results in a change of direction of the object's motion.  This is a mode transition.  The proposed research aims at treating dynamical systems where mode transition is an unknown but important component of the overall system configuration.  If successful, the results of the research will let us gain a better understanding of many complex engineering systems with mode changes and will provide a solid foundation for the improved design of such systems that in turn will have a significant impact on many practical fields.

The first component of the project is the application of the singular value decomposition to the equations governing the combination of optical pulse propagation and signal detection at the end of transmission that converts light into electrical energy, which will determine the perturbations that produce the largest changes at the output.

A characteristic feature of most of the reaction-diffusion systems that have been studied to date is that diffusion is normal, i.e., the dependence of the mean square displacement of a randomly walking particle on time is linear.<br/>In some cases, however, a more general dependence is observed, in which the mean square displacement behaves as a power function of time, and the diffusion of the reactants is anomalous.  If the exponent is less than one the diffusion process is slower than normal diffusion and is called subdiffusion. In contrast, if the exponent is greater than one it is faster than normal and is called superdiffusion. Both types of anomalous diffusion have been recognized to play important roles in various physical, chemical, biological, geological, and other processes. For anomalous diffusion the reaction-diffusion system of partial differential equations is replaced by a system of fractional partial differential equations which have been derived from appropriate continuous time random walk models at the molecular level.  The fractional equations are equivalent to systems of integro-differential equations which are the objects of our investigation. The proposed studies will involve both general reaction-diffusion systems with anomalous diffusion, and specific applications. Investigations of general reaction-diffusion systems will help elucidate the universal mechanisms of pattern formation and nonlinear dynamics under anomalous diffusion conditions. The specific models will include the famous chemical dynamics models such as the Brusselator, Oregonator, Gray-Scott, Gierer-Meinhardt, Fitzhugh-Nagumo, and other models, as well as models for combustion, polymerization, and controlled drug delivery.  The effects of both sub- and superdiffusion will be considered.<br/><br/>Reaction-diffusion systems are ubiquitous in many branches of science and have been attracting the attention of scientists, engineers and mathematicians for decades. Since the ground-breaking discoveries of Turing who showed that diffusion in a mixture of chemically reacting species could cause instability of a spatially uniform state leading to the formation of spatio-temporal patterns, and Belousov and Zhabotinskii who discovered oscillating chemical reactions, reaction-diffusion systems have become one of the paradigms for the formation of spatio-temporal patterns in systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The formation of such fascinating structures as spiral waves, spatially-regular, stationary patterns with different symmetries (hexagonal, stripe,<br/>etc.) as well as chemical turbulence have made reaction-diffusion systems the subject of numerous ongoing investigations. In many systems, however, the transport process is not via normal diffusion but rather via anomalous diffusion which can be slower (subdiffusion) or faster (superdiffusion) than normal diffusion.  Subdiffusion often occurs in biogels, porous media and polymers, while superdiffusion is typical of some processes in plasmas, semiconductors, surface reactions and many others. Although many aspects of anomalous diffusion have been studied, nonlinear dynamic and pattern formation aspects were the subject of only a very limited number of works. These preliminary studies demonstrate the significance of anomalous diffusion and the necessity for its systematic investigation. The PIs will conduct systematic studies of the effect of anomalous diffusion on the formation of Turing patterns and spatially nonuniform oscillating patterns as well as spiral waves in reaction-diffusion systems, with specific applications to combustion waves, isothermal frontal polymerization waves, and controlled drug delivery.<br/>"

The formulation of these fluid flows involves an unknown free surface that describes the region in an ambient medium occupied by the fluid. Understanding how these free surfaces evolve, what flow scenarios and material parameters are prone to trigger flow instabilities, and how the transition to flow catastrophes such as capillary breakup proceeds is a fundamental challenge in mathematics and the sciences.  Capillary, inertial and viscoelastic forces or balances thereof are known to stabilize or destabilize fluid filaments. In the case of highly viscous fluids, liquid filaments thin uniformly before breakup occurs and drops are formed, while in contrast viscoelasticity is expected to induce a beads-on-string morphology of the liquid filaments. The inherently nonlinear nature and the high degree of complexity of the cascade of events leading to thinning, necking, breakup or other transient patterns are topics that this project addresses. It encompasses a rigorous derivation and justification of averaged lower-dimensional equations for thin filaments and sheets indicating boundaries of validity of these models, a discussion of capillary thinning and breakup of viscoplastic fluid jets, and stability studies in the context of fiber spinning and film drawing for viscous and viscoelastic liquids. Analyzing and justifying mathematical models of fiber and film flows and explaining observed flow phenomena arising in capillary thinning and engineering applications requires the development of new mathematical tools, combining machinery from partial differential equations, stability theory, asymptotic analysis and multiscale analysis.<br/> <br/>A variety of high-tech applications, including food processing, ink-jet printing, atomization of paints and aerosols, jet stabilization, fiber spinning, and electrospinning of nanofibers, are all characterized by similar objectives: to either induce breakup of thin fluid filaments (or sheets) in a controlled manner, to suppress it or to keep flow instabilities from occurring. To reach these objectives, a deep mathematical understanding of the physical mechanisms and rheological parameters governing the onset of instabilities and the transition to flow catastrophes is necessary. The investigator develops the mathematical framework to derive, analyze, and justify flow models describing the evolution of free liquid filaments and sheets. Under examination are the occurrence of flow instabilities, the transition to breakup, and novel rheological phenomena in several exemplary flows. This research has the potential to significantly enhance our knowledge of the physical principles and limitations governing flows in these vital areas of engineering and science. The project also serves the purpose to train both graduate and undergraduate students in mathematical fluid mechanics and applied analysis in general and fiber/sheet forming flows in particular.<br/>"

The project has two parts:  (1) The study of boundary effects from the point of view of kinetic theory, in particular, the Boltzmann shock layer, initial layer, and their interactions, and the thermal, curvature, and condensation effects of the solid boundary;  (2) Study of multidimensional gas flow with shocks, in particular, the effects of shock reflections from a solid boundary on the overall flow patterns for the compressible Euler equations.  <br/><br/>To analyze boundary effects from the point of view of kinetic theory is physically natural, as the inclusion of the microscopic velocity in the Boltzmann solutions allows for physically realistic modeling of the solid boundary conditions.  It is mathematically challenging, as the boundary condition, such as the Maxwell type of the interpolation of specular and diffusion reflection conditions, makes possible the study of the rich interactions of particles and fluid waves.  This project will pursue local analysis of the physical phenomena. <br/><br/>Multi-dimensional gas flow with shocks is the consequence of the strongly nonlinear effect of compression and the global interaction of the gas with the solid boundary.  Mathematical analysis thereby becomes highly nonlinear and global.  New extremal principles are needed for the construction of solutions with free boundary for nonlinear partial differential equations of mixed types.  Already, an Ellipticity Principle has helped to explain that, with given boundary condition at far field, the uniqueness is possible only for self-similar flow, and not for stationary flows. <br/><br/>The study of the boundary effects on gas flow is of great importance for engineering practices.  Mathematical analysis is needed for quantitative and qualitative understanding of the physical process.  A classical example is the vacuum pump based on the phenomenon of thermal gradient flow, rather than on mechanical devices, to generate pressure differences.  Preliminary analytical studies show that the thermal gradient flow is stronger for more rarefied gases, an important consideration in the design of vacuum pumps.  The study of Prandtl's conjecture and the von Neumann paradox in compressible gas flows provides basic understanding for the shock structure of supersonic flight.  For instance, mathematical analysis quantifies the difference between the shock structure at the nose and that inside the engine of an aircraft.  This project aims to advance understanding of the mathematical models of these important processes.<br/>"

The Navier-Stokes equations can be elegantly formulated in the above framework using the inviscid Webber formula, which essentially represents the Navier-Stokes equations as the average of the Euler equations plus Brownian motion. We have a wide variety of applications in mind: A numerical (stochastic) method to compute solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, a study of the effect of obstacles and boundaries on viscous fluid flows, turbulence models for incompressible fluids, analytical estimates and weak solutions, and front propagation in the Boussinesq equations.<br/><br/>This research is based on the framework in which a viscous incompressible fluid can be explicitly represented as the average of an inviscid fluid plus Brownian motion.

A related application is to use this method to find a ""turbulence model"" for fluid flows: namely, the velocity field of the fluid is expressed as a slowly varying ""mean field"" (which is easy and inexpensive to compute), plus a rapid fluctuating ""noisy"" part, which is modeled using stochastic methods. Another application is to study boundary layer effects on the interior flow in the inviscid limit. A study of burning and flame propagation is also proposed.<br/>"

Success of inversion typically hinges on the practicality of solving wave or hyperbolic equations, or proper approximations thereof, on a massive computational scale. To this end, the PIs propose to revisit computational wave propagation in smooth media, in two and three space dimensions, in order to bring the complexity down to asymptotically linear in the size of the initial data, up to log factors and reasonable constants. In this low-complexity regime, precomputations involving the Green's function become the main focus of the numerical effort. To this end, the PIs propose to design, implement, test and analyze the following numerical methods: (1) an efficient algorithm for Fourier Integral Operators (FIO), using techniques such as phase-space partitionings, geometric downsamplings, directional interpolation, and low rank matrix approximations via random sampling, (2) an efficient algorithm for linear hyperbolic PDE with smooth coefficients, based on the above algorithm for FIO, and also using techniques such as the phase-flow method for travel times, separation and random samplings of pseudodifferential symbols, and special<br/>quadratures that exploit the microlocal geometry of wave propagation, and (3) an efficient algorithm for Kirchhoff migration in seismic imaging, based on the above algorithm for FIO, and also on a high-dimensional compression technique for the kinematics of the imaging operator. In a separate effort, the PIs will explore more general situations of physical interest such as phase blowups and multipathing, for which new ideas will be required.<br/><br/>The proposed research is directly motivated by the need for new, efficient inversion methods in reflection seismology. In turn, improved seismic imaging techniques (1) could help discover new physics and settle existing debates in geophysics (for instance concerning convection phenomena in the Earth's mantle), and (2) could provide a better map of the Earth's upper crust, for industrial exploration purposes. The PIs plan on working closely with seismologists in the later phases of the project, to deliver operational codes and disseminate ideas in the geophysics community. Alternatively, transmission electron microscopy is another curvilinear tomography imaging problem for which the proposed algorithms will provide a fresh outlook towards novel, accurate inversion methods, with applications in biology and medical imaging.<br/><br/><br/>"

Finally, closed form recovery formulas hinging on the dominant term of the depth asymptotics will be derived and combined with a fast minimization method.

In image processing, the investigator and his colleagues develop a novel multi-channel image denoising strategy based on cross channel information. Several high level mathematical tools including geometrical partial differential equations (PDE's), multiresolution harmonic analysis and calculus of variation are integrated together with some statistical methods and computer vision theory such as color spaces to remove noise from images while retaining salient geometrical features such as edges and corners. The investigator and collaborators also study a rigorous error analysis theory for wavelet based PDE techniques in image processing. In stochastic differential equations, the investigator and colleagues analyze the phase noise and time jitter for electric oscillators including an Analog Digital Conversion (ADC) model. The key is to use a moving coordinate system based on a vector bundle theory to completely decompose the phase noise and amplitude noise, and then study the associated Fokker-Planck equations which separate the deterministic statistical properties such as mean and variance from the randomness. A novel numerical method based on the Fokker-Planck equations is designed to compute Shannon's entropy which can be used to evaluate the performance of the oscillators.<br/><br/>Computing information has become one of the fastest growing aspects in many areas of science and technology. For instance, digital image processing analyzes and extracts useful information from digital images. Many images, including satellite, radar or sonar images and medical images, are polluted by noise from the environments like air, water, lighting conditions and dust on lens when they are acquired, or damaged during transmission processes such as wireless communications. Image denoising, which removes the noise, becomes one of the most important tasks in applications. A key objective in this research is to design new strategies removing noise in images while restoring important and useful information such as edges and shapes, which are often hard to be separated from the noise. Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe complicated physical or engineering systems with uncertainties. Examples include composite materials, turbulence, circuit design and optics. For instance, electric oscillators are the key circuits used in many electric devices such as antennas, and are often modeled by systems of stochastic differential equations. Phase noise, which causes channel interference in wireless communications, is one of the most important factors for designing oscillators. One objective of this study is to develop mathematical theory and methods to analyze and compute useful statistical information from random processes in oscillators so that they can be used in designing or evaluating the performance of oscillators.

The steepest descent method will itself be refined for this purpose.  A numerical component is also involved in our approach.  The second part of the project addresses resonant behavior in wave propagation through media that have a repetitive structure.  In previous work, anomalies in transmission through slabs of such media were observed and linked to resonant phenomena through a mathematical formula describing the transmission anomaly accurately in 2D.  The current project will develop formulae for the effective density of states near resonance and make a firm link between the resonance in question and the resonance introduced by Fano in a seminal 1935 quantum mechanics paper (in both cases, following a symmetry breaking perturbation, a real eigenvalue imbedded in continuous spectrum moves into the lower complex half plane as a resonance).  The project will also resolve a question in physics on the pulse response of linear materials by an elaborate use of the method of steepest descent for integrals.<br/><br/>The understanding of the propagation of waves in natural and in man-made materials is crucial to the utilization of these materials.  The first project (wave-breaking) applies to wave propagation in technologically significant materials, described to a good approximation by the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation.  Such materials are optical fibers in which the modulational instability acts adversely to fiber-optical communication.  With current technology, the breaking phenomena researched are beginning to be observable at the nanoscale and will play a role in the development of a theory of propagation in nanowires.  The second project (resonant behavior) refers to the propagation of light through photonic crystals, whose repetitive structure may guide, block, or even trap light.  The transmission anomalies studied consist of a sharp dip followed by sharp rise of the transmission coefficient as the frequency is varied in an experiment in which light is incident nearly normally onto a slab of photonic crystal material.  Both projects will involve students in interplay between mathematical analysis, numerical experiments, and physical experiments bridging the significantly different types of intuition in the mathematics and physics communities. <br/>"

The presence of the particles affects the flow of the liquid,  and this, inturn, affects the motion of the particles, so that the problem of determining theflow characteristics is highly coupled. It is just this latter feature that makes any fundamental mathematical problem related to liquid-particle interaction a particularly challenging one. The goal of this project is twofold.  On the one hand, it aims at furnishing a  mathematical analysis of some important and still not completely understood aspects  of this fascinating subject, like the transport of solid particles in the three-dimensional shear flow of a Navier-Stokes fluid in a pipe ad the orientation of symmetric particles at higher Reynolds numbers.  On the other hand, it will investigate some fundamental mathematical problems arising from this analysis,including steady and Hopf bifurcation of steady flow past an obstacle, and long-time behavior of unsteady flow past an obstacle. This latter study is also expected to give new information about regularity of solutions to the initial-value problem.<br/><br/>The motion of  homogeneous symmetric rigid  bodies in the  flow of liquids of different nature is a fundamental issue in many problems of practical interest. In particular, their orientation with the flow<br/>and, more generally, the nature of the forces exerted by the fluid on them are the key to understand the nature of a number of significant phenomena, on both small and large scales. The orientation of particle is crucial, for example, in the following problems.  In composite materials, the addition of short fiber-like particles to a polymer matrix will enhance the mechanical properties of the  material. The degree of enhancement depends strongly on the orientation of the fibers and the fiber orientation is in turn caused by the flow occurring in the mold.  Another important application occurs in separation of macromolecules by electrophoresis.  Modern applications include weight determination of proteins, DNA sequencing, and  diagnosis of genetic disease.  Electrophoresis involves the motion of charged particles (macromolecules) in solution, under the influence of an electric field.  The transport of particles in a shear flow plays a basic role in several applied problems, including suspension of particles in the flow of slurries, sand transport in fractured reservoirs and, on a larger scale, removal of drill cuttings in the oil industry. A final, but not less important application of particle transport, occurs in blood flow, where the blood cells, under certain flow conditions, tend to chain themselves along  the artery at certain preferred equilibrium positions.<br/>"

The GSMM Camp is a week-long meeting held annually in June and is designed to promote problem-solving and scientific communication skills.  At the Camp, graduate students work together in teams, with the guidance of a faculty mentor, on highly interdisciplinary problems typically inspired by industrial applications.  The problems span a wide range of areas of application and are carefully selected to promote a broad set of problem-solving skills.  The MPI Workshop is held during the week following the Camp, and its focus is on a set of problems brought by representatives from industry.  At the Workshop, the graduate students from the Camp are joined by postdocs and faculty, all working together in teams on the problems presented.  While the general organization of the Workshop is similar to that of the Camp the emphasis is different.  The Camp is a vehicle for graduate student education, whose aim is to build strength in problem-solving and scientific communication skills.  The problems brought to the Camp are intended to challenge, but not overwhelm, the students, and to provide a warm up for the difficult problems considered at the Workshop.  The Workshop also provides a learning experience for graduate students, but its primary goal is to promote links between applied mathematicians at universities and scientists and engineers in industry.  The two meetings compliment each other, and the combined program is highly valuable for graduate students and unique amongst universities in the U.S., and in the northeast in particular.<br/><br/>The proposed activity builds on a successful program already in place under the direction of the Principle Investigator.  The first three GSMM Camps were held at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute starting in the summer of 2004, and a fourth Camp is scheduled for June, 2007.   <br/>These Camps have attracted over one hundred outstanding graduate students, including many women and students from underrepresented groups, from top-tier universities across the U.S. and Canada.  The present grant will support the organization and graduate student participation in three more GSMM Camps beginning in the summer of 2008.  As a result of this support, the program will continue to grow and to have a broad impact on graduate student education and development.  The Camp, and the Workshop that follows, promote both depth in mathematics and the ability to understand and communicate across a variety of areas of science and engineering.  Accordingly, the Camp-Workshop combination provides a valuable experience that has a strong impact on the interdisciplinary research efforts of the participating graduate students.  The intellectual merit of the activity centers around the problems considered at the Camp and Workshop.  Some of these problems have led to follow up research and new mathematical results, and it is expected that this will continue to be an outcome of the combined problem-solving experience.  In sum, the aim of the program is to help build a stronger workforce of applied mathematicians who are both skilled in interdisciplinary research and are able to communicate effectively across a variety of areas of science and engineering.<br/><br/>"

Such systems represent viable models for predicting the response of mechanical structures when stressed beyond the elastic limit.  A new mathematical approach is considered: stochastic variational inequalities (SVI).  The stochastic process solutions of the underlying SVI are essentially continuous diffusion processes with degeneracies and state constraints, for which governing equations can be formulated to describe the evolution in time of their probability distributions.  Dissipativity of the system can be used to show existence of the corresponding invariant measure.  The uniqueness of this invariant measure and the ergodic property are conjectured to be true for classes of hysteretic systems appearing in applications.  Based on the availability of the probability distribution as the solution of the SVI, many practical issues concerning reliability of structures modeled by hysteretic systems can be answered in a systematic fashion.  Control problems for SVI are also considered, such as finding the lowest energy input excitation (the so-called critical excitation) that drives the system between prescribed initial and final states within a given time span.  Obtaining necessary conditions is a non trivial problem in view of lack of differentiability of the state equations, i.e., optimality conditions are needed for non-smooth dynamical systems.  The use of approximate penalty techniques (to remove the constraints) leads to the consideration of degenerate diffusion processes on infinite domains, with challenging questions concerning ergodicity of the corresponding process.<br/><br/>The nonlinear behavior of mechanical structures subjected to vibrations is a major concern in designing buildings or plants that must resist earthquakes, ocean waves, the wind, and other random excitations.  Many attempts have been made in the past decades, with some successes, in defining universally acceptable safety standards corresponding to potentially occurring environmental loadings.  However, the analysis of the underlying mathematics of models involved in these problems is far from complete.  The accumulated fatigue that explains the ruin of structures is a nonlinear phenomenon with memory.  By providing a thorough understanding of stochastic processes related to the responses of nonlinear systems described by stochastic variational inequalities, this research will establish a solid theoretical foundation for the study of system reliability.<br/>"

Tools that go beyond an application of necessary conditions for optimality will be utilized aiming at a full synthesis of optimal controls to gain qualitative insights into the structure of optimal protocols for these novel treatments. Based on the knowledge of optimal solutions, a quantitative assessment of simpler and potentially more practical suboptimal protocols will be given. Combinations of these novel treatment approaches with conventional ones, like chemotherapy, will also be addressed in the hope of harnessing synergistic effects. Here challenges arise both in the modeling and analysis and will need to be resolved. In this context pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs become an important aspect and generally models will be made more realistic by including these features. Mathematical complexity and biomedical relevance give double merit to this research: it enriches the understanding of important biomedical problems while it at the same time contributes to optimal control theory by developing and employing new techniques aimed at significant applications. <br/><br/>A major limiting factor in traditional cancer treatments like chemotherapy is drug resistance. Consequently there exist strong efforts in cancer research to find treatments that would not be prone to drug resistance. Two prominent new directions that are actively being pursued nowadays, both in experimental stages and clinical trials, are anti-angiogenic treatments and immunotherapy. Because of the great complexity of the underlying medical problem, in clinical trials the scheduling of drugs is typically pursued in scientifically guided exhaustive trial-and-error approaches. But more complex protocols are relatively difficult, if not impossible, or at least very expensive to test in a laboratory setting, particularly if more than one drug is involved. In this project mathematical models for these newly emerging therapies will be analyzed with the tools of modern optimal control to shed some light into the structure of theoretically optimal protocols. While these may not yet be medically realizable with current technologies, this analysis provides theoretical benchmarks to which realizable protocols can be compared and thus aids the design of more effective suboptimal therapy protocols. This is of particular importance for novel therapies for which no specific guidelines have been established yet and even more so in combination with traditional approaches like radiotherapy or chemotherapy which are being pursued in an attempt to harness synergistic effects. Due to its applied and interdisciplinary character, the project contains a substantial educational component of interest to students from various fields including Mathematics, Biology and Engineering. Existing efforts to attract women and minorities to the project will be continued."

We will particularly study mixing induced by time-periodic electroosmosis that is driven by externally applied electric fields, hence eliminating the need for mechanical pumping components.  Rapid switching between several electric field configurations will be utilized to create different flow fields, resulting in increased interspecies contact area and/or chaotic mixing.  Numerical simulations of mixing require robust algorithms that minimize the dispersion and diffusion errors.  To address this need, we will develop nonconforming spectral element algorithms using the Mortar element and constrained approximation methods.  Our approach will allow both h-type and p-type nonconformities for efficient resolution of all flow features, including the thin electric double layers. In addition to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes and species transport equation solvers, we will develop necessary algorithms to calculate the particle trajectories, Poincare sections, and other tools required to characterize the chaotic mixing and mixing efficiency. Implementation of both the Mortar element and constrained approximation methods will also allow detailed comparisons between the accuracy and computational efficiency of these two schemes.<br/><br/>In the absence of turbulence, mixing of fluids on micro-scales requires very long mixing lengths and long times.  This creates significant challenges in design of efficient mixers for micro-fluidic devices, such as micro-total-analysis-systems, utilized in detection of biological and chemical agents for medical, pharmaceutical, and national security applications.  Utilization of time-periodic electroosmosis allows design of new mixing strategies that either enhance diffusive mixing by increasing the interspecies contact area, or induce chaotic mixing.  This project will enable enhanced understanding and characterization of electroosmotically induced chaotic and diffusive mixing.  The research will facilitate development of new micro-fluidic mixing concepts, which can be implemented in design of new efficient micro-mixers for micro- and nano-fluidic applications.<br/>"

To obtain accurate predictions of the mortgage rate, a model needs to consider many state factors such as multiple factor interest rates, real estate prices, unemployment rates, etc. The conventional approach to solve such a multifactor model suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is, therefore, computationally intractable. This research will develop a computationally tractable algorithm by a fundamental shift in the formulation of the problem: instead of computing the mortgage rate that corresponds to a multidimensional state factor, the algorithm computes the set of state factors that correspond to a given mortgage rate. This approach eliminates the curse of dimensionality: the complexity of the algorithm is independent of the number of factors used to model the mortgage rate. The research will develop regression based Monte Carlo methods and a new randomized quasi-Monte Carlo sequence to implement the algorithm.<br/><br/>The accurate modeling of the mortgage rates, and thus accurate modeling of the prepayment behavior, improves the stability of the financial markets, reduces risk for mortgage investors, and, consequently, lowers mortgage rates for homeowners. At present, the common approach to model mortgage rates by the financial industry is based on a very simple heuristic: the 10-year Treasury yield plus an exogenous constant. Recent empirical evidence suggests that this heuristic is seriously flawed in certain economic situations. This research will develop a computationally efficient algorithm to solve an accurate mortgage rate model."

The membrane channels are three-dimensional tubular-like structures whose radii are much smaller than their lengths.  The ion flow is modeled by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system, which consists of at least two nonlinear parabolic equations for the sodium and calcium ion concentrations, coupled with an elliptic equation for the electric potential.  The PNP system is singularly perturbed by the presence of small physical parameters multiplying the highest-order derivatives. This project focuses on the effects of the singular parameters on the global dynamics of the PNP model.  It combines approaches from the theory of singular perturbations, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations.  The PI will (i) identify the one-dimensional limiting system of the original three-dimensional PNP system when the radius of the membrane  channel approaches zero; (ii) justify the limiting system by examining the relationship between the dynamics of the limiting system and the perturbed system; (iii) study the existence and stability of the steady state solutions of the systems; and (iv) explore the dynamics of the perturbed three-dimensional system based on the  dynamical information of the one-dimensional limiting system.<br/><br/>Ion channels exist in the membranes of all cells and control a variety of biological functions. Each channel has some specific physiological function; for instance, the movement of sodium and calcium ions through the channels plays a crucial role in conducting electrical signals down the nervous system and activating muscle contraction. Any defects in this physical chemistry process may cause human muscle disease.  Hence, studying the mechanism of ion flow through membrane channels is of importance for the practice of medicine. The objective of this project is to establish a practical mathematical model which can be justified theoretically as well as experimentally. The new system will be effective to capture the essential physiological information of charged ions and can be used by biologists to study the complicated behavior of ion flows by numerical as well as experimental approaches. The results of this research are expected to provide new treatments for diseases and hence help life. It is interesting to note that the transport process of charged particles in semiconductor devices and plasma physics is governed by the same model as ion flow through membrane channels. This suggests that the results of this project will also have potential applications in semiconductor technology and plasmas. In particular, the results can be used to design transistors and integrated circuits and control the physical behavior of these devices. Another objective of this project is to provide opportunity for training students in the related research areas.<br/>"

Techniques capable of improving the current knowledge about this problem will almost certainly be important for a variety of other essential questions concerning the Anderson model.  In the second part, the PI proposes to continue his previous research on the mathematical foundations of non-relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).  In various collaborations, he plans to study aspects of infraparticle scattering theory, and to further develop an isospectral renormalization group method for the analysis of spectral problems in quantum field theory.  In the third part, the PI plans to investigate stability questions related to the dynamics of high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems.<br/><br/>The projects presented in this proposal address three types of problems in mathematical physics. The Anderson model is widely used for the study of the quantum dynamics of electrons in random media, such as semiconductors.  Understanding its predictions on transport properties at small disorders in dimensions 2 or larger poses a major open problem, and the proposed project intends to focus on certain key multiscale aspects of it.  Non-relativistic QED describes non-relativistic quantum mechanical matter (electrons, atoms, molecules) interacting with the relativistic quantized electromagnetic radiation field (photons). It models low-energy processes in molecular physics and chemistry with excellent accuracy. Because photons are massless, electrons always bind an infinite number of low energetic (soft) photons, thus forming a bound state referred to as an infraparticle.  Accommodating the latter into the standard framework of quantum field theory is extremely difficult, because of the so-called infrared catastrophe (perturbative computations typically diverge due to the soft photon cloud). Building on previous work of the PI and his collaborators, the proposed projects intend to further develop the scattering theory of infraparticles.

While conjugacy provides a means to determine whether two systems are dynamically equivalent, there is no sufficient mathematical technology to decide when the dynamics of a ""toy"" model are like (although not identical to) the dynamics of the physical system. The concept of conjugacy is too rigid and cannot be applied in the typical situation of applied dynamical systems, where me might say that the model only ""reminds us"" of the true system.  We propose here methods based on a fixed point iteration scheme, and some variants which we will develop for broader practical numerical application, to produce a function which we call a ""commuter.""  The commuter is the conjugacy function between two equivalent dynamical systems, but a non-homeomorphic change of coordinates translating between dissimilar systems.  This translation is natural to the concepts of dynamical systems in that it matches the systems within the language of their orbit structures, and our practical computation is related to the concept of orbit equivalence from the field of symbolic dynamics. Our key method is based on measuring failure of this commuter function to be a homeomorphism - which we call homeomorphic defect.  The central point is that we compare nonequivalent systems by quantifying how much the commuter functions fails to be a homeomorphism, an approach that respects the dynamics better than the traditional methods of comparison based on Banach space norms.<br/><br/>Experts in many given fields of science will often have little difficulty in forming opinions of model quality.  For example, a cardiac specialist may agree that a certain equation may make a good model of the human heart, or the meteorologist may believe that a particular low-dimensional simulation may produce what ""looks like"" realistic weather.  Clearly there is a need to put this notion of ""approximate"" modeling on a clear mathematical footing, particularly when the models provide qualitative descriptions of real world phenomena.  Our work provides a computational method to allow researchers and scientific experts to assess which model is most suitable for their work, what modeling parameters are appropriate, or why certain models might better fit a certain physical situation.  At the heart of the work is that we provide a means to ""quantify the quality"" in a model.   This research has direct application to problems in the public health sphere, such as the development of a real-time EKG monitoring systems to detect abnormal cardiac heart rhythms, to better characterizing models of the weather, to improve our understanding of turbulence in fluid flow systems, and to finer design of structural mechanical systems such as those found in aircraft wings and bridges.<br/><br/>"

Examples include the gravitational field modeling, geomagnetism, helioseismology, astronomy, cosmology, and seismology. In most applications the functions on the sphere have been traditionally represented in terms of spherical harmonics. The nature of spherical harmonics as global functions, however, creates problems. The spherical harmonic representations rely on delicate cancellation/interference of spherical harmonics and are slowly convergent. The existing representations on the ball using orthogonal polynomials or other methods have the same drawbacks or are even worse. The primary objective of this project is to develop innovative multiscale data representations on the sphere and on the ball based on newly created wavelet type systems, called ""needlets"". The needlet system on the sphere consists of almost exponentially localized radial band-limited functions, which are automatically extendable to harmonic functions in the exterior of the sphere and thereby enabling needlet representations to provide a highly effective framework for representation and analysis of harmonic functions such as the gravitational potential. The needlet compatibility with spherical harmonics permits for fast conversions between needlet and spherical harmonic representations. This makes them easy to integrate into the existing models based on spherical harmonics. Furthermore, the superb localization of needlets at fine scales makes needlet-based models highly amenable to efficient local updates, which is a significant advantage over traditional models based on spherical harmonics. The needlet system on the ball has a similar structure and consists of almost exponentially localized algebraic polynomials. Theoretical results show that the new representations are superior to the existing mono- and multiscale methods used in these areas. An important element of the proposed research is the employment of nonlinear approximation methods for effective representation and approximation of functions from needlets. These are multilevel techniques which allow control of the uniform (or other) norm of the error of approximation. Another step forward will be the development of anisotropic elements on the sphere and ball (e.g. curvlets) for better extraction of curvlinear features of the data.<br/><br/>The targeted applications of this research are mainly in the domain of geodesy. Most geodetic applications rely on the ability to compute accurately the gravitational (disturbing) potential. This project will pursue the implementation of multiscale needlet representations for modeling of the gravitational potential. Other potential applications of the new representations are in geomagnetism, helioseismology, astronomy, cosmology, seismology, where spherical harmonic representations are widely used. An important goal of this project is to promote the broad utilization of the new representations in other diverse disciplines (from geophysics to high-speed videoendoscopy) and to stimulate interest in younger mathematicians to this area. This research project offers an excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students at the University of South Carolina to participate in testing ideas for further development."

The technique requires the development and implementation of diverse modern tools of pure and applied mathematics, namely, the conformal mapping method, the Schwarz reflection principle, the theory of symmetric Schottky groups, and the theory of the Riemann-Hilbert boundary-value problem on Riemann surfaces and for symmetric automorphic functions.<br/><br/>Hydrodynamic cavitation is defined as the breakdown of a liquid under low pressure.  Cavitation causes  wall erosion, alters hydrofoil performance (reduces lift and increases drag of a hydrofoil for example) and produces noise and vibration.  Cavitation has long been of interest not only in the field of shipbuilding and hydraulic machinery, but also because of its positive effects in chemical processing (electrolytic deposition and the production of emulsions), physics (dispersion of particles in a fluid) and medicine (bacteria destruction from the surfaces of equipment, therapeutic massage and potential bioeffects of ultrasound caused by acoustic cavitation in blood vessels).

The ever-increasing need for improved accuracy leads to very large-scale and complex dynamical systems. Simulations in such large-scale settings can overwhelm computational resources; this is the main motivation for model reduction. The goal is to produce a simpler reduced-order model approximating the original one as accurately as possible. The resulting reduced model can then be used as an efficient surrogate to the original, to replace it in a larger simulation or to develop a simpler and faster controller suitable for real time applications. Krylov-based methods have emerged as promising candidates for model reduction in realistic large-scale settings. This project seeks to develop optimal, robust, and systematic Krylov-based projection methods for efficient construction of high fidelity and optimal reduced-order models. By carefully employing inexact solves in a Krylov-based model reduction setting, the proposed research will extend these optimal reduction techniques to realistic settings with millions of degrees of freedom while maintaining the same quality of the error measures with respect to the exact rational Krylov subspaces. In addition, systematic approaches will be developed for the design of fast and effective, low-order optimal controllers, and more generally, for reduction of interconnected (coupled) systems. The project will apply the newly developed methods to several test problems drawn from different application areas.<br/><br/>Large-scale simulations and computations play a crucial role in studying a great variety of complex physical phenomena in many areas of computational science and engineering. Examples include signal propagation and interference in electric circuits, molecular dynamics, weather forecasting, wave propagation and vibration suppression in large structures, temperature control in various media, and behavior of micro-electro-mechanical systems. Computing in large-scale settings leads to unmanageably large demands on the nation's computational resources; hence there is a growing need to approximate the complex dynamical systems with simpler, high fidelity models that will make these simulations much easier and faster to compute. This project seeks to develop techniques that will yield optimal, high fidelity approximations of complex systems; leading at once to simulations that are more rapid yet still reliable. The mathematical tools and high-quality software that will be developed through the course of this project will contribute to research efforts of scientist and engineers working with large-scale, complex multi-physics problems. In addition to the research component, this project offers a comprehensive education plan that consists of the supervision of undergraduate and graduate students; development of a graduate course; and several interdisciplinary research projects available for introducing students in a variety of areas of high-performance scientific computing.<br/><br/>"

The probability densities of the marginals are to be determined as the sampling proceeds, using an expansion in successive linkages similar to the one used in Kadanoff's real-space renormalization. Two implementations will be explored: in one the target density and a series of its marginals will be sampled in parallel, with occasional swaps among the several parallel computations, relying on the shorter correlation times of the marginals to accelerate convergence; in the other, a single sweep from the smallest to the largest subset with available marginals will be effected, with a correction step based on an assignment of weights; this last implementation will have exactly zero temporal correlation time. At this point it is not clear which of the two may be more efficient, though it is reasonable to assume that this depends on the application. The first application will be a computer study of the three-dimensional Anderson-Edwards near-neighbors spin glass model. The second application will be to filtering and data assimilation for stochastic partial differential equations. A more distant goal is the development of more efficient training techniques for neural networks.<br/><br/>In many problems of physics and of statistics it is necessary to sample complicated probability distributions with a very large number of variables. Current methods often fail because the successive samples they produce fail to be sufficiently independent. The present proposal suggests solving this problem by creating a sequence of successively simpler problems, in such a way that the sampling of each one makes it easier to sample the next harder one; the heart of the proposal is a methodology for making this procedure self-consistent. The first application of the idea, if it is successful, will be to the analysis of a spin glass model; this is a problem of great interest in material science, and as it is known to be very hard to sample, it is a good testing ground for the methods here. The next application will be to data assimilation; this problem arises when one tries to make predictions on the basis of a partial theory and noisy observations, as one often has to do in many fields, for example in weather forecasting or in economics; the difficulty in sampling large arrays of data is often a major roadblock in this type of situation. The spin glass model is closely related to models useful in neural networks and in neurology, and a more distant goal is to use the methods developed here in these exciting areas.<br/>"

These asymptotic problems arise when a dimensionless parameter (such as the Reynolds number or the ratio between the electron thermal speed and the speed of light) goes to zero or to infinity.  In studying these problems, many mathematical difficulties arise.  These difficulties are mainly   due to the change of the type of the equations, the presence of many temporal and spatial scales, the presence of resonances, the presence of boundary layers, ... .  Many tools have been developed to circumvent these difficulties such as the introduction of different types of measures to describe the defect of strong convergence, the use of compensated compactness type arguments, the use of averaging lemma, the use of energy methods and relative entropy methods, ... .  New tools will be developed in this work. Hopefully, they can be applied to other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>The study of these problems is very important to get a better understanding about the behavior of complicated systems in different limiting cases. This also allows an improved understanding of the real physical phenomena taking place.  It also gives a better knowledge about the domain of validity of each simplifying model. This is very important for engineers and physicists who are looking for the simplest model that captures the phenomena to implement numerically or to apply in real life.  One of these problems is the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann equation when the Knudsen number goes to 0 especially in bounded domains.  Formally, the limit equation (Euler system, Navier-Stokes, ...) depends on additional  parameters such as the Mach number, the Reynolds number and the  time scaling.  In particular, one of the goals of the project is to understand fluid boundary conditions from kinetic ones. This is a step towards understanding the coupling at the boundary between fluid equations and kinetic equations.  Of course this is a very important question for numerical simulations when we have to go from a domain where a kinetic model is being used to a domain where a fluid model is being used.  Besides, another goal of this project is the study of some non-Newtonian fluids and especially polymeric liquids (egg white, blood or dough for example).  These systems require a coupling between fluids and polymers and are of great interest in many branches of applied physics, chemistry and biology.<br/>"

Examples of such rare events include phenomena as diverse as nucleation events during phase transitions, chemical reactions, conformation changes of biomolecules, or bistable behaviors in genetic switches. The study of these rare events requires going beyond Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations, which in mathematics has been the traditional tool to analyze rare events. It also requires integrating the theory within a computational perspective, which is necessary since traditional numerical tools such as Monte Carlo or direct simulation of SDEs are highly ineffective for rare events. Here the PI proposes to do so by (i) generalizing the theoretical framework of Transition Path Theory (TPT), which allows one to describe the statistical mechanics of rare events in situations when large deviation theory does not apply, and (ii) developing associated numerical algorithms such as the String Method for the effective computation of the various objects in TPT (like the probability density of reactive trajectories, their probability current and flux, and the rate of the reaction).<br/><br/>The excitement of using molecular dynamics as a tool to do biology stems for the fact that it would enable us to understand the behavior of biomolecules such as protein, enzymes, ion channels, etc. from the ""jiggling and wiggling""  of the atoms they are made of (to quote Richard Feynman).  This would allow for a much deeper understanding of their function and one that goes beyond what is currently achievable via experiments (in which it is hard or impossible to resolve the actual dynamics of the atoms).  But this objective comes with tremendous challenges. While biomolecules are tiny objects from our perspective, they are also huge in that they are typically made of thousands of atoms (hundreds of thousands if one accounts for the molecules of solvent surrounding them). Since these atoms move very fast, the equations of motion governing their evolution must be integrated on the computer using a very small time step--typically of the order of one femtosec (1 femtosec = 1e-15 sec = 0.000000000000001 sec). Every such time step takes some time because it involves updating the position of so many atoms. As a result, it is only possible to simulate directly the motion of a typical biomolecule such as Hemoglobin over a few nanoseconds (1 nanosec = 1e-9 sec = 0.000000001 sec).  Such a calculation already takes several days on a large computer.  This, however, is a problem because the motion of these large molecules which governs their actual function only arise on a much slower time scale, typically of the order of the microseconds or even more (1 microsec = 1e-6 sec =  0.000001 sec). This is because such motion typically involves reactive events, e.g. large-scale reorganization of the shape of the molecule, which are very rare on the time scale of the molecule (though obviously, they are not on our own daily time scale). The direct simulation of any such reactive event would typically require years of computations, which is neither affordable nor practical. On the other hand, various techniques have been designed recently to bypass this difficulty and describe statistically (rather than on a one to one basis) the reactive events. This proposal is about developing these techniques, first at a theoretical level then by exploiting  the theory to design efficient numerical algorithms for the computation of the reactive events which are so important in molecular biology.<br/><br/>"

There are many problems in which the physically observed coarsening timescales are controversial, for instance certain epitaxial growth experiments; a better understanding of the connection between the statics and dynamics of complex energy landscapes can lend insight into these problems.  Rare events, on the other hand, are in some sense the opposite extreme:  How and at what rate does thermal noise drive systems away from energy minimizers?  This work applies to problems in nanoscale magnetic memory devices, as well as diverse problems in chemistry and biology.  Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities describe the trend to equilibrium in spin systems, and may be useful in the analysis of certain multi-scale numerical algorithms.  Finally, thermal convection processes are important in a wide range of areas, including engineering, meteorology, oceanography, and astrophysics.

The goals are: to develop a theory of finite-length LDPC codes and  provide a comparison between different codes having related algebraic structures; to unify relevant notions like near-codewords, pseudo-codewords, girth, minimum distance, minimum pseudo-weight by studying the effect that each has on the others; to derive lower and upper bounds on the performance of LDPC block and convolutional codes based on these parameters and their influences; and to ultimately provide guidelines for designing finite-length LDPC codes that have predictably good performance under iterative decoding.<br/><br/>The inclusion of LDPC block codes in emerging standards such as digital video broadcasting, Ethernet and third-generation (3G) mobile-telephone networks, which will allow wireless access from 3G phones to be over ten times faster than from an old-fashioned dial-up, has recently spurred interest in LDPC convolutional codes. Initial research on LDPC convolutional codes leads the PI to the belief that these codes have several potential practical advantages compared to LDPC block codes.  The goal of this project is to analyze these codes and construct new ones with predictably good performance. This research will naturally integrate abstract theory and real-world applications, providing exciting opportunities for cross-cutting research. The PI's continuing collaboration with leading engineering experts from academia and industry enables a transition from the theoretical research findings in this project to practical communication systems. It is anticipated that the project will have an impact on the future information infrastructure and contribute to universal accessibility. This impact will extend to the areas of data compression and communication protocols and security, since their underlying theories are closely related to coding theory.<br/><br/>"

These solutions describe new shock-free waves that propagate through an oscillating entropy field without breaking or dissipating,  and thereby give a theoretical basis for the possibility of dissipation free, long- distance signaling.  The waves transmit information according to a fundamentally new mechanism---compression and rarefaction are balanced along every characteristic,  the waves propagate at a new speed, (different from a shock or sound speed), and sound waves move through periods  at speeds that can be commensurate or incommensurate with the period.  The period determines the speed of the wave crests, (a sort of observable group velocity), but the sound waves move at a faster speed, the usual speed of sound, and this is like a phase  velocity.   Part I of this proposal is concerned with both the  <br/>mathematical investigation and numerical simulation of these new  waves.    In particular, the mathematics shows that the waves can be  computed by a perturbation series which is given in closed form starting from linearized solutions that display the structure of the nonlinear waves, and this is the basis for a proposed numerical  simulation.   Part II  addresses problems of shock-wave propagation in General Relativity (GR).  This includes a program to numerically simulate a physically realistic cosmological shock-wave that could arise from Guth's well known inflationary spacetime.  The point of departure here is prior joint work with PI's collaborator Joel Smoller in which we introduced a physically believable, mathematically rigorous  shock-wave  refinement of the Standard Model of Cosmology.   We propose to  numerically refine this model by incorporating a more realistic equation of state and thereby resolve secondary waves in the problem.  Our goal is to use this accurate simulation as a baseline  for comparison with observational data.   Part II also addresses  shock-wave propagation and black hole formation in GR, and Part III concerns resonant interactions  in classical fluids.<br/><br/>The compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics resulted from Leonard Euler's successful attempt in 1752 to complete Newton's program to give a correct version of the Newtonian laws of motion  <br/>that apply to continuous media.   For Euler, these equations  represented the nonlinear theory of sound waves.   Euler's great  achievement was to derive the nonlinear equations from physical principles, and then to show that in the limit of weak signals the theory recovered D'Alembert's principle that sound waves were approximately sinusoidal  oscillations in the pressure that propagate according to the linear wave equation.  Thus our new construction of sound waves for the fully nonlinear equations in Part I resolves in the affirmative the most basic question one would ask about the nonlinear theory of sound waves---do the nonlinear equations support oscillatory solutions that propagate like the sinusoidal waves of the linear wave equation?  Interestingly, these solutions appear to be ubiquitous, despite two centuries of work suggesting that such time periodic solutions might not be mathematically possible. The PI believes that an understanding of these new waves will have a significant impact, and may well change our point of view regarding the fundamental wave propagation mechanisms in nonlinear hyperbolic systems.  When Einstein's ideas about time and space are incorporated into the compressible Euler equations, one is led to general relativity and the Einstein equations for a perfect fluid.  In Part II, our proposed numerical simulation of a possible cosmic shock wave, is motivated by our idea that a secondary (rarefaction) wave,  <br/>that would be reflected back from the shock in the refined model, might account for the anomalous acceleration of the galaxies within classical GR, without the cosmological constant.   If our model is  <br/>correct, then the universe after the Big Bang begins inside a White Hole, (the time reversal of a Black Hole in which everything is exploding outward), and eventually evolves into something similar to the late stages of a classical, localized explosion: a finite mass of bounded extent, evolving behind an outgoing shock wave, all expanding into an empty space beyond.<br/>"

One such instability is buckling. <br/>Buckling is ubiquitous and very important in engineering and<br/>mechanics.  Modern engineering models of buckling, though very<br/>successful, are not related to 3D hyperelasticity, which is<br/>supposed to contain a description of all elastic phenomena,<br/>including buckling.  The project initiates a systematic study of<br/>all elastic instabilities, putting buckling in its proper setting<br/>within a general theory.  Another interesting and important<br/>instability studied by the project is nucleation of a new phase<br/>in martensitic phase transitions.  This study is also related to<br/>rate-independent hysteresis -- an unexpected phenomenon of<br/>history dependence, that does not yet have a universally<br/>agreed-upon explanation.  The energy-based model of martensitic<br/>phase transformations was very successful at predicting many<br/>aspects of behavior of shape memory alloys.  Hysteresis, however,<br/>could be explained by this model only if one assumes that the<br/>material ""gets stuck"" in metastable states, modeled as local<br/>energy minima.  The project provides a hitherto missing general<br/>tool for identifying metastable states, allowing one to construct<br/>and analyze continuum mechanical models with hysteresis<br/>quantitatively on the basis of the energy-minimization principle.<br/><br/>     This project aims to advance our understanding of<br/>nonlinearly elastic materials, such as polymers and rubbers and<br/>materials with shape memory effect.  When loads are applied to<br/>these materials, they deform in such a way as to minimize the<br/>total energy stored in the deformed system.  When the loads<br/>increase, the nonlinear nature of these materials often manifests<br/>itself in the appearance of new ways to decrease the energy. <br/>When this happens, physicists talk of instabilities.  One of the<br/>most common instabilities is buckling, which occurs when the load<br/>on a slender column exceeds a certain critical value.  Recent<br/>work of the investigator with Lev Truskinovsky produced a new<br/>understanding of buckling that is used in this project to explore<br/>new methods of computing buckling loads for structures with<br/>complex geometries, such as elastic shells and composite<br/>materials.

Applications include optimal design of periodic structures in diffractive optics technology.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is motivated by significant engineering applications in nano-composite materials science.  Efficient thermal insulators can be created by proper designing of nano-composite materials, which, at the macroscale, commonly exhibit anisotropy.  For such a material, the principal Dirichlet eigenvalue of the corresponding elliptic operator can be used to measure the thermal insulation effectiveness.  The user-friendly estimates developed in this project of Dirichlet eigenvalues will be helpful in designing better nano-composite thermal insulators and in understanding the thermal tensor when its analytic formula is not available. This work extends studies of the practical problem of protecting an isotropic conductor (e.g., a space shuttle) from overheating by an anisotropic coating; an easy-to-use rule for the optimal thickness of the coating required has been obtained.  This rule is potentially widely applicable in thermal engineering.  The second part of the project addresses measurement of the strength of diffusion in a well-insulated container.

A focus of the proposal is on techniques for the design of robots and mechanisms where the objective is to find the exceptional parameter values so that the device they represent has particular motion characteristics. These techniques, which will apply to parameterized polynomial systems generally, such as may arise in computer graphics, chemistry, robot vision, and other engineering and scientific disciplines, lead to systems of polynomials that are large in comparison to the systems presently being solved.

The former is an artificial mathematical construct; the latter are ubiquitous in the sciences, where they represent conservation of mass, momentum, energy, etc. in many situations.  Building on their earlier work,   <br/>Lin and Schecter propose to complete their analysis of the spectrum of the linearized Dafermos operator.  They propose to use this analysis to determine the stability of Riemann solutions as asymptotic states of viscous conservation laws.   They also propose to investigate related issues that have arisen in the course of this work, including possible generalizations of the Exchange Lemma of geometric singular perturbation theory; extensions to third- and fourth-order regularizations of conservation laws; and a new approach to stability of Riemann solutions of systems of conservation laws without viscosity.<br/><br/>In many areas of science and technology, various situations involving fluid flow, such as oil recovery and flow of thin liquid films used in manufacturing, can be mathematically modeled by equations called viscous conservation laws.  The models become more tractable when one drops various terms, leaving only a system of conservation laws.  For these equations one can often construct explicit solutions called Riemann solutions, that frequently involve jumps that move with varying speeds.  An example from oil recovery using injection of water is a moving front that is mostly water on one side and mostly oil on the other; the water pushes the oil toward the well.  One reason Riemann solutions are important is that it is believed that in many situations, solutions of viscous conservation laws, appropriately rescaled, tend to look more and more like Riemann solutions as time goes on.  However, there are only a few, rather artificial situations is which this behavior is proved.  A related fact is that we do not have good mathematical techniques to check whether Riemann solutions are stable, i.e., are really approached for a significant set of initial configurations of the viscous conservation laws.  Lin and Schecter have developed a new approach to these issues using a different simplification of the viscous conservation laws, the so-called Dafermos regularization.  This equation admits a smoothed-out version of the Riemann solution as a steady-state.  In principle, one can check its stability by relatively familiar mathematical methods.  Lin and Schecter plan to continue their work on the stability of these smoothed Riemann solutions, and to use this work to approach the physically relevant situation.<br/><br/>"

In a simplified model, cluster growth is a<br/>discrete stochastic process of adding or shedding monomers, one<br/>at a time.  The Becker-Doring (BD) ordinary differential<br/>equations govern the growth of small clusters by surface<br/>reactions.  Large clusters, growing by the diffusion of the<br/>surrounding monomers, are described by the Lifshitz-Slyozov<br/>equations.  Small clusters nucleate and form large ones by a slow<br/>process caused by fluctuations over a free-energy barrier.  The<br/>investigator, Joseph Farjoun, studies the following aspects of<br/>nucleation:<br/> (a) The Zeldovich nucleation formula disagrees with the<br/>experimental results.  It is highly sensitive to the<br/>super-saturation's value, and hence on the distribution of<br/>cluster-sizes.  The investigator seeks a more accurate formula by<br/>resolving the super-saturation to higher order.  In addition, a<br/>simulation based on renormalized Monte-Carlo methods is providing<br/>more data on the nucleation rate. <br/> (b) The long-term distribution of clusters sizes, as determined<br/>by the Zeldovich nucleation rate and LS growth rate, is a<br/>classical problem.  The investigator studies a connection to the<br/>smooth similarity-solution: A deeper analysis of the partial<br/>answer in his PhD thesis. <br/> (c) The analysis of 2-dimensional nucleation is a natural<br/>extension of the work in the investigator's PhD thesis.  The<br/>logarithmic behavior of monomer concentration about nuclei in<br/>2-dimensions forces the nucleation process to be spatially<br/>non-homogeneous.  The investigator studies this by connecting to<br/>previous work on 2-dimensional diffusion. <br/> (d) The investigator studies the dynamic dependency of the<br/>aggregation process on other physical parameters.  Specifically,<br/>he analyzes aggregation in a system with a varying temperature. <br/>The nucleation rate and the total amount of clusters formed are<br/>determined by a balance between the decreasing temperature and<br/>the depletion of monomers, which have competing effects on the<br/>super-saturation. <br/><br/>     Phenomena that are modeled by aggregation -- solidification,<br/>precipitation, and the condensation of vapor into droplets --<br/>appear in many biophysical and industrial contexts:<br/>Glass-to-crystal transformations, crystal nucleation in<br/>under-cooled liquids, and in polymers, colloidal crystallization,<br/>growth of spherical aggregates beyond the critical micelle<br/>concentration (CMC), and the segregation by coarsening of binary<br/>alloys quenched into the miscibility gap, to name but a few<br/>specific examples.  The field of micro-chip fabrication stands to<br/>benefit greatly from a theory capable of predicting the short-<br/>and long-term behavior of 2-dimensional clusters.  Resolving the<br/>long-standing disagreement between the Zeldovich formula (which<br/>predicts the rate at which clusters are created) and the<br/>experiments, finding the time-scales of the various phases of the<br/>aggregation process, and a theory for 2-dimensional aggregation<br/>(all of which are topics of research in this project) allows for<br/>more accurate predictions and better design.  A more realistic<br/>model, which accounts for the varying temperature, can be used in<br/>the design of vapor-forming industries (e.g. power plants), and<br/>in weather prediction.  The current state of the art in<br/>aggregation is that of extremes: the behavior at very short and<br/>very long times, the behavior of very small or very large<br/>clusters have been studied extensively.  In this project, the<br/>work of the investigator, Joseph Farjoun, bridges these gaps. <br/>"

Such behavior has been of interest to engineers and physicists for at least a hundred years and has been a pressing concern of mathematicians working in fluids for at least half of that time. There is much practical knowledge about the boundary behavior, but little precise mathematical understanding. The proposal is to investigate the boundary behavior of the fluid in the limited setting of a two dimensional bounded domain, focusing on a disk, where important aspects of the analysis are simplified, but where the behavior is still physically relevant. The goal is to strengthen existing partial results concerning the boundary behavior of the fluid and to attempt to integrate the partially heuristic methods of engineers and physicists into a mathematical setting.<br/><br/>Many fluids have reasonably low viscosity and nearly all fluids are in contact with a boundary. How is the flow of blood affected by imperfections in vessel walls? How is the lift of a wing determined by its shape? How do a submarine's propellers induce turbulence when running at certain speeds? In all of these problems and many more the flow of the fluid can be constrained by the interaction of the fluid with the boundary in ways that are currently only partially understood. Almost any progress that can be made in the understanding of this interaction would ultimately be beneficial in addressing all of these problems, whether by giving better control on the error bounds in numerical computations, by giving a qualitative understanding of the interaction, or even by demonstrating that the boundary behavior is even more complex than is currently believed.<br/>"

The basic idea of IS to simulate the system under a different probability distribution, and correct for biasedness via the likelihood ratio. During the last three decades, most of the IS schemes that were developed were based on heuristics, and led to algorithms with questionable performance.  In contrast, this research project develops a systematic methodology for the construction of simple, efficient IS schemes for broad classes of process models.  This approach capitalizes on the intimate connection between IS and a related differential game.  It turns out that subsolutions to the Isaacs equation associated with the game can be used to build IS schemes whose performance can be rigorously characterized.  The investigators are particularly interested in developing both theoretical and practical aspects of importance sampling in the areas of stochastic networks, metastability analysis, systems with discontinuous dynamics, small noise diffusions, counting problems, analysis of higher-order moments of IS estimators, and heavy-tailed distributions.  The project will also study the use of subsolutions for the construction and analysis of fast simulation methods based on branching processes, such as splitting and RESTART.<br/><br/>Rare events, such as transitions between stable wells in a model from chemical physics, data loss in a highly reliable communication system, or unexpectedly large payouts in insurance claims, are often key quantitative measures of a system's overall behavior.  They also play a central role in risk assessment and management.  Reliable numerical methods are required in order to design systems and protocols that can minimize and mitigate the negative effects of rare events.  The main technique for the fast simulation of rare events is importance sampling.  Importance sampling algorithms have been developed over the last thirty years for many different application areas.  However, the development to date has been largely ad hoc and without a proper theoretical foundation.  Practitioners have relied on a few rudimentary heuristics in constructing importance sampling algorithms.  The performance of these schemes was supported by limited numerical evidence, and unfortunately recent work has shown that these heuristics are in general unreliable.  This project brings new ideas from probability theory and tools from game theory and partial differential equations to the problem of design and analysis of importance sampling schemes.  The work aims to develop systematic methods for the construction and rigorous analysis of reliable algorithms.<br/>"

Based on the knowledge of optimal solutions, a quantitative assessment of simpler and potentially more practical suboptimal protocols will be given. Combinations of these novel treatment approaches with conventional ones, like chemotherapy, will also be addressed in the hope of harnessing synergistic effects. Here challenges arise both in the modeling and analysis and will need to be resolved. In this context pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs become an important aspect and generally models will be made more realistic by including these features. Mathematical complexity and biomedical relevance give double merit to this research: it enriches the understanding of important biomedical problems while it at the same time contributes to optimal control theory by developing and employing new techniques aimed at significant applications. <br/><br/>A major limiting factor in traditional cancer treatments like chemotherapy is drug resistance. Consequently there exist strong efforts in cancer research to find treatments that would not be prone to drug resistance. Two prominent new directions that are actively being pursued nowadays, both in experimental stages and clinical trials, are anti-angiogenic treatments and immunotherapy. Because of the great complexity of the underlying medical problem, in clinical trials the scheduling of drugs is typically pursued in scientifically guided exhaustive trial-and-error approaches. But more complex protocols are relatively difficult, if not impossible, or at least very expensive to test in a laboratory setting, particularly if more than one drug is involved. In this project mathematical models for these newly emerging therapies will be analyzed with the tools of modern optimal control to shed some light into the structure of theoretically optimal protocols. While these may not yet be medically realizable with current technologies, this analysis provides theoretical benchmarks to which realizable protocols can be compared and thus aids the design of more effective suboptimal therapy protocols. This is of particular importance for novel therapies for which no specific guidelines have been established yet and even more so in combination with traditional approaches like radiotherapy or chemotherapy which are being pursued in an attempt to harness synergistic effects.

Unfortunately, the growth of planar strained<br/>films is susceptible to instabilities.  These instabilities are<br/>often manifested by the formation of surface ripples, surface<br/>cusps, and island-like mounds such as quantum dots and quantum<br/>wires.  The demand for films with precisely tailored micro- and<br/>nanostructures has led to an extensive literature concerned with<br/>morphological instabilities during the epitaxy of thin alloy<br/>films.  To date, attention has focused primarily on instabilities<br/>that arise from a mismatch in lattice parameters between the film<br/>and the substrate and surface diffusion.  However, interfacial<br/>stress, which may strongly influence the formation of surface<br/>patterns, has received almost no attention.  Moreover, because of<br/>the geometric complications associated with the description of<br/>evolving surfaces in three space dimensions, studies of<br/>growth-stress interactions have thus far confined attention to<br/>two-dimensional theories, wherein the interface is a curve. <br/>Additionally, no theory yet accounts for the influence of surface<br/>stress on phase segregation and related pattern formation,<br/>processes that occur during epitaxy.

For instance, in the<br/>electronics industry, epitaxially grown multi-layers have been<br/>used to increase the storage capacity of hard drives and are now<br/>being studied for possible improvements.

Much of the present focus of the field is on fully three-dimensional imaging, stimulated by major algorithmic advances in recent years. <br/>Shannon sampling theory provides exact interpolation formulas for band-limited functions and plays a fundamental role in signal processing. It is used in tomography to identify efficient sampling schemes that allow for maximum resolution in the reconstructed images, as well as for error analysis of reconstruction algorithms.  The research proposed in this project lies in the intersection of these areas and is motivated by applications. Its interconnected themes include the derivation of new sampling theorems; optimal data acquisition in 3D tomography; mathematically rigorous and practically useful analysis of  recently developed 3D tomographic algorithms; local tomography in two and three dimensions; high-resolution reconstructions; and the close interaction of tomographic reconstruction with image processing, motivated by the experience that high-resolution reconstructions often carry more noise and can be further improved by state of the art  image processing. In pursuing these themes the project will place an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration.<br/><br/><br/>Computed x-ray tomography (CT) is an increasingly popular technique for two- and three-dimensional (3D) imaging of opaque objects.  An object is irradiated and the image is computed from measurements of the transmitted radiation.  Beyond its famous use in medical imaging, tomography has found an increasing number of applications in science, engineering, and technology. The research undertaken in this project will contribute to make this technique even more efficient. It will develop and use Shannon type sampling theorems to identify optimal data acquisition schemes for 3D tomography and to analyze and improve algorithms for image reconstruction and image processing. This will contribute to the development of fully three-dimensional image reconstruction methods that require a minimal number of measurements and have high accuracy, optimal resolution, and minimal noise. The general approach taken in this project aims to unite research on fundamentals with interdisciplinary efforts driven directly by practical challenges presented by users of tomography.

Because of the magnetic interactions between the<br/>particles, these materials are magnetostrictive and their<br/>mechanical response can be modified smoothly and reversibly in<br/>real time.  Conversely, the presence of strain in these materials<br/>can be detected by induced changes in the overall magnetization. <br/>Although ""macroscopic"" (continuum mechanics) approaches for MREs<br/>have been in existence since the 1950s, more ""microscopic""<br/>theories with truly predictive capabilities are much more recent<br/>and so far have been restricted to the linear (infinitesimal<br/>strain) regime.  The investigator develops nonlinear<br/>homogenization techniques and applies them to generate<br/>constitutive models for magnetorheological elastomers that are<br/>valid in the finite-strain regime.  This builds on earlier work by<br/>the investigator for reinforced elastomers and uses extensions of<br/>variational ""linear comparison"" homogenization techniques that<br/>have been developed previously.  At the theoretical level, the<br/>models account for: (i) the strongly nonlinear response of the<br/>constituents, including nonlinear ferrolectric behavior for the<br/>particles, as well as nonlinear mechanical response for the<br/>elastomeric matrix, (ii) microstructural information, such as<br/>particle shape and orientation, as well as their spatial and<br/>orientational distribution, (iii) coupled magnetoelastic<br/>constitutive behavior, and (iv) finite deformations.

The existence of Stokes waves of extremal form and their geometric properties will be established.  The second aspect is the Cauchy problem for water waves.  This problem will be viewed as a system of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations, and a priori estimates for long-time behavior of solutions will be obtained.  The third aspect is the hydrodynamic stability of equilibria of water waves.  A sharp criterion for linearized instablility will be obtained for a general class of free-surface gravity shear flows and small-amplitude rotational Stokes waves of finite depth.  Stability and instability of other free-surface Euler equations such as generalized vortex patches will be established.<br/><br/>Water waves are a prime example of applied mathematics describing wave motions of the kind which may be observed in the ocean, ranging in size from ripples to tsunamis or freak (rogue) waves.

A key objective of the proposed research is to develop new methodologies and mathematical theories in the rigorous analysis of the mathematical problem which models free-surface water waves. Results from the proposed project will enhance our understanding of the dynamics of the ocean wave currents, and they will help engineering designs and numerical simulations.

Applications can be found in coating and cooling problems where liquid films are used to enhance heat or mass transfer, and fluid management in microfluidics devices (for example lithographically induced self-assembly technologies).  Highly viscous flows are considered because inertia is absent in many important applications. The problems are nonlinear and mathematically challenging because they require the simultaneous solution of the equations of fluid mechanics and of the Maxwell equations. Two basic mathematical approaches are developed. The first is a fully nonlinear numerical method based on a  boundary integral equation formulation. This leads to a large system of integral equations which describe the motion and the electric field in each fluid. These equations are coupled by nonlinear boundary conditions and a stable numerical method is derived. The second approach is an asymptotic method based on long wave approximations. It leads to simpler partial differential equations whose range of validity is determined by comparing solutions with those obtained by the first approach. Analysis and computations will be used to solve for the spatio-temporal evolution of electrified coating flows over flat and variable substrates as well as the evolution of microfluidic layers under the action of electric fields in the presence of topographically structured electrodes. Of major interest is the use of electric fields to manipulate the interfacial evolution and possible robust coherent structures such as nonlinear steady- or large-time states.<br/><br/>In the high-tech world of ever decreasing machinery sizes and their components, it is vitally important to be able to construct models and study fundamental aspects of different processes. A mathematical model that can be put on a computer and solved, provides us with a rare opportunity to perform numerical experiments rather than laboratory experiments which can be both time consuming and expensive. The mathematical/computational model becomes an exploratory tool to refine the design of existing processes and at the same time to probe new regimes efficiently. It is important to produce valid mathematical models and resolve them accurately using computers.  The present study develops and studies such models with applications in coating of microelectronic components and the production of micro- and nano-sized structures in microelectronics applications.  Many components are coated with a liquid which solidifies to form the desired surface (e.g. DVD disks).  Any waves that form at the liquid surface and then get inherited in the final product after solidification, produce defects and degrade performance.   This study examines, theoretically, ways to control such features.  It also examines models that describe the formation of nano-sized features on microelectronic devices that can be used to produce micro-chips. The goal is to study and produce a theoretical protocol to control the waves that form during the liquid phase and before solidification.<br/>"

Both come with nontrivial modeling, theoretical,<br/>and computational challenges.  The first part of the project<br/>deals with an extension of the stochastic programming and<br/>variational analysis methodology to deal with a large class of<br/>variational problems in a stochastic environment, which could be<br/>called stochastic equilibrium problems.  They include variational<br/>inequalities, cooperative and noncooperative games, Walras-type<br/>equilibria, solving inclusions, and fixed point problems, when<br/>some of the components of the problem are stochastic.  The goal<br/>here is to develop a theory that leads to implementable numerical<br/>procedures.  The second part of the project deals with making the<br/>methodology of stochastic programming more accessible to a wider<br/>range of users, namely with the design of procedures that allow<br/>the user to describe the uncertainty when only (very) limited<br/>data are available about the random parameters.  This is<br/>particularly critical when the uncertainty is to be revealed over<br/>time (or space) and the decision maker can use this information<br/>to select recourse (adjusting) decisions. <br/><br/>     Almost all important decision-making problems, except<br/>possibly a few that are purely technical in nature, involve some<br/>level of uncertainty about some of the parameters or components<br/>of the problem.  For example,<br/> (a) setting monetary or economic policy requires taking into<br/> account uncertainty in the economic and financial markets,<br/> (b) selecting a master scheduling plan in manufacturing requires<br/> taking into account uncertainty in the market's response,<br/> (c) the choice of an environmental protection plan needs to<br/> balance changing atmospheric conditions with sociological and<br/> economic impacts, all involving various uncertainties,<br/> (d) policies issues related to energy supply require taking<br/> into account world market price vagaries as well as potential<br/> technological innovations,<br/>and so on.  Deterministic models for such problems, even when<br/>including scenario ""analysis,"" lead to so-called optimal<br/>decisions that almost never are robust, sometimes are even<br/>seriously misleading.  So it is crucial to take uncertainty into<br/>account when setting up either optimization or equilibrium<br/>models.  Using tools of variational analysis, algorithmic<br/>procedures developed for solving (nonconvex, finite-dimensional)<br/>variational inequalities, and approximation schemes for<br/>stochastic optimization problems, the investigator develops<br/>theoretical results and computational tools to solve such<br/>fundamental problems and to improve the modeling of the<br/>uncertainty components.  An important issue, both for stochastic<br/>optimization and for equilibrium problems in a stochastic<br/>environment, is the modeling of the uncertainty.  In practical<br/>situations, sufficient data are not always available to justify<br/>the use of classical statistical methods.  The investigator<br/>studies ""lack of data"" issues, examining techniques that allow<br/>the user to incorporate other information in the estimation of<br/>the distribution of the unknown parameters. <br/>"

Thermal effects can lead to interesting dynamics that are very different from the dynamics in isothermal cases.  The project will investigate the role temperature effects on viscosity and surface tension play in shaping viscous threads.  The problems under study involve nonuniform fluid cylinders and cylindrical tubes with viscosity and/or surface tension that change rapidly with temperature.  To better understand the collapse mechanism of fluid cylinders or tubes, the project studies model problems that describe:  1) pinch off of cylindrical threads; 2) collapse of a cylindrical hole in an infinite medium; 3) collapse of tubes; 4) annealing of tubes, and 5) extensions of these problems with flow.<br/><br/>This project analyzes the effects of temperature on threads of viscous material, which are used in many manufacturing processes.  Thin viscous threads (such ink jets in printing) pinch off into droplets due to the effect of surface tension, which tends to minimize the surface area of the liquid.  Pinch-off phenomena also occur in other applications, e.g., in thin films that arise in coating flows.  Heating can significantly modify surface tension, which leads to thermocapillary effects, in which temperature gradients cause surface tension gradients that drive flows.  Manufacturing processes require glass and polymeric materials to be at high temperatures to deform them, which leads to thermoviscous effects due to due to the resultant large changes in viscosity.  Examples include the pulling of fiber optic cables and formation of glass microelectrodes used in electrophysiology.  In recent years, semiconductor nanoclusters and high-purity nanowires have been produced using various techniques, and heating is normally required in the annealing stage.  In all these processes, heating plays a crucial role in controlling the shape of final products.  This project will contribute to detailed knowledge of the effects of heating on viscosity and surface tension, potentially leading to improved manufacturing processes for these materials.<br/>"

Certain choices of control and measurement can be theoretically analyzed in great detail using the theory of well-posed linear systems, which was developed during the last two decades. This detailed analysis subsequently leads to better controller designs for the given choice of control and measurement (for example dynamic controllers instead of static controllers) and through this to better performance of the designed structure. Unfortunately, what seem to be the most effective choices for control and measurement do not always lead to a well-posed linear system. These effective choices of control and measurement that appear in the engineering literature do however always lead to a distributional control system, a notion recently introduced by the principal investigator. Every well-posed linear system is a distributional control system and the above mentioned examples of systems that are distributional control systems, but not well-posed linear systems, provides the motivation for extending the existing control theory from well-posed linear systems to this more general class of distributional control systems.<br/><br/>To measure the performance of the designed structure, a generalization of analytic semigroups known as ultradifferentiable semigroups, will be used. This is needed since even the most effective choices for control and measurement in structural dynamics applications often cannot produce an analytic closed-loop semigroup, but only an ultradifferentiable one. It will be investigated whether finite error-bounds for model reduction by balanced truncation, known to exist when the semigroup is analytic, generalize to the ultradifferentiable case. This property of the closed-loop system under static feedback is crucial in designing low-order dynamic controllers for the open-loop system.  Thus, motivated by structural dynamics applications, the situation where the open-loop system is a distributional control system and the closed-loop system under static feedback has an ultradifferentiable semigroup will be investigated.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the research will be twofold: 1. Presently, mathematically justified designs of controllers for flexible structures are limited by requiring either that the system be well-posed or that the feedback controller is static. The approach in this project enables mathematical analysis of more effective controller designs for flexible structures.  2. The theoretical results and insights obtained in the study will have the potential to be applied to other areas than structural dynamics such as the study of acoustic systems, thermodynamic systems and systems comprised of composite materials."

Particular attention will be given to the question on finiteness of relative equilibria equivalence classes, linear stability of relative equilibria and Saari's conjecture, that the only solutions in the n-body problem with a constant moment of inertia are relative equilibria. These questions will be approached using modern tools from algebraic geometry such as Grobner bases and BKK theory. Analytic and numerical techniques from the theory of differential equations and dynamical systems will also be employed. The problems considered here are easily generalizable to other fields of study such as geometric mechanics, the motion of point vortices, the motion of a generalized rigid body and power-law potential systems depending only on the mutual distances between bodies.<br/><br/>The n-body problem concerns the motion of celestial bodies interacting through gravitational attraction. One of the most important types of solutions are periodic in nature, returning to their initial configuration after some fixed amount of time. Among this class of solutions, analyzing the structure and stability of simple, rigidly rotating orbits, known as relative equilibria, leads to a greater understanding of the complexities in the full problem. The study of relative equilibria is particularly useful for plotting spacecraft trajectory and discovering inexpensive methods of exploring space. Moreover, locating stable solutions provides key information pertaining to the kinds of orbits we expect to see in the universe. The educational impact of this project includes the continued mentoring of undergraduate researchers and the creation of a capstone seminar integrating the fields of celestial mechanics and algebraic geometry."

Additionally, this<br/>project fits in well with ongoing efforts in high-performance<br/>computing, because future decomposition applications will utilize<br/>parallel processing or networks of computers to solve very large<br/>or complex decision-making problems."

This is because of the wide range of spatial and time scales involved in the dynamics of these models. Taking advantage of the shallowness of the atmosphere and the oceans, as well as the rotation of the earth, geophysicists have introduced more simplified models - the so-called primitive equations and their variance - to be implemented in the simulations of global climate models. This project is to justify rigorously some of these simplified models, and to prove existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on the initial data of their solutions; and to investigate the long-term behavior for these models. This is the first and the most crucial step in justifying the derivation of these models and their consistency with physical observations for the relevant spatial and time scales. This project involves the development of novel and sophisticated mathematical techniques for the analytical study of these models and of new sub-grid scale models of oceanic turbulent flows. The latter are being proposed as new analytical parametrization models for ocean circulation dynamics. Furthermore, we propose to investigate the qualitative and statistical approximation behavior of a new class of inviscid regularizing schemes/models for oceanic and atmospheric dynamics, and to implement them computationally. The advantage of these new schemes, which are globally (in time) regular, is that they do not require addition boundary conditions, unlike the standard hyper-viscous regularization, which is commonly used in geophysical computations to suppress the numerical, non-physical, small scale instabilities.<br/><br/>Due to the developments in modern technology, the ever increasing computational power, and the sophisticated mathematical analysis of the ocean and atmosphere dynamics models we are able predict the weather only for a few days. Reliable long time numerical simulations of the exact equations that govern the climate dynamics are still out of reach, even for the most powerful state-of-the-art computers. Geophysicists have introduced more simplified models for climate dynamics to be implemented computationally. It is therefore essential to justify, rigorously, the validity of these models. Development of computational and theoretical tools to further understanding of the climate system and its predictability will be the major focus of this project. The approach of this project involves a combination of mathematical, numerical and statistical tools."

Mucus transport by cilia in the respiratory tract, sperm penetration of the oocyte in fertilization, and peristaltic contractions of the oviduct are examples of such interactions. Many biological fluids are actually complex; that is they are not liquids or mixtures of a simple molecular structure that yields Newtonian responses, but instead have complicated non-Newtonian mechanical responses that arise, usually, because they have suspended microstructure. While much progress has been made in the development of mathematical models and numerical methods for fluid-structure interactions in a Newtonian fluid, much work needs to be done in the case of complex fluids. This focused research group will use a combination of analytical, computational and experimental tools to investigate the dynamics of elastic structures coupled to a complex fluid. Accurate and robust numerical methods for viscoelastic fluids coupled to moving and flexible boundaries will be developed that build upon classical immersed boundary methods and particle methods previously designed for Newtonian fluids. Continuum descriptions of the viscoelastic fluid will be implemented, as well as models that track discrete viscoelastic microstructure of the fluid. While the methods developed will be widely applicable, the team will focus upon the biofluidmechanics of reproduction, nematode motility in microfluidic chambers, as well as mucus-ciliary transport. Computational models will be coordinated with physical and biological experiments performed at the Applied Mathematics Lab at the Courant Institute.<br/><br/>Mathematics has had a huge impact on engineering and the physical sciences through its development of theoretical analyses and numerical methods for Newtonian fluid flows. The dynamics of complex fluids is emerging as another such opportunity, and is one which draws some of its richest problems from new areas in biophysics and engineering, medicine and reproductive health, and from core biology. The integration of mathematical and computational analysis into biological science presents educational challenges and great opportunities. This research project embraces these challenges, and is based upon collaborations of investigators at four institutions - Tulane University, New York University, Washington State University and the University of California, Los Angeles. A central component of this project is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. This FRG project will sponsor two summer programs, where the postdoctoral researchers and graduate students will spend six weeks at the Applied Mathematics Lab at Courant Institute. This will provide opportunities for all the students and postdocs involved in the project to work together side by side, develop a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of the research, and experience and participate in the life of a working fluids lab."
