Some exceptions include stochastic optimization and on-line optimization models that treat problems with time-varying uncertainties in the objective functions. Stochastic optimization anticipates that these uncertainties occur in a random fashion and on-line optimization allows for objective functions to be drawn from some pre-specified class of functions, again, in an arbitrary fashion. In the existing literature on constrained optimization, there is litte, if any, evidence of optimization theory or algorithms that treat the class of problems where the uncertainties are both in the objective function and the constraint. The goal of this proposal is to bridge this gap. The significance of the proposed research is twofold: (1) It critically expands the domain of optimization to include a new class of problems a with time-varying nature by developing their background theory; (2) It pioneers some new computational models for solving time-varying problems, and especially those currently arising in data classification, signal processing, and network resource allocations.<br/><br/>The proposed research has the potential to impact the design and operation of autonomous engineering systems. It also has the potential to make contribution to the study of information processing systems that support human-centric operations and decisions. Some of the engineered systems that could benefit include: surveillance and monitory systems for tracking environmental and other changes, data management systems (including data analysis, information retrieval, decision support), and wireless communication systems, e.g. mobile phone networks. The proposed research could increase the stability, reliability, and the performance of these systems."

Despite several decades of intense activity, this general area shows no sign of abating nor of calcification. Indeed, two of the recent Fields medalists are cited for their work in this area, and major new forays into geophysical modeling and high-speed communication have made use of nonlinear wave equations. The conferences in this series are well known for bringing together researchers in theoretical and computational mathematics, the applied sciences and engineering.<br/><br/>The conference will feature  several invited, one-hour presentations on some of the most topical aspects of the area and an estimated 180 shorter talks, most of which will be in a focused session format. Past experience suggests that well over 200 participants will attend. At the most recent conference in 2011, 229 research papers were presented. In addition to 161 participants from the USA, there were 68 international scientists and students from 36 countries. We had 41 graduate and undergraduate students, 3 junior faculty and 27 women who attended the conference. This conference we will have 20 organized sessions, 3 keynote speakers, and two tutorials for students and young faculty. The requested support is for the expenses of the invited speakers and to defray the costs of younger participants, with special attention paid to students, women, minorities, persons with disabilities, postdocs and junior faculty. As of mid-November, 2012, more than 50 applications were received from students, women, underrepresented groups, and young faculty requesting financial support to attend the conference."

Over the past fifty years, a large body of knowledge has been accumulated on these systems, which continue to be extensively studied worldwide.  Nonetheless, problems in which the boundary conditions play a crucial role still pose significant challenges.  This project is aimed at undertaking a wide-ranging investigation of initial-boundary value problems for integrable NLEEs, both continuous and discrete, in both one and two spatial dimensions, including their applications in several concrete scientific and technological settings.  This study will be carried out by developing and using exact methods, such as the inverse scattering transform and direct methods, in combination with appropriate asymptotic and numerical techniques. Specific problems that are being studied include: (i) nonlinear Schrodinger systems (scalar and vector, continuous and discrete) with non-zero boundary conditions at space infinity; (ii) boundary value problems for discrete and continuous NLEEs; (iii) characterization of soliton interactions for all of the above systems; (iv) classification of solitary wave structures in (2+1)-dimensional integrable systems such as the Davey-Stewartson system.<br/><br/>Nonlinear wave equations are well-known to model a variety of physically interesting phenomena arising in areas ranging from fluid dynamics and nonlinear optics, to plasmas, cosmology and quantum field theory.  The study of these equations is especially attractive because it offers a unique combination of interesting mathematics and concrete physical/technological applications.  In particular, the systems that will be studied in this project model wave propagation in water waves, optical fibers, lasers and Bose-Einstein condensates.  Hence the outcomes of this project will not only advance our mathematical understanding, but they will also provide practical information that will help scientists and engineers.  The training of undergraduate and graduate students is also an integral component of this project.  One of the PIs has co-authored a monograph on NLS systems that has been referenced extensively and is helping the dissemination of knowledge in the field of nonlinear waves.  Both PIs have a long record of working with both graduate and undergraduate students, and will work both with undergraduate students and with Ph.D. students as part of this project."

In biology, they arise as model for the movement of large swarms of individuals (insects, bacteria, birds, fish, etc...). The research will involve rigorous analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, numerical simulations, and modeling. More specifically the following problems will be investigated: 1) Study of the formation of singularities and the formation of patterns in nonlocal interaction equations. 2) Study of nonlocal interaction equations in a domain with boundaries and use of optimal transport techniques in order to study phenomena of mass concentration on the boundaries (such phenomena are observed, for example, in continuum models for swarms of locusts). 3) Modeling of the formation of ""foraging trails'' in an ant colony.<br/><br/>This project investigates equations describing the collective behavior of a large number of individuals, such as a swarm of insects, a flock of birds, a school of fish, or a colony of bacteria. Understanding basic rules of these swarming behaviors has potential for the design of flexible and robust algorithms for unmanned vehicles, with possible applications, for example, to the surveillance of hazardous areas. The equations investigated in this research also arise in various other contexts: evolution of vortex densities in superconductors, adhesion dynamics, simplified model for granular flow and orientational distribution of filaments in cells."

Rare events play a key role and large deviations theory deals with their estimation. The PI will consider two broad classes of problems. The first class of problems is related to a rigorous investigation and design of provably efficient Monte Carlo methods for metastable systems. The second class of problems is about large deviations and a rigorous analysis of associated Monte Carlo methods for stochastic processes with multiple scales. The problems outlined in this research proposal are partially motivated by fundamental mathematical questions and partially by generic questions in other branches of science, such as chemical physics, biology and engineering, where metastability is important.<br/><br/>Many problems arising from chemistry and physics involve rare but significant exit events from the basin of attraction of stable states and transition events between stable states. The transitions happen on a time scale much longer than the intrinsic time scale of the dynamical system. These rare events are important, for example in conformational changes of biomolecules, chemical reactions and nucleation events during phase transitions.  Even though, a large body of work exists in the chemistry, physics and mathematics literature addressing issues related to energy landscapes and metastability, this research seeks to provide new insights about the effect of multiple scale features and about issues involved in the design of algorithms. The PI will focus on a rigorous mathematical development of moderate and large deviations as well as efficient Monte Carlo methods via large deviations for systems  that may have metastability and multiple features."

The dimension of those systems is proportional to the number of particles involved which can be quite large, up to 10^{25} in some settings. This makes them too complex to analyze and too costly to solve numerically. However a key feature of those large systems is their multiscale nature: It makes the dynamics extremely complex at the microscopic level of an individual particle. But it can also lead to a drastic reduction in the complexity of the system by approximating it at the mesoscopic or macroscopic level with PDE's in lower dimensions; the main difficulty in that case is the study and control of the correlations between particles. A classical example is the usual mean field limit problem for kinetic equations in statistical physics for which the investigator will develop novel techniques in order to handle singular potentials. New extensions will be investigated as well in order to push beyond the classical framework, including bacterial suspensions, mean field games models and applications to social sciences (consensus formation...). The bacterial suspensions under study have a relatively high number density with hence non negligible correlations between the particles or bacteria. The investigator and collaborators introduce a new numerical scheme to calculate those correlations. In the case of mean field games, in addition of ""classical"" interactions between the particles or agents, a control on the dynamics is optimized by a central agent. The usual techniques, propagation of chaos on the joint law for instance, are no more applicable and we develop a new approach, based on the minimization of  N and 1 agent energies.<br/> <br/>Systems with a very large number of particles are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Indeed depending on the context and the model, the term ""particle"" may represent very different objects; in the scope of this project, a particle could for instance be as ""simple"" as an electron or ion (particles in a plasma), or more complex like a bacteria, an economical or social agent or even a very large structure like a galaxy (dynamics of clusters in astrophysics). Reducing the complexity of such large systems, for instance by approximating them by Partial Differential Equations, is a critical step to be able to use them (numerical simulations...).  The project will contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon for a few important applications: the classical framework of statistical physics, suspensions of bacteria with critical density, multi-agent systems in economy and consensus formation. The project also has a direct impact on the education and future careers of graduate students and will also involve undergraduate students."

The goal is to develop new mathematical tools towards progress on various open problems, such as the global regularity versus finite time blow-up of classical solutions, the behaviour of solutions in singular limit regimes, and other qualitative properties.  The first part of the project is devoted to studying the regularity of active scalar equations.  The work is mostly geared towards the analysis of the inviscid and the supercritically-dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation, porous media equation, and the magneto-geostrophic equation.  For all these models the a priori controlled quantities are too weak to guarantee the global existence of smooth solutions.  The investigator and collaborators seek to identify analytic and geometric mechanisms that preclude the possible formation of singularities.  The regularity of supercritical drift-diffusion equations is also considered.  The second part of the project addresses the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations on a bounded domain.  The goal is to establish new well-posedness results for the Prandtl boundary layer equations under weak matching conditions at the top of the boundary layer, and analyze the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations in these regimes. <br/><br/>     The equations describing incompressible Newtonian fluids, such as the Euler and the Navier-Stokes equations, account for interactions between a very broad range of space and time scales, in a highly nonlinear fashion.  Due to this intrinsic complexity, the accuracy needed to fully resolve the underlying phenomena via numerical computations is out of reach for the foreseeable future.  This project seeks to further advance the rigorous analysis of these equations, which is vital to a finer understanding and validation of the models, and to an accurate interpretation of numerical simulations."

Applications include water waves and nonlinear optics. In water waves, when surface tension is relatively small, the solutions to be investigated describe interactions of non-decaying soliton waves that have X, Y and more complex structure. From results of prior NSF supported research by the PI, it is known that novel multi-lump solitons can occur in water waves with relatively large surface tension. In this case a complete characterization of the multi-lump class of solutions will be considered. Related nonlinear equations that have similar types of solutions will also be investigated. New classes of nonlocal equations that are solvable by the inverse scattering transform will be analyzed.  Interactions of dispersive shock waves in a wide variety of physically interesting systems will be considered by the inverse scattering transform. Nonlinear wave propagation in optical materials with periodic lattice backgrounds will also be studied.<br/><br/>Wave phenomena in oceans and optics have broad appeal. Numerous observations of shallow water wave interactions on flat beaches by the PI and a graduate student funded by NSF have led to mathematical descriptions that provide deeper understanding of such phenomena. These interactions frequently appear visually to be of X and Y structure, though sometimes they are more complex. Interestingly these waves also have application to tsunami propagation.   As a result of the initial research, a journal article was recently published in Physical Review. The work was subsequently described in a focus article in Physics Today, the Society of Industrial and Applied Math News and was featured in a number of articles by popular news organizations. These articles included remarkable photos taken by the authors. In other directions, the mathematics also applies to nonlinear optics with applications that involve the dynamics, steering and manipulation of localized electromagnetic waves. The contemplated research will extend the mathematical understanding of the nonlinear equations to a variety of physically interesting systems.

Specifically,  we focus on the situation of a fluid in a three-dimensional domain with a flexible boundary that is described by a  plate or membrane equation. We suggest several problems which serve to address our fundamental question: How much control in one or more components of the  coupled system is needed to obtain (i) controllability  or approximate controllability of the coupled system or (ii) partial controllability (approximate or exact) of one or more components of the system? The proposed research extends the  state-of-the-art in  several ways. First, the partial controllability problem in the context of a fluid-elastic system has not been addressed for the types of physically-based models we are considering. Secondly, many of the models we propose to analyze have not been studied even for well-posedness. This is a nontrivial step even in the linear case for some of the models (e.g., when considering free boundary conditions). However we also hope to address local controllability for the nonlinear problems associated with  the free boundary  problem for the Stokes system associated with a moving flexible boundary. Likewise we hope to make some progress in the case of a compressible Navier-Stokes fluid coupled with a plate. Our main analytical tool to attack these problems will be the method of Carleman estimates together with microlocal analysis. Development of Carleman estimates for these types of coupled systems might turn out to be be very useful in a broader context, as it is likely that a similar approach may be useful in the analysis of a variety of other types of coupled systems. We also propose to investigate the closely related inverse problem of determination of plate coefficients through knowledge of the appropriately defined Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps associated with solutions of the coupled plate-fluid system.    <br/><br/>The fluid-elastic structures we aim to study arise in many practical applications. For example,the problem of minimizing the engine noise in a portion of an aircraft fuselage through controllers placed on and inside the aircraft is closely related to the partial controllability problem (ii) mentioned above. One specific fluid-elastic structure we plan to investigate is the cochlea, which is the  auditory organ in the inner ear that  translates sound vibrations to electrical impulses transmitted to the brain. A better understanding of the controllability structure of the cochlea could lead to an improved design of cochlear implants and hearing aids."

We observe only the scattered field, the wave after it has passed through the intervening medium (which may be empty space). The simplest mathematical model is the scalar wave equation, which decomposes, via Fourier transform, into the scalar Helmholtz equation at each wavenumber.  The phenomenon of evanescence limits resolution by allowing only a finite dimensional family of waves to reach the sensors with an amplitude that has not been severely attenuated. The dimension of that family gives important information about the size of the source of the wave, and the number of nonzero coefficients needed to represent the wave in different bases (Hankel function expansions centered at different points) carries information about the location of the source or sources. We are developing methods to use this information. This is complicated by the fact that the source is not uniquely determined by the scattered wave. We resolve this by seeking the smallest set that supports (carries) a source that radiates that scattered field, and must have been part of any other source that radiated the same field. Examples show that there is no such set in general, but there is a smallest union of well separated convex sets that satisfies both criteria. A major goal of this project is to find an algorithm to find this union of well separated convex sets, and give reliable estimates on how far apart sources of various sizes must be in order to guarantee that the individual sources will be visible in the data. This analysis is relevant to many other inverse scattering problems. A particularly important application is understanding the circumstances in which the Born, or single scattering, approximation is a reliable substitute for the full scattering problem. While all practitioners of inverse scattering techniques know that the farther apart two scatterers are, the less they interact, and therefore the better the Born approximation works, current mathematical theory seems to say the opposite. The apparent paradox is due to the norms we use to measure and compare the waves. Most mathematically tractable norms have features which misrepresent some of the physics. We continue to work to formulate norms which are simple enough to allow mathematical analysis and yet faithfully reflect physical reality.<br/><br/>A remote sensing experiment gathers information about an object from a distance, without any direct contact. An underwater array of acoustic sensors that seeks to locate a submarine (the source) based on the noise radiated from the submarine's engine, is an example of passive remote sensing system. While a sonar array that transmits its own wave in order to locate the submarine based on the properties of the echo, is an example of active remote sensing system. In this case the array, and not the submarine, is the primary source, and the submarine is referred to as the scatterer.The inverse source and scattering problems are an essential part of remote sensing, and algorithms for finding small point-like sources and scatterers have had major impact on technological development, including antenna design. The project aims to bridge the gap between effective algorithms and theory by reformulating the analysis in a way that more accurately reflects the way this algorithms work with finite data sets."

IP are problems where causes for a desired or an observed effect are to be determined. They lie at the heart of scientific inquiry and technological development. The enormous increase in computing power and the development of powerful algorithms has made it possible to apply the techniques of IP to real-world problems of growing complexity. Applications include a number of medical as well as other imaging techniques, location of oil and mineral deposits in the earth's substructure, creation of astrophysical images from telescope data, finding cracks and interfaces within materials, shape optimization, model identification in growth processes and modelling in the life sciences. This is the first time that these series of conferences will be held in Asia. One aim of the conference is to bring together investigators working on different aspects of these fields and to encourage interaction between mathematicians and practitioners of inverse problems. Another goal is to foster international cooperation between scientists working on inverse problems throughout the world.<br/><br/>The series of AIP Conferences aim to provide a primary international forum for academic and industrial researchers working on all aspects of inverse problems (IP), such as mathematical modelling, analytic and geometric methods, computational approaches, numerical algorithms etc. This series of conferences started in Montecatini, Italy in 2001 and has been held every two years since in Europe and North America: Lake Arrowhead, California, in 2003, Cirecester, UK, in 2005, Vancouver, Canada, in 2007, Vienna, Austria, in 2009 and College Station, Texas, in 2011.

The invited speakers and the minisymposia of AIP 2013 will cover a broad spectrum of the applications of inverse problems, focusing on recent developments in medical imaging, determination of defects in materials, homogeneization and inverse problems, geometric inverse problems, remote sensing, industrial applications, numerical and regularization methods in inverse problems, and also, invisibility and cloaking. One aim of the conference is to bring together investigators working on different aspects of these fields and to encourage interaction between mathematicians and practitioners of inverse problems. Another goal is to foster international cooperation between scientists working on inverse problems throughout the world."

In a series of recent works, the PI and collaborators  have characterized the linear stability of travelling and standing waves for second order in time equations and  systems.  Such results provide necessary information for the asymptotic stability of the same waves. The PI and collaborators will build on their previous work to show asymptotic stability of standing waves for the following models: the Klein-Gordon equation, the sine Gordon equation and the Dirac equation. A second goal of the proposal is to study the existence and stability of coherent structures, arising in  spatially discrete models. More concretely, the project will deal, among other things,  with Hertzian granular chains/crystals  and the discrete nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation.<br/><br/>The project deals with nonlinear dispersive equations, which model wavelike behavior of important physical processes. Important class of problems under consideration include the propagation of light in optical waveguides, motion of quantum particles, the mechanics of fluids to mention a few. The overarching theme of the investigation will be the stability of coherent configuration - that is, if one is initially close to such coherent structure, does it stay close to it forever? The mathematical formulation of such problems, as well as their analysis and predictions about their long time behavior will greatly enhance our understanding of these and related processes."

In particular, we study the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for the motion of a viscous liquid, the Euler equations (and their models) for the motion of an inviscid liquid, and a class of scalar equations arising naturally from the mentioned systems through approximations in physically important settings. In the first part, regarding the Navier-Stokes equations, we intend to explore the anisotropy introduced by the oscillatory structure of solutions, in order to construct classes of large data leading to global well-posedness. The second part of the project is geared towards gaining a deeper understanding of the ill-posedness of a class of active scalar equations, based on the properties of the second iterate. The analysis focuses particularly on the equations where the nonlinearity is given by a Fourier multiplier whose symbol is anisotropic and/or even (the porous media equation and the magneto-geostrophic equation). The third objective of this project is to investigate a system of PDEs simulating the fundamental features of the vorticity-stretching phenomena in the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations. <br/><br/>The project seeks to advance the understanding of the dynamics described by the equations of fluid dynamics by methods of rigorous mathematical analysis. These partial differential equations represent a basic tool for modeling many natural phenomena and technological applications. For instance, the equations describing fluid flow (on which an important part of this project concentrates) are used in weather prediction, climate research, and various technological applications, such as the design of optimal aerodynamical and hydrodynamical shapes. The equations of fluid dynamics are notoriously difficult to solve, even with the help of the largest computers. Some of these difficulties constitute part of the problem, but some are due to the fact that our mathematical understanding of the equations themselves is incomplete. From the analytical point of view, these equations account for interactions of a broad range of space- and time-scales in a highly non-linear fashion. Due to this intrinsic complexity, the accuracy needed to fully resolve the underlying phenomena via numerical computations is out of reach for the foreseeable future. Advances in theoretical understanding of these partial differential equations are vital for the validation of the models and for an accurate interpretation of numerical results. In the final analysis, the main task of the theoretical investigation is to find simple and natural parameters that control the behavior of the solutions. Once a good set of such parameters is known, it becomes much easier to design practical methods for calculating the solutions numerically."

There are very exciting new developments on these PDEs in the last few years and significant progress has been made on many fundamental issues concerning these PDEs such as the global (in time) regularity problem. This workshop, inspired by these recent advances, strives to fulfill four major objectives: 1) to broadly disseminate the most recent advances in the focused research field; 2) to give local (Oklahoma and neighboring states) PDE researchers an opportunity to communicate directly with the leading experts and to expose themselves to the forefront research; 3) to provide a convenient platform for our graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, women and minorities to present their research results; and 4) to stimulate interactions and interdisciplinary collaborations.<br/><br/>PDEs are fundamental tools in understanding many fluid phenomena ranging from small scale blood flows to large-scale geophysical flows. The PDEs featured by this workshop have played important roles in many practical applications such as in the study of frontogenesis, the formation of sharp fronts between hot and cold air. This workshop aims to bring the state-of-the-art research in the focused research field to a broad audience in a timely fashion and to promote interactions and interdisciplinary collaborations between mathematicians and meteorologists including those in the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma. It is hoped that this workshop will help accelerate the incorporation of the present cutting-edge research into the modeling and simulation of sophisticated weather phenomena such as tornadoes."

This is a regime of obvious relevance in many applications. Even for basic models frustratingly little is known rigorously about their range of validity. A first step in a mathematical approach is to pursue a theory of existence of solutions for a reasonable class of initial data. A key concern is to develop methods that provide quantitative and qualitative predictions as well. By pursing methods that give information beyond abstract existence results we seek to assess the relevance and limits of models that are routinely used for practical applications, such as compressible Euler flow. The models we consider are formulated as hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. As a complement to existence results for initial value problems we also seek general structural properties of such systems. The aim is an understanding of how the ""geometry"" of a system, as encoded in its characteristic values, eigen-frame, entropies, etc., impact the properties of solutions. This part of the project leads to questions of independent interest in geometry, and also clarifies the role of underlying structures in physical models. <br/><br/>Consider the following scenario: a perfectly spherical shock wave propagates inward in a gas which is at rest within the converging shock. From experiments and basic considerations it is clear that the shock will typically accelerate and strengthen as it approaches the center of motion. Very close to the center the gas will experience enormous densities, velocities and temperatures. This and similar physical situations are of great interest in applications such as high-speed flight, meteorology, combustion, etc.  However, we currently lack a good understanding of this type of fluid flow, and the reason for this is a lack of mathematical insight. The basic models for describing the physical processes have been known for more than 150 years. Nonetheless, we are still searching for answers to even fundamental questions. These models are typically formulated as systems of non-linear equations. Such systems are ubiquitous in modeling of natural phenomena, and above all in connection with fluid flow - they demand a good understanding. The mathematical aspect of such understanding is provided by rigorous results pertaining to existence of solutions, their uniqueness and stability, and their qualitative properties. The proposal addresses these types of fundamental issues for non-linear phenomena that originate in models for compressible gas flow. The problems we consider appear to be essential road blocks that must be overcome in order to gain a proper understanding of non-linear phenomena in fluid flow."

The study is divided into two independent projects. The first project concerns the stability properties of one-dimensional sources of reaction-diffusion systems that are temporally- and spatially-periodic traveling waves with defects. Pointwise Green function and Evans function techniques are exploited to investigate nonlinear stability and long-time dynamics of sources. The second project regards the vanishing viscosity limit problem of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of impermeable boundaries. Topics that will be addressed include the well-posedness of the Prandtl boundary-layer equation, the validity of asymptotic boundary-layer expansions, and fluid-structure interactions. The primary goal of these projects is to provide a mathematically rigorous investigation into these structural solutions and boundary-layer phenomena in fluid dynamics. <br/><br/>The mathematical research projects that will be undertaken are motivated by many scientific disciplines including oceanography, aerodynamics, fluid dynamics, and the dynamics of biological and chemical reactions. The objects of this study, namely traveling waves, boundary layers, and coherent structures, their stability properties and their dynamics are of fundamental importance in biology, engineering, and physics. The primary goal of this research is to provide mathematical understanding of the stability properties of these structural solutions and to develop analytical methods that can be of practical use in biology, engineering, physics, and manufacturing. Among many others, one particular practical use of the study of boundary layers is to provide fundamental principles that help engineers to calculate the friction drag of a ship, an airfoil, or the body of an airplane, and to help determining an efficient shape of the body in order to minimize the friction drag and to reduce turbulence. Another objective of this research is to study the effect of viscosity in fluid motion, and to mathematically justify phenomena related to boundary layers that have been observed in experiments. Results of this research will be disseminated through presentations at national and international conferences, seminars and publications in scientific journals."

The mathematical formulation leads to the non-linear partial differential equation of 1-Laplacian with a variable coefficient. This is a singular and degenerate elliptic equation for which solutions can be defined in the viscosity sense. While not all viscosity solutions are of interest in the inverse conductivity problem, it turns out that solutions of interest are of weighted least gradient. One direction of research considers the study of weighted least gradient functions (in the sense of Radon measures) with prescribed boundary data. A major goals is to prove uniqueness and stability for the minimization problem in the larger space of functions of bounded variations. Delicate questions concerning the regularity of the weight, as well as what happens when the coefficient vanishes on open subsets are to be investigated. Another direction of research concerns the understanding of types of boundary data which would a priori exclude singularities. Existence of such data would then reduce the problem to a Hamilton-Jacobi system, in which the role of time is played by one spatial variable. More generally, some regularization techniques coming from the algorithmic side of Image Processing will be analyzed in the context of the weighted minimum gradient problem. On an second facet of imaging, the PI will investigate the relation between the range conditions that characterize the data obtained in the attenuated X-ray transform, and the theory of A-analytic maps, as well as a stochastic model arising in X-ray tomography when low count radiation does not warrant the law of large numbers assumed in the transport model.<br/><br/>The proposed research is in the area of Inverse Problems of hybrid type, a hot topic in imaging sciences that uses coupled Physics to determine a material property inside a body. The PI aims to find and analyze new mathematical methods which quantitatively recover the electrical conductivity (a characteristic encoding responses to electromagnetic excitations) with significantly higher accuracy and resolution than currently possible. A quantitative display that not only reveals the inner structure of the object, but also allows for discriminating in the status of a same part. Applications range from nondestructive testing in Material Sciences to Medical Imaging and Diagnostic. Of special interest in medical diagnostic applications, the use of harmless radiation to image with high resolution would decrease the current rate of misdiagnosis by methods such as CAT-scans, and would detect defective tissue at an earlier stage of development, with the benefit of increasing the odds of a cure.

More specifically, this research will study patterns emerging spontaneously and in a self-organized fashion for problems related to visual cortical activity and convections patterns. Model systems are nonlocal and local equations defined on unbounded spatial domains. An approach is to use a neural fields setting (nonlocal) to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the visual cortex and the Swift-Hohenberg family (local) to analyze the formation of domain boundaries in convection patterns. It is proposed to focus on three mains projects. The focus of the first project is to give some new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of visual hallucinations and ongoing cortical activity in the presence of hexagonal symmetry close to different types of bifurcations. A second project is to provide existence and stability results of different types of two-dimensional cortical waves such as planar traveling waves, concentric traveling waves and spiral waves. Finally, the last project is to extend the analysis of grain boundaries into three directions: i) study small angle grain boundaries, ii) show the existence of asymmetric grain boundaries and iii) investigate hexagonal grain boundaries. From a phenomenological perspective, it is proposed to investigate the role of the different parameters of the models in a systematic fashion.<br/><br/>The methods that are develop have a wide applicability in neurosciences, fluid and crystal dynamics. Visual hallucinations, two-dimensional cortical waves and convection patterns are most of the time organized around spatiotemporal coherent structures.

Specifically, the PI and co-PI will study systems in which collective behavior manifests non-trivial co-dimension. The mathematics of such particle systems pervades many disciplines, ranging from physics, chemistry and biology to control theory and engineering. Modern applications in these areas include protein folding, colloid stability and the self-assembly of nanoparticles into supramolecular structures. In biology, similar mathematical models help explain the complex phenomena observed in viral capsids, locust swarms and colonies of bacteria. The first phase of this project will apply and expand recently developed mathematical tools to identifiy various physical and chemical interactions that will naturally produce co-dimension one structures. This has a direct application to the study of processes, such as the self-assembly of Polyoxometalate (POM) molecular clusters into spherical supramolecular structures, in which experimental evidence is overwhelming but a theoretical understanding of the underlying formation mechanisms is lacking. The PI, co-PI and their collaborators have made numerous important developments in the mathematical theory of such mechanisms when the interaction is isotropic. This part of the project aims to further develop this theory in a manner that will prove useful to a broad set of researchers in other disciplines. The proposed research project is fundamentally interdisciplinary in that it derives mathematical problems from unexplained phenomena in diverse fields such as chemistry, biology and engineering. The PI and co-PI will apply a broad set of mathematical tools drawing from dynamical systems, partial differential equations, mathematical modeling and computational methods to solve several problems that are subject to active research in these fields, including the so-called 'designer potential problem' in nano self-assembly. By clarifying which physical forces drive POM self-assembly and other related phenomena, such as viral capsid formation, we will provide rigorous solutions to the question of how to design sub-units that form into these importantstructures. <br/><br/>One of the demonstrated career goals of the PI is to further the inclusion of underrepresented groups in the field of mathematics. The PI has the personal experience and critical perspective necessary to serve as a mentor for the diverse student body at University of San Francisco. Exposing these students from underrepresented groups to cuttingedge mathematical research, coupled with faculty mentoring, will inspire many of them to pursue graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences. The student research supported by this grant will prove indispensible to the project's recruitment efforts given USF's high proportion of low-income students who are compelled to work part-time while they pursue full-time academic degree programs. The PI has a proven track record of recruiting talented students from underrepresented groups into mathematics and this grant would allow these activities to continue and expand."

The widely known examples are aeroelasticity and biofluids. In biofluidic applications, such as, e.g., the study of interaction between blood flow and cardiovascular tissue, the coupling between the fluid and the relatively light structure is highly nonlinear, requiring sophisticated ideas for the study of their solutions. In the blood flow application, the problems are further exacerbated by the fact that the walls of major arteries are composed of several layers, each with different mechanical characteristics. No results exist so far that analyze solutions to fluid-structure interaction problems in which the structure is composed of several different layers. The proposed research takes a first step in this direction by proposing a program to study the existence of solutions to a class of FSI problems describing the interaction between a multi-layered structure and the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid, giving rise to a fully coupled, nonlinear moving boundary, fluid-multi-structure interaction problem. The analysis relies on a novel, loosely coupled, partitioned, time-marching numerical scheme, and on novel compactness arguments providing convergence of the numerical scheme to a weak solution of the nonlinear fluid-multi-layered structure interaction problem. The proposed program opens up a new field within the area of FSI problems. This work brings to light several features that have not been studied before. In particular, this work reveals a new regularizing mechanism in FSI problems that is due to the presence of a fluid-structure interface with mass. The inertia of the fluid-structure interface regularizes the evolution of the entire FSI solution.<br/><br/>This is an exciting, novel study requiring the development of original mathematical techniques motivated by an important biological application: the interaction between blood flow and human arterial walls. It is well-known that arterial walls are composed of several layers, each with different mechanical characteristics and thickness. The healthy physiology and the pathophysiology of the human cardiovascular system are significantly affected by the pulsation of arterial walls during each cardiac cycle. However, the interaction between the different arterial wall layers and their interaction with blood flow is still not completely understood. For example, recent developments in ultrasound speckle tracking methods revealed significant shear strain between the different layers of arterial walls in high adrenaline situations. The consequences of this phenomenon on the initiation of cardiovascular disease are yet to be understood. The proposed research makes a step in this direction by designing mathematical models, and by analyzing solutions of the mathematical models that capture fluid-structure interaction between blood flow and arterial walls in the case when arterial walls are modeled as multi-layered structures. No mathematical results exist so far in this area, and the proposed research opens up a new area in the field of fluid-structure interaction problems. The work proposed here promises to develop a strong partnership between the University of Houston, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Zagreb, and the Texas Medical Center in Houston. The PI is a woman, and active recruitment of minorities and women to participate in this research is proposed."

Two approaches to risk aversion are considered: dynamic risk measures and stochastic orders.  The investigators seek to advance their work on risk-averse discrete-time models and to develop general methodology for incorporating risk models into continuous-time optimal control problems of Markov structure.  Three major challenges are associated with this project.  First, the investigators develop proper mathematical tools for measuring risk in a time-consistent manner that would be suitable for continuous-time Markov systems.  Second, the investigators develop optimality theory for control problems involving time-consistent dynamic models of risk.  This includes the analysis of the structure of the control models, existence of solutions, and properties of the solutions.  When developing risk-averse control models the third challenge has to be taken into account: the possibility to solve the problems numerically in an efficient way. <br/><br/>     Decision and control problems under uncertainty arise in many areas: energy production and distribution, telecommunication, insurance and finance, logistics, medicine, security and military applications.  In most cases decisions have to be made over time: decisions, as well as the random environment, influence evolution of a system, which creates the need to make new decisions, etc.  Therefore, a policy has to be designed that incorporates rules for responding to future states of the system.  So far, most theoretical models of such control processes have been based on average performance criteria.  The investigators propose to take into account risk, that is, the possibility of occurrence of highly undesirable scenarios.  The project develops mathematical models for quantifying risk in dynamical systems that evolve in a continuous way.  It also provides methods to determine the best policy, when risk aversion is essential."

One intriguing feature that sets ternary systems apart from binary systems is the triple junction phenomenon. The three constituents of the system may meet at a point in the two dimensional case or at a curve in the three dimensional case. The PI proposes to show the existence of a double bubble assembly pattern, where the triple junction phenomenon occurs in each double bubble. Two novel techniques, restricted perturbation classes and internal variables, will be used in the proof. The second feature in ternary systems is the complexity of the long range interaction manifested in a two by two matrix of parameters. For instance it will be shown that the core-shell pattern appears only if the 2-2 entry is greater than the 1-2 entry of the matrix. When multi-constituent inhibitory systems appear in a curved space, such as a vesicle of lipid membranes, the role played by the Riemann curvature will also be investigated. Patterns and their possible defects will be shown as a balance and compromise of growth, inhibition, and curvature. <br/><br/>Exquisitely structured patterns arise in many multi-constituent physical and biological systems as orderly outcomes of self-organization principles. Examples include morphological phases in block copolymers, animal coats, and skin pigmentation. Common in these pattern-forming systems is that a deviation from homogeneity has a strong positive feedback on its further increase. On its own, it would lead to an unlimited increase and spreading. Pattern formation requires in addition a longer ranging confinement of the locally self-enhancing process. This project derives geometrical patterns from self-organization principles in various binary and ternary physical and biological systems. Analysis of these geometric structures is a fundamental step in understanding the mechanical, optical, electrical, ionic, barrier and other properties of these systems. This project supports a culturally diverse environment that fosters critical and independent thinking both in classroom and research settings in the ethnically diverse metropolitan area of Washington, DC.  It produces mathematics of depth and beauty, and offers profound insights into the natural world."

A special challenge has been to understand why on many plants such as the sunflower, the seeds lie on families of clockwise and counterclockwise spirals and that the numbers in each family belong not just to the integers but to a special subset known as Fibonacci numbers generated by starting with any two integers and defining each successive member as the sum of the previous two. Google sunflower images and count for yourselves. You will encounter beautiful sunflower seed heads with 21, 34 and 55 family spirals. Count them. One can generate this, the most common, Fibonacci sequence by beginning with 1,2 and obtain 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55...  .<br/><br/>Attempts to explain phyllotactic configurations fall into two categories. The teleological approach devises rules for positioning the next seed or flower so as to pack the seeds in some optimal fashion and is philosophically equivalent to saying the reason tigers have stripes is that it provides better camouflage. Now that may be the reason that striped tigers had an evolutionary advantage over  unstriped ones, but nature has to use plain old physical and biochemical processes to achieve these outcomes. In plants, the mechanisms by which phylla are made involve instabilities which lead to a non uniform distribution of the hormone auxin (phylla initiation would occur at maxima of the auxin field) and non uniform stress fields in the vicinity of the plant's growth tips. The corresponding pattern then propagates as a front and creates potential sites for phylla initiation. What we have obtained is some stunning new results which demonstrate that the locations of the maxima of the instability generated pattern fields coincide with the point configurations generated by the teleologically inspired models. This suggests the exciting new idea that in many circumstances nstability generated patterns may be the mechanisms by which plants and other organisms can pursue optimal strategies. It also suggests alternative approaches to investigate many of the open challenges in optimal packing."

The PI considers the problem on a partial differential equation (PDE) model. Specifically the PI uses a nonlinear Schrodinger equation coupled to the trajectory of a classical particle, obtained after taking the mean field limit on the Bose Einstein condensate. The PI will prove the following three results: (1) if the initial speed of the classical particle is higher than the speed of sound in the Bose Einstein condensate, i.e. supersonic, then the particle will decelerate due to the friction until the speed reaches the speed of sound, (2) if the initial speed of the particle is subsonic, then the particle will travel ballistically as the time goes to infinity, (3) the whole system will converge to some inertial mode. Technically, the PI has to develop a better understanding of integro-differential equations, together with other techniques in nonlinear PDEs, for example Fermi Golden rules. The second problem is the resonance problem. The PI wants to consider the problem in the context of linear and nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Very often the presence of degeneracy, or resonance, in perturbation expansions makes the problem hard. The PI hopes to develop a better understanding of normal form transformations, and then to tackle some of the problems in Schrodinger equations. The third problem is to develop a new method for geometric flows, specifically mean curvature flow and Ricci flow. Different from the previous works, by Huisken for example, the PI mainly uses modulation equations and spectral analysis to perform almost precise estimates, instead of the maximum principle and entropy estimates. Hopefully the PI can solve some open problems here. For example, in the context of mean curvature flow, the evolving surface will collapse in finite time and form a cylinder around the collapsing point. However, whether the cylinder is unique is an open problem. The PI hopes to solve it, also a similar problem in Ricci flow.<br/><br/>Quantum friction has many applications nowadays. One example is to test the speed of particles, for example neutrinos, by shooting the particle to some medium, for example argon. This phenomenon is known as Cerenkov radiation (Noble prize 1958). Despite its importance, the mathematical understanding of Cerenkov radiation is not satisfactory. In a broader context, the problem is in the class of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and quantum fluid, which are popular at the moment. The second problem, the resonance problem, will deepen the understanding of normal form transformations, and help to tackle other problems, for example, in dynamical system (specifically KAM theory), and spin model in quantum mechanics. For the third problem, in the recent years, people have applied mean curvature flow to classify topological structures of different surfaces, and have estimated the amount of mass in general relativity. The PI's techniques provide more precise information on the evolution of the surfaces. Hopefully the PI's method will find applications there."

There is a deep relation between these algebras and the semigroups associated with Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)  and Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential equations (PDEs).  During the past decade, the max-plus curse-of-dimensionality-free methods for solution of classes of first-order HJB PDEs were discovered. Most importantly, for some classes of HJB PDEs, these methods can solve problems in significantly higher dimensions than would be feasible with classical, i.e., grid-based, methods, which are subject to the curse of dimensionality.  More recently, it has been discovered that idempotent distributive properties allow such methods to address stochastic control and dynamic game problems, and this is opening up interesting new domains.  The project has four components.  The first is the further development of max-plus curse-of-dimensionality-free numerical methods, specifically extending the domain of applicability to diffusion processes.  Second, application of these methods to the control of quantum-spin in the case of open quantum systems where one has stochastic inputs. On the third front, the investigators are developing idempotent algebra-based methods for solution of linear, infinite-dimensional control and estimation problems where the dynamics are described by systems of PDEs.  The fourth component regards fundamental solutions of two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs) for conservative systems, in which case one may apply the Stationary Action Principle.  The fundamental solutions convert two-point boundary value problems into initial value problems via an idempotent convolution of the fundamental solution with a cost function related to the terminal data.  Moreover, as these are fundamental solutions, once computed, one can easily convert any of a large class of TPBVPs for that system and time duration into an initial value problem.  The investigators are also expanding this theory to cover the classic n-body problem.  There, it can be found that an n-body TPBVP, posed in terms of the stationary-action principle, can be converted into a differential game, and the fundamental solution can be obtained as a set in Euclidean space.<br/><br/>Optimal control has not generally been feasible due to the half-century old problem of the curse of dimensionality, whereby with classical grid-based approaches, the computational complexity grows exponentially fast with the dimension of the system being controlled. Max-plus based curse-of-dimensionality-free methods are not necessarily subject to this exponential growth.  Consequently, this research is opening up large application areas which were previously inaccessible.  Specific applications of interest (among many possible application domains) include spacecraft and aircraft guidance and control, quantum spin control, signal amplification for long fiber-optic networks, UAV sensor tasking operations and portfolio optimization.  The efforts on fundamental solutions for two-point boundary value problems will allow rapid solution of dynamical system problems where one seeks solutions of the dynamics for a variety of initial/terminal conditions.  That is, the fundamental solution allows one to use the same object repeatedly for varying initial and terminal data.  The applications of current interest include systems governed by linear, infinite-dimensional dynamics such as the standard heat and wave equations, as well as the n-body problem. In the latter case, applications could include rapid estimation of asteroid threats.  Extensions to other classes of potential fields, beyond gravitational, will also be considered."

Exploiting this latent structure in sampling and reconstruction strategies can dramatically increase algorithmic robustness to both noise and missing data.  The theory of compressed sensing shows that if a signal of interest is sparse --- that is, well-approximated by some small subset of a dictionary of basis elements, then the signal can be acquired from a reduced number of measurements and reconstructed using efficient convex programming techniques.   However, current compressed sensing theory is limited<br/>largely to finite-dimensional, well-conditioned, and uniformly bounded dictionaries, and these restrictions limit the scope of applications. Using notions such as variable-density and weighted sparsity, the investigator and her colleagues aim to develop a range of structure-dependent sampling theorems that merge finite-dimensional sparsity constraints with infinite-dimensional smoothness constraints, and which naturally extend the compressed sensing methodology to infinite-dimensional and unbounded function systems.  As a related goal of this proposal, the investigator has teamed up with professors in computer science and electrical engineering at UT Austin to develop an interdisciplinary statistical signal processing seminar series.   The investigator has also recently established the first Association for Women in Mathematics student chapter at UT Austin in order to foster the advancement of women in mathematics.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, this proposal puts forth theoretical tools that can be used to design strategies for acquiring high-dimensional data as efficiently as possible, given any known lower-dimensional structure of the data and within the framework of the acquisition process at hand. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one driving application.  Here, one would like to reduce the MRI scan time as much as possible while still acquiring a clear image of the brain, neck, or other internal structure. By exploiting the underlying structure of natural images, such as the localization of information content of the image to boundaries between different materials in the brain, MRI scanning technology can become significantly cheaper and faster, and preliminary experiments by the investigator and collaborators suggest that the  sampling strategies put forth in this proposal have the potential to speed up MRI scan timestenfold. Uncertainty Quantification is another application of the proposed research.  Here, one is interested in analyzing the sensitivity of high-dimensional nonlinear models to small changes in input parameters. Applications range from the design of civil infrastructure to be robust in the face of extreme climate, to the assessment of the stability for climate models with respect to perturbations in initial weather conditions. Generally speaking, Uncertainty Quantification involves repeatedly perturbing the initial conditions of the model at hand, simulating the model at each of these perturbations, and analyzing the resulting output statistics.  Since such simulations are expensive for high-dimensional nonlinear models, one would like to derive strategies for simulating perturbed input parameters so as to gain as much information about the model from as few simulations as possible.<br/><br/>"

The predictions of the model equations are applied to explain observed features of membrane behavior such as the appearance of sharp edges, vesicle bursting, and stability of the thin liquid film between membranes undergoing electrofusion.  The dynamics of a compound vesicle are also considered.  Generalizations of the lipid bilayer model to account for pores are studied.  Mathematically, these are challenging free boundary problems exhibiting complex dynamics.  Continuum theory is used to model the motion of the lipid membrane interface and the surrounding liquids, e.g., the Stokes equations for the flow in the bulk and a coupled system of partial differential equations describing the interface evolution and membrane charging.  The interface conditions are related to the jump in stress and electric potential across the interface and they depend on the geometry of the interface and several physical constants, e.g., the bending rigidity and membrane capacitance.  A computational method is developed to solve these complicated transient three-dimensional free-boundary problems.  Limiting cases are investigated analytically, using asymptotic and perturbation methods.  Recent experimental work is used as a guide in selecting our mathematical models.  An investigation beyond the range of the experimental situations is done to fully understand the models and as a guide to the development of more realistic models of cells. <br/><br/>     The dynamics and stability of biomembranes is at the heart of cellular function.  The electromechanics of biomembranes is an area that is largely unexplored.  This project uses methods from applied mathematics and ideas from continuum theory, and applies them in a biological setting.  This expands the frontiers of these disciplines.  The outcomes of this project directly impact biomedical technologies that employ membrane electroporation (e.g. gene transfection) or cell fusion.  The interconversion of electric and mechanical energies, one example being the membrane flexoelectricity (bending in response to electric fields), could be exploited for novel micro- and nano-fluidic designs.  The project is interdisciplinary and this is very beneficial for the education and development of the undergraduate and graduate students associated with the project."

This necessitates the use of various approximate macroscopic effective models in practice. The passage from the stochastic microscopic equations modeling a particular physical system to the large-scale model is a highly non-trivial problem in itself. The goal of the first part of the project is to develop new tools and better understanding of such effective limits, especially in the regime when random media have long range correlations that lead to multiple temporal and spatial scales for various physical phenomena. The second part of the project investigates the qualitative behavior of solutions of reaction-diffusion equations, in particular, those that arise in stochastic particle systems, such as branching Brownian motion,  and other Brunet-Derrida systems.  Another set of problems involves reaction-diffusion equations that arise in biology, such as chemotactic models, and ecology involving population dynamics in heterogenous environments. <br/><br/>This project carries out mathematical studies of physical systems, and wave propagation in cluttered environments and of reaction-diffusion processes.  These studies are relevant to several branches of science, ranging from biomedical imaging questions to geophysics, fluid dynamics, and biology. Imaging in a cluttered environment, whether it is a human body, earth interior, or foliage, is inherently unstable because of media complexity. One objective of this project is to develop imaging methods that are less sensitive to unpredictable fluctuations of the clutter.  Another area of this project concerns the mathematical description of the mixing effects of a fluid flow on chemical and biological reactions. Turbulent fluid flow plays an important role in many reaction phenomena: it may drastically enhance the rate of reaction, leading to higher efficiency, or, in some situations, extinguish the chemical process. The project will address these issues in simpler mathematical models to illuminate the mechanisms present in the full problem."

The investigator extends recent successes in the analysis of globally minimizing and locally minimizing quasi-static evolutions to both locally stable quasi-static evolutions and dynamic evolutions.  One goal is to develop and study new models for cohesive fracture and plasticity with softening, based on local stability rather than global minimality (which is mathematically problematic).

Such models are used especially for biological processes on small scales, in which the interface exerts a force on the fluid. The work to be done will focus on the efficient computation of surface integrals representing viscosity-dominated flow, or Stokes flow, and error analysis of finite difference methods for more general Navier-Stokes flow, such as the immersed interface method, in which the equations are discretized on a regular grid, with modifications near the interface to account for the forces. The methods considered should be at least second-order accurate. In the first project a relatively simple method will be developed for computing singular or nearly singular integrals on smooth surfaces, such as the velocity integrals for three-dimensional Stokes flow, evaluated on or near the surface. This work will improve and generalize earlier work, in which a standard quadrature of a regularized integral is combined with corrections found by analysis near the singularity. This method should be accurate even for grid points near the surface, allowing more flexibility in computing the motion of the surface. It could be used as part of a computation for Navier-Stokes flow. In the second project, error estimates in maximum norm will be derived for finite difference methods such as the immersed interface method. Recent results of the proposer showing a gain in regularity for finite difference versions of Poisson or diffusion equations will be used to clarify the relationship between the accuracy of numerical solutions and the corrections needed near the interface and also the choice of time discretization. The work will include convergence proofs for simplified interface problems with Navier-Stokes flow and maximum norm stability of the approximate projection on divergence-free vector fields. <br/><br/>A number of scientific problems involve moving boundaries in fluids, such as a drop of one fluid in another, or the motion of an elastic membrane in living tissue. Numerical study of such problems has special difficulties, since it is desirable to discretize the fluid variables on a fixed grid, while the moving boundary must be represented separately, together with its influence on the fluid motion. It is difficult to discretize the moving surface in a way that is simple and practical. For Stokes flow, dominated by viscosity, integral formulations of the fluid variables are widely used. The proposed method of integration promises to be simpler and more efficient than standard methods and require less effort with the surface. Thus it could contribute to the practicality of three-dimensional simulations as the models become more realistic. The second project emphasizes estimates of maximum errors, since these are likely to be largest near interfaces. They are less well developed than estimates in integral norms. Such estimates will be used for methods such as the immersed interface method, the decomposition of Navier-Stokes flow mentioned above, and approximate projection methods. Error analysis of existing numerical methods should improve understanding of their validity and limitations. It can also show how choices in the methods affect their accuracy and suggest improvements."

The motivation for this research comes from a systematic study of mathematical models for cancer treatment that combine various structures that form the tumor microenvironment. In modern oncology, a tumor is viewed as not just cancerous cells, but as a system of interacting components that in various ways aid and abet the tumor (e.g., the tumor vasculature), but also fight it (e.g., the immune system). Current treatments therefore are multi-targeted therapies that not only kill cancer cells, but also include antiangiogenic therapy, immunotherapy and many other options. The search for best ways of administering these therapeutic agents naturally leads to formulations as multi-input nonlinear optimal control problems. The aim of the research is to develop local syntheses of optimal controls for such systems, a difficult task even for single-input systems with only partial results known. These new results will be developed in connection with the study of systems that describe (i) cancer treatment within the complex context of the tumor microenvironment and (ii) optimal strategies for the control of the spread of diseases in epidemiology. In the latter field, mathematical models have been a relevant tool in analyzing the underlying dynamics, whereas in this project a much less explored optimal control approach to the problem will be pursued. While one aim is to develop general methods and procedures that have wide applicability, a second important aspect of the research is to provide qualitative and quantitative insights into the structure of optimal solutions for important real-life problems. Motivated by timely problems in biomedicine, like how to design metronomic chemotherapy protocols, challenging problems in optimal control theory will be considered whose solutions require developing new tools and methods. Because of its applied and interdisciplinary character, the project is expected to be of strong interest to students from mathematics and engineering and consequently it contains a substantial educational component. Efforts to attract women and minorities will be continued and expanded by reaching out to engineering students where participation of these groups is particularly low.<br/><br/>In modern oncology, a tumor is viewed as not just cancerous cells, but as a system of interacting components that in various ways aid and abet the tumor (e.g., the tumor vasculature), but also fight it (e.g., the immune system).  Current treatments therefore are multi-targeted therapies that not only kill cancer cells, but also include antiangiogenic therapy, immunotherapy and many other options. It is very difficult and expensive to test complex multi-target protocols in medical trials. For this reason, the analysis of mathematical models becomes of intrinsic value. The medical community has become more and more aware that not only what drug is given, but also how it is administered, i.e., dosage, frequency and sequencing, can have a major impact on the outcome of the treatment. This led to a recently launched ""Metronomics Global Health Initiative"". The proposed research is motivated by the biomedical ideas of this initiative and the investigators believe that the tools of geometric optimal control are best suited to give mathematical answers to these questions and thus provide insights into how a metronomic protocol should be designed. Regarding a second topic, infectious diseases continue to be one of the most important health problems worldwide. In this project, the investigators seek theoretical results that can give practical guidelines how to pursue joint efforts of vaccination and treatment in an optimal way to maximize the effectiveness and minimize the social economic cost.

Lions (Fields Medalist) and J.M. Lasry, a few years ago. It is a remarkable idea to transfer a well known approach of Physics to Social Sciences.  The concept of Mean Field in physics attempts to describe the effect of the media on the motion of a particle, this media being composed of an infinite number of particles, similar to the individual one.  Conversely in economics, models consider that agents interact through markets (real and financial) and equilibrium can be obtained through prices. It has been widely acknowledged that these types of models cannot realistically address all the phenomena that one can observe in real life, for instance the issue of systemic risk.  <br/><br/>Mean Field Games is a novel approach to understand what is missing in the models.  It has been a spectacular success.  Besides economics and finance, it has been very fruitful in many areas such as: traffic control, network analysis, as well as in understanding how technology can expand, and how environmental aspects impact growth.  It turns out that the theory can handle also many new considerations of risk management. Independently of the applications, these concepts have completely changed control theory, differential games and introduced new types of partial differential systems.  However, Mean Field Games is limited to agents who are identical, like particles.  This is a serious limitation, since in social sciences, unlike in physics, the reality is more a situation of coalitions or dominant players.  This is the major objective of this proposal: To study extensions to consider coalitions. One has to solve much more complex systems of partial differential equations. A second objective is to develop an Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation approach to Mean Field Control Type problems, which has never been done before, because of a basic difficulty, called ""Time inconsistency"" inherent to Mean Field Control (different from Mean Field Games). A third objective is to develop ideas relevant to risk analysis, in which one cannot be satisfied in optimizing an average.  Since risk aspects have become predominant in engineering as well as in economics, this direction can have very broad implications, in many areas of strategic importance."

The simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation in complex structures gives rise to a host of significant computational challenges that result from oscillatory solutions, low-fidelity representations of complex geometries, and ill-conditioning in the low and high-frequency regimes. The recent efforts of the investigator and his collaborators resulted in the development and analysis of a highly efficient computational methodology which resolved several of these difficulties and whose extension, proposed hereby, will enable the investigator to fulfill an ambitious plan: to simulate with high fidelity realistic scattering environments.<br/>"

In several models and for certain types of risks, the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE for short) provides the price of the risk. The complexity of the pricing PDE increases with the dimension of the problem and with the complication of the non-linear components of the model. One of the major features of Monte Carlo methods is to be less sensitive to the dimension of the problem than other evaluation methods, as the dimension grows with the number of uncorrelated risk factors. For a significant class of PDEs, i.e. for fully non-linear parabolic equations, designing an appropriate Monte Carlo method is challenging. Recently, new work by the PI and his colleagues opened the door to progress. This award will exploit these advances in theoretical and practical aspects of Monte Carlo schemes for fully non-linear parabolic PDEs and will also incorporate existing ideas in the simpler linear and semi-linear cases. The project will relax the assumptions that had to made previously and will result in schemes for more general situations, such as fully non-linear parabolic equations, nonlinear terms that are neither concave and nor convex, or non-Lipschitzian terms. The convergence of such schemes will be analyzed and asymptotic results for the rate of convergence will be derived. In addition, more problematic PDE's, i.e. degenerate PDEs will be considered. The award will also support the study of so called non-monotone Monte Carlo schemes. Such schemes are observed to converge faster in practice than monotone schemes, but the rigorous mathematical verification of this improved convergence still presents difficulties at the theoretical level, which in turn impedes further broad progress. The theoretical discoveries will be verified by implementing them in practical numerical schemes. This implementation will involve undergraduate students in the context of a summer REU program. Students will be trained in a class of state-of-the-art numerical techniques that have wide practical applications.<br/><br/><br/>The award will support the development of computational methods that are useful in quantitative finance. Traditional methods for this task are known to be quite accurate, but are limited to situations of low complexity. So-called Monte Carlo methods, which employ simulated random experiments, are known to avoid this bottleneck (at some well-known loss of accuracy), but so far have been limited to cases with special (linear or nearly linear) structure. This project will extend computational Monte Carlo schemes to situations with more general non-linear structure. The results of this project will help mathematicians and financial engineers to test new models by comparing their outcome with the patterns in the market and thus help to extend our knowledge about financial markets. Specifically, the project will provide efficient methods for performing computations in the models. At the immediate application level, the project will contribute to progress in the practical aspects of risk pricing, i.e. to develop faster and more reliable evaluations of financial derivatives and of risk related products. Moreover, there are potential applications also in other areas of engineering, for e.g. noise reduction in image processing. The breadth of applications of this research project is also expected to attract students from mathematics and other disciplines. The award will support undergraduate students through summer research experiences and train them in an exciting and accessible area, and the results obtained from this research will be integrated into classes. The award will also be used to disseminate the results within the mathematical research community and beyond."

These models embody several challenges: moving interface between two types of fluids which leads to strong nonlinearity of the resulting models, and different physics in different parts of the physical domain which leads to the coupling of subsystems of different types. Although these two difficult issues have been studied before in separate contexts, the physical need of two phase fluid flow in karstic geometry requires us to investigate the two issues in a coupled fashion. This is a challenge that has not been addressed so far. The PI and collaborators plan to investigate the models from several different angles. Firstly, we will investigate the mathematical well-posedeness of models. Secondly, we will study the sharp interface limit. Thirdly, we will design and implement accurate and efficient numerical methods for the models so that the results can be compared to experimental results. These are highly non-trivial tasks due to the highly nonlinear nature of the coupled systems, and the disparity of physical and mathematical mechanism in the porous media and in the conduit. The sharp interface limit is a highly nonlinear singular perturbation problem which is known to be a challenge. We will combine tools from partial differential equations, functional analysis, asymptotic analysis, numerical analysis and computation, and laboratory experiments to investigate these problems.<br/><br/>Geometric configurations that contain both conduit (or vug) and porous media is termed karstic geometry. It is known that the study of multiphase flow in karstic geometry is of great importance in many applications such as groundwater study, fuel cell technology, petroleum engineering and carbon-dioxide sequestration. The successful completion of the investigation on the validity of the models proposed here will help us better understand several important two fluid phenomena in karstic geometry. We also believe that the methodologies to be developed may be expanded to investigate more complex models that involve phase transition, and large density ratio. The better understanding of these important problems could lead to better engineering processes and better science based environmental policies."

Common to these interaction problems are the huge inherent scale separations between the different dynamical components of the flow, which render a direct numerical simulation hopeless and which also introduce a stochastic component to the system dynamics because the small-scale components are only partially observable. Hence the study involves the mathematical investigation of various systems of multidimensional nonlinear PDEs using a combination of asymptotic analysis, stochastic modeling, and numerical computation, all with an eye towards ultimate applications in the real world that are relevant to climate science and nuclear fusion.  Specifically, the study consists of three projects. The first considers a special kind of small-scale internal gravity wave in the ocean and its interactions with mean currents near the sea floor, the second considers random particle motion induced by deep-ocean internal waves in the presence of forcing and dissipation, and the third investigates the wave-turbulence jigsaw puzzle posed by interactions between strong drift waves and strong zonal flows in the problem of plasma confinement in tokamaks.<br/><br/>Atmosphere ocean dynamics relevant to climate science contains a vast span of active dynamical scales, from millimeters and milliseconds associated with sound waves to planetary scales and decades associated with large-scale ocean circulations, for example. All these scales are dynamically coupled together through a wide variety of nonlinear interactions and this is where fundamental mathematical theory can make a decisive contribution, namely by reducing these interactions into more tractable and understandable components that can then be simulated with significantly greater ease. Analogous comments apply to plasma dynamics that is relevant to fusion research and the behavior of tokamak devices. Hence, results from this theoretical study may feed into the future design of next generation atmosphere ocean forecasting systems for weather and climate, which is of great societal importance, and they should also strengthen the fundamental principles that feed into the design of nuclear fusion devices in tokamaks."

The PI considers the problem on a partial differential equation (PDE) model. Specifically the PI uses a nonlinear Schrodinger equation coupled to the trajectory of a classical particle, obtained after taking the mean field limit on the Bose Einstein condensate. The PI will prove the following three results: (1) if the initial speed of the classical particle is higher than the speed of sound in the Bose Einstein condensate, i.e. supersonic, then the particle will decelerate due to the friction until the speed reaches the speed of sound, (2) if the initial speed of the particle is subsonic, then the particle will travel ballistically as the time goes to infinity, (3) the whole system will converge to some inertial mode. Technically, the PI has to develop a better understanding of integro-differential equations, together with other techniques in nonlinear PDEs, for example Fermi Golden rules. The second problem is the resonance problem. The PI wants to consider the problem in the context of linear and nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Very often the presence of degeneracy, or resonance, in perturbation expansions makes the problem hard. The PI hopes to develop a better understanding of normal form transformations, and then to tackle some of the problems in Schrodinger equations. The third problem is to develop a new method for geometric flows, specifically mean curvature flow and Ricci flow. Different from the previous works, by Huisken for example, the PI mainly uses modulation equations and spectral analysis to perform almost precise estimates, instead of the maximum principle and entropy estimates. Hopefully the PI can solve some open problems here. For example, in the context of mean curvature flow, the evolving surface will collapse in finite time and form a cylinder around the collapsing point. However, whether the cylinder is unique is an open problem. The PI hopes to solve it, also a similar problem in Ricci flow.<br/><br/>Quantum friction has many applications nowadays. One example is to test the speed of particles, for example neutrinos, by shooting the particle to some medium, for example argon. This phenomenon is known as Cerenkov radiation (Noble prize 1958). Despite its importance, the mathematical understanding of Cerenkov radiation is not satisfactory. In a broader context, the problem is in the class of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and quantum fluid, which are popular at the moment. The second problem, the resonance problem, will deepen the understanding of normal form transformations, and help to tackle other problems, for example, in dynamical system (specifically KAM theory), and spin model in quantum mechanics. For the third problem, in the recent years, people have applied mean curvature flow to classify topological structures of different surfaces, and have estimated the amount of mass in general relativity. The PI's techniques provide more precise information on the evolution of the surfaces. Hopefully the PI's method will find applications there."

The specific goals are first to identify characteristics of both the investor and the market that endogenously lead to large holdings, and second to determine the effects of large positions on pricing, price impact, portfolio optimization, and risk management.  Because large positions induce extreme sensitivity to rare unexpected events, the theory of Large Deviations is well suited for this analysis.  In particular, using Large Deviations in conjunction with utility-based theory on optimal position sizes, the investigator studies when, if ever, a risk-averse agent acting in an incomplete market should take a large position in a non-traded risky asset.  Regarding the issue of pricing and hedging, it is well known that in incomplete markets investor preferences affect the price at which one is willing to buy a claim.  Typically, closed-form expressions for utility based prices are unavailable and some approximation is necessary.  Existing approximations are only valid for small position sizes and thus large holdings approximations provide a natural counterpart.  In addition to determining asymptotic prices, the investigator identifies the key components of the investor's utility that drive such prices.  Lastly, examples show that large positions arise in conjunction with asymptotically complete markets: the investigator thus seeks to extend this notion beyond the current one, which focuses on weak convergence of asset price laws, to a more natural notion in terms of the asymptotic ability to hedge.  Once extended, questions regarding continuity with respect to market completeness are considered.<br/><br/>     From a rigorous mathematical perspective, the investigator seeks to understand the rapid growth in over-the-counter derivatives markets during the previous two decades.  Given the complexity of many of these products, it is not clear why a bank, or some other financial institution, would wish to take on a large position in a claim, especially given the lack of perfect hedging strategies or liquid markets.  The investigator thus studies when, if ever, a financial institution should own a significant notional amount of a derivative contract.  Additionally, given such a position, the investigator aims to determine the impacts in terms of pricing, hedging, and over-all risk that a financial institution faces."

The first equation is for the determining modes of a differential equation of Navier-Stokes type. A set of low modes is determining, if for any solution on the global attractor, the high modes of the solution for all time, can be produced from only the low modes (for all time). Extending this relationship to the Banach space of bounded functions from the reals into the low modes leads to a determining form, an evolution equation that is globally Lipschitz, and dissipative. The global attractor of the original differential equation is contained in the long time behavior of the determining form.  This provides an alternative to the theory of inertial forms which is not known to be applicable to the Navier-Stokes equations. The other evolution equation is for the radius of analyticity in the spatial variable.  We will use this equation to study the domain of analyticity for solutions on the global attractor and its effect on aspects of fluid flow such as intermittency.<br/><br/>Fluid motions at large scales, for instance in ocean and atmosphere, display erratic, seemingly incomprehensible (turbulent) features when viewed locally and for short times. However, over time, consistent global statistical patterns emerge. The purpose of this research is to develop a rigorous understanding of the nature and origin of such patterns, and of deviations from it, with a view towards diverse applications such as ocean modeling and weather forecasting. For instance, weather forecasting is done by solving a large system of equations which model the state of the atmosphere over a period of time.<br/>The current state of the atmosphere is needed as input in order to compute the state in the future.  As there are always limited measurements of the state of the system, this input inevitably contains some error. The inherent sensitivity of the system to such an error means that as time goes on the computed solution diverges from reality. The technique of data assimilation uses the limited measurements of the system at not just a single moment of time, but rather over an extended time period in the past, to arrive at a more accurate input.  This project applies recent mathematical discoveries to develop new variations on this technique. It will lead to new algorithms that will be implemented and tested by the research team.  Graduate students will play an essential role in this collaborative effort, thus serving to train future generation of scientists in the STEM disciplines."

When the weight vector is equal to zero  wCP reduces to CP. With nonzero weight vectors the theory of wCP becomes more complicated than the theory of CP. The aim of this project is to investigate the analytic and geometric properties of wCP and to develop efficient algorithms for computing its solution. The investigator focuses on finding sufficient conditions ensuring the convexity of the solution set of wCP, on studying different central paths for wCP and the relationship between their curvatures and the computational complexity of the corresponding path-following algorithms, and on establishing the analyticity of certain central paths. The latter property has implications on the superlinear convergence of the path-following algorithms. These questions are not trivial even for linear wCP over the non-negative orthant, but they become very difficult in the nonlinear case and/or for more general cones such as the second order cone or the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. The intellectual merit of the project lies in understanding  the theoretical properties of wCP and the computational complexity of interior point methods for solving wCP. This extends existing theory from CP to a more general class of problems. The generalization for wCP is highly nontrivial and  requires invention of new mathematical techniques.<br/><br/>In recent years the scientific community has embarked on a sustained research effort for understanding computability of market equilibria, motivated in part by the emergence of highly lucrative markets on the internet. Formulating an equilibrium problem as a wCP opens the possibility of devising highly efficient algorithms for its numerical solution. For example, Fisher's  competitive market equilibrium model can be formulated as a wCP, while the Arrow-Debreu competitive market equilibrium problem (due to Nobel prize laureates Kenneth Joseph Arrow and Gerard Debreu) can be formulated as a self-dual wCP. The original proofs of existence of  solutions to the Fisher and Arrow-Debreu equilibrium problems were nonconstructive. One of the objectives of the present project is to formulate a large class of market equilibrium problems and game-theoretical problems as wCPs that are amenable to efficient computation. The broader impacts of the proposed research are significant because the applicability of wCP extends beyond market equilibrium problems. In this research program, the investigator aims at identifying several classes of problems in science and engineering that can be modeled as wCP. Studying theoretical properties of wCPs and developing robust algorithms for their numerical solution will provide the scientific community with new modeling and computational tools that are likely to have a positive impact on the US economy."

These include most notably the spectral theory of such nonlinear coherent states, structural phase transitions thereof, reductions to particle-based dynamical models with interesting nonlinear bifurcation phenomena, and computational tools to monitor the existence, stability and dynamics of vortex clusters. Also, a multi-component generalization of these themes will be considered in the recently established direction of spin-orbit coupled BECs. These contain a more complex operator structure within the nonlinear problem, with a linear part featuring both a dispersive (Laplacian) and a Dirac-like part and the interplay of these terms and their impact on nonlinear states such as dark or bright solitons and vortices will be studied. The results in this direction will be compared to ongoing experiments by a collaborating experimental group at Washington State University.  <br/><br/>This research is expected to provide a new generation of both theoretical and computational tools for studying nonlinear coherent structures with a particular view towards the pristine atomic physics setup of Bose-Einstein condensates. Furthermore, the theoretical/mathematical tools developed here will bear broader impacts towards areas such as spectral theory and nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations, among others. It is also envisioned that our findings will create connections with a number of areas  of Physics such as Fluid Dynamics, Nonlinear Optics and Statistical Mechanics (of Phase Transitions). On the other hand, the developed computational tools will explore the interface between numerical bifurcation theory, dynamical system and even Monte-Carlo/Molecular Dynamics techniques and their potential use for the physical system at hand.  Importantly, the research will be a genuine synergy in truly Applied Mathematics, involving not only the development of theoretical methods and computational techniques, but also their direct connection with physical experiments. Finally, the project will be critically focused on sustaining a dynamic and multi-disciplinary team with a strong and diverse core of graduate students and hence will be consistently geared towards having a significant set of broader impacts. The relevant research will be disseminated via high quality journal publications both in Mathematics and in Physics and will be presented at Nonlinear Science and Mathematical Physics conferences both in the US and abroad."

The main goals of the work are: (1) provide classes of rational, accurate models for understanding the often exotic behavior of such systems under various loadings; (2) systematically find their locally stable equilibria (corresponding to local minima of the total potential energy) as loading and/or composition parameters vary, particularly as small parameters like thickness, inter-facial capillarity, etc., asymptotically approach zero.  Goal (2) is inextricably linked to (1).  The investigator employs rational continuum models, characterized by general constitutive functions, to study questions of existence, thresholds of bifurcation and instability, and the structure of local energy minima.  The work is highly interdisciplinary, requiring tools and perspectives from several areas of mathematics as well as biophysics and materials science. <br/><br/>     The investigator undertakes fundamental modeling and mathematical analysis enabling a quantitative, predictive characterization of the behavior of certain structures and solids under applied loading: lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles, thin films and the nucleation and progression of damage/fracture zones in solids.  Each of these has direct and important connections to basic science and technology -- especially biotechnology and materials and manufacturing.  For example, lipid-bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems; understanding and predicting their mechanical behavior is crucial for understanding cell function.  The project focuses on understanding the behavior of man-made membranes or liposomes under changes in osmotic pressure, temperature, or composition.  The future promise of liposome vesicles (closed membranes) as vehicles for drug delivery demands a fundamental understanding of their multi-phase mechanical behavior under loading and change of composition.  Associated with this, but also of more general interest, is the wrinkling of thin films, which also shows up in the design of many thin devices or coatings, fabric-like structures, in the behavior of human skin, etc.  The investigator studies the onset and development of wrinkles in very thin structures in highly stretched environments.  Finally, the fracture of solids, a well-known culprit behind sudden and catastrophic failures in structures, is also currently of great interest for purposes of harvesting natural gas.  Predictive models, which are especially lacking in this field, are addressed in this project.  In particular, he studies the onset and development of damage leading to fracture of solids under loading."

One distance metric on the space of planar shapes is realized by identifying this space as a subset of the Universal Teichmueller Space, and equipping it with the Weil-Petersson metric. This results in a metric that is scale- and translation-invariant on shapes, and has unique geodesic flow between two shape endpoints. The work of this proposal develops robust computational methods for the computation of metric distances and geodesics between shapes on this space. The major difficulty lies in computations involving ""crowded"" shapes, i.e., those with elongated, winding, or extended protrusions. Such shapes stymie finite-precision computations because direct algorithms suffer from severe roundoff error. The major thrusts of this proposal develop algorithmic methodologies to address roundoff error and related issues: The Zipper conformal mapping algorithm will be augmented to produce accurate conformal maps for crowded shapes. The velocity field representation on a geodesic will be rewritten into a form that is resistant to roundoff error. The geodesic equation will be transformed into a expression that takes advantage of the aforementioned velocity field transformation, and can effectively flow between crowded shapes. The final phase of this project will demonstrate accurate geodesic flow and distance computations between crowded shapes. The methods developed under this project can be applied to several related problems in scientific computing: solutions to differential equations on irregular geometries through conformal mapping, conservative integration methods with ill-conditioned particle systems, and moving-mesh kernel approximations.<br/><br/>The work of this project can contribute to far-reaching applications in scientific and computer vision problems: automated object recognition (e.g. projectile identification), outline classification (determination of an animal's species), medical imaging (usage of MRI to diagnose dementia and related diseases), and artificial intelligence (visual recognition and interpretation) to name a few. All computational deliverables (computer code, example simulations, documentation) will be made publicly available.

The property of the medium is modeled by a function of three variables, loosely called the potential, and the acoustic wave satisfies the wave equation with the zeroth order term coefficient being the potential. The PI proposes studying two specific problems. In the first problem, the medium is probed by a plane wave and the medium response is measured in the same direction as the incoming wave, over a long enough time interval. This data is measured for incoming waves from all possible directions (the back-scattering data) and the goal is to recover the potential. The PI proposes studying the special case when the potential is analytic in the angular variables, by adapting Volterra type methods and using scales of Banach spaces - an idea used by Romanov on a different inverse problem. The PI proposes also using a time domain interpretation of the back-scattering problem which he has already used successfully to obtain new uniqueness results for certain restricted classes of potentials. In the second problem, the medium is excited by a point source placed at the center of the medium, the medium response is measured at the boundary for a long enough time period, and the goal, again, is the recovery of the potential. There are one dimensional versions of this problem, even with interior measurements, which remain unsolved with the chief difficulty being that the response is measured at points away from the source so that Volterra type methods such as layer stripping or downward continuation are not applicable. The PI proposes studying these problems with the help of Carleman estimates using results of Ionescu and Klainerman which give easily verifiable conditions for constructing radial Carleman weights.<br/><br/>This work will be of interest to people working in geophysics, oil prospecting, medical imaging, fiber-optics, and in any area where one wishes to determine the properties of the interior of a medium from the response of the medium, measured on the boundary, to an acoustic wave generated at the boundary. The PI will supervise graduate students who will work on these problems towards a PhD and possible careers in the energy industry, the medical devices industry or in academia. Undergraduate students may study discrete versions of these problems in one space dimension. The results of this work will be disseminated through graduate seminars, publications in research journals, and presentations at conferences and introductory workshops for non-specialists."

Such systems originally were considered in statistical mechanics, however in recent years studies in many different fields have led to similar stochastic dynamical models. Some examples include, loss network models, default clustering in large portfolios, chemotactic response dynamics, and belief systems in social sciences. The basic mathematical object is the empirical measure of the trajectories of the collection of particles. There is extensive work on the law of large number behavior(LLN), central limit theory and large deviation results for this object. For example, under conditions, this measure under a large particle limit converges to a deterministic measure that is characterized through a nonlinear evolution equation known as the McKean-Vlasov equation. Most of the existing theory concerns the behavior of the system on a finite time horizon. In the proposed work the interest is in the long time behavior of the empirical measure process and its LLN limit. More precisely, the goal is to develop a systematic stability theory for the associated Mckean-Vlasov equation, and to study its consequences for the time asymptotic behavior of the interacting particle system. Three specific families of models will be studied: (A) Finite state Markovian systems arising from communication networks; (B) Models for active biological transport; (C) Opinion dynamics models.<br/> <br/>In many applications the time asymptotic behavior of an interacting particle system of the above form  is of central concern. For example, in communication systems stability and control is fundamental and one is interested in system design and control protocols that keep the state processes in the neighborhoods of desirable operating conditions over long periods of time. In applications coming from biological systems, one is primarily interested in describing aggregation, self organization and other pattern formations in the steady state of the system. In social science applications, such as opinion dynamics modeling, one of the key goals is to understand long term consensus formation mechanisms. All of these topics have in common the feature that they are related to the behavior of the large time limit of the associated empirical measure process, the study of which is the central goal of this research.  Research in (A) will lead to ideas for improved design, stability, and regulation of complex communication networks. Research in (B) will provide insight and understanding for diverse pattern formations observed in biological systems. Research in (C) will enable development of minimal intervention protocols that lead to desirable long term consensus patterns."

Emphasis is given to problems in mathematical and control-theoretic areas which are rather unexplored, such as: gas flow-structure interaction in aeroelasticity; elastic structure-flow interaction with moving interface; structural acoustic interaction with a non-shallow shell as active curved wall and a nonlinear acoustic Westervalt-Kuznetesov chamber (based on Fourier Law of Heat Flux) or Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson chamber (based on Maxwell-Cattaneo Law), both arising in High Intensity Ultrasound focusing.<br/><br/>Mathematical control theory injects in the study of differential equations the active viewpoint of an external agent or manipulator, who is not satisfied with just passively observing or contemplating the evolution of a natural phenomenon; but instead seeks to intervene as to influence and modify its dynamical behavior, in order to achieve a preassigned outcome.

In addition, the PI hopes to continue to explore the strongly nonlinear effects relating to frequency cascades in Hamiltonian models on compact domains.  The bulk of the project will focus on understanding theoretically the existence and regularity of solutions to strongly nonlinear models, as well as studying local and global dynamics of special solutions within these complex models.

There is a dearth of techniques for determining the stability of structures in spaces of dimension greater than one, including, for instance, the physical three-dimensional space in which we live. This lack of methodology has severely hampered the use of mathematical techniques in many application areas and the work of the investigator and collaborators under this award will address this important issue.<br/><br/>The focus of the work under this award will be on criteria for the stability of particular states of a system that are based on intrinsic features of that state.

The underlying ideas are rooted in dynamical systems and thus have been almost exclusively in one space dimension. The goal of this work is to build a viable theory for multi-dimensional domains. The approach will place the multi-dimensional problem in a dynamical systems context by introducing a domain sweeping technique that parametrizes the domain with the boundaries of shrinking domains. A key bridging role between the domain and solution geometry, on the one hand, and the spectrum of the linearized operator on the other, is played by the Maslov index. In this multi- dimensional context aninfinite-dimensional formulation is necessary and this will be further developed and adapted to the conditions of the specific problems. A particular focus will be on problems from Bose-Einstein condensates and fluid mechanics. Sought will be results that relate information about the underlying structure to the spectrum of the linearization of the dynamic equation.

The majority of the effort is focused on the following three themes: (i) Recent developments have enabled detailed measurements of the properties of a class of suspensions known as thixotropic yield stress fluids. An example is the flow of ketchup under applied stresses. Prior theoretical models require the input of measured quantities such as a yield stress, or to pose a phenomenological equation for the structure of the microcomponents. In contrast, a new mathematical perspective is explored in this project, in which yielding is an output of a systematically derived viscoelastic constitutive model in the limit of large relaxation time. Direct numerical simulations, in conjunction with multi-scale perturbation techniques based on slow and fast time scales, will enable the prediction of several experimentally observed phenomena, such as the hysteretic loop for up-down ramping of applied stress. (ii) The technological drive toward smaller scales has spawned new modeling and simulation challenges for droplet evolution in devices that are as small as the droplet itself. Confinement can enhance drop elongation, lead to new modes of drop breakup, and introduce numerical difficulties with respect to the constitutive laws and interface tracking. Capillary-focusing is a recently developed technology for the production of monodisperse submicron-sized droplets, which is not completely understood. This project sheds light on the physical mechanisms at work, by modeling the Hele-Shaw geometry and with direct numerical simulations. (iii) The advantages in combining the desired properties of two different liquids to produce a new blended mixture are well known. The quality of the blend is strongly dependent on the size of the dispersed droplets and their  distribution. Therefore, it is of practical importance to understand how a droplet evolves in a matrix fluid, and to predict the influence of the rheological properties of each constituent.  A novel viscoelastic height function algorithm will be developed and implemented in this project, and optimized for drop breakup simulations with possibly high gradients of stress. <br/><br/>This project contributes to the understanding of physical mechanisms that control practical applications, such as recycling plastics for environmental sustainability, predicting the dynamics of droplets and particulates in confined flows for biomedical drug delivery, and understanding fundamental processes that improve nanofluidic technology for the pharmaceutical industry. The use of a computational infrastructure such as XSEDE will enable direct numerical simulations for comparison with experimental data. The knowledge gained from this research will be disseminated to a broader scientific audience at conferences on mathematics, physics and engineering, and through journal publications. The outcomes include the training of graduate students, outreach to the local K-12 audience, and cross-disciplinary partnerships."

The project will extend the recent collaborative work of the PIs on the theme of vortex dynamics in trapped condensates. There, we will explore both connections with experimental results obtained by a collaborating experimental group at Amherst College and ones with other areas of mathematics and physics. These include most notably the spectral theory of such nonlinear coherent states, structural phase transitions thereof, reductions to particle-based dynamical models with interesting nonlinear bifurcation phenomena, and computational tools to monitor the existence, stability and dynamics of vortex clusters. Also, a multi-component generalization of these themes will be considered in the recently established direction of spin-orbit coupled BECs. These contain a more complex operator structure within the nonlinear problem, with a linear part featuring both a dispersive (Laplacian) and a Dirac-like part and the interplay of these terms and their impact on nonlinear states such as dark or bright solitons and vortices will be studied. The results in this direction will be compared to ongoing experiments by a collaborating experimental group at Washington State University.  <br/><br/>This research is expected to provide a new generation of both theoretical and computational tools for studying nonlinear coherent structures with a particular view towards the pristine atomic physics setup of Bose-Einstein condensates. Furthermore, the theoretical/mathematical tools developed here will bear broader impacts towards areas such as spectral theory and nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations, among others. It is also envisioned that our findings will create connections with a number of areas  of Physics such as Fluid Dynamics, Nonlinear Optics and Statistical Mechanics (of Phase Transitions). On the other hand, the developed computational tools will explore the interface between numerical bifurcation theory, dynamical system and even Monte-Carlo/Molecular Dynamics techniques and their potential use for the physical system at hand.  Importantly, the research will be a genuine synergy in truly Applied Mathematics, involving not only the development of theoretical methods and computational techniques, but also their direct connection with physical experiments. Finally, the project will be critically focused on sustaining a dynamic and multi-disciplinary team with a strong and diverse core of graduate students and hence will be consistently geared towards having a significant set of broader impacts. The relevant research will be disseminated via high quality journal publications both in Mathematics and in Physics and will be presented at Nonlinear Science and Mathematical Physics conferences both in the US and abroad."

The investigator studies stress-driven patterns involving wrinkles, folds, delamination, and other defects, with particular emphasis on situations where the energy-minimizing pattern develops fine-scale structure as the sheet thickness tends to zero.  His approach is to focus on how the minimum energy scales with respect to the sheet thickness and other relevant physical parameters. <br/>(b) The second thrust concerns surface-energy-driven coarsening of two-phase mixtures.  The investigator studies a family of nonlocal evolutions from the physics literature, which generalize the relatively well-understood model of ""Cahn-Hilliard dynamics.""  The focus here is on understanding the large-time coarsening rate. <br/>(c) The third thrust concerns prediction with expert advice (a topic from the machine learning literature).  The investigator's goal is a fresh perspective on some regret-minimization-based algorithms for prediction.  He views regret minimization as a robust control problem and considers a suitable scaling limit in which the associated value function solves a differential equation. <br/><br/>     The investigator studies three interdisciplinary topics.  The first two lie at the interface where mathematics meets physics and materials science, while the third lies at the interface with machine learning.  In each area, challenges from applications drive the development of new mathematical methods.  For example, the work on thin elastic sheets is helping develop a theory of energy-minimizing patterns, in much the same way that consideration of soap bubbles and soap films led to the theory of minimal surfaces a generation ago.  It is of course a familiar fact that thin sheets often wrinkle or fold: our skin wrinkles and our clothes wrinkle; leaves, flowers, and hanging drapes have folds.  Physical experiments in controlled settings can quantify such phenomena, and numerical simulations can demonstrate within a model how the patterns develop.  But neither experiment nor simulation can tell us ""why"" a system chooses a particular pattern.  The project provides a valuable complement to other methods, by showing that elastic energy minimization requires types of patterns.  The project provides training opportunities for graduate students."

Complex problems often benefit from being viewed in a new light; the investigators use persistent homology to study behavior of financial trading networks.  Persistent homology focuses on how a family of simplicial complexes D(t) vary with a real parameter t.  Typically one starts with a discrete data set (point cloud data) corresponding to t=0, and then as t varies, points are replaced by balls of radius t, centered at the original point.  Thus varying t yields a filtered family of simplicial complexes, the Rips-Vietoris complex of the associated topological space.  In the context of trading networks, the parameter t represents margin; a low value for t corresponds to allowing highly leveraged trading.  The aim of the project is to understand how changes in the topology of the D(t) associated to a trading network correspond in some way to systemic collapse.  Put simply, the investigators explore the circumstances that cause a local event to cause global contagion. <br/><br/>     The problem of understanding interconnectedness is one of today's premier challenges.  Connectivity is ubiquitous; interconnections often allow a system to be tapped to its full potential and enhance its robustness.  The flip side of connectivity is that it gives rise to pathways for unexpected emergent behavior (""black swan"" events) and even systemic collapse.  The world is awash in data: how can we extract meaning (and understand connectivity) from it?  One answer is via the mathematical discipline of algebraic topology, which is a tool to distill the study of complex objects or spaces into a simple form.  For example, how can we distinguish between an orange and a donut?  The obvious answer is that the donut has a ""hole""; algebraic topology makes the natural intuition (which is not so natural in higher dimensions!) rigorous.  In particular, algebraic topology is built to probe the relationship between local and global structures; this makes it an ideal tool for studying financial trading networks.  The proliferation of problems where there is a confluence of local/global transitions and a large experimental data set has given rise to the field of applied algebraic topology, yielding a systematic way to unfold connections.  The investigators interpret various notions of collapse of financial networks via this unfolding perspective.  The work focuses on clearing networks, which encode trades and liabilities, and bring the tools developed in applied topology to bear on unfolding the interconnections in such networks.  In particular, the investigators study how local events propagate: under what circumstances does contagion and systemic collapse result from a local event?"

The main goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive mathematical theory of these objects by combining tools from coding and information theory, linear algebra, combinatorics, and graph theory.  It is achieved by an analysis of the codewords corresponding to the cover graphs of the associated code graphs -- called protograph-based codes -- and the pseudocodewords obtained by projecting these codewords onto the code graphs, an analysis of the pseudocodewords in the fundamental cones (with implications in linear programming decoding and iterative decoding), and an analysis of the pseudo-weights (the measure of performance under iterative decoding) with implications in code performance. <br/><br/>     Despite significant progress in the last decades, the performance of current communication systems is still not satisfactory in many situations, such as when delay is important, power is critical, or bandwidth is constrained.  This project studies the reasons why current coding techniques underperform relative to theoretical limits and develops a mathematical theory that explains their shortcomings and helps design better codes.  The investigator's joint appointment with the department of electrical engineering and her collaboration with engineering experts from academia and industry ensure that the project has an impact beyond the theoretical realm; the analytical findings are exploited to improve the reliability of current and future communication systems.  Because reliable communication is at the heart of ubiquitous access to and exchange of data, the nation's information technology infrastructure benefits from the project.  Its impact is, however, not restricted to channel coding, but extends to areas such as computer science, networking, and compressed sensing."

Second, this proposal will develop methods for the reconstruction of surface waves from pressure measurements.  Building upon previous work with collaborators, this proposal will generalize the relationship between pressure and the surface elevation to allow for pressure measurements to be taken at arbitrary depths (not just the bottom).  In addition, physical parameters that are difficult to physically measure a priori will be formally eliminated from the model without approximation.

This project will investigate the stability of traveling wave solutions in order to gain better insight into the physical parameters and types of perturbations that could give rise to rogue waves or tsunamis. Alone, this information is not sufficient in practical use. One must also rely on real-time measurements the current ocean state as part of any prediction or forecasting system.

The estimation of a signal from the knowledge of its Fourier transform in a band qualifies as super-resolved when the fine structure of the signal is recovered on a length scale smaller than the inverse of the band's width --- the so-called Shannon-Nyquist scaling.  It is a poorly understood, yet real and decidedly nonlinear numerical phenomenon.  Sparsity has been suggested as a principle according to which super-resolution reliably occurs.  However, recent insights from analysis of convex programs indicate that a second principle, sign compatibility, is needed in tandem with sparsity to unlock positive results.  Building on this, the investigator seeks quantitative guarantees of a new kind for successful signal recovery up to the ideal resolution level that no method can beat.  Such results would generalize the theory of compressed sensing in the regime of very coherent dictionaries, where no restricted isometry-type property can be expected to hold.  The investigator also studies algorithms based on translation-invariance such as the matrix pencil method, modified matching pursuits, precorrective filtering, and generalizations to higher dimensions.  He explores implications, both positive and negative, for tomographic imaging modalities such as seismic and synthetic aperture radar in the subwavelength regime. <br/><br/>     The project aims to design advanced, nonlinear processing methods to deliver higher image resolution and interpretation levels in situations where the data come with poor frequency content, such as in the case of a blurring.

The project also offers an opportunity for students to acquire strong interdisciplinary training at the intersection of computational mathematics, modern data processing, and tomographic imaging.

They eliminate the symmetries by symplectic reduction and invariant theory. They call the resulting regularized reduced flow the ""global regularization.""  This flow is complete and has   the minimum number of degrees of freedom possible among for a  flow encoding the N-body problem. Given the global regularization, the investigator and his colleague study previously inaccessible problems within the N-body problem, such as the dynamical and variational  nature of collision-collision solutions, and the existence or lack of existence of a symbolic dynamics for  the planar zero-angular momentum three-body problem whose 3 symbols are the 3 types of syzygies (collinearities).  <br/><br/>Imagine the moon going around the earth,  the earth going around the sun, and the sun spinning around the galaxy.

When two bodies get close the forces get large to the point that when the bodies  collide the  forces become infinity.  This infinity  is called a ""collision singularity.""

It focuses on nondispersive waves, especially surface waves that propagate on interfaces such as discontinuities in vorticity, vortex sheets, material boundaries, water waves, and shock waves. Many of the wave motions considered in the proposal have constant, nonzero frequency in the linearized limit. These waves form a comparatively little studied class of nondispersive waves, and the proposed research aims to develop an understanding of their nonlinear dynamics, which is qualitatively different from that of dispersive waves or nondispersive hyperbolic waves. The proposed research will derive and study asymptotic descriptions of these waves and will also develop normal form transformations for quasi-linear wave equations. Hamiltonian dynamics provides unifying framework for most of the nonlinear wave motions to be studied in the proposed research. For small-amplitude waves, this description is more easily carried out in spectral form, which is particularly appropriate for the surface waves considered in the proposed research because of the spatial nonlocality of their interactions. The issue of understanding the relationship between the spectral and spatial descriptions of the resulting nonlinear dynamics is a fundamental one and one that is relevant to many other problems. A further topic of the proposed research is a study of the glancing Mach reflection of shock waves. Shock reflection is one of the most important multi-dimensional problems for hyperbolic conservation laws, leading to remarkably interesting and complex phenomena.These results should also shed light on related problems in transonic aerodynamics.<br/><br/>Surface waves are waves that propagate along a boundary or interface. The most familiar example consists of the water waves on the surface of a body of water, like an ocean. Another type of surface wave consists of the Rayleigh waves on a solid interface. These waves are generated by earthquakes, and they are also used in technological applications, such as ultrasonic surface acoustic wave devices in cell phones. A further example consists of the electromagnetic surface waves, or surface plasmons, on the interface between a metal and an insulator, which find applications in photonics. Small-amplitude waves are well-described by linear equations, but at larger amplitudes nonlinear effects become important. These effects lead to qualitatively new phenomena such as wave-breaking, the formation of shock waves or other singularities, and the generation of new waves by nonlinear wave-interactions. Nonlinearity, and the possibility of a free surface that moves with the wave, makes the mathematical analysis of these problems very challenging. An additional feature of surface waves is that the effects of nonlinearity may be nonlocal because what happens at one point on the surface can influence what happens elsewhere on the surface through the bulk medium. The principal investigator plans to study the fundamental qualitative properties of such surface waves in the context of a wide variety of physical problems. The results will have potential applications in fluid dynamics, transonic flow, elasticity, magnetohydrodynamics, geophysics, and condensed matter physics."

Reducing and controlling turbulence flow is particularly relevant in the design of small-scale unmanned aircrafts and morphing aircraft wings (e.g. improving the flight of a robobee), and is also of great interest in the medical community (for example, blood flow in a stenosed or stented artery).  The proposed problem presents new challenges since it treats the case of a moving and deforming elastic body coupled with a viscous fluid, building on the existing literature on control problems in fluid-structure interactions, which is predominantly focused on the assumption of small but rapid oscillations of the solid body, and therefore assumes that the common interface is static.  Due to the presence of the free boundary and the fully nonlinear coupled system, the issue of existence and uniqueness of an optimal control will involve strategies from sensitivity and shape differentiability analysis, on top of techniques from control theory of partial differential equations and well-posedness analysis for fluid-structure interactions.  Therefore, the project will be of interest to a broad mathematical and engineering audience.  <br/><br/>Mathematically, the proposed research will lead to: (i) the construction of quasilinear theory arising in Navier-Stokes equations coupled with waves, (ii) the development of the theory of strong shape derivatives for hyperbolic problems with non-smooth Neumann boundary conditions, which is challenging due to the failure of the Lopatinski condition, and (iii) the study of well-posedness analysis for the first linear model of fluid-elasticity interaction that takes into account the common interface and its curvatures, which are critical for a correct physical interpretation of the coupling.

The motivation for this research comes from a systematic study of mathematical models for cancer treatment that combine various structures that form the tumor microenvironment. In modern oncology, a tumor is viewed as not just cancerous cells, but as a system of interacting components that in various ways aid and abet the tumor (e.g., the tumor vasculature), but also fight it (e.g., the immune system). Current treatments therefore are multi-targeted therapies that not only kill cancer cells, but also include antiangiogenic therapy, immunotherapy and many other options. The search for best ways of administering these therapeutic agents naturally leads to formulations as multi-input nonlinear optimal control problems. The aim of the research is to develop local syntheses of optimal controls for such systems, a difficult task even for single-input systems with only partial results known. These new results will be developed in connection with the study of systems that describe (i) cancer treatment within the complex context of the tumor microenvironment and (ii) optimal strategies for the control of the spread of diseases in epidemiology. In the latter field, mathematical models have been a relevant tool in analyzing the underlying dynamics, whereas in this project a much less explored optimal control approach to the problem will be pursued. While one aim is to develop general methods and procedures that have wide applicability, a second important aspect of the research is to provide qualitative and quantitative insights into the structure of optimal solutions for important real-life problems. Motivated by timely problems in biomedicine, like how to design metronomic chemotherapy protocols, challenging problems in optimal control theory will be considered whose solutions require developing new tools and methods. Because of its applied and interdisciplinary character, the project is expected to be of strong interest to students from mathematics and engineering and consequently it contains a substantial educational component. Efforts to attract women and minorities will be continued and expanded by reaching out to engineering students where participation of these groups is particularly low.<br/><br/>In modern oncology, a tumor is viewed as not just cancerous cells, but as a system of interacting components that in various ways aid and abet the tumor (e.g., the tumor vasculature), but also fight it (e.g., the immune system).  Current treatments therefore are multi-targeted therapies that not only kill cancer cells, but also include antiangiogenic therapy, immunotherapy and many other options. It is very difficult and expensive to test complex multi-target protocols in medical trials. For this reason, the analysis of mathematical models becomes of intrinsic value. The medical community has become more and more aware that not only what drug is given, but also how it is administered, i.e., dosage, frequency and sequencing, can have a major impact on the outcome of the treatment. This led to a recently launched ""Metronomics Global Health Initiative"". The proposed research is motivated by the biomedical ideas of this initiative and the investigators believe that the tools of geometric optimal control are best suited to give mathematical answers to these questions and thus provide insights into how a metronomic protocol should be designed. Regarding a second topic, infectious diseases continue to be one of the most important health problems worldwide. In this project, the investigators seek theoretical results that can give practical guidelines how to pursue joint efforts of vaccination and treatment in an optimal way to maximize the effectiveness and minimize the social economic cost. Because of its applied and interdisciplinary character, the project is expected to be of strong interest to students from mathematics and engineering and consequently it contains a substantial educational component. Efforts to attract women and minorities will be continued and expanded by reaching out to engineering students where participation of these groups is particularly low."

This is a regime of obvious relevance in many applications. Even for basic models frustratingly little is known rigorously about their range of validity. A first step in a mathematical approach is to pursue a theory of existence of solutions for a reasonable class of initial data. A key concern is to develop methods that provide quantitative and qualitative predictions as well. By pursing methods that give information beyond abstract existence results we seek to assess the relevance and limits of models that are routinely used for practical applications, such as compressible Euler flow. The models we consider are formulated as hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. As a complement to existence results for initial value problems we also seek general structural properties of such systems. The aim is an understanding of how the ""geometry"" of a system, as encoded in its characteristic values, eigen-frame, entropies, etc., impact the properties of solutions. This part of the project leads to questions of independent interest in geometry, and also clarifies the role of underlying structures in physical models. <br/><br/>Consider the following scenario: a perfectly spherical shock wave propagates inward in a gas which is at rest within the converging shock. From experiments and basic considerations it is clear that the shock will typically accelerate and strengthen as it approaches the center of motion. Very close to the center the gas will experience enormous densities, velocities and temperatures. This and similar physical situations are of great interest in applications such as high-speed flight, meteorology, combustion, etc.  However, we currently lack a good understanding of this type of fluid flow, and the reason for this is a lack of mathematical insight. The basic models for describing the physical processes have been known for more than 150 years. Nonetheless, we are still searching for answers to even fundamental questions. These models are typically formulated as systems of non-linear equations. Such systems are ubiquitous in modeling of natural phenomena, and above all in connection with fluid flow - they demand a good understanding. The mathematical aspect of such understanding is provided by rigorous results pertaining to existence of solutions, their uniqueness and stability, and their qualitative properties. The proposal addresses these types of fundamental issues for non-linear phenomena that originate in models for compressible gas flow. The problems we consider appear to be essential road blocks that must be overcome in order to gain a proper understanding of non-linear phenomena in fluid flow."

In this project, the PI proposes to study multiscale asymptotics for the PDEs which govern tropical atmospheric waves and their connection to midlatitude waves, extending the PI's  previous work in the field. The three aspects of this project are: (1) A boundary layer asymptotic analysis connecting tropical waves in the weak temperature gradient approximation to quasi-geostrophic mid-latitude waves through a new subtropical matching layer; (2) The effect of the (large scale) climatological flow (the Hadley circulation) and the sub-grid circulation (moist convection) on the Intraseasonal Multiscale Moist Dynamics models of tropical waves and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). This involves the derivation of a closed planetary scale description of the MJO using the PI's stochastic sub-grid models and multi-scale asymptotic theory; (3) The analytic and numerical study of three non-linear PDEs - two of which are non-local - which arise from the analysis of tropical atmospheric waves.  <br/><br/>The dynamics of the atmosphere in the middle latitudes has long been studied as a problem of both practical interest (for understanding weather patterns over North America and Europe) and of theoretical interest (since the equations which govern atmospheric dynamics displayed a rich set of behavior as soon as scientists began studying them). More recently, however, we have realized that the tropical atmosphere also provides an enormous set of unsolved problems both for practical purposes and for mathematical theory. Computer simulations have shown that a better understanding of tropical atmospheric dynamics will not only improve our understanding of tropical weather but it will greatly increase our understanding of weather patterns in the middle latitudes, thereby improving weather predictions over North America and Europe. This project focuses on two general phenomena: (1) how tropical weather is organized on very large scales and (2) how tropical weather patterns interact with midlatitude weather patterns and thereby modify midlatitude weather. In the process of studying these phenomena, the PI has found new simplifications to the complicated equations of atmospheric dynamics - these equations are approximations which elucidate the important aspects of tropical organization and tropical/midlatitude interactions. This work is an example of scientific problems creating new mathematics and careful mathematical analysis creating better scientific theories."

Traveling waves are basic coherent structures in partial differential equations and they often serve as building blocks for complex patterns. This project is about traveling waves in parabolic and partly parabolic systems (in partly parabolic systems some quantities diffuse and others do not). More precisely, this project is focused on the investigation of three phenomenologically different manifestations of instability of traveling waves: (1) If a system supports waves that move with different speeds, what kind of instability can cause a transition from one wave to another? In such systems of coupled equations, will the preferred wave speed be defined by linear or nonlinear dynamics? (2) How to analytically prove or predict that instability is convective? For a convectively unstable wave small perturbations are moving away from the interface of  the wave faster than they grow. (3) An instability sometimes manifests itself in the appearance of new structures. These can be patterns in a neighborhood of an asymptotic rest state of the wave, or new global structures such as modulated waves which are composite waves that consist of a wave and periodic patterns. Modulated waves are known to exist in parabolic systems. A component of this project is devoted to the study of modulated waves in partly parabolic systems.<br/> <br/>Traveling waves are abundant in nature and human activities. They arise in applied problems  from different fields: optical communication, combustion theory, biomathematics, chemistry, population dynamics, to name a few. Information about whether traveling waves exist, how many of them are there in the system, and their resilience under perturbations assists in understanding of complex phenomena. Proposed work will help to identify situations when multiple waves exist and when the transition between them can be anticipated and controlled. Traveling waves that are observed in real life are usually stable (resilient under small perturbations). Stable waves withstand inhomogeneity of the medium that carries them and perturbations that may be caused by a variety of factors. Scientists and engineers who study traveling waves  are interested to know in what parameter regimes waves are stable, but it is equally important to know what to expect from an unstable wave. The proposed work will allow detailed and rigorous conclusions to be drawn about how different perturbations  to a wave behave and what the outcome of an instability is."

Two approaches to risk aversion are considered: dynamic risk measures and stochastic orders.  The investigators seek to advance their work on risk-averse discrete-time models and to develop general methodology for incorporating risk models into continuous-time optimal control problems of Markov structure.  Three major challenges are associated with this project.  First, the investigators develop proper mathematical tools for measuring risk in a time-consistent manner that would be suitable for continuous-time Markov systems.  Second, the investigators develop optimality theory for control problems involving time-consistent dynamic models of risk.  This includes the analysis of the structure of the control models, existence of solutions, and properties of the solutions.  When developing risk-averse control models the third challenge has to be taken into account: the possibility to solve the problems numerically in an efficient way. <br/><br/>     Decision and control problems under uncertainty arise in many areas: energy production and distribution, telecommunication, insurance and finance, logistics, medicine, security and military applications.  In most cases decisions have to be made over time: decisions, as well as the random environment, influence evolution of a system, which creates the need to make new decisions, etc.  Therefore, a policy has to be designed that incorporates rules for responding to future states of the system.  So far, most theoretical models of such control processes have been based on average performance criteria.  The investigators propose to take into account risk, that is, the possibility of occurrence of highly undesirable scenarios.  The project develops mathematical models for quantifying risk in dynamical systems that evolve in a continuous way.  It also provides methods to determine the best policy, when risk aversion is essential."

This project is strongly motivated by the efforts to develop a new, universal computer memory based on thin film ferromagnetic materials, the Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM).

Their popularity lies in the fact that they capture a wide variety of common network tendencies, for example connectivity and reciprocity, by representing a complex global structure through a set of tractable local features. The PI views these models mainly from a mathematical physics perspective, and introduces various advanced statistical physics tools, such as cluster expansion methods and renormalization group techniques, to the study of these models. Special emphasis is given to the development of a quantitative theory of ""phase transitions"", since in the vicinity of a phase transition, even a tiny change in some local feature may result in a dramatic change of the entire system. Multiple problems and avenues for research are presented in this project. Particular examples of such problems are to characterize the phase structure of attractive and repulsive exponential random graphs, and to derive a convergent power series expansion for the limiting free energy.<br/><br/>The proposed work is motivated by the interchange of ideas between mathematics, physics, and computer science. The PI will establish a precise definition of phase transitions in exponential random graphs and explore their connections to other mathematical physics models.

Many of the questions under consideration have broad applications to different areas of mathematics including combinatorics, probability, and graph theory. A far reaching potential benefit of the proposed research will be a better understanding of the influence of different local features on the global structure of real-world networks, such as social and biological networks, whose study is still in its infancy. The broader impacts of the project will be achieved through integrating research into classroom teaching and engaging students in learning and discovery. Broad dissemination of the proposed research will also be realized through the PI's continued participation in interdisciplinary conferences and workshops both nationally and internationally."

The applications include electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), electrical impedance tomography (EIT), electric neurography (ENG), and dynamical PET imaging. Characteristic for all these problems is the high complexity of the mathematical model describing the system, significant level of noise in the signals, and severe ill-posedness of the inverse problem of recovering the information of interest from the data. Well-planned model reduction methods help to simplify the model, but at the same time a significant modeling error is introduced, as the simplified model can no longer capture all the features of the data. The aim in the project is to develop computational statistical methods to overcome these problems. Unknown quantities are modeled as random variables, making it possible to analyze in statistical terms the model reduction errors. In the MEG/EEG application, stochastic modeling is used to analyze and filter out the complex noise due to normal brain activity that easily masks the signal coming from an abnormal activity such as the onset of focal epileptic seizure. Well-planned prior models for the unknown quantities help to reduce the ill-posedness of the inverse problems, and lead to efficient numerical methods for both estimating the unknowns of interest as well as to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate. Novel time-dependent filtering methods are investigated to deal with noisy signals.<br/><br/>The mathematical and computational methodology aims at improving the performance of different diagnostic processes: In the impedance tomography application, the goal is to be able to discern benign and malignant lesions seen in a mammography image without the need of breast biopsy, by injecting weak electric currents through contact electrodes in the breast and measuring the corresponding electric voltages, and by further computing the electric response of the tissue of interest. It is known that cancer tissue is characterized by an abnormal electric response.  The main target in EEG and MEG research is to help localizing epileptic foci in the brain by measuring the electric and magnetic fields outside the patient's head. This information helps greatly the brain surgery planning for patients with severe epilepsy that does not respond to medication. Dynamic PET imaging is used in the studies of brain functioning, e.g., under severe liver conditions that change the ammonium level in the blood. Electric neurography aims at reading the electric signals inside a peripheral nerve in a minimally invasive manner using contact microelectrodes. This data can be used to give a patient control of a prosthetic robotic arm mounted on an amputated limb, as if the arm would be a real arm responding to neuronal commands. Another exciting application being investigated is the possibility to control chronic pain."

Theme 1 defines sparsity-inducing dual frames of a non-exact frame.  Preliminary studies show that if a signal has a sparse frame representation, then there is a sparsity-inducing dual frame (sparse dual) that produces the exact sparse coefficient when applied to the signal.  Optimality issues of sparse duals and common sparse dual frames to classes of signals are examined.  Theme 2 develops iterative algorithms for a sparse-dual-based analysis approach in sparse signal recovery.  Improvement and convergence analysis of an alternative iterative algorithm are among the goals here.  Theme 3 aims to understand the greatly improved sparse signal recovery capacity of the sparse-dual-based analysis method.  This appears to be related to some geometric properties of the sparse hyperplane -- the affine subspace of the sparse representation fused with sparse dual information.  One goal is to derive algorithms that adaptable to the geometric properties of the sparse hyperplane for greater effectiveness.  Theme 4 develops the notion of sparse duals for practical scenarios where signals are merely approximately sparse with frames.  Theme 5 develops ""arbitrary"" filter banks for multi-channel signal/image requisition and multi-channel communication applications.  These systems exhibit arbitrary inter-channel relationships because they generally do not satisfy the commonly known multi-rate filter bank constraints rooted in wavelet theories.  The challenge lies in actual constructions of realistic or FIR synthesis filters for these systems. <br/><br/>     Signal processing generally refers to making a signal easy to handle or of better quality.  It is a common task in modern systems that transmit or store information.  In this project, the principal novelties introduced to signal processing are the new notion of sparsity-inducing dual frames (sparse duals) and ideas of recovering underlying signals from much smaller samples of the signal.  Sparsity-inducing dual frames are sets of optimal and basic signal components used in obtaining the sparsest (the smallest number of nonzero) signal decomposition coefficients.  An advantage of sparse duals is that they can improve the recovery of a signal from a small number of samples of the signal.  The investigator develops effective methods of sparse signal recovery.  Results of the project could lead to simpler and more effective sampling devices, radar systems, commercial imaging techniques, geographic survey and mapping systems, wireless communication systems, multi-sensor/camera surveillance systems, and multi-channel medical image requisition methods.

The overall objective of this work is to derive coarse-grained equations that approximate the effect of interactions between resolved and unresolved scales of motion from given, fine-grained, physical equations of motion. For a typical complex system, say a Hamiltonian system with many degrees of freedom, the method of reduction proceeds as follows: a vector of resolved variables is selected to describe the coherent, slow behavior of the system, and a parametric statistical model is canonically associated with this resolved vector; the predicted, or estimated, evolution of the mean resolved vector is defined by that path in the statistical parameter space which optimally fits the Liouville equation for the given dynamics. A cost functional is introduced to quantify the lack-of-fit of parameter paths; it is an information-theoretic metric on the Liouville residual containing weights that determine the adjustable constants in the ensuing closure. The desired equation for the mean resolved vector is derived by applying Hamilton-Jacobi theory to the optimization principle defining the best-fit closure. Recently the best-fit theory has been validated on a prototypical turbulent dynamics (truncated Burgers-Hopf equation), for which it produces a coarse-grained dynamics having novel dissipative effects and modified nonlinear interactions. Effective coarse-grained equations will be derived for barotropic and baroclinic quasi-geostrophic flows, and these closures will be tested against benchmark numerical simulations of fully-resolved ensembles. The best-fit approach will also be applied to represent approximate nonequilibrium spectra for these models, after first investigating these questions on some simpler turbulent wave dynamics.          <br/><br/>Mathematical models of many physical phenomena such as geophysical fluid dynamics, which are used to predict the motions of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans, typically display very complex, turbulent, behavior. It is therefore important to design appropriate reduced models of such complex systems that capture, at least approximately, the coherent behavior of the full system in many fewer variables. The P.I.'s research is directed towards developing general mathematical and statistical tools for constructing reduced models of this kind. Specifically, the research endeavors to simplify nonlinear dynamical models of the atmosphere and oceans by devising effective computational schemes in which unresolved turbulence is parameterized by statistical models that best fit the full equations of motion. A reduction method of this kind would furnish a mathematically justified technique for  improving the performance of numerical models of the large-scale, low-frequency dynamics of  weather and climate. Specifically, the work seeks to build up an understanding of model reduction and closure through a hierarchy of simplified, prototype problems examined using a systematic and robust methodology that draws on physical concepts from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, mathematical techniques from optimization theory and dynamical systems, as well as tools from statistics and information theory. A postdoctoral research associate will be hired to collaborate with the P.I., and the training of the postdoc in these interrelated topics will be an important outcome of the project."

Thirty years ago, it was realized that the QR algorithm for calculating eigenvalues can be considered as a time-T map of the Toda lattice. This opens up the possibility of bringing the qualitative methods of dynamical systems to bear on the algorithm, and to potentially speed up the algorithm by more efficient discretizations. The crucial aspect of the Toda lattice is that it is a continuous conjugation that preserves upper Hessenberg form and therefore the eigenvalues. In recent research, the PI has achieved similar results with the calculation of the singular value decomposition by developing a Lotka-Volterra system that preserves bidiagonal structures, which has led to advances in computing the SVD. This project investigates other dynamical systems preserving symplectic and Hamiltonian structure, which are pivotal in many areas of applications. The ultimate goal is to investigate the connection between their geometric structures and existing numerical algorithms, to establish a rigorous mathematical theory on dynamical behaviors, and to develop possible structure-preserving re-discretizations to improve robustness, speed, and accuracy of iterations in numerical analysis. <br/><br/>Structure-preserving dynamical systems are natural and ubiquitous. Conservation laws in the physical world and constrained mechanics in engineered systems are just two examples. Structure preservation is also imperative in computation because it makes possible more efficient algorithms, improves physical feasibility and interpretability, and is more robust in long-term behavior. The proposed research recasts numerical algorithms as differential systems that mimic the structure-preserving properties of the corresponding iterative schemes. Understanding the overall dynamics of the continuum system can shed light on the convergence properties of the related discrete counterparts, and can also contribute to the re-discretization of the continuum system into a new algorithm with better numerical properties. A wide range of applications stands to benefit from the study of properties and geometric structure of these systems, which essentially include all disciplines that entail structure preservation, including classical and quantum mechanics, model reduction, reversible systems, and molecular dynamics."

He will concentrate primarily on equations arising in physical applications such as fundamental fluid equations, e.g the Navier-Stokes equation, the equations for vortex sheets, and equations from nonlinear optics.  His research will focus on four main problems: (A) Metastable behavior in two-dimensional fluids; (B) Periodic solutions of the vortex sheet equations; (C) Breathers in periodic media; and (D) Normal forms and invariant manifolds in dispersive Hamiltonian systems.  Dynamical systems methods have yielded many insights into the qualitative behavior of finite dimensional systems for which no closed form solutions exist.  The existence theory of many of the infinite dimensional systems to be studied is now well established and this research will attempt to derive more detailed information about the behavior of the solutions on various physically relevant time scales, as well as illuminating the origin of these time scales.<br/><br/>The differential equations that Professor Wayne will study arise in a variety of different physical contexts and are characterized by the fact that while the equations themselves are well known, they are too complicated to solve explicitly except in very special or physically unrealistic cases.  Nevertheless, applications require at least a qualitative understanding of the behavior of their solutions and this research project will aim to develop such an understanding for the systems described above.  As an example related to point (C) in the preceding paragraph, consider light pulses of the types that are used in fiber optic cables currently used for telecommunications.  In a homogeneous medium, such as  glass, such pulses rapidly spread out or disperse.  However, in periodic media, like certain crystals, such pulses may become trapped.  Trapped pulses are of great current interest because of the hope that they might serve as the basis for a purely optical computational system. Professor Wayne's research will examine the conditions that the medium must satisfy in order to support these ``trapped'' pulses as well as investigating how common such media are likely to be.  The other three projects will also aim to develop new fundamental insights into these important physical systems."

Specifically, the PI and co-PI will study systems in which collective behavior manifests non-trivial co-dimension. The mathematics of such particle systems pervades many disciplines, ranging from physics, chemistry and biology to control theory and engineering. Modern applications in these areas include protein folding, colloid stability and the self-assembly of nanoparticles into supramolecular structures. In biology, similar mathematical models help explain the complex phenomena observed in viral capsids, locust swarms and colonies of bacteria. The first phase of this project will apply and expand recently developed mathematical tools to identifiy various physical and chemical interactions that will naturally produce co-dimension one structures. This has a direct application to the study of processes, such as the self-assembly of Polyoxometalate (POM) molecular clusters into spherical supramolecular structures, in which experimental evidence is overwhelming but a theoretical understanding of the underlying formation mechanisms is lacking. The PI, co-PI and their collaborators have made numerous important developments in the mathematical theory of such mechanisms when the interaction is isotropic. This part of the project aims to further develop this theory in a manner that will prove useful to a broad set of researchers in other disciplines. The proposed research project is fundamentally interdisciplinary in that it derives mathematical problems from unexplained phenomena in diverse fields such as chemistry, biology and engineering. The PI and co-PI will apply a broad set of mathematical tools drawing from dynamical systems, partial differential equations, mathematical modeling and computational methods to solve several problems that are subject to active research in these fields, including the so-called 'designer potential problem' in nano self-assembly. By clarifying which physical forces drive POM self-assembly and other related phenomena, such as viral capsid formation, we will provide rigorous solutions to the question of how to design sub-units that form into these importantstructures. <br/><br/>One of the demonstrated career goals of the PI is to further the inclusion of underrepresented groups in the field of mathematics. The PI has the personal experience and critical perspective necessary to serve as a mentor for the diverse student body at University of San Francisco. Exposing these students from underrepresented groups to cuttingedge mathematical research, coupled with faculty mentoring, will inspire many of them to pursue graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences. The student research supported by this grant will prove indispensible to the project's recruitment efforts given USF's high proportion of low-income students who are compelled to work part-time while they pursue full-time academic degree programs. The PI has a proven track record of recruiting talented students from underrepresented groups into mathematics and this grant would allow these activities to continue and expand."

Specifically,  we focus on the situation of a fluid in a three-dimensional domain with a flexible boundary that is described by a  plate or membrane equation. We suggest several problems which serve to address our fundamental question: How much control in one or more components of the  coupled system is needed to obtain (i) controllability  or approximate controllability of the coupled system or (ii) partial controllability (approximate or exact) of one or more components of the system? The proposed research extends the  state-of-the-art in  several ways. First, the partial controllability problem in the context of a fluid-elastic system has not been addressed for the types of physically-based models we are considering. Secondly, many of the models we propose to analyze have not been studied even for well-posedness. This is a nontrivial step even in the linear case for some of the models (e.g., when considering free boundary conditions). However we also hope to address local controllability for the nonlinear problems associated with  the free boundary  problem for the Stokes system associated with a moving flexible boundary. Likewise we hope to make some progress in the case of a compressible Navier-Stokes fluid coupled with a plate. Our main analytical tool to attack these problems will be the method of Carleman estimates together with microlocal analysis. Development of Carleman estimates for these types of coupled systems might turn out to be be very useful in a broader context, as it is likely that a similar approach may be useful in the analysis of a variety of other types of coupled systems. We also propose to investigate the closely related inverse problem of determination of plate coefficients through knowledge of the appropriately defined Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps associated with solutions of the coupled plate-fluid system.    <br/><br/>The fluid-elastic structures we aim to study arise in many practical applications. For example,the problem of minimizing the engine noise in a portion of an aircraft fuselage through controllers placed on and inside the aircraft is closely related to the partial controllability problem (ii) mentioned above. One specific fluid-elastic structure we plan to investigate is the cochlea, which is the  auditory organ in the inner ear that  translates sound vibrations to electrical impulses transmitted to the brain. A better understanding of the controllability structure of the cochlea could lead to an improved design of cochlear implants and hearing aids."

The theoretical core of the project includes both mechanistic models of nearly contacting groups of particles, and continuum modeling and analysis of the dynamics of dense suspensions. The research develops new Stokesian Dynamics algorithms to resolve the slow particle interactions in dense suspensions, and uses simulations of how particles collectively reconfigure on the micro-scale to accommodate applied external strains to construct a continuum model for suspension rheology. New theory is supported by experiments carried out in the Applied Mathematics Laboratory at UCLA to test predictive models of suspension rheology.<br/><br/>Particle laden flows are important in many industrial applications including oil and gas extraction, coal processing, mining of minerals, and waste-water treatment.  Results from this basic research project can be used to develop quantitative models for such diverse applications as spiral separators in the mining industry, cell separation in inertial microfluidic devices and aggregation of microbes.

The aim is to provide an accurate, practical, detailed description of these coherent wave structures that is useful for applications in nanomagnetism and the fluid dynamics of dissipationless, dispersive media.  Motivated by recent experiments, time-periodic, localized solutions of a modified Landau-Lifshitz equation that incorporates a spin transfer torque forcing term to compensate damping will be computed and studied analytically using asymptotic methods.  These magnetic droplet solitons and their generalizations have potential for technological applications. Another research front will be developed involving modulated nonlinear wavetrains or dispersive shock waves (DSWs).  The generation of DSWs represents a universal mechanism to resolve hydrodynamic singularities in dispersive media such as water waves, plasma, optics, interfacial fluids, Bose-Einstein condensates, and two-phase, viscously deformable fluids.  Theoretical studies will focus upon central questions of modern DSW theory including loss of genuine nonlinearity/strict hyperbolicity in the modulation equations, multi-dimensional DSWs, and stability.  In collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students, the principal investigator will undertake experiments involving a viscous fluid conduit system in order to make quantitative measurements of DSW properties for comparison with theory.<br/><br/>When wave properties intrinsically depend upon the wave amplitude, novel physical behavior can arise.  With a view toward applications, this project encompasses two classes of these nonlinear waves: solitary waves in nanomagnetism and shock waves in dispersive media.  Spintronics encompasses the effort to develop information transport, processing, and storage using the electron's spin in addition to its charge, for example, to continue Moore's Law (the doubling of the number of transistors per unit area every eighteen months) beyond present technological limitations.  The spatially localized spin excitations in a nanomagnet to be studied in this project possess features that hold great promise for future spintronic applications.  Viscous shock waves that form when a projectile exceeds the speed of sound in air are commonly understood. The dispersive shock waves studied in this project are of a very different type, lacking dissipation and realized as expanding, oscillatory wavetrains.  A fluid experiment will be developed to carefully measure these shock properties while also being used as an educational, outreach, and demonstration tool, providing young mathematicians direct experience with nonlinear waves.  Presentations at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will provide the general public with exposure to this fascinating field."
