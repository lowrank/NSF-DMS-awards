The preliminary model will be closely based on                      experimental evidence from alligators  Alligator mississippiensis               and the known properties of cells.  The case for the alligator as               a model for research in craniofacial development is convincingly                made by Ferguson (1981).  In particular the PI's aim to reproduce               a specific pattern, namely the positions and initiation sequence                of the first seven teeth in the right half lower jaw of the                     alligator.

The neural network studies are based on Voltage Controlled                      Oscillator model Neurons (VCONs), which are constructible                       electronic devices that have interesting mathematical models and                many parallels with physiological nerve cells.  The investigators               have recently derived VCON networks that filter, process, and                   store information based on frequency encoding; they extend and                  refine this work in parallel with known physiological circuits.                 The mathematical aspects of interest in this are rotation vectors               and generalized Fourier analysis of dynamical systems.  The                     applied aspects are related to the design and study of circuits                 that can reproduce known functions of parts of mammalian brains                 based on frequency encoding and decoding.  Specifically, the                    investigators study tonotopic mappings, storage and retrieval of                messages, and the structure and function of processing circuits                 similar to neocortical columns.  The second part of this proposal               studies populations and genetics.  The investigators focus on                   food chains and colony synchronization in bacterial communities,                pattern formation in bacterial lawns, and plasmid stability in                  genetically engineered microorganisms.  Computational methods                   developed for simulation of VCON networks are applied to study                  bacterial communities.                                                               The project involves two problems in mathematical biology                  that illustrate two important contributions that mathematics                    makes to the life sciences: First, mathematics enables us to                    analyze large networks that resemble parts of our brains, and                   second, mathematical formulations enable us to use scientific                   computers to predict the outcome of experiments that are                        expensive or difficult to perform.  First, the investigators                    study large collections of electronic devices that mimic brain                  circuits.  These devices (called VCONs) are based on phase-locked               loops that are widely used in electronic communications.  They                  have designed, analyzed, and simulated VCON networks that focus                 attention on the most persistent among many competing stimuli,                  and that memorize and recall messages.  They extend this work to                include other aspects of the brain, including parts of the                      hippocampus.  The novelty of this work is that it is based on                   frequency encoded information rather than discrete information                  bits, as in digital computers.  As a result, the networks are                   quite stable, even functioning well when partially destroyed.  In               the second part of this work, they use methods developed for VCON               networks to study problems about bacterial communities.  While                  these two problem areas are widely separated, certain                           mathematical aspects of the two are remarkably similar: Bacteria                lead oscillatory lives, and using the methods for large networks                of VCON oscillators, the investigators are able to describe in                  mathematical terms large communities of bacteria -- for example,                as arising in soil.  In addition to working on problems that are                similar between the two areas, they study problems specific to                  bacterial genetics, including how stable are genetically                        engineered variations in bacterial cell lines."

In the study of wavelets,                beyond the mathematical analysis a major focus is on applications               to real-time (or on-line) time-frequency analysis.  Hence the                   investigators study the analysis and algorithmic and                            computational aspects of spline-wavelets and non-orthogonal                     wavelet packets.  In particular, they will design a                             predictor-corrector algorithm along the line of the Kalman filter               to implement the spline-wavelet decomposition without truncation                and to take care of noise processes such as white noise.  The                   research on multivariate splines also extends to the construction               of multivariate wavelets using box splines.  One of the most                    difficult problems is the study of minimum supports that give                   rise to reconstruction sequences with minimum length.  Again a                  predictor-corrector algorithm will be implemented to avoid                      truncation of the decomposition sequences. ""Radial basis                        functions"" is a tool that allows fiting both regular and                        scattered data by continuously differentiable functions. Certain                matrices associated with interpolation and approximation                        processes arise in connection with the data fitting.  The                       investigators will study the ""stability"" of these matrices.  They               also consider various aspects of the question of how rapidly the                approximating surfaces approach the underlying surface from which               the scattered data are sampled as the number of data points                     increases.                                                                           The wavelet transform is a tool that cuts up data or                       functions as well as their spectra into different frequency                     components and then studies each component with a resolution                    matched to the appropriate scale.  For example, given a signal,                 one is interested in ""cutting"" up its frequency content with                    local time-information.  This is similar to music notation, which               tells the player which notes to play at any given moment.                       Wavelets, wavelet transforms, and wavelet packets help in                       analyzing signals and data.  Wavelet analysis is useful in data                 reduction, which already has been applied to high-definition T.V.               Using wavelets, the investigators aim at decomposing and                        reconstructing signals as simply and accurately as possible.                    Another aim is to represent the underlying processes generating                 scattered data by means of ""simple"" radial functions.  This                     allows one to analyze and extrapolate data, which is important                  for artificial learning devices."

In practice, while this may be                  true for flows dominated by strong shocks, other flow phenomena                 may be better modelled by different, not necessarily conservative               flow descriptions. In such cases, one may be prepared to                        sacrifice strict conservation in favor of a nonstrictly                         conservative model that describes better the dominant flow                      features. To be reliable, the model should generate acceptably                  small conservation errors. The investigator shows that                          propagating fronts is one such phenomenon. Capturing propagating                fronts by conservative models gives rise to oscillations and                    other inaccuracies near material fronts, and is in general                      unsatisfactory. These are not the common oscillations associated                with high order schemes, but rather a result of the simple wave                 model (i.e. eigenstructure) of the conservative systems. A remedy               is to use a nonconservative flow description, which offers a                    different eigenstructure.  It becomes exact near contact surfaces               and produces clean oscillation-free interfaces. Near shocks, the                model is not exact and conservation errors are committed. A                     technique recently developed by the investigator offers a cure to               this problem. It uses viscous perturbations that render the                     algorithm conservative to the order of numerical approximation                  and generate acceptably small conservation errors. The technique                has been successfully applied to computing propagating fronts in                1D.  The investigator will study several theoretical aspects of                 this nonstrictly conservative algorithm and its application to                  the computation of bubble dynamics in several space dimensions.                      The work of the project involves theoretical analysis and                  computer simulation of flows. These arise in physical phenomena                 involving mixing of fluids, the initiation and evolution of                     vortices, the ignition and evolution of chemical reactions in                   fluids, and the propagation of flames. The aim of the project is                to develop analytical and computational tools to enhance the                    understanding of the complicated physical phenomena involved.                   Insight gained this way will supplement experimental data, which                are often expensive, difficult or even dangerous to obtain. For                 example, wind tunnel simulations of space conditions in the upper               stratosphere are difficult and expensive to perform and may give                unreliable results; studying gun ballistics requires                            experimenting with strong explosions, which are both expensive                  and dangerous.  Potential impact of this project extends to a                   variety of industries including the space and aircraft industries               (design of space vehicles and of aicraft wings), marine industry                (design of boats with improved hydrodynamic properties, the                     effect of bubbles on submarine hydrodynamics, etc.) and the                     weapon industries (e.g., internal ballistics of guns)."

The theoretical                   tools involved in this program are continuum mechanics, geometric               measure theory, partial differential equations,                                 thermoelastodynamics and the calculus of variations.                                 Relaxation and lower semicontinuity properties of nonconvex                bulk and interfacial energies will be obtained and singular                     perturbation methods will be used in nonlinear elasticity to                    resolve nonuniqueness of equilibria.  These results will help us                understand and predict the surface structures and geometries of                 crystals subjected to thermal or mechanical treatments.                              When the minimum energy is not attained, the role played by                the surface tension in stabilizing the oscillations, and the                    dynamical creation of the microstructure and its evolution within               the framework of generalized measure-valued solutions, will be                  studied.  Thermochemical equilibria for coherent two-phase alloys               when physical variables, such as composition, are taken into                    account will be considered.  This study will enable predicting                  the dependence of equilibrium phase composition on the overall                  composition and volume fraction.                                                     Models to analyze defect interaction, dislocations,                        different types and arrangements of domains and global effects of               defects will be addressed.  In particular, variational                          formulations for metastable equilibria of elastoplastic crystals                with defects will be analyzed.

Therefore, accomplishing                   these goals will require manipulation of some very recent                       mathematical tools and possibly the introduction of new ones.

The research has direct applications to several important                  practical problems, for instance:  1) the interpretation of                     magnetic diagnostics for Tokamak (fusion) devices,  2) medical                  impedance imaging, and 3) nondestructive testing of mechanical                  parts.  Part of the research is concerned with determining the                  sufficiency of the proposed boundary data for the various                       reconstructions (proving uniqueness and continuous dependence                   results).  Another part of the research involves the design of                  effective algorithms, for instance for the detection and location               of cracks using real experimental data.  There will be an active                involvement of post-doctoral researchers as well graduate                       students and hopefully even some advanced undergraduate students                in various aspects of the research."

The persistence theorem is studied in                 the context of reaction-diffusion equations and functional                      differential equations.                                                              The chemostat is a laboratory apparatus that is used                       in ecology to study exploitative competition.  (It is a model of                a simple lake.)  It is one place where both the mathematics and                 the biological experiments are tractable; all the parameters                    needed for the equations of the mathematical model are measurable               in the laboratory.  The basic model does not allow for the delat                between nutrient uptake by the organisms in the chemostat                       and reproduction (cell division).  A standard assumption in the                 model is that the tank is well stirred; hence there are                         differences in the amounts of nutrient present in different parts               of the tank. To study the effect of a nutrient gradient, another                device called the gradostat has been proposed by biologists.  The               mathematics of that device is now fairly well understood.                       Another way to induce a gradient is to allow the nutrient to                    enter the tank at one point and to diffuse along with the                       organisms.  The notion of persistence tries to capture the                      ecological idea that all components of a model ecosystem survive.               Such theorems have proved useful in the context of ordinary                     differential equation models; e.g., in the analysis of the                      gradostat and of a chemostat with an inhibitor.  The concept has                now found its way into the mathematical literature in a general                 form, in particular for an asymptotically smooth semi-dynamical                 system.  The aim of this project is to use the full potential of                the persistence theorem by applying it in an infinite dimensional               context, to reaction-diffusion equations and differential                       equations with delays.  If the assumptions about the chemostat                  are changed to remove the well-stirred hypothesis and to let the                nutrient and the cells move by diffusion or convection, then a                  reaction-diffusion equation or a gradostat results.  Delayed                    chemostat models have been studied, but no physiological                        mechanism has been introduced to account for the delay.  The                    obvious mechanism is the cell cycle, the time between nutrient                  uptake and cell division."

One seeks to recover the neutron interaction               potential, which is a bounded, real valued function defined on                  the real line, that is zero to the left of the origin, and                      approaches a nonzero constant as the space variable tends to                    positive infinity.  The information to be used for the                          reconstruction is the amplitude of the reflection coefficient                   corresponding to a wave incoming from the left, defined in the                  usual quantum mechanical sense.  Because the reflection                         coefficient is in general complex valued, the missing phase                     information is the central difficulty, and in fact this problem                 is closely related to the well known phase retrieval problem in                 optics.  However, even if the full complex reflection amplitude                 were known, the problem still presents some new aspects, in                     comparison with standard formulations of inverse scattering for                 the Schrodinger equation, because of the fact that the potential                does not decay to zero.  The investigator will also consider some               cases in which the phase data are partially known.  In the                      neutron scattering application, one may usually assume that the                 potential does not have any bound states, and this hypothesis is                essential for the main line of approach.  Nevertheless the case                 when bound states are present is of some interest also, so an                   alternative procedure allowing for this possibility will be                     investigated.                                                                        A newly emerging technology for the detailed analysis of                   chemical and magnetic properties of layered materials is the use                of neutron reflectivity data.  For example, there are many                      applications to the study of surface and interface structure at                 the molecular level for polymer blends.  This in turn is a                      valuable tool in the development of new high performance                        materials.  In a typical experimental set up, a beam of neutrons                is incident from a vacuum region onto a reflecting material,                    whose material properties vary only in the direction                            perpendicular to the material surface.  An instrument called the                neutron reflectometer measures the reflected neutron intensity                  with high precision as a function of the particle's momentum in                 the direction perpendicular to the surface.  These data are thus                dependent in some manner on the so-called neutron interaction                   potential, which is a function of location within the material.                 If this potential can be determined, then other physical                        properties of the material can be directly inferred.  The                       proposed research addresses directly the problem of interpreting                reflectivity data in order to determine the interaction                         potential.  Specifically, the investigator seeks to understand                  the mathematical structure of the problem, and to develop                       accurate and reliable computational procedures."

Their model is based on field studies from                       northeastern Minnesota that indicate that adjacent wolf packs                   form distinct territories that are separated by ""buffer zones""                  where packs rarely trespass.  These buffer zones can provide a                  spatial refuge for the primary prey species: white-tailed deer.                 The field studies show that deer density is higher in the                       inter-territorial areas (refuges) and is lower near the center of               established territories (where deer populations may be subject to               intense predation).  The buffer zones may also stabilize                        wolf-deer interactions by providing a reservoir of deer that can                recolonize areas of wolf territory that have suffered heavy                     predation losses.

The investigator proposes to develop new numerical and analytical               tools to further investigate the bifurcations of these forced                   oscillator systems.  Current numerical ""continuation"" routines                  are able to trace out one-parameter curves of local bifurcations                of fixed and periodic points for orbits of low period, typically                less than four or five.  Proposed work will include development                 of new routines that are expected to trace out bifurcations                     curves for higher period orbits.  These new ""high period""                       routines will then be used for locating ""global bifurcations,""                  where invariant manifolds, typically a stable one and an unstable               one, become tangent before crossing.  Once developed, these                     routines will enable a much more automatic and detailed                         bifurcation study, not only of maps generated by forced                         oscillators, but also of any two-parameter family of maps.                           Many processes in science and engineering can be                           mathematically categorized as ""forced oscillator systems.""  One                 example of an oscillator is a pendulum, because it swings back                  and forth, or oscillates.  We usually think of a pendulum as                    having a fixed support (the nail in the wall to which the string                with a weight is tied), but if we keep moving the location of the               support, we say the pendulum is being ""forced;""  if we move the                 support in a repeating pattern, such as back and forth, then we                 have a ""periodically forced oscillator.""  It turns out that the                 resulting motion depends critically on how fast the support is                  moved back and forth (the forcing frequency) and how far it is                  moved back and forth (the forcing amplitude).  Fairly simple                    mathematical models also exhibit this same behavior, including                  the sensitivity to changes in ""parameters"" analogous to forcing                 frequency and amplitude.  Changes in the qualitative behavior of                the system (how the pendulum bob moves) that occur as the                       parameters are varied are called ""bifurcations.""  Much is known                 about these bifurcations, but much is still unknown.  The                       investigator proposes to fill in some of the missing gaps in this               area.  Results will help explain observed behavior in any process               that can be classified mathematically as a forced oscillator                    system."

Research on indirect nutrient consumption will focus on models of               both extracellular and intracellular conversion of the nutrient                 to an intermediate product which is assimilated for growth.  The                goal is to compare the efficiency of the different consumption                  processes, and to study the possibility of coexistence of species               with different mechanisms of nutrient assimilation.                                  This project is concerned with the study of mathematical                   models of microbial growth and competition in continuous culture,               a commonly used laboratory technique in microbiology.                           Microorganisms play very important roles in natural ecological                  systems, and their activities have numerous industrial                          applications, e.g., waste water treatment, production of food,                  drugs and various other chemicals, bacterial control, etc.                      Competition between different species is an important feature in                many ecological systems, and the design of many industrial                      processes, e.g., use of biological agents in bacterial control or               waste disposal, is based on the competitiveness of different                    species.  Experimental study of microbial activities in                         laboratory environments are especially amenable to mathe matical                modeling by differential equations.  Analysis of the model                      equations gives better understanding of the underlying principles               of microbial behaviors, and often leads to new experimental                     designs."

The                significance of this research lies both in the development of                   mathematical methods to analyze structured population models and                in the identification of the qualitative features of these models               that have potential biological applicability.  Results of the                   project may shed light on the behavior of tumors."

The homotopy approach involves using a single parameter to                 deform a system of equations into an auxiliary and more easily                  solved system, then tracing the solution back to the solution of                the original system.  Applications include problems in economics                and engineering.  Specifically, an economic model with incomplete               markets will be analyzed.  The resulting system of equations has                a Grassmanian manifold as the domain -- a feature which                         interjects new obstacles and opportunities.

By replacing the parameter with                an infinitesimal variable and solving the system relative to a                  larger field containing the infinitesimal, a family of solutions                are obtained in an efficient way.  Applications include linear                  inequality systems, linear programming problems, bounded variable               integer programs, linear complementary problems, and quadratic                  programs."

They continue work begun by Lin on spatially                      patterned solutions of reaction-diffusion wquations near                        spatially homogeneous solutions, represented by homoclinic orbits               on heteroclinic cycles of the reaction equation.  They                          investigate a new approach, based on earlier work, to the                       stability of stationary solutions of reaction-diffusion equations               with small diffusion that consist of regular and transition                     layers, in which the stability would be checked layer by layer.                 They continue work begun by Schecter using heteroclinic                         bifurcation theory to study the solutions of systems of                         conservation laws.  They also continue work on the stability and                convergence of numerical methods for finding homoclinic and                     heteroclinic orbits to nonhyperbolic equilibria.                                     It can happen that if one starts a dynamic process near one                of its steady states, the resulting orbit of the process goes far               from that state, then returns to the same or a different steady                 state.  Such an orbit is called homoclinic or heteroclinic                      respectively.  These orbits turn out to be key to understanding                 numerous phenomena in the sciences.  The investigators continue                 their studies of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, and of                     mathematical aspects of them that are important in applications.                One subject they investigate is how two interacting dispersed                   populations can spontaneously become organized into spatial                     patterns of varying population densities that fluctuate over                    time, because of homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits in the                       underlying dynamics.  The second subject is an idea of Lin for                  understanding the stability of propagating fronts, in chemical                  reactions, for example, by viewing the fronts as heteroclinic                   orbits.  The third subject is complicated waves that arise in                   solutions of equations such as those that model the recovery of                 oil from an underground reservoir when water is pumped in to                    force it out.  These waves can be viewed as heteroclinic orbits.                The fourth subject is the robustness and accuracy of numerical                  methods used to compute homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits."

She uses inverse scattering techniques to obtain               solutions to the Euler equations that govern the flow of an                     incompressible, inviscid fluid.  This work follows from a Lax                   pair formulation for the Euler equations derived by the                         investigator and Vishik.  She also proposes to apply dynamo                     theory techniques to extend the applicability of the instability                criteria that she and Vishik have recently obtained for the                     linearized fluid equations.  The investigator will continue her                 examination, via the use of Hamiltonian techniques, of the                      stability/instability of three dimensional axisymmetric                         magnetohydrodynamic equilibria.                                                      The primary subject of this research concerns criteria for                 the existence of instabilities (i.e., when a small change in a                  steady configuration becomes larger and larger with time.)  Fluid               instabilities are crucial factors in determining the behavior of                many important physical systems.  For example, the so called                    baroclinic instability governs the large scale circulation of the               atmosphere; convective instabilities play an important role in                  air-sea interaction with implications for possible global                       warming; magnetohydrodynamic instabilities underlie the                         phenomenon of plasma fusion; the existence of terrestrial and                   solar magnetic fields is dependent on dynamo instabilities.  The                investigator's mathematical analysis of the equations of fluid                  motion has led to specific criteria governing the existence of                  certain types of instabilities and her proposed research will                   continue to advance our understanding of the behavior of                        geophysical and astrophysical fluids."

Shock waves, turbulent mixing zones, flame fronts,                      solidification fronts, and fluid and material interfaces provide                examples of the types of waves considered here.  The                            investigators analyze first the regular case, in which a small                  number of waves meet at a point and propagate in a self-similar                 fashion, as a traveling wave with definite velocity and with                    definite relativeangles.  This problem is related to, but more                  difficult than, the one-dimensional Riemann problem, with which                 the investigators and coworkers have prior experience.  Secondly,               they consider the case of chaotic higher dimensional wave                       interactions, characterized by unstable interfaces, mixing                      regions, and sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  In this               chaotic case, they identify elementary modes, which interact to                 form an effective statistical ensemble.  The study of the chaotic               case depends upon the renormalization group, and methods to                     reduce the number of effective degrees of freedom.  Fixed points                of the renormalization group found by the investigators and                     coworkers to characterize chaotic mixing regimes suggest                        directions for research.                                                        One of the most difficult aspects of the study of wave                          propagation is the computation of nonlinear wave interactions.                  This project is to study the mathematical structure of such                     interactions and to use this analysis to improve computer                       programs that model flows where wave interactions are important.                Flows of this type occur in a wide variety of industrial,                       military, and scientific applications, including supersonic                     flight, sheet metal forming and die pressing, weather prediction,               fluid turbulence, projectile penetration of armor, blast waves,                 and astrophysics.  All of these areas are characterized by                      sensitive dependence on the detailed structures produced by the                 nonlinear interaction of waves, and thus share many common                      mathematical aspects.  Knowledge gained in studying the abstract                properties of wave interactions can be applied to all of these                  areas, and will lead to improved computer simulations and a                     better understanding of the processes occurring during strong                   wave interactions."

A                    microtubule is an arrangement of tubulin in a tube-like shape.                  Tubulin is a protein that plays a key role in the ability of                    cells to hold their shape and to move.  So a better understanding               of the growth of microtubule could lead to a clearer picture of                 cell development; this is important in areas as diverse as the                  development of fetuses and the growth of tumors."

Their model is based on field studies from                        northwestern Minnesota that indicate that adjacent wolf packs                   form  distinct territories that are separated by ""buffer zones""                 where packs rarely trespass.  These buffer zones can provide a                  spatial refuge for the primary prey species: white-tailored deer.               The field studies show that deer density is higher in the inter-                territorial areas (refuges) and is lower near the center of                     established territories (where deer populations may be subject to               intense predation).  The buffer zones may also stabilize wolf-                  deer interactions by providing a reservoir of deer that can                     recolonize areas of wolf territory that have suffered heavy                     predation losses.

The                   analysis of the model equations will employ mathematical and                    numerical techniques from areas such as perturbation theory and                 finite difference numerical methods.  This should lead to a                     detailed quantitative understanding of wolf territorial pattern                 formation,  and an illustration of how territoriality influences                the distribution and abundance of deer.

For fixed                   time-stepping strategies, the proposed area of research is a                    generalisation of the classical theories of A, B and G stability.

Many phenomena of interest in the physical sciences and                    engineering require the understanding of dynamical phenomena that               evolve over very long time scales.  Examples include turbulence                 in fluids, phase separation in solids, and planetary motions.                   Often these phenomena are modelled by differential equations and                it is necessary to approximate these equations by computational                 techniques to obtain information about the underlying problem                   being modelled.  A question of fundamental importance is to                     ascertain the validity of the computer-generated output and, in                 particular, it is important to understand fully the relationship                between the computer-generated approximations of the model and                  the behavior of the model itself.

The model is intended to represent blood                flow in large arteries with stenoses and atherosclerosis.                       Detailed localized numerical solution for the flow in free moving               elastic tubes with local hardening, thickening and occlusions is                obtained.  Corresponding experiments are made in the lab using                  elastic tubes.  The numerical and experimental results are                      compared and the mathematical model may be further refined.                     Those results are also compared with published results of in vivo               measurements to verify the validity of the models and techniques.               The numerical results obtained and experimental techniques                      developed in this project will lead to better understanding of                  blood flow in large arteries and may be of clinical value in the                future.                                                                              As is well-known, cardiovascular diseases are the leading                  causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States.  Specific               diseases are typically atherosclerosis, stenoses, and aneurysms                 that often remain undetected due to inadequate diagnostic                       techniques.  This research aims to provide a valid improved                     mathematical model for blood flow in large arteries, an efficient               numerical method for mathematical simulations, and an accurate                  noninvasive ultrasound measurement technique.  These could be                   very useful for the early diagnosis of blood vessel diseases and                therefore have the potential to save many lives in the future.                  The numerical method developed in this project is also applicable               to many other free moving boundary problems and is itself of                    significance to applied mathematics."

Part I of the               research, the first of two parts, focuses on a biaxial                          constitutive test with two additional, innovative, features: (i)                the capacity to continuously measure the speed of sound in                      deforming granular material as a function of the accummulated                   deformation in the sample and the direction of propagation of the               waves and (ii) the capacity of continuously measure density                     changes and particle velocities with sophisticated X-ray imaging                equipment.  The goals of Part I include (i) experimentally, to                  construct and operate the apparatus and (ii) computationally, to                simulate deformation of a sample in the apparatus, including                    superimposed acoustic waves, up to and beyond the formation of                  shear bands.  Mathematical analysis has a major supporting role                 to play in extracting constitutive information from the                         experimental data and in developing an appropriate numerical                    scheme.                                                                              Part II of the research consists of several subprojects                    which probe more deeply phenomena discovered in the previous                    grant period.  These include (i) to study the flutter instability               as a possible cause of vibrations in silos, (ii) to further                     investigate experimentally and to understand analytically                       porosity waves in a discharging silo, (iii) to characterize more                fully and to explain the power spectra of time-dependent stresses               in a discharging silo, and (iv) to explore ""scale-invariant""                    initial value problems as a possible paradigm problem in                        elastoplasticity (analogous to the Riemann problem in gas                       dynamics).

However, there are many geophysical occurrences of granular                     materials, and the rich supply of constitutive information on                   sound propagatioyn to be gathered from this project will be                     relevant for these.  Moreover, the simulation of shear banding                  has implications far beyond this project - mathematically because               shear banding involves PDE which change type and scientifically                 because shear banding is a widespread mechanism leading to                      failure in many materials."

For                  the interfacial dynamics problem, the investigator will use                     singular perturbation methods, viscosity methods, functional                    analysis, etc., to establish some physically based criteria for                 the motion of the interfaces, and to provide some mathematical                  justification on the uniformity between the modern models and the               classical models in solidification theory and related areas.                         A thermistor is a heat sensitive electrical resistor which                 has  been widely used in current regulation, switching, gas                     detection, control and alarms, etc.  The investigator will use                  mathematical tools to find relations among the characteristics of               thermistors, thereby providing guidelines for practical design                  and testing.  Interface, in the solidification case, is the                     boundary between solid and liquid.  Motion of the interface is                  essential to the solidification theory.  Many good models                       concerning the motion of interfaces have been proposed.  The                    investigator plans to justify rigorously these relations,                       especially the common aspects of various models, and find                       physically based criteria for the motion of the interfaces where                the current models give multiple choices."

The goal of this                     project is to obtain a cogent description of the response of                    composites to time-dependent loadings and to arrive at effective                medium theories which give a macroscopic description of the                     response.

Of               main interest are problems related to the structure and stability               of matter.                                                                           First, rigorous estimates will be established on the effects               of correlations between many electron on the binding and                        ionization in atomic and molecular systems.                                          Second, the structure of matter  on the surface of a neutron               star under large magnetic fields will be mathematically analyzed.               This study involves the fairly  new area of semiclassical                       analysis in the presence of a magnetic field.                                        Third, are problems related to the statistical mechanics of                quantum spin systems, especially the systems with continuous                    symmetry.                                                                            Quantum mechanics is probably one of the most successful                   attempts to give a mathematical description of the world around                 us.  However, while many complex quantum mechanically systems are               fairly well understood at a somewhat heuristic level, a complete                mathematical analysis of these systems is very difficult and very               often lacking.  The lack of a detailed mathematical analysis of                 these systems is not separate from a lack of complete                           understanding of the underlying physics.  The mathematical                      analysis of a series of these complex physical systems will be                  attempted and it is the hoped that new mathematical as well as                  physical insight will emerge."

Central to this study                will be the construction of regularization schemes based on                     proximal type methods which play an important role in the                       development of numerical schemes based on duality and                           decomposition techniques for large scale problems.  A new class                 of proximal-like mappings associated with closed convex functions               is introduced, where the usual quadratic term is replaced by                    entropy-like distances.  When applied to the dual of an                         optimization problem, this gives rise to a wide variety of new                  augmented Lagrangian methods which have many attractive                         properties, not present in the classical quadratic augmented                    Lagrangian.  The main thrust of the proposed research is to                     follow this approach with an attempt to develop new mathematical                tools for the computational and theoretical analysis of                         optimization problems.  Properties of the optimal sets of the                   regularized problems, the construction of iterative schemes for                 approximating primal and dual solutions and convergence analysis                issues will be studied.  Duality methods and decomposition                      techniques will be used to support the development of efficient                 computational schemes for convex as well as nonconvex and                       nondifferentiable problems, by taking advantage of the problem                  structure that is present in most nonlinear applied problems.                   Such development will be significant for applying our results to                a variety of concrete problems arising from applied sciences and                engineering.                                                                         Proximal methods play an important role in the development                 of computational methods based on duality theory and of                         decomposition techniques leading to parallel algorithms.                        Decomposition of large scale problems is an important and                       classical topic in applied mathematics and optimization.  Recent                advances in computer technology have motivated the search for                   constructing new algorithms for large scale problems, by taking                 full advantage of certain structures that many nonlinear applied                problems may possess.  Such problems arise, for example, as a                   result of a discretization of infinite dimensional optimization                 and optimal control problems.  They arise in a wide range of                    applications such as optimal shape design, structural                           optimization, and image reconstruction problems."

Two long-range goals of the project are: first, to                prove the global existence of solutions of the Navier-Stokes                    equations for compressible flow with large, discontinuous Cauchy                data; second, to understand solutions of these equations in the                 one-dimensional case, with Riemann initial data, in terms of                    solutions of the corresponding Euler equations for inviscid                     fluids.

The design and development of                   computer methods for numerically solving the model equations is                 greatly facilitated by a rigorous mathematical understanding of                 why solutions do exist and in what sense, and how sensitive these               solutions are to the initial state of the system.  The primary                  goal of this project is to provide this rigorous mathematical                   understanding of the mathematical models; a secondary objective                 is to apply these mathematical results to the design, testing,                  and analysis of computer algorithms for generating approximate                  solutions."

The first problem concerns               an exothermic reaction of fractional order in a reactor or                      catalyst particle.  There may then exist a dead core (a region                  where the reactant concentration vanishes) whose boundary evolves               in time.  Particular attention is paid to a high chemical                       diffusivity approximation known as the shadow system.  The second               problem treats the interaction between fluid and solid phases,                  a frequent phenomenon in chemical and materials                                 engineering. Various properties of the combustion of a porous                   solid are studied, such as the conversion time, the conversion                  front, and the penetration front.  The validity of the so-called                pseudo-steady-state approximation is examined in a more general                 setting than previously considered.  The climatology problem                    concerns the dependence of ice-covered regions on parameters such               as the solar constant and the infrared radiation constants that                 appear in the energy balance equation.                                               This study deals with aspects of reaction-diffusion systems.               The name originated with problems such as the combustion of                     coal as oxygen diffuses through the hot coal and reacts with                    it, converting it to products.  The corresponding mathematical                  model also appears, with some modifications, in other settings:                 for instance, in catalytic converters, in ecological competition,               in the spreading of contaminants and in their removal, in                       propagation of impluses along nerves, and in climate modeling.                  The investigator's interest lies both in the mathematical                       framework and in specific applications.  Using techniques                       developed recently, he directs his efforts to obtaining estimates               for quantities of physical interest such as the time required for               conversion of the solid in a gas-solid reaction and to finding                  the effect on the earth's icecaps of a change in the amount of                  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."

Our                   current theoretical  understanding of internal solitary-wave                    dynamics is based, to a large  extent, on weakly nonlinear long-                wave theories which are derived on the  assumption that only long               waves are present.  On the other hand, there  is evidence from                  laboratory and field observations that, in general,  large-                     amplitude solitary internal waves do not remain locally confined                as suggested by these approximate theories, but, rather, they                   develop  short-wavelength oscillatory tails that cause radiation                damping.  This  radiation, in turn, provides a nonlinear                        mechanism for coupling  large-amplitude solitary-wave                           disturbances with short-scale oscillatory  waves of different                   modes.  For example, it is possible for solitary  internal waves                to transfer energy to short-scale surface waves that  remain                    phase-locked with the internal waves P a situation reminiscent of               the surface rips that often accompany internal waves in the                     field, and  are visible in radar images of the sea surface.                          In order to fill the gap currently existing in our                         theoretical  understanding, this research program investigates                  the generation of  oscillatory tails and the related radiation-                 dampling mechanism of  solitary internal waves, using singular-                 perturbation and numerical  methods.  Particular emphasis is                    placed on calculating the amplitude of  short-wave tails under                  realistic conditions, including the possibility  of deep fluids                 and the presence of a free surface.  For this purpose, a                        nonlinear WKB technique will be developed for weakly nonlinear                  disturbances, and fully numerical computations will be carried                  out for large-amplitude solitary waves.  In addition, the                       transfer of energy  from solitary waves to small-scale                          disturbances of different modes  (short-scale surface or lower-                 mode internal waves) will be examined in  comparison with other                 physical processes, like viscous dissipation, that  occur in                    practice."

The research concerns the             study of nonlinear partial differential equations by the Inverse                Scattering Transform (IST) Method.  The IST method has been a                   successful and powerful method of solution in the 1+1 (one space                and one time dimension) setting.  The power of the IST method comes             from the fact that the solution of certain nonlinear partial                    differential equations can be reduced to the solution of the                    inverse problem for linear ordinary differential equations, and                 such an inverse problem can usually be formulated as a Riemann-                 Hilbert problem.

The                   long-term goal of this project is to study mathematically the                   origin and properties of traveling waves of excitation in heart                 muscle, in fields of aggregating cells, in fields of dividing                   cells, and in nonliving chemical mixtures.

The models are studied by                        analytical mathematical methods and by numerical simulations.                        In modern industrialized nations, the two most common causes               of death are heart disease and cancer.  Each is a                               complicated suite of diseases with many different causes and                    treatments. Nonetheless, at a fundamental level, hearts fail                    because the electrical stimulation of heart muscle contraction                  goes awry, and cancers spread because the normal controls over                  cell growth and division are short-circuited.  To develop                       rational strategies to treat or cure these diseases, one must                   understand the basic biological machinery that controls the                     contraction of heart muscle and the division of body cells.  The                investigator and other mathematical biologists are using powerful               mathematical tools to unravel the inner workings of the beating                 heart and the dividing cell.  Their models have revealed                        previously hidden secrets.  For instance, the rapid disorganized                fluttering of a failing heart is caused by tiny rotating waves of               contraction the spin out of control in the heart muscle.                        Mathematical models are used to uncover the laws that govern                    these spinning waves, that dictate their onset and demise, and                  that hold the key to their treatment.  Similarly, the laws that                 govern cell division, that determine which cells shall divide and               when, are ultimately expressible with mathematical precision.  As               these laws become clear, through experimental and theoretical                   investigations, it will be possible to use them intelligently to                bring renegade cancer cells back under control."

In a large class of iterative methods, each                iteration consists of a solution of another system of equations.                If that system is in turn solved by an iterative method, it is                  called a two-stage iterative method.  Among the questions to be                 investigated are criteria to determine the optimal or                           near-optimal number of inner iterations to guarantee overall                    convergence of the two-stage method.  When a matrix is                          appropriately partitioned by blocks, and its diagonal blocks are                nonsingular, many of the classical iterative methods can be                     generalized to treat each submatrix as a component.  On a MIMD                  parallel computer (a computer that executes multiple streams of                 instructions on multiple streams of data), each diagonal block                  can be solved by a different processor, using components of                     previous iterations as soon as they are available.  These are                   chaotic or asynchronous parallel block iterative methods.  Their                convergence properties as well as implementation details will be                studied.  Iterative methods for the solution of the general                     eigenvalue problem will also be studied.  Experiments with these                methods will be performed on different parallel architectures.                       A large class of problems in science and enginering is                     described by linear systems of equations.  These are equations in               which the unknown quantities appear in a simple way.  An example                of a linear system is the description of the forces on a building               structure.  These forces need to be calculated to design the                    building materials.  The quantities to be calculated, called the                variables or unknowns, are the forces on particular points of the               structure.  To describe a big structure, such as a high-rise                    building or a bridge, many hundreds or thousands of equations are               needed, but because the forces on each point come only from a few               neighboring points, the equations are relatively simple.  A                     simple iterative method to solve such equations, that is, to find               the values of the unknowns, consists in giving an initial                       approximation for the values of some unknowns, and then computing               the values of the resulting forces on the other points of the                   structure.  Parallel computers are simply a collection of                       computers or processors that communicate with each other.  In the               method just described, different processors can compute the value               of the forces on different points simultaneously, using the                     information already computed by the other processors.  This is                  repeated until all values satisfy all equations.  This situation,               if attained, is called convergence. Not all iterative methods                   attain convergence.  In this project, the iterative methods for                 which convergence can be guaranteed will be studied.  Experiments               will be carried out to test them."

The core of the                   research is in partial differential equations and systems of                    ordinary differential equations.                                                     A distinctive feature of this grant is its support of the                  ongoing postdoctoral and visitor program at the Courant Institute               of Mathematical Sciences.  The institute provides a unique                      opportunity for young mathematical scientists to gain new                       insights into the applicability of their researches, a tradition                at the institute since its inception.  The vast number of U.S.                  mathematicians who have been imprinted by the CIMS spirit as                    students, postdocs or visitors is unmatched anywhere else.                      Probably even in the world.                                                          Much of the present work will focus on nonlinear equations.                One class of problems concerns the question of monotonicity of                  solutions of nonlinear second order equations in prescribed                     directions.  This type of problem arises in the analysis of flame               propagation in cylinders.  In a different direction work will                   also be done to determine whether there exist periodic solutions                to vector-valued ordinary differential equations with a time                    periodic forcing function.  Additionally, the classical sine-                   Gordon equation has been used by mathematicians to provide                      examples of solitary waves as solutions of relatively simple                    nonlinear equations.  It has been suspected that solutions which                decay at infinity (called breathers) are nonexistent.  Techniques               necessary for the resolution of this problem are probably now                   developed to the point where an answer can be expected in the                   short term.  Work will be done toward this goal."

Many problems are most naturally initially modeled as a                 DAE.  They arise, for example, in a variety of control problems                 in flight control, robotics, chemical process control, and                      contact or constrained problems in mechanics.  In addition,                     differential algebraic equations occur in the solution of partial               differential equations by the method of lines and in many circuit               models.  DAEs are sometimes also called singular or descriptor                  systems.

Existing numerical codes, while very useful, require                 special problem structure and do not handle many problems of                    interest.  This project will develop a general numerical method                 for nonlinear differential algebraic equations.  These results                  will also be of interest when explicit models exist, but the                    sparsity, nonlinearity, or dependence on parameters of the                      equations, make the original implicit system preferable to a                    lower order, but non-sparse, (or difficult to compute local)                    explicit system."

In particular, they construct suitable algorithms to               compute orbits of chaotic ordinary differential equations, such                 as the Lorenz equations, and derive rigorous estimates of the                   shadowing error in such numerically computed orbits; determine                  general conditions under which an attractor of a differential                   equation is well-approximated by an attractor of the discretized                system resulting from a one-step method; and devise a rigorous                  numerical algorithm to test for hyperbolicity in specific                       dynamical systems.  They also study homoclinic phenomena, which                 play an essential role in the analysis of chaotic behavior.  More               specifically, they estimate the intervals of the parameter on a                 dense subset of which a one-parameter family of dissipative                     planar diffeomorphisms has homoclinic tangencies, and establish                 the presence of transversal homoclinic points in slowly varying                 systems.                                                                             Some of the more noteworthy discoveries in dynamical systems               have largely been based on numerical experiments.  It is                        important to devise such experiments whose reliability can be                   rigorously verified.  Most of this project is concerned with                    chaotic systems.  In recent years it has been realized that much                of nature behaves chaotically.  For example, small changes on a                 given day in weather parameters such as temperature and                         barometric pressure can lead to large fluctuations in weather                   patterns a few days later.  A mathematical model that describes a               chaotic system in nature will almost inevitably behave                          chaotically also.  Because these mathematical models can rarely                 be solved exactly, knowledge of their behavior relies greatly on                computer simulations.  The main object of this project is to                    develop tests that will tell how close a computer simulation of a               chaotic system is to a true behavior of the system."

A primary goal is to discover how certain                   features of nonlinear dynamics, and in particular the dynamic                   attractors (limit cycles, chaotic attractors, fractals)                         apparently found in biological systems, can be useful for pattern               learning, recognition, and retrieval.  To test the results, nets                that recognize handwritten digits will be built.  The normal form               projection algorithm, a new method of constructing networks, will               be used.  A key feature of a net built this way is that its                     underlying dynamics is explicitly isomorphic to any of a class of               standard, well-understood nonlinear dynamical systems.  This                    system is chosen in advance, independent of the patterns to be                  stored and the learning algorithm used.  The projection algorithm               decouples certain dynamical features -- stability, basin                        geometry, and rates of convergence -- from others that are more                 problem-dependent, such as preprocessing, learning rules, and                   reconstruction of data.

The connections between nodes may                 themselves be weighted so that certain inputs or outputs are more               influential than others.  If one views a net as a dynamical                     system, the rest points of the system are what the net ""knows.""                 The theoretical knowledge and practical experience gained in this               project may lead to greater understanding of the design                         principles that underlie the superior performance of biological                 systems in pattern recognition, robotics, and adaptive behavior,                and to greater insight into memory, learning, and motor control                 in biological networks.

He uses results from                   averaging theory for ordinary differential equations and from a                 theory for the motion of energetic charged particles based on                   Nekhoroshev-type estimates.  By combining recent progress in                    long-time estimates with quasiconvex unperturbed part (due to                   Lochak and Poeschel), and in averaging theory for ordinary                      differential equations (Ellison, Saenz, and Dumas), he expects to               develop improved estimates for specific model systems.  This                    expectation is based on the way averaging methods are embedded in               Lochak's new approach: his methods reduce the problem --- in what               is probably an optimal way --- to a high-order, single-phase,                   periodic averaging problem of the type for which improved                       estimates were recently developed.

Such estimates might augment or even partly                      supplant some of the costly experimental methods now used to                    design and test accelerator lattices (the collections of                        multipole magnetic elements used to stabilize particle beams                    orbiting in accelerator storage rings).  In view of the enormous                development costs of the next generation of accelerators (such as               the Superconducting Super-Collider, now in the initial phases of                construction in Waxahachie, Texas, even as its development                      continues), even a small contribution to the design theory could                result in a sizable savings of time and money.  Moreover,                       estimates of the same type might be useful in much the same way                 in the design and development of ""toroidal confinement fusion                   machines"" (hot fusion reactors)."

Such networks are common in the central nervous system, but so far the relationship between structure and function in them is largely unexplored. Some of the specific projects are tightly connected to the analysis of particular neurophysiological networks, such as the vertebrate central pattern generator for undulatory locomotion. This work is undertaken in collaboration with a group of neurophysiologists. Others are designed to develop new methods to analyze such networks. In particular, neurons and networks of them operate on many different time scales, and new mathematical techniques are needed to understand the range of behaviors that can result as a consequence. The mathematics is used to help determine which features in the neurons or their connectivity is responsible for the emergent behavior seen in physiological preparations or in computer simulations of them. Mathematical techniques that have been useful for earlier stages of this work include reduction procedures that produce simpler equations having similar behavior. New techniques to be developed include geometric methods for the analysis of equations with many time scales. Some of the project topics concern the development of such techniques independent of biological questions. Central pattern generators are neural networks -- clusters of neurons connected together -- that are thought to govern rhythmic motor activity such as walking, running, swimming, and breathing. These generators are examples of oscillatory networks of neurons. The project aims to develop a better understanding of the relations between the structure of oscillatory networks and the behaviors of the networks. Such understanding is fundamental for a variety of neurophysiological questions."

The first area is an interdisciplinary study done in collaboration with Dr. J. W. Zyskind on the modeling of initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli. Using mathematical models, they attempt to explain which are the most important steps in the beginning of the DNA replication cycle. Several other regulatory processes for growing cells are examined, providing additional insight into cellular control systems and introducing new dynamical systems to study. The second area of inquiry analyzes the stability region for a linear differential equation with two delays. Both analytical and numerical techniques are used to determine how the stability region varies with the parameters in this equation. The stability region varies dramatically for even small changes in some parameters, so studying these anomalies is very important from a modeling point of view. The final area of investigation examines mathematical models for erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis. Previous models have included two delays linking this study to the previous one. More recently, models have been developed using either state-dependent delays or age-structured modeling. The principal investigator has developed a new age-structured model that more accurately reflects the biology in hematopoietic systems. He will undertake mathematical studies to determine the qualitative behavior of this model and to examine how it compares to models with either multiple delays or state-dependent delays. Parameter identification methods may provide quantitative information for how these systems can become unstable in certain disease states. The principal objective of this project is to develop mathematical models that correspond to known biological behavior. The models will provide insight into the mechanisms that govern the specific biological problem. DNA replication marks the beginning of the cell cycle in bacteria. An understanding of the controls underlying the cell cycle is important for other areas of research, including genetic engineering and cancer research. The mathematical studies provide support for certain biological experiments, suggest further avenues of experimentation, and show how some biological theories are impossible. The computer simulations of cellular processes require less time to perform than experiments and are significantly less costly. However, it is the interaction between the experimenter and the mathematical modeler in this study that will be most important to the advancement in understanding the cell cycle. Mathematical models for erythropoiesis or red blood cell production can elucidate the effects of certain changes in this complicated process that begins with simple undifferentiated cells in the bone marrow and proceeds to mature red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. The models may explain the mechanisms underlying certain blood diseases and suggest possible therapeutic procedures. The models could aid in developing new procedures to efficiently collect blood, which is significant for patients who choose to provide their own blood supply for elective surgery and avoid risks of HIV infection. The work includes several novel mathematical techniques that will advance fundamental research tools available for future mathematical studies. These tools will be applicable to a wide range of problems in applied mathematics."

The project focusses on the complexity theory of learning for feed-forward neural networks and on the optimality of learning algorithms. Such algorithms are amenable to complexity theoretic analyses, and existence and characteristics of lower bounds on learning times for neural networks will be studied. This will bear on questions regarding feasibility of constructing working feedforward learning networks. The problems will be studied largely from a functional analytic approach. The investigator will also study semigroup and statistical mechanics approaches to finding global energy minima in neural nets (useful in minimizing the error in learning algorithms). The main aim of this work is to develop more rapid semigroup simulation methods (related to the simulated annealing process) for optimizing weights in neural nets. Work in analytic complexity will involve investigation of relationships of worst-case properties of algorithms to their average case characteristics. It will also concentrate on the role of randomization (e.g., Monte Carlo methods) in breaking intractability of continuous mathematical problems. Complexity theory has as its goal the analysis and understanding of the difficulty (in terms of time and amount of computation) of solving mathematical problems. Certain simple-looking problems are surprisingly complex when they are attacked, say, on the computer. There is in complexity theory the notion of intractability, namely, the phenomenon in which a problem is so difficult that, even with all of the computing resources one can imagine (existing now or in the future), the problem is nevertheless unsolvable. The investigator studies these notions, especially in the context of neural networks. The area of neural networks involves the study of computing elements connected very much like neurons in the brain, and has the ultimate goal of showing how one might be able to duplicate the functions of naturally intelligent systems like the brain. This field has been approached quite mathematically in recent years, and is an area in which complexity theory has some real potential for inroads. This is because it has been shown that in principle neural networks can solve essentially any problem imaginable, but the question of how long such solutions will take (or how many neurons they will require) is very subtle and difficult. In particular, it is important to know which so-called intelligence problems are tractable in the present neural network paradigms. The mathematical questions here can be framed quite naturally, and the investigator will study their meaning and answers. He will also study other methods of modeling neural networks using techniques such as simulation via random processes. In addition, the investigator will study other complexity theoretic issues related to the above problems of tractability."
