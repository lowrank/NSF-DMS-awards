It is believed that more than 95% of the matter in the universe is in the form of a plasma (the fourth state). The main motivation of this research is to promote design of nuclear fusion devices (such as a tokamak), in which a confined plasma is accelerated at high speed to produce high energy. This project focuses on basic mathematical research related to the study of a plasma in a tokamak. Research topics include study of plasma-wall interaction, dynamic stability of plasma configurations, as well as shock waves in plasma. All of such topics are fundamental theoretically in the plasma control for a nuclear fusion device with potential applications.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project is aimed at establishing regularity, and the validity of boundary layer expansion with geometric corrections for the Boltzmann theory in a convex domain. The key methodology is based on the principal investigator's previous work on regularity of similar boundary layer expansions for the neutron transport equations. Another direction to be pursued is well-posedness for the Vlasov-Landau equations in a bounded domain. This system of equations is fundamental in modeling a collisional plasma, and the boundary value problem models the plasma-wall interaction. Among other problems to be investigated are: The Landau damping and long-time stability for the BGK waves in a Vlasov-Poisson system; the long-time behavior of Euler-Maxwell system in the presence of a non-zero vorticity that describes the fundamental two-fluid models in a plasma; the dynamics of moving contact lines in fluids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lipid membranes are fundamental building blocks of cellular structure forming the separating walls, the plumbing, and the assembly points for many proteins. The work will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of mathematicians and plant biologists and will focus on validating experimental observations of lipid droplets against predictions of the multicomponent lipid models. Lipid droplets are of significance to public health for their role as a signal of the onset of metabolic syndrome, which has a correlation with the development of small fatty inclusions (lipid droplets) within the liver. Lipid droplets are being pursed in oil seeds and algae as energy storage compartments to improve the energy content of the biomass. The mathematical elements of the proposal identify key bottlenecks within the rearrangement of lipid structures with the creation and destruction of minimal energy pathways within a higher dimensional system, these pathways correspond to optimal packings of lipids and oil that contribute to the observed self-assembled structures.   <br/> <br/>The project presents a detailed analysis of the structure of the free energy governing the low energy connections that represent amphiphilic morphologies and high energy barriers that are the minimal cost of reorganization. The PI and his collaborators investigate the central thesis that the dominant manifestation of the entropy of packing of amphiphilic molecules lies in the structure of this connection problem. Packing-based energy landscapes are strongly nonlinear, and fundamentally distinct from the more weakly nonlinear mixture-based models built upon the Cahn Hilliard framework. The packing-based energy will be validated against in-vitro experiments on lipid droplets, the prototypical example of a two-fluid amphiphilic system driven by interfacial competition, and are compared with entropic descriptions derived from short- chain limits of self-consistent mean field theory models. Specifically, the proposal uses spatial dynamics and singular perturbation techniques to develop robust pearling inhibition that stabilizes the pearling modes of connections, and tunes the existence and persistence of connections and barriers within factored Melnikov structure via piecewise defined and singularly perturbed dynamical system approaches. The two fluid model of lipid droplet formation will be used to investigate pinch-off and merging events while one fluid models address phase separation (rafting) and localized pearling. The models will be validated by comparison to entropic effects extracted from self-consistent mean field models of amphiphilic blends, to in-vitro experimental morphology of lipid droplets, and to the bifurcation diagram for castings of synthetic amphiphilic polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The internal interaction mechanism attracts a lot of attention in physics, engineering, biology, and social sciences. This project is devoted to developing a unified mathematical theory towards the understanding of the swarming dynamics, as well as other nonlocal models that share similar structures. These models are widely considered in fluid mechanics, meteorology, astrophysics, biology, and ecology. The study of the regularity and singularity formations of these equations will provide a firm theoretical foundation for these applications, and also help consolidate the validity of these models in describing the natural phenomena. <br/><br/><br/>The research will focus on understanding the nonlinear and nonlocal phenomena in swarming dynamics, and models having related structures in fluid mechanics. Three different but related models will be investigated. The first model is the Euler-Alignment system, which describes the flocking behavior in animal swarms. The goal is to develop a robust toolbox to analyze the nonlocal alignment operator and its balance with the drift nonlinearity. Similar behaviors are also observed in other fluid equations including porous medium flow, and surface quasi-geostrophic equations, which will be investigated using the same analytical techniques. The second model is the 2D inviscid Boussinesq equations. The global regularity is one of the outstanding problems in fluid dynamics. The idea is to construct solutions to capture the possible singularity formation, starting from some modified versions of the equations. The third model is the kinetic swarming system. The aim is to investigate the important relation between the kinetic equation and a variety of hydrodynamic limits. In particular, different alignment operators will be considered at the kinetic level. They are expected to lead to different macroscopic limits. All these three sub-projects will advance the mathematical understanding of nonlocal PDEs and related applications. They will also provide education and training to graduate and undergraduate students in this active field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, in many vital areas of application, notably in geology or astrophysics, direct detailed observations are not available. The chaotic microscopic behavior can give rise, however, to very robust macroscopic structures, for example, the great red spot on Jupiter or pattern formation in chemical reactions, which can be studied by methods of statistical physics. A rigorous derivation of the existence and properties of such coherent patterns from the fundamental laws of physics is a notoriously difficult problem that requires additional assumptions that select typical solutions. These assumptions frequently include an addition of randomness, which models unknown influences, or a condition that the system equally explores all possible states. Then the existence and properties of statistical steady states of complex systems is accessible mathematically. This research project explores and further develops this important class of mathematical models.<br/><br/>The project branches in two directions. The first part focuses on properties of statistical invariant states for stochastically forced systems, especially their stability, dependence on parameters, and distribution on the state space. Special attention is given to the structure of the introduced forcing, as it is crucial for application, where the noise might act only in parts of the physical space or be localized is some scales. Although mainly problems arising from fluid dynamics are explored, equations originating in biology and chemistry are also considered. The second branch aims to gain more insight into the problems for which the addition of random forcing is not well motivated or it causes undesired behavior of the model, such as blow-up. Assuming the ergodic hypothesis, the large deviation principle implies that the system evolves toward thermodynamic equilibrium, and statistical solutions can be viewed as maximizers of an entropy, which effectively transforms evolution equations to variational problems.  The analysis of stability, observability, and qualitative properties of these so-called Gibbs states relies on variational methods, bifurcation theory, and investigation of associated Euler-Lagrange equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interplay of spatially discrete structure and nonlinearity in many physical and biological systems, from mechanical metamaterials and nanoelectromechanical devices to biopolymers, often results in formation of nonlinear waveforms that either coherently transport or release energy as they propagate through the system.  In particular, recent experimental and theoretical work on granular materials has advanced the understanding of the conditions for existence and properties of a variety of such structures, including traveling pulses and shock waves.  However, much less is known about the conditions under which these structures are stable.  The goal of this project is to obtain such criteria in a framework that extends earlier work to more general classes of waves and to broader settings that account for the effects of higher dimensions, lattice structure, external driving, and damping.  Fundamental understanding of stability criteria for nonlinear waves is important in a number of different fields, including materials science, condensed matter physics, mechanical engineering, and biophysics.  The insights provided by this work can be helpful in designing new devices for energy channeling, shock absorption, and vibration mitigation.  An integral component of this collaborative project is teaching and training graduate students in the interdisciplinary research area of nonlinear wave phenomena in lattices.  To this end, graduate students participate in the research.<br/><br/>This project builds on the ongoing joint work of the principal investigators on stability of solitary traveling waves in one-dimensional lattices and its intimate connection to the stability of discrete breathers.  This involves developing novel analytical stability criteria, as well as state-of-the-art numerical approaches necessary to extend this framework to broader settings, including two-dimensional and heterogeneous lattices, while considering more general classes of traveling waves.  In particular, stability of waveforms with oscillatory tails, such as nanoptera in resonant granular chains and generalized kinks in dislocation models, is investigated.  The project involves studying dynamic implications of instability and examining the effects of dissipation, long-range interactions, and external driving.  The project's goals also include clarifying the relation of the linear spectra associated with a solitary traveling wave (and their variations at instability critical points) to the corresponding discrete breather Floquet spectra, as well as connecting the stability criteria for such waves to the established functional analytic framework for continuum systems.

Systemic risk corresponds to rare events of many defaults in cascade, disrupting liquidity and the economy as a whole. This research project concerns modeling this network in interaction and studying the limiting behavior as the number of agents becomes large. The project studies Nash equilibria, whose limits are described by so-called mean field games. The focus is on the effects of time delays and randomness on the network itself. This research aims to help understand and ultimately prevent the occurrence of systemic adverse events. From the point of view of the regulators, it is important to rank institutions according to their contributions to systemic risk; on the other hand, this ranking needs to be fair to the banks. The research also aims to develop mathematical tools to measure systemic risk and design fair allocation schemes.<br/><br/>Mathematically, systemic risk events in the network of banks correspond to a large deviation principle describing the occurrence of the small probability events in which a large number of participants are defaulting. The research consists in using mean field game theory to derive large deviation of the finite player games. The first goal is to consider the effect of delays in the game and develop the corresponding theory of mean field games with delay. The second goal is to study large deviations for games on stochastic networks. The main tool will be to use the master equation for the corresponding mean field game, specifically to explore how the stochastic nature of the network will affect the rate function in the large deviation principle. The third goal is to develop a duality approach to the systemic risk measures introduced in previous work, to ensure fairness of systemic risk allocations to the participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to apply modern machine learning and geometric tools to the problems of classification and automated reassembly of broken bone fragments from an archaeological context, to determine agents of breakage (e.g., carnivore, hominin, etc.,), improve taxonomic identifications, and better understand site formation processes through spatial analysis of refits.  The anthropological implications are expected to impact the study of early human origins and dispersal, prehistory, culture, predator avoidance, and social organization -- hunting, scavenging, food provisioning, etc.  The project relies on samples and data generated both locally by known agents and through ongoing field work in Dmanisi, Georgia; if successful, these methods can be applied to archaeological sites from all times around the world.  The potential impact of success is underscored by the April, 2017 announcement that, based on the geometry of broken mastodon bones, humans settled the Americas 100,000 years earlier than the standard estimates of 30-40,000 years ago, although this claim remains highly controversial in the field.  Accurate and precise methods of determining the agent of breakage have not yet been completely worked out by archaeologists, and hence a reassessment of their bone analysis would be of supreme interest.  Besides zooarchaeological applications, potential areas of significant impact include computer-aided and virtual reassembly of other archaeological objects (pottery, statuary, lithics and tools, etc.), paleontology (dinosaurs and other fossils), art restoration, and computer-assisted surgery, where the mathematical techniques can aid the surgeon to both plan and undertake an operation while minimizing the invasiveness and impact on the patient.  Other areas where these techniques have already had some impact include the reassembly of jigsaw puzzles, shredded documents, and whole histological sections from digitized tissue fragments, as well as the diagnosis of cancer in breast tumors and the distinguishing of moles from melanomas.  Graduate and undergraduate students participate in the research.<br/><br/>The project seeks to adapt and extend known geometric methods, data analysis, and numerical schemes, particularly those based on continuous and discrete invariant signatures, to the problem of analyzing and reconstructing broken solid objects, with a particular emphasis on bone fragments.  Notable success in the automatic reassembly of non-pictorial jigsaw puzzles and broken surfaces, e.g., egg shells, using differential invariant signatures, suggests that one of the key goals of the project, the three-dimensional solid object reconstruction problem, is attainable.  In addition, new (to anthropological field work) geometric tools of surface geometry -- principal curvatures, torsion and curvature of three-dimensional break curves, histogram and other discrete integral invariants -- are applied to analyze breakage geometry, starting with controlled samples of ungulate (elk, cow, and goat) bones that have been broken by humans using stone tools and by animals (hyenas in the Milwaukee County Zoo and the Irvine Zoo in Chippewa Falls), in preparation for the eventual analysis of field samples from Dmanisi and possibly other sites around the world, such as Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and The Cradle of Humankind in South Africa.  This analysis is used to develop machine learning algorithms, both fully supervised and semi-supervised, for classifying bone fragments based on agent of breakage.  We map the bone fragments into feature spaces via computation of histograms of geometric invariants, and train a machine learning algorithm, such as k-nearest neighbors or support vector machine classifiers, to distinguish between different agents of breakage.  The controlled samples of ungulate bones broken by humans are used as training data, and field data from the Dmanisi site are used as testing data.

It studies the forces that cable networks under tension can support, and this should be important to civil engineering, in particular to bridge or building design. It studies the possible elastic responses of 3-d printed metamaterials, and this could be helpful in designing structure that guide acoustic and elastic waves, for controlling vibrations and potentially for cloaking against sonar. It opens the field of boundary field equalities, that generalizes the notion of conservation laws, and which can be used for benchmarking numerical algorithms for calculating the response of inhomogeneous bodies. It develops a new approach to scattering of electromagnetic and elastic waves off an inclusion, that can help one understand the extent to which an arbitrarily shaped inclusion can scatter the waves. It develops new bounds that can be useful for predicting the electromagnetic response of two-phase composites even if one does not know the detailed microstructure. This should help in the identification of the most energy-absorbing composites and nano-particles. It explores what novel responses can be achieved in metamaterials, through coupled effects of electrical current flow, interaction with magnetic fields, and vibrations. This may lead to new types of magnetic field sensors and to novel devices coupling deformation and magnetic effects. For biomedical, engineering and counterterrorism applications it is vitally important to know what is inside a body from non-invasive testing, and it is better if one can say things with near certainty. The project will provide new methods of obtaining precise lower and upper limits on the volume occupied by an inclusion in a body. This may have applications to determining the size of certain tumors, or voids in a body, or the porosity in an osteoporotic bone. It studies new classes of theoretical inhomogeneous bodies for which there is an exact solution for the field and this may be useful for benchmarking numerical algorithms, and for gaining insight into how fields can be manipulated in inhomogeneous bodies. Finally, it trains two postdocs in interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The project provides a cross-fertilization of ideas from the four areas of Structures, Metamaterials, Scattering, and Inverse Problems. Some of these ideas, developed in the theory of composites, will be applied for the first time to inverse problems where one seeks to determine what is inside a body from boundary measurements, and to scattering problems where one seeks to understand the range of possible scattering responses as the shape of the scatterer is varied. The work on boundary field equalities, that stems from the theory of exact relations in composites, seeks to explore generalizations of the classic conservation law that a field which is divergence-free inside a body has zero net flux through the surface. For bodies containing certain wide classes of inhomogeneous media these equalities provide exact identities that are satisfied by the Dirichlet to Neumann map, which plays a central role when one seeks to extract information about what is inside a body from boundary measurements. The work on elastic tensors of 3-d printed materials seeks to bring a close to the challenging question of what elastic tensors are possible in mixtures of one given material plus void. The proposal addresses the inverse problem of estimating the size of an inclusion in a body, through boundary measurements in the time (rather than frequency) domain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although there is an enormous wealth of knowledge accumulated in the broad area of fluid mechanics, many of the most fundamental and important questions remain poorly understood. Of particular interest is the question whether solutions to equations describing fluid motion can spontaneously form singularities - meaning that some quantity becomes infinite. Understanding singularities is important because they often correspond to dramatic, highly intense fluid motion, can indicate the range of applicability of the model, and are very difficult to resolve computationally. More generally, one can ask a related and broader question of creation of small scales in fluids - coherent structures that vary sharply in space and time, and contribute to phenomena such as turbulence. The project aims to analyze singularity formation process for some key equations of fluid mechanics, and to better understand the mechanisms that generate small scales in fluid motion. Another direction of the project research focuses on mixing in fluid flow. Mixing in fluids plays an important role in a wide range of settings, from marine ecology to internal combustion engines. Here the goal is to find and study fluid flows that are especially efficient mixers, as well as to produce bounds on mixing efficiency given some natural constraints. Such bounds can serve as benchmarks in evaluation of mixing processes.<br/><br/>The research covers three topics. The first topic concerns the Euler equation for incompressible inviscid fluid. It is nonlinear and nonlocal, which makes analysis difficult. Many key questions about behavior of solutions to the Euler equation remain open despite significant research efforts. Recently, the PI jointly with Vladimir Sverak have constructed examples of solutions to the 2D Euler equation which exhibit extremely fast formation of small scales. This work has been stimulated by the new scenario of potential singularity formation in the 3D Euler equation, proposed by Tom Hou and Guo Luo. The project aims to gain further rigorous insight into the possible singularity formation in three dimensions by analyzing a series of model equations.  The second topic concerns properties of solutions to the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) and modified SQG equations. These equations model evolution of temperature on the surface of Earth. Recently, the PI and collaborators have constructed examples of singularity formation in modified SQG patches in presence of boundary for a part of the possible parameter range. These examples are the first available in this class of equations. The project will involve further work on the modified SQG patch solutions, in the absence of boundary. The methods to be deployed in the first two directions of the project involve novel analytic estimates, comparison principles, asymptotic analysis, partial differential equations (PDE) estimates, and Fourier analysis techniques. The third topic concerns mixing in fluid flow. The goal is to improve understanding of flows that are most efficient in speeding up mixing. Quite often, there are constraints on some aspects of mixing flow, and it is important to understand how to produce most effective mixing under these constraints. The problems here are at the interface of applied partial differential equations, dynamical systems, probability theory and functional analysis."

The project is interdisciplinary by design - the problems cut across the fields of materials science and fluid dynamics - and is motivated by both practical and futuristic engineering applications. In materials science, for instance, there is the potential for new biologically-inspired and growth-based design mechanisms for building highly flexible but controlled solid membranes. Regarding fluid dynamics, besides the potential for the design of new and extremely efficient heat exchangers, the investigation is motivated by the broader scientific challenge of deriving the scaling laws of naturally occurring transport in turbulent fluids. As experience shows, these questions are very difficult to solve on a computer by applying conventional numerical techniques. There are oftentimes many nearly optimal answers, and each can be rather complex. Rigorous mathematical analysis presents the possibility of knowing that certain patterns are truly optimal overall: such information cannot be gleaned using other non-rigorous approaches. Thus, the project is an important contribution to the larger scientific community interested in understanding why or how such complex patterns achieve global optimality.  <br/>  <br/>This project consists of two main parts: (a) The first class of problems concerns the mechanics of thin elastic sheets, such as naturally occurring ones like leaves and flowers, but also man-made versions which can be orders of magnitude thinner than a standard sheet of paper. The thinner an elastic sheet becomes the more easily it can be deformed, in particular through bending forces, but extracting from such intuitive physical principles the mathematical mechanisms behind the vast array of wrinkling, folding, and crumpling patterns found in experiments is a clear and difficult challenge. The investigator seeks to derive through rigorous mathematical analysis the effective, coarse-grained models governing optimal elastic patterns in the vanishing thickness limit. A key task is to obtain the scaling law of the minimum energy in any natural parameters, and then to ask which patterns can possibly attain such energy scaling laws. (b) The second class of problems regards the design of incompressible fluid flows for achieving optimal heat transfer. While hot objects submerged in fluid media do cool on their own, it is natural to ask whether the efficiency of heat transfer can be significantly enhanced by intelligent stirring of the surrounding fluid. Oftentimes, any stirring protocol achieves some enhancement of heat transfer, but determining which strategies attain maximal heat transfer overall is an intriguing and open question. In the advection-dominated limit, which can be reached by increasing the amount of power available with which to stir, such optimal strategies exhibit patterns remarkably similar to those from problems of ""energy-driven pattern formation"" in mathematical materials science. The investigator is developing a precise and general link between these apparently related classes of problems, and is exploring its ramifications for the study of the scaling laws of naturally occurring turbulent transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applications contained in this project include carbon sequestration, a means of storing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in liquid form in deep underground salt water aquifers; the motion of cells in biology by a process called durotaxis; the formulation of models of granular materials such as soils, agricultural bulk grains, pharmaceutical materials.

The interest here is in equations for which the Whitham system fails to be hyperbolic, or for which the nonlinearity is degenerate, on hypersurfaces. Numerical simulations exhibit a range of nonlinear wave interactions that will be explored analytically. Novel models of flow in porous media and gravity currents in carbon sequestration exhibit unusual effects that were recently explored in student projects. The next steps aim to establish the rigorous mathematics behind these wave effects. Research on granular materials will build on a recent breakthrough in our understanding of how to formulate continuum models for which the time dependent equations are well-posed. This has been a problem in the field for at least thirty years. The continuing research will specify constitutive laws in the new framework and test them against prototype special flows, in numerical simulations, molecular dynamics representations and physical experiments. Finally, a student project on the motion of droplets in durotaxis has made progress on the corresponding static problem and is ready to move onto dynamics, in which the droplet surfs a ridge created through deformation of the underlying flexible substrate. This project is proceeding in tandem with physical experiments on contact lines and surface tension, at the interfaces between water, a gel, and air.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is perhaps surprising that the underlying process is not fully understood, especially when the fluid motion is laminar, i.e., either it is slow or the viscosity is high; then uniform, efficient mixing is hard to achieve. Such laminar processes are important to many applications including the development of micrometer scale bioreactors, effective mixing of polymer and granular materials, spreading of pollutants in the atmosphere, and even nutrient dispersal and spawning efficacy for life in the sea. Laminar flows can cause chaotic motion of advected particles, yielding rapid loss of accuracy for prediction of individual trajectories that turn out to be extremely sensitive to the miniscule changes in environment. The investigator and his colleagues study the design of efficient mixers by developing an understanding of the causes of this sensitivity, and by developing methods to globally optimize stirring protocols. The mathematics of these models is closely related to that, ubiquitous for conservative motion in physics.  Techniques the investigator develops are used to predict the lifetime of particles in accelerators, obtain rates for elemental chemical reactions, calculate confinement times in plasma devices, understand the spectra of highly excited atomic systems, and predict asteroid and spacecraft trajectories. Graduate students will be trained through participation in this research project.<br/><br/><br/>Subsonic fluids are incompressible and the resulting flows are volume-preserving. Though chaotic motion in incompressible fluids is similar to that in Hamiltonian or symplectic systems, there are profound geometrical differences due to the lack of a canonical pairing between momenta and coordinates. The investigator studies how the geometry of such dynamics changes when it is ""nearly"" symplectic, leading to novel elliptic structures and to a discovery of the violation of the exponential quasi-stability of nearly-integrable systems implied by Nekhoroshev's theory. The studies include the development of techniques for understanding transport through destroyed invariant tori and the long-time correlations engendered by regular islands and accelerator modes. Mixing due to chaotic advection is caused by stretching and folding, which promotes homoclinic tangles and structure so fine that diffusivity can be effective even when small. The investigator and his students will model this by a finite sequence of stirring events that determine a mixing protocol. Optimization techniques under geometric and energy constraints are used to extremize Sobolev norms that give measures of mixing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The internal interaction mechanism attracts a lot of attention in physics, engineering, biology, and social sciences. This project is devoted to developing a unified mathematical theory towards the understanding of the swarming dynamics, as well as other nonlocal models that share similar structures. These models are widely considered in fluid mechanics, meteorology, astrophysics, biology, and ecology. The study of the regularity and singularity formations of these equations will provide a firm theoretical foundation for these applications, and also help consolidate the validity of these models in describing the natural phenomena. <br/><br/><br/>The research will focus on understanding the nonlinear and nonlocal phenomena in swarming dynamics, and models having related structures in fluid mechanics. Three different but related models will be investigated. The first model is the Euler-Alignment system, which describes the flocking behavior in animal swarms. The goal is to develop a robust toolbox to analyze the nonlocal alignment operator and its balance with the drift nonlinearity. Similar behaviors are also observed in other fluid equations including porous medium flow, and surface quasi-geostrophic equations, which will be investigated using the same analytical techniques. The second model is the 2D inviscid Boussinesq equations. The global regularity is one of the outstanding problems in fluid dynamics. The idea is to construct solutions to capture the possible singularity formation, starting from some modified versions of the equations. The third model is the kinetic swarming system. The aim is to investigate the important relation between the kinetic equation and a variety of hydrodynamic limits. In particular, different alignment operators will be considered at the kinetic level. They are expected to lead to different macroscopic limits.

Even for standard models little is known rigorously about their range of validity. This effort highlights the critical role of theoretical insights in hydrodynamics. Such understanding goes hand in hand with the computational effort to solve the equations of gas dynamics.

An energy harvester is a device that transforms the energy of mechanical vibration of an elastic structure (a beam or an aircraft wing) into electric energy. Energy harvesting is a newly emerging area. The goal of this research direction is to develop a new technology for providing alternative sources of electric power and/or recharging storage devices such as batteries or capacitors. The concept has ecological ramifications in reducing the chemical waste and potential monetary gains by significantly reducing maintenance cost. A piezoelectric energy harvester consists of an elastic structure (e.g., a beam) and layers of a piezoelectric material bonded to it. If the structure vibrates under an influence of external forces (e.g., an ambient airflow) then each of the piezoelectric layers undergoes a deformation which results in the appearance of an electric voltage on the faces of the layers. This voltage produces an electric current whose energy can be harvested. In this project the investigator studies three increasingly more complicated aeroelastic harvester models, i.e., models of a harvester whose underlying elastic structure is an aircraft wing. The project is a generalization of the results and models of two research projects carried out by the investigator. The first one is a rigorous investigation of aircraft wing models. It is a natural continuation of the investigator's 15 years of work on mathematical analysis of aircraft wing models and on wing flutter control. The second project is a detailed mathematical analysis of an energy harvester model with the most basic underlying elastic structure: the Euler-Bernoulli beam. The model, well known in engineering, was studied numerically and validated experimentally. Mathematical analysis of the model is presented in four recent papers by the investigator. In particular, control problems for this model were analyzed.<br/><br/>A mathematical model of a piezoelectric energy harvester is composed of the following: 1) the equation(s) of the underlying structure; 2) the equation of the electric circuit formed by the electrodes covering the top and bottom faces of the piezoceramic layer and by the external electric load; 3) additional terms describing the direct and inverse piezoelectric effects. The goal of this project is to investigate three piezoelectric harvester models with physically realistic underlying elastic structures and similar electric circuits. I. The structure is the bending-torsion vibration model describing a long slender aircraft wing, not affected by an airflow (ground vibration wing model). The model is given as a system of two coupled hyperbolic equations for the transverse deflection and the torsion angle. II. The elastic structure is the same bending-torsion wing model in an ambient incompressible air flow that is normal to the leading edge of the wing. The structural equations contain additional time-convolution integral terms representing the forces and moments exerted on the wing by the flow. III. The elastic structure is a short stiff structure in an axial (parallel to wing span) incompressible airflow (a palatal flutter model for snoring/apnea.) The goals for the above models are: a) derivation of asymptotic representation for the electroaeroelastic modes and mode shapes; b) proof of the Riesz basis property of the mode shapes; c) application of results to exact controllability and output tracking problems. The long term goal is to extend the above program to compressible airflow cases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, this project integrates research with education, and contributes towards preparing a diverse, highly qualified mathematics workforce.<br/><br/>At the fundamental level, the mathematical models to be investigated by this project can be framed in the formalism of Hamiltonian dynamics.

The realization that drag forces exerted on a body moving through air (or water) take place on a thin layer around the body lead to the development of boundary layer theory. The practical importance of boundary layer theory in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics is immense: computing the drag on an object and the energy dissipation rate nearby, with implications for fuel efficiency; understanding the problem of wing stall, the dependence of the lift on the angle of attack; and even the enhancement of heat transfer near solid walls. Mathematically, these questions concern the behavior of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in the vanishing viscosity limit, and the stability of the ensuing boundary layers.  This project will develop new analytical tools to study the validity of the vanishing viscosity limit, the formation of singularities in boundary layers, and to explore the nonlinear stability mechanisms by which these lead to dynamic boundary layer separation. This theoretical information will lead to more accurate reduced models and finer predictions about real fluid flows. The project will train undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate researchers, in modern research problems in applied mathematics and the tools to study them.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new mathematical tools that will further our understanding of the vanishing viscosity limit: the question whether solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to solutions of the incompressible Euler equations as the viscosity approaches zero, in the presence of a characteristic physical boundary. For fixed external parameters, the vanishing viscosity limit is equivalent to the infinite Reynolds number limit, and thus this problem is of vital importance to the study of the onset of turbulence in fluid flows. The PI and collaborators will address the emergence of singularities in the Prandtl boundary layer equations by establishing more robust finite time blow-up scenarios. The stability of nearly laminar boundary layers will be studied via a hypocoercive analysis of the Prandtl system and of higher order models. Finally, the PI will develop new energy methods that intertwine Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches to prove the vanishing viscosity limit in high regularity regimes. The goal is to develop nonlinear, solution-adapted methods. Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows will be mentored and included in the research activities."

The equations of free-boundary fluids present many challenges and only recently we have begun to understand their mathematical properties. By relativistic fluids, one means fluids in a regime where Einstein's theory of relativity cannot be neglected.

The coincidence of these two properties in media that support waves is not limited to the ocean and fibers but is ubiquitous in nature, the lab, and technology.  There is an emerging field of applied mathematics called dispersive hydrodynamics that explores the mathematical and physical ramifications of these two properties.  This project will develop new mathematical solutions and models of nonlinear, dispersive waves in a variety of physical environments.  The solutions will include solitons or solitary waves and dispersive shock waves, quintessential manifestations of waves whose speeds depend on wave amplitude and wavelength.

Examples range from laboratory models of climate in which a fluid is heated from below to hexagonal arrays of firing neurons in the region of the brain responsible for spatial memory.  Two classes of pattern-forming systems motivate the work of this project.  The first involves nanoscale patterns produced by bombarding a solid surface with a broad ion beam.  This can produce a wide variety of self-organized nanoscale patterns.  The self-assembly of nanoscale patterns that occurs when solids are irradiated is not just fascinating: in the future, ion bombardment may prove to be an important tool in the fabrication of nanostructures.  It is widely believed that the burgeoning field of nanotechnology will lead to advances that will transform fields as disparate as energy, electronics, and medicine.  The second class of patterns involves color changes in chemical systems in which a vapor reacts with a solid or liquid.  For example, a colored pattern may appear in a solution of an important class of plant pigments called anthocyanins as it is exposed to common atmospheric pollutants.  These patterns are a part of the sponsored outreach to elementary and high school students.  In both of these systems, the patterns vary from highly ordered ripples or lattices with a few defects to patterns so dominated by defects that a lattice structure may not be easily recognized.  These defects limit the utility of nanostructures produced by ion bombardment.  They are also indicative of the underlying chemical or physical mechanism by which the patterns form, and therefore help the investigators to understand those mechanisms.  In this work, the investigators develop mathematical tools to understand the formation of defects.  The tools are also applied to help propose experimental methods to eliminate defects in nanopatterns produced by ion bombardment.  The tools also provide insight into the mechanisms driving pattern formation.  The research involves undergraduate and graduate students in integrated theoretical and experimental work.<br/><br/>Defects are often prevalent in patterns produced in nature and the laboratory, so that the patterns are far from ideal ripples or hexagonal lattices.  These defects can be interpreted as data sets that have topological characteristics.  In this project, the investigators apply methods of topological data analysis (TDA) to patterns modeled by nonlinear partial differential equations.  In particular, the investigators and their colleagues develop methods to quantify the order in a pattern using the output of various TDA methods.  Experiments and simulations suggest that long-wavelength deformations (i.e., the zero mode) can play a significant role in the persistence of defects in a developing pattern.  The investigators test this hypothesis using a multidimensional extension of TDA methods.  The stability of defects is probed by deriving equations for the amplitude and phase of the patterns.  Methods of predicting where defects will form as a pattern evolves are developed using TDA.  Finally, combining TDA with machine learning tools, the team determines parameters in models of pattern formation from experimental data.  The methods are applicable to any pattern-forming system.  However, two classes of systems provide focus for this work.  The first is the formation of nanoscale patterns when a solid surface is bombarded by a broad ion beam.  Using TDA, the investigators determine the nature of the instability that leads to the formation of a hexagonal array of nanodots when the surface of a binary material is bombarded, a subject of considerable debate.  The second class is a set of reaction-diffusion systems that we call vaporchromatic experiments.  In these experiments, vapor interacts with a solution containing a polymer or pigment that changes color upon interaction with the vapor.  The team develops mathematical reaction-diffusion-convection models for the formation of vaporchromatic patterns.  The methods of analyzing patterns using TDA are motivated by and tested on patterns produced both by experiments and by numerical simulations of partial differential equation models.

The goal of the current project is to develop novel mathematical tools and numerical algorithms for analyzing how such competing effects achieve dynamic balance or lead to critical solution behavior.  The mathematical results are expected to be fundamental, and contribute to a body of understanding that promises to be useful to researchers across a range of disciplines. Critical regularity is a fundamental problem in fluid dynamics, the study of which can provide a deeper understanding of critical threshold phenomena occurring in wider applications. The understanding of photon condensate can result in methods which may potentially be suitable for designing novel light sources.<br/> <br/>This investigation focuses on the study of dynamic behavior in areas strongly motivated by applications and the theory of partial differential equations, with research objectives ranging from critical regularity in nonlinear balance laws, selection dynamics in trait-structured population models to energy transport in photon scattering.

These solution features depend on crossing a critical threshold associated with the initial configuration and/or the interaction kernels.

Scale separation occurs ubiquitously in nature and is tied to a variety of phenomena; important examples from mathematical ecology and biology include the formation of vegetation patterns in water-limited ecosystems, the propagation of impulses along nerve fibers, and periodic bursting rhythms in neurons.  Mathematically, these systems are frequently modeled by dynamical systems in the form of singularly perturbed ordinary, partial, or lattice differential equations.  This project contributes to the theory of singular perturbations through the development of broadly applicable techniques to study these phenomena, their robustness under variation in model parameters, and their stability to perturbation.  Part of the project includes research experience opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The specific research goals are organized into three parts inspired by the different application areas.  The common thread through these applications is that they are conceptually described by singularly perturbed differential equations where a delicate interplay occurs between local singular bifurcation phenomena and the global behavior of solutions.  The first part concerns the formation and resilience of vegetation stripe patterns on sloped terrain in semiarid regions.  This process is modeled by reaction-diffusion-advection equations, and the focus is on existence and stability analysis of patterns in the limit when the advection dominates.  The second part is concerned with periodic traveling waves in lattice differential equations that model impulse propagation in myelinated nerve fibers, of which the spatially discrete FitzHugh-Nagumo equation is a prototypical example.  This necessitates the extension of techniques used in the study of ordinary differential equations where loss of normal hyperbolicity occurs to the infinite dimensional setting of lattice differential equations.  The third part is concerned with spike-adding transitions between bursting solutions in models of neuroendocrine cells.  The construction of these transitions involves accounting for both hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic dynamics and linking local and global behavior of solutions, providing a framework in which complex bifurcations can be understood in other systems.

Regarding stochastic games, the project studies models with mean field interaction which, at least formally, correspond to games with a continuum of players. It is expected that multiplicity of equilibria is related to coalitions of agents, and a notion of stability may be useful to understand why certain equilibria of mean field games are limits of N-player games but others are not. The third project will continue recent work that aims to develop a robust stochastic model for speculation among heterogeneous agents and investigate how market regulations and the distribution of beliefs among market participants influence prices and speculative trading in a bubble. The study of probability densities for stochastic processes follows a novel approach based on optimal control theory. It allows for remarkably general processes, including non-Markovian ones, while being elementary in nature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The dynamics can be either classical or quantum. Equilibrium statistical mechanics (the foundational work going back to L. Boltzmann and J.W. Gibbs) has a well-formulated, in principle, procedure to go from the microscopic dynamics to the description of the macroscopic system.  Carrying out this procedure can be extremely difficult; nevertheless, the broad outlines are well understood.  Most physical systems are not in equilibrium and the main interest is their long-time behavior.  The Gaussian distribution (the familiar bell-shaped curve) is important because of its universality; that is, it applies to a wide variety of seemingly unrelated problems. The underlying common theme for all these problems is the fact that the objects under study have some degree of ""independence""; or stated in more physical terms, are non-interacting (or weakly interacting). These types of problems are well-understood both physically and mathematically. The foundations of nonequilibrium statistical physics are not as well understood as equilibrium statistical physics, in particular when the processes involve interacting particles. This project is directed at understanding the processes which are strongly interacting; and as such, there is no satisfactory general theory as there exists for the non-interacting cases. <br/> <br/>Simple models occupy a bigger role in understanding systems far from equilibrium. The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), a model of interacting particles on a lattice, is one such model.  ASEP is one of the simplest, nontrivial stochastic models in which to study transport phenomena as it models processes far from equilibrium.  This project, building on earlier work of the one-point correlation, will analyze a class of higher-order correlations.  The first higher-order correlations are block probabilities for step initial conditions.  By a block of length L we mean a contiguous block of L particles (starting, say, at position m on the lattice).  Recently the probability of this event was computed.  The project will generalize this block probability result to the case of step Bernoulli initial conditions. This same result is also the starting point of the project where similar higher-order correlations will be analyzed.  For example, the correlation of the first particle with the particle at position m.  The methods employed are both combinatorial and analytical.  In particular new combinatorial identities generalizing those found for block probabilities are an essential element of the project.  The possible long term impact of this project is to discover new universal limit laws that generalize the Tracy-Widom distributions that appear in the limit laws for the one-point fluctuations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some salient features of these diverse phenomena can be described by mathematical models based on reaction-advection-diffusion equations that have been used extensively to investigate fundamental and ubiquitous phenomena in several areas of biology, and more recently in the social sciences.  While these models are simplified versions of reality, their mathematical analysis has contributed to the understanding of many important phenomena. At the same time, the underlying equations can be extremely interesting and challenging from the mathematical point of view as their solutions can exhibit rich behaviors, e.g., pattern formation and traveling wave structures. The behavior of solutions reflects critical features of the system that mathematics models and have clear and convincing parallels with the evolution of real-world systems. However, there is still a large gap between real world systems and their more tractable mathematical models.  One of the goals of this project is bridging this gap through the use of accumulated concrete data and the corresponding calibration and modification of mathematical models.  Of particular importance is the analysis of systems which include heterogeneous environments, the understanding of the effects that non-local dispersal has on the behavior of the solutions, and the validation of these models with real-world data.  Efforts will be focused on four reaction-advection-diffusion systems where the heterogeneities are due to: climate change in an ecological context, non-local and asymmetrical spread of information in the context of riots, income heterogeneities in the context of social segregation, and environment heterogeneities due to specific concentrated inputs.  The primary goal of the project is to understand how heterogeneous environments and non-local dispersal impact solution patterns in both a general class of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations as well in specific ecological and social contexts.  Throughout this project the investigators will maintain and foster contacts with social scientists in order to conduct the much needed discourse between the mathematical theory and the applications.     <br/><br/>This project will focus on the development of an extensive theory for reaction-advection-diffusion systems in heterogeneous environments with applications in ecology and sociology.  In particular, the objective of this research is three-fold: to expand the current mathematical theory for local and non-local reaction-advection-diffusion systems in heterogeneous environments, to gain insight into various (ecological, sociological, and biological) complex systems by modeling them using these types of systems, and to  take an initial step toward bridging the gap between basic mathematical models and the complex real-world systems they aim to describe by incorporating the use of data. From the qualitative perspective, this work will be mainly concerned with exploring the effects that various dispersal mechanism have on the propagation (and lack thereof) of a solution in a heterogeneous environment: for example, determining the spreading speed, the existence of traveling wave solutions, pulsating fronts, traveling pulses, or generalized fronts in heterogeneous systems.  Additionally, the fundamental issues of the global well-posedness of solutions to these systems, intermediate and long-term asymptotics, and existence and uniqueness of non-trivial steady-state solutions will be rigorously analyzed."

Of particular note is graphene's semi-metallic character which permits one to tune its electrical properties. It is not surprising that extensive investigation of graphene has been conducted in the engineering community, however, there is very little to report in the applied mathematics literature. There is an opportunity to make valuable contributions.

While investigating wave-like processes, it is important to understand how the waves form, how they travel, whether they form a stable or an unstable structure, and if certain initial conditions lead to formation of singularities (like tsunamis, rogue waves, or rough turbulence). Understanding the evolution in time of such processes via various mathematical models is a goal of this project, and it will include studying various wave phenomena with or without stochastic elements. These wave-type phenomena are fundamental in nature, yet we are still at the dawn of their full analytical and numerical descriptions. This project is aimed at advancing the frontiers of the science of wave phenomena with applications to the real-life manifestations in nature. Students at all levels, from undergraduate to post-doctoral, will be involved in this research and receive training for their careers.<br/> <br/>The project is aimed at understanding the global behavior of solutions to nonlinear stochastic and deterministic dispersive partial differential equations, where the nonlinearities cause a significant difference in global behavior compared with the linear time evolution. One such nonlinear structure is a solitary wave, or soliton, which has a specific shape, exists (in the mathematical sense) for all time and in some equations travels in particular directions, while in other equations it oscillates periodically. Whether such a structure is stable or unstable and how it might be influenced by the external random perturbations is important in applications, and if unstable, it is important to investigate what it leads to. Typically, instability (the case when solitons are unstable) means that a singularity will form: for example, a freak wave in the ocean or a self-focusing burn in laser optics. Thus, it is very important to investigate the question of soliton stability, which is to be studied in this project in both stochastic and deterministic settings and via analytical and numerical approaches. A special thrust will be given to the study of formation of singularities, for example, collapses and concentrations. The research program starts from advancing the soliton stability theory as well as understanding the singularity formation process for the stochastic generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, then progressing to one of its higher dimensional generalization (the little explored even in pure deterministic case but important in quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics) Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation, where questions of asymptotic stability, existence and the description of singularities is proposed for investigation. Using the analytical and numerical techniques the nonlinear Hartree equation with the non-local potential will be investigated, with the special emphasis on understanding the spectral structure. This type of equation arises in general relativity as well as in quantum mechanics, and so is important to study in that context. Finally, questions of description of global behavior of solutions in a wave-type equation, such as the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are numerous parameters in the formulation of each such problem.  In many cases the exact values of some parameters are not available due to the lack of complete information, especially when such parameters describe future events.  An effective way to manage the long-term behaviors of complex systems under such data uncertainty is to introduce probability distributions on the parameters and use expectation functions in the problem formulations.  To numerically solve those problems with expectation functions, certain types of approximations are commonly used.  The investigators study properties of optimization and equilibrium problems defined with expectation functions, relations between these problems and their approximations, and methods to solve them.  Of particular interest is application of these ideas to study the electricity market competition between renewable and nonrenewable energy sources.

They apply this method to predict the out-of-sample performance of the SAA solutions.  Their second goal is to revisit existing importance sampling techniques to efficiently incorporate them into an iterative optimization algorithm for minimizing the probability of a rare event under some design parameters, and study properties of the probability function and compare solutions of the original problem with those of its convex substitutes.

If the agents make their decisions dynamically, in an uncertain environment, the outcome of such interactions can be conveniently described by a continuum-player stochastic dynamic game.  The investigator pursues several research directions, unified by the idea of establishing the game-theoretic models, which on the one hand capture the real-world phenomena with sufficient precision, and on the other hand allow for tractable representations of the equilibria.  Such models can be used to establish quantitative results, i.e., to make predictions about the future evolution of a system, or to optimize the rules of interaction in the system.  The study of such classes of games is motivated by various applications.  As particular cases, the investigator considers models arising in market microstructure and systemic risk.  The results of the project can be used for predicting the potential instabilities in financial markets and for designing effective regulatory policies for financial exchanges and banking systems.  In addition, the class of systems analyzed in this project includes other relevant models in economics, neuroscience, and sociology, resulting in a large array of potential applications that may benefit society.  The educational component of the project includes designing teaching materials, for both undergraduate and graduate students, with stronger emphasis on the novel applications of mathematics to problems of finance and economics.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     While there are many abstract mathematical results for constructing equilibria in dynamic stochastic games, these results rely on assumptions that often are incompatible with realistic models.  The investigator considers several classes of large-population games that naturally fail to satisfy the standard assumptions, either due to the presence of stopping times in the agents' strategies, or because of the singular type of interactions between the agents.  In both cases, the standard fixed-point results cannot be applied directly to construct an equilibrium, due to the lack of required continuity or monotonicity properties.  The investigator studies several methods to overcome these difficulties, which lead to mathematical problems interesting in their own right.  This study contributes to the theory of continuum-player games (including, but not limited to, mean field games), optimal stochastic control, and the propagation of chaos.  In particular, this project addresses specific problems in the theory of backward stochastic differential equations with oblique reflection, as well as the questions of limiting behavior of particle systems with singular interaction through hitting times.

The subject of this research project is a network of one-dimensional strings, also known as a metric graph. The project aims to answer several interrelated questions concerning vibrational mode analysis on metric graphs.

Three sets of questions will be addressed in the project. The first set is the optimal placement of a rank one perturbation (such as a forced zero). It has several potential applications, both theoretical (understanding the nodal count) and practical (optimizing the spectral gap to tune stability of a network-like structure). The second set of questions addresses the type of information about the graph that can be gleaned from the nodal count.

In this project the investigator and his collaborators develop three research areas that support these improvements by introducing and applying novel spectral problems associated with the geometry of material heterogeneity. In the first set of projects the theory of periodic and quasi periodic electrostatic spectra is developed for structured geometries enabling control of wave propagation in photonic, phononic, and metamaterial crystals. This theory will be applied to the systematic design of pass bands and band gaps for devices used in communication and energy transmission. In the second set of projects a novel spectral theory is developed for restriction operators acting on electromagnetic fields inside heterogeneous materials and applied to provide new efficient approaches to the fast numerical solution of multiscale problems for dielectric and magnetic media. A final research project develops a spectral formulation for energy concentration in heterogeneous media and applies it to identify the worst case loads for structures made from composite and polycrystalline media. This will give us a better understanding of why metallic and composite joints fail in infrastructure and aviation. These research projects are in line with the research interests of the the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate at Wright Patterson Air Force Base and a continuation of interaction between the PI and the labs initiated in the previous NSF award. It is anticipated that the graduate student supported by this award will benefit from the interaction with scientists at the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. <br/><br/>Earlier work on the theory of band gaps addresses the asymptotic theory of band gaps at infinite contrast. In this project the investigator will exploit new structural spectra associated with inclusion geometry and lattice parameters to develop new techniques for complex operator valued functions which deliver explicit formulas for band gaps at finite contrast. The approach proposed here is distinct from earlier ones and will provide new explicit formulas for the size of band gaps and pass bands given in terms of contrast, shape and configuration of scatters, and lattice parameters. In a second thrust of the project, the investigator and his collaborators will develop new spectral methods related to the restriction operator for the vector wave equation to deliver new and faster methods for the numerical solution of multiscale problems of electromagnetic wave propagation in heterogeneous media. A novel spectral formulation for energy concentration will be developed and applied to identify worst case loads for structures made from composite and polycrystalline media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In comparison with partial differential equations (PDE), SPDEs are advantageous because they allow modelers to explicitly incorporate space-time randomness and capture the effect of random fluctuations inherent to systems with many degrees of freedom.  However, they are trickier to numerically solve than PDEs and require new specialized techniques.  Indeed, since SPDE solutions are very rough, straightforward adaptations of numerical PDE methods often lead to approximations that do not accurately represent the behaviors of the actual solutions.  To address this issue, the project develops a new numerical method, called Spectrwm [spek-trum] (signifying spectral random walk method), that is tailored specifically to SPDEs.  REU students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>Spectrwm is a family of Markov jump process approximations for SPDEs.  As such, these approximations can be viewed as infinite-dimensional analogues of random walk methods for Brownian motion.  Aside from their mathematical interest, these methods address in a natural way several issues encountered when simulating SPDEs, including long-time simulation, accurately representing the effect of multiplicative noise, and approximation of their path-dependent expected values.  by suitably constructing them, Spectrwm is faithful to the domain of their solution.  The investigator and his collaborators aim to use probabilistic techniques to quantitatively understand the finite- and long-time behavior of Spectrwm methods for well-posed SPDEs with reflecting boundary conditions, and to develop accelerated variants of Spectrwm methods for a wider range of SPDE problems, including ones that are classically ill-posed or where the operators of the underlying processes are not well understood.  As a major byproduct, the project lends insight into SPDEs themselves: the nature of the Kolmogorov equations associated to SPDEs, the influence of boundaries on SPDE solutions, metastability in SPDE solutions, and renormalizations for classically ill-posed SPDEs.

These algorithms are used, for example, to send data to mobile devices and to simulate fire and water in movies. Many of the most classical algorithms, and particularly those with applications in linear algebra, have been extremely useful for decades, if not centuries. Yet, some of these algorithms are poorly understood -- they can fail catastrophically, but rarely do. In other words, the worst-case behavior is poor, but the average-case behavior is good. This research will advance the understanding of this phenomenon by employing techniques from the ever-expanding field of random matrix theory (RMT). In turn, this research gives rise to new questions within RMT. A substantial feature of this project is the extensive educational component that integrates research and education. This integration is achieved via a three-pronged approach including a summer workshop on random matrices, high school engagement, and undergraduate/graduate student mentoring.<br/><br/>Two natural ways to employ RMT within numerical linear algebra also coincide with the two most common themes in numerical linear algebra: Algorithm analysis and algorithm development. For example, remarkably detailed estimates from RMT such as rigidity and edge universality have found concrete applications within numerical linear algebra giving average-case performance for the classical power method. Randomized algorithms have found great utility in the big-data age. This research will employ both of these themes with applications to data science, psychology and beyond.

The interplay of spatially discrete structure and nonlinearity in many physical and biological systems, from mechanical metamaterials and nanoelectromechanical devices to biopolymers, often results in formation of nonlinear waveforms that either coherently transport or release energy as they propagate through the system.  In particular, recent experimental and theoretical work on granular materials has advanced the understanding of the conditions for existence and properties of a variety of such structures, including traveling pulses and shock waves.  However, much less is known about the conditions under which these structures are stable.  The goal of this project is to obtain such criteria in a framework that extends earlier work to more general classes of waves and to broader settings that account for the effects of higher dimensions, lattice structure, external driving, and damping.  Fundamental understanding of stability criteria for nonlinear waves is important in a number of different fields, including materials science, condensed matter physics, mechanical engineering, and biophysics.  The insights provided by this work can be helpful in designing new devices for energy channeling, shock absorption, and vibration mitigation.  An integral component of this collaborative project is teaching and training graduate students in the interdisciplinary research area of nonlinear wave phenomena in lattices.  To this end, graduate students participate in the research.<br/><br/>This project builds on the ongoing joint work of the principal investigators on stability of solitary traveling waves in one-dimensional lattices and its intimate connection to the stability of discrete breathers.  This involves developing novel analytical stability criteria, as well as state-of-the-art numerical approaches necessary to extend this framework to broader settings, including two-dimensional and heterogeneous lattices, while considering more general classes of traveling waves.  In particular, stability of waveforms with oscillatory tails, such as nanoptera in resonant granular chains and generalized kinks in dislocation models, is investigated.  The project involves studying dynamic implications of instability and examining the effects of dissipation, long-range interactions, and external driving.  The project's goals also include clarifying the relation of the linear spectra associated with a solitary traveling wave (and their variations at instability critical points) to the corresponding discrete breather Floquet spectra, as well as connecting the stability criteria for such waves to the established functional analytic framework for continuum systems.

Being at the core of technological advances and modern scientific investigations, inverse problems are concerned with determining properties of a medium from indirect, incomplete, or noisy observations. Applications of inverse problems range over a broad spectrum of geophysical, sonar, and medical imaging techniques, used for finding location of oil and mineral deposits in the interior of the Earth, early detection of pulmonary edema, as well as monitoring of lung function. A major topic for this project is the fundamental Calderon problem, which forms the basis of Electrical Impedance Tomography, an imaging modality with applications in biomedical imaging and nondestructive testing of mechanical parts. The Calderon problem asks whether the conductivity of a medium can be determined by performing voltage and current measurements on the surface of the medium. The specific focus of the project is on recovering the conductivity of a rough medium by performing measurements along possibly small portions of the boundary surface, a situation ubiquitous in practice, as well as on reconstructing the conductivity of an anisotropic medium, such as the muscle tissue in the human body, say. The investigator will also attack significant inverse problems arising in fluid dynamics, elasticity, and anisotropic linear and non-linear electromagnetism. The novel mathematical approaches to be developed in the project may lead to important advances in medical and seismic imaging. <br/><br/>The project will focus on the following four significant research topics. The first one is inverse boundary problems with partial data in the low regularity setting. In this class of problems one seeks to determine low regularity coefficients of partial differential equations (PDE), representing characteristics of a medium, from boundary measurements performed along small portions of the boundary. Motivated by recovery of material parameters in anisotropic media, the second topic is concerned with geometric inverse boundary problems, where one wishes to recover also topological and differential characteristics of the underlying Riemannian manifold. The third topic proposes a broad and systematic attack on the phenomenon of increasing stability for partial data inverse boundary problems for elliptic PDE in the high frequency regime, driven by the need to design reconstruction algorithms with high resolution. The investigator aims to develop the innovative approach of bringing the powerful techniques of semiclassical analysis to bear on this important class of problems. Inspired by the study of the stability of matter and non-hermitian quantum mechanics, the fourth topic proposes to investigate the distribution of complex eigenvalues for non-self-adjoint operators of Schrodinger type, in the spirit of the classical Keller and Lieb-Thirring bounds. This research is to be carried out in the general setting of non-compact manifolds, whose structure at infinity generalizes the Euclidean one, relying upon the powerful techniques of geometric microlocal analysis. While seemingly quite independent of each other, the different parts of the project are in fact intimately connected, there being a synergy amongst them, and tools developed in one part, such as Carleman and resolvent estimates, say, can lead to progress in the others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the intellectual foundations of celestial mechanics belong to antiquity, the field is more relevant than ever thanks to the advent of space exploration in the twentieth century.  Modern developments in dynamical systems theory provide deep insights, and by now several space missions have transformed inspired mathematics into successful practice.  The key to these developments is to understand certain landmark objects known as invariant manifolds, and to study connections between them.  In realistic applications the only way to discover these landmarks is through numerical computations.  Due to the global nature of these computations, questions involving errors and accuracy are both important and subtle.  These issues are treated with great care in the present project, ultimately leading to a mathematically rigorous framework describing all discretization and truncation errors.  The results provide practitioners of scientific computing with mathematically rigorous tools for quantifying computational errors, while providing mathematicians with new methods for proving theorems.  The investigator applies this new framework to problems in celestial mechanics that have resisted earlier analysis.  Doing so requires substantial advancement of both analytical and computational aspects of the theory.  The resulting infrastructure will be made freely available, and can be used to study other complex mathematical models.<br/><br/>A central theme of the investigator's research program is the unification of numerical and analytical methods for global analysis of nonlinear systems.  This project builds on the success of the investigator's earlier research, demonstrating its scalability and parallelizability.

One project numerically studies collision dynamics on a compactified phase space, while another answers questions about global branches of periodic orbits bifurcating from the polygonal central configurations of Lagrange.  A more computational aspect of the project develops a new approach to cluster computing and archiving of invariant manifold atlases, providing deeper understanding of the dynamics and new possibilities for space mission design.  Throughout, the work is guided by the principle that basic invariant sets like equilibria, periodic orbits, and heteroclinic/homoclinic connections between them are the fundamental building blocks for understanding complicated dynamics.

Carrying out such tasks presents difficulties for traditional methods, which are based on collecting data at uniformly placed sites or which require constructing ""meshes"" (think wire fence) that must be carefully tailored to deal with the data sites involved.  Newer methods, the so-called kernel methods, are meshfree and can handle scattered data.

Although they may be harder to see in everyday experience, other types of waves like electromagnetic waves frequently also produce such patterns. This means that wave patterns might be understood from the mathematical study of certain underlying models of wave motion that are common to several different types of physical systems. In a similar way, understanding wave patterns from first principles is a worthwhile pursuit because such patterns occur frequently in so many physical circumstances, ranging from the very small (e.g. optics or quantum waves on the scale of atoms) to the very large (e.g. gravitational waves on the scale of the galaxy). This project is a systematic investigation of wave patterns arising in mathematical models of wave propagation, and it aims both to catalogue the various wave patterns that can occur in a given model and to determine the range of models and physical situations in which a given pattern can arise. As one example application, the outcomes of this project will contribute to our understanding of rogue waves, large disturbances of the sea surface that appear out of nowhere and disappear just as suddenly, but which can cause great damage to ships, unless they are anticipated and avoided or otherwise mitigated. Some parts of the project will serve as vehicles for the training of junior researchers such as undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop and apply methods from the theory of completely integrable systems to the study of wave patterns. The key mathematical methods are tools of complex, functional, and asymptotic analysis, and the results of the research will be relevant to the fields of nonlinear wave propagation, integrable systems, and special functions. Specific models to be studied include the three-wave resonant interaction equations, the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, the Davey-Stewartson equations, and the family of Painleve equations. The project will study both regular wave patterns, i.e., modulated wave trains spontaneously generated from smooth initial conditions, and universal wave patterns, i.e., special structures appearing in double-scaling limits that do not depend on initial conditions (and perhaps not even on the equation of motion). Specific goals include the development of new techniques for the investigation of wave patterns via asymptotic analysis in integrable systems consisting of multiple coupled fields or in multiple space dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program provides training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral participants who benefit from their integration in vertically structured working groups. It is important for Science, Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) students to have professional skills extending beyond technical expertise; they must be able to communicate their results to non-technical audiences in clear, compelling and engaging ways. Through its emphasis on multi-layered working groups, the program offers a prime training ground for its participants to gain the communication skills necessary to bridge disciplinary divides, as is required for work addressing most of society's grand challenges. The program also involves the development of new course material, both online and on campus, that reflects and addresses challenges in present-day scientific computing.<br/><br/>The paradigm of numerical analysis as the study of algorithms for the problems of continuous mathematics needs to be updated. An increasing number of data intensive applications are better described through discrete mathematics in terms of graphs or networks rather than through the smooth manifolds of continuous mathematics. Additionally, current computational models are often neither well-posed nor well-conditioned; new approaches are needed. The program addresses this pressing need by using randomization as the key scientific tool. The research is organized around three complementary thrusts in numerical linear algebra, nonlinear solvers and global sensitivity analysis. By analyzing the effect on numerical solutions of perturbations caused by randomization, or corrupted data, the first two thrusts fill a critical gap in the theoretical foundation to numerical analysis under large perturbations and low accuracy: even the notion of numerical solution has to be revisited. The third thrust aims at reducing model complexity through novel sensitivity analysis methods and the use of surrogate models; this thrust both capitalizes on and contributes to the previous two.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Heterogeneous environments are ubiquitous. Some examples are ocean flows, atmospheric turbulence, oil-bearing sands, and biological tissues. Understanding overall properties of such media is relevant to aspects of virtually every branch of science and engineering; especially materials science, chemical engineering, geophysics, medical imaging and fluid dynamics. One of the projects of this research concerns changes in salinity or chlorofluorocarbon on the surface of the ocean. Oceanic vortices may dramatically change mixing rates of various chemical compounds. The aim of this project is to estimate these rates in simpler mathematical models to illuminate the mechanisms present in the full problem.  Another project of this research concerns light propagation through the atmosphere. The main source of distortion in these devices comes from atmospheric turbulence. The aim of this project is to understand the mechanism of this distortion.<br/><br/>This work carries out mathematical studies of particle propagation in cluttered environments and of convection-diffusion processes in fluids. The first project concentrates on the effect of long-range correlations. This is a novel direction in the theory of propagation in random media, and approximate models of propagation in slowly decorrelating media are not yet developed. The goal is to explain how long-range correlations lead to time-scale separation of various phenomena. The second project concentrates on the interaction of the standard and the fractional diffusion with incompressible flows. The intellectual challenge of the proposed work is to understand this interaction for incompressible flows with large amplitude.

Time-inconsistency is a phenomenon in which the preferences of a decision maker change over time, due to various factors. Careful studies show that there are two main reasons for this: the decision makers' time preferences and their risk preferences. The former is due to the fact that decision makers may place more weight on the immediate utility, while the latter is due to the decision makers' different subjective opinions in estimating the risks associated to their decisions at various times. This project studies general time-inconsistent problems quantitatively, from the point of view of stochastic optimal control theory, with the goal of obtaining time-consistent equilibrium solutions to these problems. The results obtained should lead to a better understanding of the time-inconsistency issue and provide some guidance towards making time-consistent decisions that are acceptable in practical situations. The expectation is that the theories developed in this project will be applicable to asset pricing, risk management, resource allocation, and production planning. Graduate students will be trained as part of the project.  <br/><br/>In time-inconsistency problems, time preferences can be described mathematically by discounting, which may be exponential or non-exponential, while risk preferences can be described by the choice of expectation operators, such as the classical expectation or various nonlinear versions of it. Classical stochastic optimal control problems of continuous-time dynamical systems involve exponential discounting and classical expectations. In this case, Bellman's principle of optimality holds, which leads to time-consistency of optimal controls, that is, an optimal control found for a given initial pair of time and state will remain optimal afterwards. However, when a stochastic optimal control problem involves either a non-exponential discounting, or a non-classical expectation operator, the problem becomes time-inconsistent, namely, an optimal control selected at a given time based on the given initial state does not remain optimal at a later time. This project aims to develop general tools for finding time-consistent equilibrium strategies (rather than time-inconsistent optimal controls) for time-inconsistent stochastic optimal control problems. The specific problems to be investigated involve cost functionals depending on initial pair and conditional expectations, recursive cost functionals, as well as problems with distorted probability. It is expected that this project will provide a better understanding of the time-inconsistency of optimal control problems and that the theory developed will significantly contribute to the area of mathematical optimal control. Further, the project will have a significant impact in applications and in other areas of mathematics, such as stochastic analysis, mathematical finance, differential games, and partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has been widely used in (wireless) sensor networks, smart power grids, and other engineering and science fields, because it offers some practical advantages over the more traditional form of data network that ships collected data to central processing facilities.  However, distributing the data processing tasks, such as filtering, denoising, and compressing, raises some new challenges.  While these have received much attention in recent years, there still is a gap between mathematical theory and engineering practice.  The investigator works to develop a mathematical foundation for signal processing on spatially distributed data networks that has practical consequences for engineering applications.  Graduate students participate in the research.  Graduate students participate in the research.<br/><br/>The topological structure of a spatially distributed data network is described by a sparse graph.  Data processing on a spatially distributed data network is performed by agents in the network; many of them can be described by well-localized matrices and integral operators, in terms of which the network behavior can in principle be described and optimized globally.  But this could be an impractically large optimization problem.  The principal investigator studies how to split a large network into a set of overlapping smaller ones whose separate global optimizations can be used to approximate the global optimization of the large network.  In this way, he aims to develop a mathematical foundation for signal processing on such networks that has engineering applications.  Here he emphasizes applied harmonic analysis and numerical analysis of well-localized matrices on graphs, design of stable spatially distributed data networks, fast algorithms implemented by agents in spatially distributed data networks, phaseless signal reconstruction, and deep learning coupled to signal processing on graphs.

The findings on topic (i) will help understand which type of compensation schemes are optimally offered to managers that manage risk of companies or portfolios, and to understand the effect of managerial compensation on the formation of asset prices. The findings on topic (ii) will explain how fund families structure their offerings and the associated investment fees. The findings will shed light on which issues to focus on when regulating compensation of executives, or regulating hedge funds and mutual funds, or giving advice to fund customers. This line of research is of interest given that one of the reasons for the 2007/2008 financial crisis was the way managers had been compensated. Moreover, because of the crisis, new changes and challenges are facing financial markets and it is important to maintain and improve the training and support available to young researchers in this field, as they will play an important role in facing those challenges in the future.

From the economic point of view, topic (a) will partially cover a gap in contract theory: most of the dynamic models only the effect of the managers on project return, and not on its risk. Methodologically, it requires extending recent sophisticated mathematical results for second order Backward Stochastic Differential Equations.  Topic (b) will cover another gap: most of the contract literature assumes that investors offer take-it-or-leave-it contracts to managers. However, in financial practice, it is usually other way round - hedge funds or mutual fund families offer their services with precise contracting features.

This optimization produces a new class of problems in mathematical finance related to the theory of calculus of variations from analysis. Furthermore, the equilibrium models are carefully designed such that while being mathematically tractable, the models can deal with many of the practical issues Big Data represent.

Unfortunately, effective methods for testing complicated materials for structural defects or for identifying unknown targets in an efficient way with little a priori information are still in a state of infancy. In this project, the investigator and her graduate students will develop new techniques in inverse scattering theory to obtain reliable target signatures or usable information about objects being examined in computationally efficient ways. The goal is to minimize dependence on a priori information describing the physics and/or geometry of unknown targets as well as of the complications arising from complexity of the hosting background. This study will combine practical applications with the mathematical elegance of new direct imaging techniques. <br/> <br/>This research is a multifaceted effort to investigate some open questions associated with the qualitative methods (otherwise referred to as non-iterative methods) for solving inverse scattering problems for inhomogeneous media. The central theme is the development of the generalized linear sampling method for a variety of inverse problems. This is a new qualitative approach to inverse scattering that is rigorously justified for noisy data. There are three main projects: 1) Eigenvalues in inverse scattering theory for inhomogeneous media: Motivated by the theory of the transmission eigenvalue problem, this project proposes to develop a general framework for modifying the scattering operator in order to provide  new eigenvalue problems associated with the scattering by an inhomogeneity. Particularly important are the issues of determining these (real or complex) eigenvalues from the scattering data, together with their relation to material properties of the inhomogeneity. The ultimate goal of this effort is to use such eigenvalues for the imaging of anisotropic (possibly absorbing and dispersive) media. 2) Qualitative methods for time domain problems: The use of time dependent data is proposed to address the issue of the need for large amount of spatial data in the use of qualitative reconstruction methods. The time domain interior transmission problem is the fundamental mathematical ingredient to develop qualitative methods for the wave equation and its solvability is a long lasting open problem. This project suggests an approach to solving this problem, hence opening the way to study time domain qualitative methods. 3) Inverse scattering for periodic media: The main consideration of this project is to investigate the far field behavior due to scattering by a highly oscillating periodic media of bounded support with application to imaging of macro/micro structure of the media. In addition, the project will develop a new qualitative method for reconstructing local perturbations inside periodic media without needing to compute the scattered field due to the periodic background nor to recover the background. The PI will undertake a systematic investigation of new qualitative methods in inverse scattering theory for complex inhomogeneous media as well as in the time domain which, if successful, can lead to progress outside the field of mathematics, such as nondestructive testing and target identification. In addition to progress outside the field of mathematics, the new eigenvalue problems that appear in this study, such as the transmission eigenvalue problem or the Steklov eigenvalue problem for absorbing media, have attracted considerable attention in the area of non-selfadjoint eigenvalue problems for partial differential equations. The analysis of scattering problems for periodic media touches some of the most active contemporary topics in PDEs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two major sources of these questions are models of rotating stars and galaxies, and models of deep water waves in the ocean. The study of equilibrium shape and density distribution of rotating stars is a classical question in the history of mathematical physics. Early efforts beginning in the eighteenth century were devoted to finding ellipsoidal shapes with constant density. In the twentieth century, major progress was made by solving equations describing compressible fluids, thus allowing a more realistic model of stars with variable gaseous density. The mathematical method used to construct such solutions involves putting the same amount of gas in different shapes and density distributions, and finding one with the least physical energy. However, such a method only provides proof for existence of solutions, without delivering too much information on the shape of the star, or how the solution varies as the rotation speed of the star varies. In this project, the investigator aims to provide new existence proofs using a different method, which involves continuously deforming the shape of a round, non-rotating star to arrive at a rotating star solution. The new method is intended to return information about shape and dependence on rotation speed. For deep water waves, the investigator will study certain important model equations that describe internal waves below the ocean surface as well as spectacular phenomena in the atmosphere, such as the ""Morning Glory"" cloud seen in northeastern Australia. The internal waves described by such models have practical significance; for example, internal waves can interact with surface ocean waves to produce rogue waves that can damage or destroy ocean vessels or fixed structures.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project aims to prove existence of rotating star solutions to the Euler-Poisson and Vlasov-Poisson equations, using an implicit function theorem type perturbation technique. Apart from proving detailed analytical estimates involving spaces adapted to the problem, the investigator will need to study the linearized operator by proving a vanishing theorem about a certain integro-differential equation for functions in the kernel. The research will study continuation of the solution curve to faster rotation speed using topological degree arguments, and discover possible breakdown mechanisms of the solution curve. In addition, the investigator plans to examine the phenomenon of mass bound on rotating white dwarf solutions to the Euler-Poisson equations, using both variational methods and spectral analysis. For models involving deep water waves, the project will explore the completely integrable aspect of the Benjamin-Ono equation. Building on previous work, the investigator will study existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic properties of the Jost solutions proposed in the Fokas-Ablowitz inverse scattering transform. These questions are closely related to the continuous spectrum of certain singular integral perturbations of the derivative operator."

Wave turbulence is manifested in many physical systems, including familiar water waves, water surface gravity and capillary waves, and a great variety of waves in plasmas (in particular, in fusion devices). A Bose-Einstein condensate is a state of matter that was first predicted theoretically in 1924 and produced experimentally in 1995. While quantum phenomena are exhibited on micro-scales, and nature is well described on macro-scales by classical mechanics, for a Bose-Einstein condensate macroscopic quantum phenomena become apparent. The quantum kinetic theory that describes some physical properties of this state of matter is the second subject of this research. Although wave turbulence and quantum kinetics are dramatically different as physical phenomena, their mathematical description uses similar equations. Despite the widespread applications of these kinetic equations, little is known rigorously in this field. The aim of the project is to develop mathematical techniques and apply them to concrete physical situations, leading to a more profound understanding of both wave turbulence and quantum kinetics.<br/><br/>The project is aimed at developing the theory of the existence, uniqueness, finite-time condensation, and relaxation to equilibrium for strong solutions of the kinetic equations. The principal investigator will address the local-in-time existence via techniques of harmonic analysis and novel Strichartz-type estimates. For important questions related to 3-wave wave turbulence, regularity theory for the kinetic equation with a particular broadening (regularization) of the resonance set will be used.

While entanglement became one of the most valuable resources in quantum theory, many of its attributes remain unknown. At present, one of the main technological challenges in quantum information arises from the destructive effects of environment, the effect known as decoherence. Decoherence is a partial loss of quantum information through a channel, in other words, the introduction of noise into the communication. This project will contribute to understanding how these losses may be theoretically predicted and minimized. Students at different levels will be trained through participation in this project. Another educational objective of the project is to promote STEM subjects and improve educational opportunities for students in Houston, TX, middle and high schools, with?main focus on economically disadvantaged neighborhoods.<br/><br/>Two, often overlapping, research directions will be pursued in this project: quantum information theoretic inequalities and dynamics of quantum systems. Quantum information theoretic inequalities, such as monotonicity of quantum relative entropy and strong subadditivity of entropy, are at the core of providing a framework for what is theoretically possible to achieve in quantum information. Dynamics of open quantum systems describing the effects of the environment is notoriously challenging and vital problem.  The principal goals of the project are: (i) to improve understanding of the role of entropy in the quantum setting through a sharpening of the monotonicity of different relative entropies as well as the formulation/derivation of quantum versions of classical information-theoretic inequalities; and (ii) to rigorously describe attributes of quantum entanglement by seeking upper bounds for the speed of generation of entanglement. This investigation is largely motivated by the need to understand and control the decoherence in quantum channels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator studies two sets of problems, each exploiting redundancy of representation in mathematics and engineering.  An example of the first is the problem of estimating simultaneously, from an array of many sensors, the locations of stationary sources and the content of their separate signals, when the sources are not correlated and not all sensors receive information from a given source.  Mathematically, this comes down to extracting information from a positive semi-definite covariance matrix that relates signals from sources to receptions by sensors.  The existence of unknown blind spots makes this problem challenging.  The first thrust concerns the class of positive semi-definite finite trace operators.  The aim is to look for decompositions of such operators into sums of rank-one operators that minimize a given criterion.  What makes this problem hard is the condition that the rank-ones are also positive semi-definite.  It turns out this problem is connected to an open question of Feichtinger in analysis of compact operators with kernels in a modulation space.  Additionally, the problem has strong connections to the theory of sparse matrix decomposition, and to array signal processing.  The second thrust is related to analysis and optimizations on classes of low-rank positive semi-definite matrices.  In particular, this thrust continues the investigator's previous work on the phase retrieval problem and the quantum state tomography problem.  Tools from Lipschitz analysis and non-convex optimizations are used throughout this program.  Graduate students participate in the research.  In addition, the investigator is training them for a globally competitive STEM workforce through his contacts with industry and government labs.  The project strengthens existing partnerships with industry while offering opportunities to explore mathematics of real-world applications and to create novel solutions to existing problems.  Undergraduate students are encouraged to enter this area of research by participating in existing opportunities under the umbrellas of Research Experience for Undergraduates or Research Interaction Teams.<br/><br/>The first problem proposed here relates to the question H. Feichtinger asked in 2004: does the eigen-decomposition of a positive semi-definite trace-class integral operator with kernel in the first modulation space converge in a stronger modulation space-sense?  It turns out this question has a negative answer; however, it naturally raises the question of whether a different decomposition of such operators (not necessarily the eigen-decomposition) converges in such a stronger sense.  A similar decomposition problem appears in the context of blind source separation.  Consider a system composed of many sensors (e.g., antennas, or microphones) and decorrelated wide-sense stationary transmitting sources.  The mixing environment has blind spots so that not all sensors receive information from a given source.  The problem is to estimate simultaneously location of sources and the source signals, based only on the positive semi-definite covariance matrix.  The existence of unknown blind spots is what makes this problem challenging.  The second problem of this project refers to quantum state tomography and phase retrieval.  Specifically, it asks to estimate low-rank positive semi-definite unit trace matrices from inner products with a fixed set of Hermitian matrices.  The project focuses on the class of homotopy methods for matrix recovery.

At the core of this progress is a better understanding of the redundancy inherent in many data generated in our daily lives.  Frame theory can be viewed as one of the appropriate paradigms to investigate and model redundancy.  The investigators use frame theory to study two classes of problems whose solutions could have significant applicability in quantum information theory.

They observe that the Zauner conjecture is a special case of the HRT conjecture in the setting of rank-one finite-dimensional time-frequency matrices, and use that relationship initially for the transference of current technology for each conjecture.  The theory of frames plays a fundamental role in formulating and understanding the problems the investigators examine here.

However, there are currently no methods available for solving these equations except in the very simplest settings. This project will introduce new mathematical and computational techniques for solving GJEs, which will lead to new software that can solve these challenging equations. These new techniques will be used to solve several different lens design problems. Complementing this research plan, the investigator will produce a comprehensive series of video lectures that teach core mathematical topics within the context of cutting edge research.

The investigators will then model the phenomenon of dielectrowetting, driven by carefully-tuned applied electric fields. The spreading and dewetting problems to be considered are directly applicable to various industrial processes that rely on coating thin films of NLC onto substrates, such as the manufacture of NLC-based microdisplays for electronic devices, for which the development of robust predictive models would be very valuable. The work will also inform the use of dielectric fluids as optical shutters and as controllable lenses, and of NLCs in various biosensing applications. Establishing a firm theoretical framework for the experimentally-observed dewetting phenomena, and establishing models for controllable dielectrowetting, will be of significant interest both to researchers in industry and to a large class of academic researchers from the mathematics, physics and engineering communities.

He focuses primarily on questions arising in physical applications.  Among the questions he studies are the metastable behavior of fluid systems, whereby long-lived structures like vortices appear in the flow on a relatively short time scale, and then determine the subsequent evolution of the fluid for very long times.  He also studies the influence of localized structures like vortices on the behavior of rotating, stratified fluid layers like the atmosphere.  The differential equations arise in a variety of different physical contexts and are characterized by the fact that while the equations themselves are well known, they are too complicated to solve explicitly except in very special or physically unrealistic cases.  Nevertheless, applications require at least a qualitative understanding of the behavior of their solutions; this research project aims to develop such an understanding.  The project incorporates the training of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows into all facets of this research.<br/><br/>Among the specific systems that the investigator studies are: (i) nearly inviscid fluids and weakly damped Hamiltonian systems like the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam system using normal forms and the theory of hypercoercivity; (ii) invariant manifolds and their implications for the behavior of: (a) unstably stratified, rotating fluid systems, (b) the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and (c) as a means of understanding the continuum approximation of kinetic systems, and (iii) small-divisors in fluid mechanics and other infinite dimensional systems.  One feature that makes it difficult to apply dynamical systems ideas to partial differential equations on unbounded domains is the interplay of effects due to continuous spectrum with those coming from discrete spectrum.  The planned work on stratified fluids and approximation theorems for kinetic systems further develops the theory of invariant manifolds to treat these problems.  The study of small divisor problems in the vortex sheet equations extends KAM-like methods to a new class of infinite dimensional systems.

While investigating wave-like processes, it is important to understand how the waves form, how they travel, whether they form a stable or an unstable structure, and if certain initial conditions lead to formation of singularities (like tsunamis, rogue waves, or rough turbulence). Understanding the evolution in time of such processes via various mathematical models is a goal of this project, and it will include studying various wave phenomena with or without stochastic elements. These wave-type phenomena are fundamental in nature, yet we are still at the dawn of their full analytical and numerical descriptions. This project is aimed at advancing the frontiers of the science of wave phenomena with applications to the real-life manifestations in nature. Students at all levels, from undergraduate to post-doctoral, will be involved in this research and receive training for their careers.<br/> <br/>The project is aimed at understanding the global behavior of solutions to nonlinear stochastic and deterministic dispersive partial differential equations, where the nonlinearities cause a significant difference in global behavior compared with the linear time evolution. One such nonlinear structure is a solitary wave, or soliton, which has a specific shape, exists (in the mathematical sense) for all time and in some equations travels in particular directions, while in other equations it oscillates periodically. Whether such a structure is stable or unstable and how it might be influenced by the external random perturbations is important in applications, and if unstable, it is important to investigate what it leads to. Typically, instability (the case when solitons are unstable) means that a singularity will form: for example, a freak wave in the ocean or a self-focusing burn in laser optics. Thus, it is very important to investigate the question of soliton stability, which is to be studied in this project in both stochastic and deterministic settings and via analytical and numerical approaches. A special thrust will be given to the study of formation of singularities, for example, collapses and concentrations. The research program starts from advancing the soliton stability theory as well as understanding the singularity formation process for the stochastic generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, then progressing to one of its higher dimensional generalization (the little explored even in pure deterministic case but important in quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics) Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation, where questions of asymptotic stability, existence and the description of singularities is proposed for investigation. Using the analytical and numerical techniques the nonlinear Hartree equation with the non-local potential will be investigated, with the special emphasis on understanding the spectral structure. This type of equation arises in general relativity as well as in quantum mechanics, and so is important to study in that context. Finally, questions of description of global behavior of solutions in a wave-type equation, such as the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Magnetic reconnection is inherently a multi-scale process and causes difficulties in laboratory experimental study, satellite observations, and computational simulations. During magnetic reconnection, the magnetic force can create thin localized region wherein the elevated voltage difference generates intense electric currents and dissipation - the Hall effect.

Since the invention of computer-aided tomography in the 1960s, numerous imaging modalities have been introduced and became indispensable for diagnostic instruments in biology and medicine. Recently, the quest for more sensitive and more reliable techniques has led to such promising coupled-physics modalities as Thermoacoustic and Photoacoustic Tomography (TAT and PAT), and Magnetoacoustoelectric Tomography (MAET). These imaging methods combine high resolution of ultrasound with the sensitivity of electromagnetic waves to optical absorption and conductivity of the tissues. Sharp abnormalities in the latter physical parameters are good markers of breast cancer, thrombosis, ischemia, and other medical conditions. Thus, these new techniques overcome limitations of classical tomography, and deliver otherwise unavailable, potentially life-saving diagnostic information - at a lesser cost and with less harm to a patient. The images in these modalities are obtained by complex mathematical procedures, rather than through direct acquisition. The mathematics of these methods is, mostly, at very early stages of development. The investigator and his collaborators work to resolve the central theoretical problems and to develop efficient numerical techniques for PAT, TAT, MAET and other hybrid techniques. A graduate student and a postdoc are playing a significant role in the project, gaining exposure to the exciting area at the junction of exact sciences, medicine, and biology. The results will be disseminated through publications in high quality research journals, presentations at national and international conferences, and series of lectures at various major venues.<br/><br/>The mathematics underlying and enabling such modalities as PAT, TAT, MAET and several novel techniques based on Compton scattering, contains a number of challenging open problems, important from both the theoretical and applied points of view.

In particular, they work on (1) deriving exact inversion formulas for the problem of TAT/PAT reconstruction from the sets of data reduced both in time and in space; (2) developing efficient reconstruction algorithms for different MAET data acquisition schemes, including MAET with loss of low frequencies, and MAET of objects with anisotropic conductivity; (3) devising efficient numerical techniques for congregating strongly over-determined Compton data sets, and processing them using attenuation compensation techniques previously developed for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography.

These tasks are regularly cast as optimization problems where one minimizes an objective functional that models the desired properties of the object sought.

The relevance of optimization has increased manyfold alongside advances in computer design, and recently alongside the availability of vast and complex datasets arising from internet applications.  Optimization has become a central part of machine learning.  However, even the most efficient optimization algorithms are unable to succeed for complicated models populated by huge datasets possessing little special structure, the main problem being the limited core memory available on (even large) computers.  While Moore's Law accurately predicted exponentially-increasing computing power, the surprise has been that the sizes of datasets are increasing much faster.  A central focus of the project is the design of algorithms capable of solving a complicated optimization model populated with a huge dataset, by breaking apart the model into a sequence of computational problems, each relying on only a portion of the data, not too much for core memory.  Graduate students participate in the research.<br/><br/>The general approach makes use of the most elemental of algorithms for convex optimization, namely, subgradient methods, dating to the 1960's.  In tandem, the approach makes use of -- and advances -- a framework promoted by the investigator in recent years, whereby a general convex optimization problem is transformed into an equivalent convex optimization problem whose only constraints are linear equations and for which the objective function is Lipschitz continuous (thereby allowing direct application of subgradient methods).  Exploration is being done initially for linear programming, an ambitious goal being to solve problems even beyond the reach of the simplex method (in cases where the basis-inverse matrix is larger than core memory permits).  Focus also is being given to problems involving an objective function that is itself the sum of many functions, a common setting in machine learning.  Here the goal is to devise algorithms that are able to choose the summand functions in a principled (and efficient) manner, unlike incremental (sub)gradient methods, which choose a summand uniformly at random.  Additionally, attempts are being made to extend the investigator's framework so as to provide, for example, a way to transform a continuously-differentiable objective function, possibly with bounded domain, into an entire function possessing Lipschitz-continuous gradient, thereby allowing accelerated methods to be applied easily.  A particularly important aspect of the project is the design of practical schemes for speeding up first order methods when the optimization problem being solved has some particular kind of geometrical structure (such as ""sharpness,"" where the objective function grows linearly with the distance to optimality).  The goal is to design schemes that require no knowledge of parameters governing the geometrical structure, and yet that are guaranteed to achieve optimal speedup whenever the structure is present (regardless of whether the user knows the structure is present).

Increased understanding of the behavior of solutions to these modeling equations will find important applications to the dynamics of compressible fluids, the mechanics of elastic materials, traffic control systems, porous medium flows, and geophysical dynamics. The project also involves international collaborations and training of graduate students and young researchers in this challenging field.<br/><br/>This research project focuses on four goals: (1) To provide a clear picture of the global existence and finite-time blow-up for compressible Euler equations in one dimension with large initial data, and to find sharp density lower bound estimates for generic large solutions; (2) To establish a reasonable justification of the isentropic approximation in compressible fluids when initial entropy tends to a constant, for both inviscid and viscous fluids; (3) To investigate nonlinear Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities in compressible fluids, including the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system; (4) To study the large-time asymptotic behavior of compressible full Euler equations with frictional damping in three dimensions to justify Darcy's law, and to undertake the modeling and analysis of interactions between short waves and long waves in compressible fluids under the influence of magnetic fields. These research activities aim to provide a solid mathematical foundation to bridge gaps between existing results and for future studies.  It is anticipated that the results will significantly advance basic understanding of nonlinear hyperbolic balance laws.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical models of drones, computer vision and graphics, medical imaging, fluid dynamics of plasmas, and gravitational waves are posed on curved spaces, which possess geometric properties that have to be respected by the numerical simulations in order to obtain accurate, robust, and reliable predictions.  The two main motivating applications for this project are to plasma physics and gravitational waves.  Plasmas are highly ionized gases; theyarise in nuclear fusion devices, propulsion systems for space exploration, and during the formation of galaxies.  Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime that were predicted by Einstein, and they arise from the collision of massive astrophysical bodies like black holes and neutron stars.  The construction of numerical methods for such problems enables scientists to design more stable and efficient nuclear fusion systems, and to more accurately determine the astrophysical events that correspond to gravitational waves that are detected.  In addition, the investigator develops optimization and sensitivity analysis techniques that improve the efficiency of optimization algorithms that underlie deep learning and other machine learning techniques in data science.  Graduate students participate in the research.<br/><br/>The project combines theoretical and computational tools arising from discrete Dirac mechanics and geometry, variational integrators, the relationship between symmetric spaces and the generalized polar decomposition, and embeddings of noncanonical Hamiltonian systems as well as nonvariational equations and their adjoints into degenerate Lagrangian systems.  This provides a systematic method for constructing and analyzing geometric structure-preserving discretizations of degenerate noncanonical Hamiltonian systems, nonvariational equations and their adjoints, and problems that evolve on symmetric spaces.  The resulting methods have implications for plasma physics, which is described by noncanonical Hamiltonian systems, as well as general relativity, which is a degenerate higher-order gauge field theory on a symmetric space.  In addition, adjoint equations arise in many important applications, including optimal control, optimal design, optimal estimation, uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis.  A deeper understanding of the hidden geometric structure underlying an arbitrary system of differential equations and their associated adjoint equations, and variational discretizations that respect that geometric structure, would have profound implications on the broad range of analytical and numerical techniques that rely critically on the solution of adjoint equations.

Roughly speaking, a coherent structure is a well-defined feature in fluid flow that can be easily distinguished and mathematically described in a simple manner. One example is a vortex, where all fluid particles rotate about a single point. Another example is a sharp front, which may arise when a fluid consists of warm and cold regions separated by a thin moving transition region.  Many more examples of coherent structures exist in the natural world and we encounter them daily. While it seems to be an extremely formidable problem to give an efficient way to describe general fluid flows, describing the evolution of coherent structures seems to be amenable to mathematical analysis. Moreover, since coherent structures are often observed to be dominant in physical and numerical experiments, describing their evolution is of great importance. A simple question that one could ask in this regard is: What happens to a ""strong"" vortex under small perturbations? Does the vortex persist or does it quickly disintegrate? Another question of interest is whether nice fluid flows can develop coherent structures that possess a singularity, that is, infinite velocity or velocity gradient.  Such questions lie at the core of this project.  <br/><br/>Mathematically, the research focuses primarily on the dynamics of both weak and strong solutions to the incompressible Euler equations and related models. The project investigates a novel approach to the classical problem of finite-time singularity formation in fluids with zero viscosity -- that is, the emergence of certain singular structures in a fluid without external influence. Previous work provided an example of finite-time singularity formation for strong solutions to the incompressible Euler equations in certain settings. Part of the project involves extending and strengthening these results as well as investigating the applicability of the methods to other questions including the dynamics of vortex patches in the 2D Euler equation. Another part of the project studies the stability of certain singular weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equation and related models, specifically, the stability of singular vortices with respect to smoother perturbations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Why do market crashes and rallies occur? How much do asset prices depend on our risk appetites, and how much on the inherent randomness of the world around us? These questions can be answered by analyzing various mathematical models based on the fundamental idea that prices adjust to equalize supply with demand. This analysis is often very hard, and requires considerable analytical effort, but is nevertheless within the reach of contemporary mathematics and its tools. The societal benefits of a better understanding of the structure behind asset-price movements are numerous; for instance, it will help us regulate the markets more efficiently and plan better for potential future financial instabilities. <br/><br/>The principal investigator and his students and collaborators will study several separate, but ultimately related, clusters of problems at the intersection of probability, mathematical finance and stochastic-control theory.  One area of concentration is the class of equations, known as Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs), which describe evolutions of random processes in many different contexts.  The PI and his collaborators will focus on the existence and uniqueness theory for systems of nonlinear fully-coupled BSDEs. While their interest in this subject originates in its pivotal role in the financial equilibrium theory, there are numerous other applications in finance, economics, game theory, optimal stochastic control, and other fields. The second cluster of problems centers around the so-called mean-field limits in the context of equilibrium theory. The main goal here is to provide a meaningful simplification of the equilibrium problem when the market consists of a large number of small economic agents. Attention will be paid to the limiting behavior of the systems of BSDEs which appear in incomplete-market equilibrium models with exponential investors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are observed throughout the natural world and include surface and internal waves in the ocean, ignition fronts in combustion theory, and even stripe patterns in animal fur. Through their ubiquity, traveling waves command the interest of researchers in nearly every corner of the physical and biological sciences. This project aims to develop novel tools for constructing large-amplitude waves, especially for the important case of pulses, which are localized disturbances that travel through unbounded domains (such as tsunami waves or rough waves). In a related direction, the project will apply and extend a new theoretical framework for diagnosing stability of traveling waves solutions, i.e., capacity of the waves to persist when subjected to a disturbance. This project will advance the mathematical understanding of traveling waves; the results will have implications to oceanography, fluid mechanics, and combustion theory. More generally, the techniques developed by this study are intended to provide a framework with considerable potential for future applications to a broad array of disciplines. Graduate students will be trained and actively involved in this research. <br/> <br/>This project aims to advance the mathematical understanding of traveling waves along two parallel tracks: existence theory and stability theory. The first set of activities concern the existence of large-amplitude traveling waves on unbounded domains.  While many tools currently exist for constructing small-amplitude waves in a neighborhood of known explicit solutions, the non-perturbative regime is far less well understood.  This is particularly true for problems set on unbounded domains, for which issues of compactness seriously frustrate what tools are available.  This project will develop a global bifurcation theoretic machinery designed to overcome these obstructions using symmetry and monotonicity properties.  This new framework will then be used to address important open problems in a variety of systems.  Specifically, these applications include (i) construct large-amplitude bore solutions to a two-phase fluid system in a channel; (ii) prove the existence of large-amplitude traveling waves evolving according to general non-compact symmetry groups, for example scroll ring solutions to reaction-diffusion equations; and (iii) extend beyond the appearance of internal stagnation points a family of large-amplitude solitary stratified water waves constructed in earlier work. A second set of projects will develop new systematic tools for diagnosing the orbital stability or instability of traveling solutions to abstract Hamiltonian systems that possess symmetries. This work aims to relax key hypotheses in existing theory to allow more direct application to highly nonlinear systems like those governing water waves.  Using this machinery, it is planned to (i) prove the instability of internal waves in a two-phase system confined to a channel and (ii) give a new systematic proof of the stability and instability of Korteweg?de Vries solitons. Moreover, a local well-posedness theory in the Hadamard sense for the water wave problem with a point vortex will be provided.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In certain situations important for applications, particles diffuse in unusual ways.  This project investigates such ""anomalous"" diffusive behavior on intermediate (as opposed to long) time scales. The third set of questions is motivated by mathematically quantifying the entanglement of long polymer molecules; it aims to quantify the winding of trajectories of the related random walks.

Most of them share the irregular phenomenon of nonsmoothness or nonconvexity that challenges computation. Despite several practically successful algorithms recently proposed to solve such problems, the underlying fundamental theory is not quite understood and explored. Only analyzing the complexity and the deep mathematics behind these problems and algorithms provides practitioners across related, vital science and engineering areas new tools to comprehend their core features, be able to design more efficient algorithms, and attack more challenging problems arising from practice. The investigators develop such tools via a novel approach from a relatively young subfield of applied mathematics, variational analysis, which is naturally compatible with these nonsmooth and complex structures. Several topics from this project are integrated with teaching topic courses and training of students.<br/><br/>     This project is devoted to developing the theory of second-order variational analysis (SOVA) and using it to study the stability, sensitivity, and computational complexity of algorithms for solving structured optimization problems. The first part of this project serves as the theoretical foundation; it concerns the theory of SOVA with connections to stability and sensitivity analysis. More specifically, the investigators intend to study: (i) tilt stability and full stability for general optimization problems with connections to Robinson's strong regularity and Kojima's strong stability for conic programming via SOVA; (ii) metric (sub)regularity of the subdifferential and Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property on nonsmooth (possibly nonconvex) functions via SOVA; and (iii) stability for parametric variational systems including Nash equilibrium systems and variational inequalities via SOVA. The second part of this project consists of designing and analyzing proximal algorithms for solving convex and nonconvex structured problems. Immediate applications include Lasso, group Lasso, elastic net, basic pursuit, sparsity, low-rank problems, and completion matrix problems that originate from compressed sensing, image reconstruction, machine learning, and data science. Stability theory developed in the first part plays a significant role here, especially in the complexity analysis of these algorithms. It explains why the development of many recent proximal algorithms is strongly influenced by the hidden power of SOVA. The specific objectives of this part are: (i) to accelerate the forward-backward splitting method and analyze the phenomenon of linear convergence encountered frequently in numerical experiments; and (ii) to design efficient methods of Douglas-Rachford splitting type for solving nonconvex optimization and feasibility problems.

The project combines theory with computer simulations. The principal investigator runs a research seminar, which integrates seasoned researchers, a post-doctoral associate, doctoral students, and undergraduate students, each of whom is involved in a specific aspect of the project.

Recent demonstrations of non-symmetry-induced spectrally embedded bound states in electromagnetic structures have opened the way toward a richer set of resonance phenomena. This project develops a theory of asymmetry and embedded eigenvalues. The investigations employ functional analysis and partial differential equations, complex analysis, spectral theory, and analytic geometry. These are the specific problems of the project: (1) It investigates the precise connection between asymmetry, embedded eigenvalues, and reducibility of an analytic variety called the ""Fermi surface"" for periodic operators, including the partial differential equations (PDE) of physical systems and mathematical graph models; (2) The principal investigator's recent work shows that bilayer quantum-graph graphene is special in that its Fermi surface is always reducible, regardless of the type of asymmetries in the potentials on the edges connecting the two sheets of graphene. The project seeks the mathematical reasons behind this and the PDE counterpart; (3) The investigator and collaborators are developing numerical algorithms for probing the very complex situation of embedded eigenvalues for the Maxwell equations of electromagnetics; (4) The existence and construction of embedded eigenvalues for the Neumann-Poincare boundary-integral operator that is fundamental to the theory of ""plasmonic resonances"" is also being studied.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the investigator studies the derivation of thermodynamic properties of a gas that is not at thermal equilibrium, starting from a microscopic particle description of the gas.  The microscopic heat conduction problem under study is representative of numerous physical systems that are intrinsically high-dimensional, multiscale, noisy, and non-equilibrium.

The quest for newer, safer, cheaper, and more robust imaging techniques is ongoing and has intensified in recent years. The main thrust of the project is the development of new techniques of medical imaging and improving some of the existing ones, as well as the development of efficient methods of detecting illicit nuclear materials at border crossings and in harbors. In recent years, revolutionary ""hybrid/coupled-physics"" methods of medical imaging have been emerging, with a major contribution by the investigator, his students, and his collaborators. By combining several different types of physical waves, they overcome limitations of classical techniques and deliver potentially life-saving diagnostic information - at a lesser cost and with less health hazards to a patient. The images in these modalities are obtained by complex mathematical procedures rather than through direct acquisition. A part of the project is devoted to development of several of such novel techniques. Another part is directed towards improving the recently suggested and development of new techniques for the homeland security problem of detecting illicit weapons-grade nuclear materials in cargo, to be used at border crossings and harbors. The project has a significant impact on the development of several new sensitive, inexpensive, and safe methods of diagnostic medical imaging and efficient novel techniques of nuclear threat detection in homeland security, with possible applications in other areas. Graduate students play a significant role in the project, which prepares them for work in the exciting area at the intersection of exact sciences, medicine, biology, and homeland security. <br/><br/>The project takes up central analytic and numerical issues and several novel techniques of emerging coupled-physics. A significant effort is also devoted to the mathematics of Compton camera imaging, which is a promising novel technique that avoids mechanical collimation of particles and thus is well suited for high noise modalities such as Single Photon Emission Tomography in medical diagnostics. Compton cameras and their currently developed analogues for neutron detection carry even more promise for detecting the presence of low-emission illicit weapons grade radioactive sources versus a strong background noise. Here, the exact reconstruction techniques customary in medical imaging do not work, but a mixture of analytic and statistical tools goes much further down to very low signal-to-noise ratios.

This research project seeks to predict how such granular materials respond to applied forces from the viewpoint of their underlying energy landscape, which like a mountain range is a vast expanse of valleys and peaks. Of particular interest is the effect of microgravity environments on granular systems, such as rubble-pile asteroids composed of loosely held-together dust and fractured rock.

These are strongly nonlinear phenomena which require to solve fully nonlinear hydrodynamics equations. Rogue waves are another example of strongly nonlinear large surface waves, which occur spontaneously in the ocean.  Relative motion of fluids (wind over the water) induces instability of their common interface such as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). This instability that recently became a focus of attention of experimental scientists in the context of the interface between different components superfluid Helium, will also be addressed in this project. <br/><br/>This research will focus on development a new type of conformal map and new tools for the efficient description of the strongly nonlinear surface dynamics both for free surface and interfaces. It was Stokes who in the 19th century first used conformal mapping as a tool for studying of the steady flow of the fluid with a free surface. In this approach domains occupied by fluids are conformally mapped into simpler domains such as a lower complex half plane. The dynamics of the surface is then reduced to the dynamics of the conformal map. It gives an enormous advantage for both the analysis and high precision simulations of surface dynamics by allowing to recover the fluid dynamics through the motion of the complex branch cuts and poles in the complex domain.

At the microscopic level, the basic laws of quantum physics govern the dynamics of systems consisting of atoms and elementary particles. Much of the recent progress made in understanding the dynamics of such systems has been through the mathematical analysis of their quasi-locality properties.

One important goal of the project is to understand how the excitation spectrum of such systems can be described as a system of quasi-particles. In particular for systems in two space dimensions these quasi-particles may be anyons, instead of the more commonly encountered fermions and bosons. Techniques will be developed, based on the fundamental quasi-locality properties of the dynamics, to prove the existence of anyons, their relation to topological order in the ground state(s), and their dynamical properties.

Among the several phenomena that may be responsible for this failure is so-called ""sensitivity to imperfections,"" or the highly oscillatory nature of energy minimizers resulting in non-compactness even in very simple geometries like cylinders. The imperfection sensitivity phenomenon poses an ongoing challenge to engineers working with a wide range of thin-shelled structures, from aircraft and automotive components, buildings, poles, and other civil infrastructures, to carbon nanotubes and biopolymer shells. One of the goals of this project is to use the general theory of buckling of thin structures to quantify the imperfection sensitivity phenomenon. Another goal is to solve the longstanding problem of determining the rigidity of a given shell, which is believed to be identified by the principal curvatures of the shell. <br/><br/>While the problem of determining the rigidity of plates is well understood, determining the rigidity of a given shell has been a longstanding problem in continuum mechanics. Recent results on shells in the linear elasticity setting, with vector fields satisfying Robin boundary conditions on the thin face of the shell, provide evidence that the rigidity of a shell is determined solely by the principal curvatures of the shell's mid-surface. One of the goals of the project is to extend ansatz-free lower bounds to the nonlinear geometric rigidity setting. The strategy is to use existing estimates inducing artificial boundary conditions by test functions as well as a universal Korn interpolation inequality, which reduces the linear geometric rigidity estimate to a Poincar? type estimate. Once this is done, a new hierarchy of shell theories with smaller gaps will naturally follow, which will encompass the existing ones derived by Gamma-convergence. The second part of the project is to further develop the theory of buckling of thin structures. The theory has two ingredients: (i) proving sharp Korn's inequalities, and (ii) proving the existence of bending-free trivial branches. While (i) has been almost entirely done in previous work, (ii) is the goal of the second part of the project.

However, in the last decades a new class of solid state matter, called aperiodic crystals (or quasicrystals), has been found.

The range of these phenomena includes such diverse examples as complex and compressible fluids (combustion, aerospace engineering, and meteorology), nonlocal reaction-diffusion processes (nuclear physics, population biology, and genetics), and kinetic theory (plasma physics, swarm dynamics, and astrophysics). This project focuses on novel approaches to determining two fundamental characteristics of solutions to equations modeling large numbers of strongly interacting particles: their regularity and asymptotic behavior. The regularity of such problems establishes that the models are well-behaved, which often means the equations remain numerically tractable in computer simulations. The asymptotic theory seeks to find simplified limiting behavior for equations, in which many complex interactions average out and have a residual effect that governs the behavior of the system. Information about the limiting behavior is instrumental for applications such as medical imaging or materials science. For many important phenomena that demonstrate complex, nonlinear behavior, the application of known methods for analysis and control is greatly limited and not always possible. The aim of this project is to investigate three new techniques that partly overcome the difficulties caused by nonlinearity. The project will also provide training and research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The principal investigator will use techniques of nonlinear analysis, viscosity theory, and probability to establish bounds and asymptotic dynamics for the three major parts of the project. The first part focuses on exploring thermally enhanced dissipation for hydrodynamic equations where the viscosity grows with local temperature. From kinetic considerations and empirical observations, the kinematic viscosity of a compressible fluid flow increases with the local temperature and the local temperature is produced by friction. The intuition is that, in such models, regions of high turbulence self-regularize by producing hot spots which boost the viscosity exactly where it is needed to prevent the development of singularities. Prior work has identified this effect in two model problems (along with corresponding bounds). One of the main goals of the project is to push these types of estimates to physical models of compressible thermal fluids such as the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, the equations of magneto-hydrodynamics, and the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Fourier system for electrokinetic complex fluids. Enhanced thermal dissipation is a truly novel source of regularization compared to other known energy-based methods and lends itself naturally to dynamic weighted Sobolev estimates and entropy methods. The second part focuses on developing methods to extract asymptotic behavior from strongly nonlocal heterogeneous reaction-diffusion equations. There is a growing interest in extracting simpler macroscopic dynamics (often taking the form of geometric equations) from certain scaling limits of more complicated models. The nonlocal operators in these models present unique challenges in determining their residual impact on the (sometimes discontinuous) homogenized equation. The investigator plans to implement the techniques of viscosity theory to pursue homogenization phenomena for nonlocal periodic Fisher-KPP and bistable (Allen-Cahn) equations. The third part focuses on the regularity theory for kinetic equations (i.e., Landau and Boltzmann). Most regularity results for these equations rely on the assumption of having the lower bound on the density (as this often yields a minimum dissipation in the velocity variables). The investigator will explore the emergence of such lower bounds through probabilistic techniques, writing the kinetic equation as an approximate Fokker-Planck equation for a certain stochastic process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Key components of the project are the improved understanding of turbulent energy transfers from large to small scales in the fluid, and the effect of turbulent advection on passive floating devices in the ocean, which is aimed at extracting maximal information from costly oceanographic measurements.  Overall, the proposed work has broad impacts within fluid mechanics, physical oceanography, and dynamical meteorology, and its training aspects include both graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The fluid dynamics of these complex systems is characterized by a nonlinear jigsaw puzzle of intermingling turbulent waves and vortices, especially at small scales, such as those relevant to submesoscale oceanography, for instance.   Here classical wave-mean interaction theory fails, direct numerical simulation of the fluid motion with global computational models is not possible, and theoretical innovations for diagnostic and predictive models are needed.  In this connection the project seeks to break new ground with a multi-pronged approach that combines theory and numerical modelling in three problem areas. First, a fundamental study of third-order structure functions in rotating stratified turbulence is proposed, with the aim of better diagnosing spectral, scale-to-scale energy fluxes from sparse observational data. Second, a recent diagnostic wave- vortex decomposition method is to be extended to the increasingly important case of data acquisition following a set of random Lagrangian tracers. Third, a predictive model for interactions between waves and vortices is to be improved by generalizing a certain asymptotic conservation law for slowly varying waves to more general wave fields.  The proposed research calls for non-trivial mathematical investigations that involves various systems of multi-dimensional PDEs, asymptotic analysis, stochastic modelling, and numerical computation, all with an eye towards ultimate applications in the real world that are relevant to atmosphere and ocean dynamics. This is a non-trivial technology transfer between different branches of applied mathematics as well as of several physical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first system is vegetation in semi-arid environments, which often grow in large-scale, swirling striped patterns visible in satellite imagery. The investigator and his collaborators will create a class of models that are grounded in fundamental ecological principles and are informed by geographic information systems (GIS) observations. They will analyze these models and compare them to data. This work will provide insight into the working of our natural world in the area of vegetation ecology. The second system involves collective behaviors, like those that arise when particles, objects, or agents interact, ranging from nanoparticle assembly to pedestrian crowds to insect swarms. The behavior of these groups can be vexing to characterize as they are neither highly organized nor totally random. The investigator and his collaborators will study collective behavior through the lens of a mathematical area called computational topology, which examines the shape of data obtained from simulations of or experiments on these groups. This work will aid the development of strategies that help humanity understand complex data. Other features of this proposal include: extensive undergraduate student involvement; creation of a network of collaborators across four institutions; a pipeline from research to the classroom; enhancement of computational infrastructure; a focus on the participation of underrepresented groups; efforts to join the applied dynamics and topology mathematical communities; and a study of one-of-a-kind, unpublished mathematical manuscripts of John von Neumann.<br/><br/>The investigator and his collaborators study two pattern-forming systems: (1) Semi-arid vegetation patterns are commonly modeled as reaction-diffusion PDE that incorporate some subset of geophysical and ecological ingredients selected by the modeler. The investigator proposes a new paradigm for modeling vegetation patterns that is based on the fundamental ecological principle of energy balance and is both motivated by and validated with GIS data. The primary mathematical contribution is the analysis of a class of optimization problems with nonlocal constraints. The primary applied contribution is a unified framework for vegetation pattern modeling. (2) The collective behaviors of groups of agents can be complex. Traditionally, investigators diagnose these behaviors by studying time series of order parameters chosen a priori to be of possible interest. Taking a different view, the Pl develops a topological theory of collective behavior, building the mathematical machinery to pass from models of collective behavior to simpler descriptions capturing their on-average topological behavior. The primary mathematical contribution is a simpler characterization of the complex collective dynamics that is framed in terms of the evolving Betti numbers of the system. The primary applied contribution is a framework for understanding collective behavior models that does not require an a priori choice of order parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Random environments are ubiquitous to many physical systems: gases, condensed matter, chemical reaction, etc. The inherent complexity of these phenomena motivates the use of noise in their mathematical description. A fundamental challenge is to interpret how this noise affects the dynamical aspects of the system. In condensed matter physics, the lack of synchrony between random scatterers can eliminate all propagation of waves-- a phenomena known as Anderson localization. On the other hand, disordered gases exhibit high diffusivity properties, with applications in imaging. A mathematical understanding has impact on technological applications in atmospheric science, wireless communications in urban environments, physiological imaging and electronic transport in nano-structures. <br/><br/>This workshop will present recent developments on wave propagation, scattering and diffusion in random medias at the interface of probability theory, mathematical physics and partial differential equations.

These problems arise in different areas of science and engineering, including massive data analysis, machine learning, signal processing, medical image reconstruction, statistics, traffic and logistical networks, and operations research. Most of them share the irregular phenomenon of nonsmoothness or nonconvexity that challenges computation. Despite several practically successful algorithms recently proposed to solve such problems, the underlying fundamental theory is not quite understood and explored. Only analyzing the complexity and the deep mathematics behind these problems and algorithms provides practitioners across related, vital science and engineering areas new tools to comprehend their core features, be able to design more efficient algorithms, and attack more challenging problems arising from practice. The investigators develop such tools via a novel approach from a relatively young subfield of applied mathematics, variational analysis, which is naturally compatible with these nonsmooth and complex structures. Several topics from this project are integrated with teaching topic courses and training of students.<br/><br/>This project is devoted to developing the theory of second-order variational analysis (SOVA) and using it to study the stability, sensitivity, and computational complexity of algorithms for solving structured optimization problems. The first part of this project serves as the theoretical foundation; it concerns the theory of SOVA with connections to stability and sensitivity analysis. More specifically, the investigators intend to study: (i) tilt stability and full stability for general optimization problems with connections to Robinson's strong regularity and Kojima's strong stability for conic programming via SOVA; (ii) metric (sub)regularity of the subdifferential and Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property on nonsmooth (possibly nonconvex) functions via SOVA; and (iii) stability for parametric variational systems including Nash equilibrium systems and variational inequalities via SOVA. The second part of this project consists of designing and analyzing proximal algorithms for solving convex and nonconvex structured problems. Immediate applications include Lasso, group Lasso, elastic net, basic pursuit, sparsity, low-rank problems, and completion matrix problems that originate from compressed sensing, image reconstruction, machine learning, and data science. Stability theory developed in the first part plays a significant role here, especially in the complexity analysis of these algorithms. It explains why the development of many recent proximal algorithms is strongly influenced by the hidden power of SOVA. The specific objectives of this part are: (i) to accelerate the forward-backward splitting method and analyze the phenomenon of linear convergence encountered frequently in numerical experiments; and (ii) to design efficient methods of Douglas-Rachford splitting type for solving nonconvex optimization and feasibility problems. Other important applications include inverse problems corrupted by Poisson noise and total variation denoising models, both of which are well recognized in imaging science and statistical learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
