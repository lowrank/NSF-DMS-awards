The nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) and its vector generalization are universal asymptotic models for quasi-monochromatic waves in nonlinear media. Both NLS and vector NLS are completely integrable and can therefore be solved by the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) method. However, this method for vector NLS in the normal dispersion regime (defocusing regime) is not yet fully developed. Hence, the complete development of this method and description of the soliton interactions is a principal part of the project. The coupled Maxwell-Bloch system, which arises as a model in atomic physics, laser physics and optics, will also be investigated by a suitable adaptation of the IST method. Further, the IST method will be extended to the recently derived short-pulse equation, which provides a more appropriate model than the quasi-monochromatic approximation. Theoretical development of the IST for these systems and elucidation of the soliton dynamics will be guided by numerical simulation and direct methods for constructing special solutions.<br/><br/>Because of their physical applicability in such diverse fields as water waves, magnetic spin waves, optical fibers, waveguides and Bose-Einstein condensates, NLS and other systems investigated in this project are of wide scientific relevance. Dynamics of their solitary wave (soliton) solutions is also of keen interest from the point of view of applications, as interaction of vector solitons sets forth the experimental foundations for designing controlled logic gates and all-optical computers, of the phenomenon of self-induced transparency, as well as a mechanism for polarization switching of light in multi-level media.  The equations investigated in this project are not only models for phenomena at the frontier of physical science, but also have intrinsic mathematical value. The development of a modern IST for these equations will advance the fundamental understanding of complex physical phenomena in a unified mathematical framework and provide concrete information about the behavior of such systems. The collaborative nature of the research program, both between the principal investigators and with colleagues at nearby institutions, will serve to accelerate the development of an interconnected research community accessible to students at Montclair State and at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (both undergraduate institutions). Significantly, the student population at both institutions includes a substantial number of members of underrepresented groups and the collaboration leverages existing programs directed to these students"

The effort brings together new experimental phenomena with quantified mathematical modeling.<br/><br/>Fluid dynamics is central to understanding the behavior of many physical systems on a wide range of length and time scales spanning our atmosphere and oceans down to the smallest swimming micro-organisms.  In particular, understanding how a body moves fluid and in turn how the fluid can impact a body is fundamental to understanding how our environment works, which is necessary to even begin to assess human impacts on climate.  Our the large scales, the oceans and atmospheres are complicated fluid systems possessing strong density variations, and the associated phenomena are complex and central to building a more quantified understanding of climate.  On smaller scales, biological systems are bathed in fluids with varying viscosities which are moved via the motion of small hair-like structures called cilia.  Developing quantified analytical and computational models to predict these dynamics has implications for improved understanding of lung function and disease such as Cystic Fibrosis.

In these problems, data may be collected directly in the Fourier domain (as in MRI), or may be transformed into the Fourier domain for the purpose of image formation (as in X-ray Tomography or Electron Microscopy). In all cases, the image resolution is controlled by the largest wave-number present in the measured data. In order to minimize the distortion due to Gibbs phenomenon, current imaging methods either collect data in a large enough area of the Fourier domain or window the data to force an artificial decay. It can be shown that current methods require collecting more data than necessary or negatively impact the resolution near spatial singularities of recovered functions of interest. These singularities are, typically, the most informative part of the final image. In contrast, this proposal relies on nonlinear, near optimal approximation by exponentials to extrapolate the available Fourier data, also yielding a near optimal rational representation in space. This approach not only improves the resolution near singularities and achieves a near optimal performance, but also detects the level of noise in data and provides a practical technique for signal/noise separation.  These new algorithms already yield a significant improvement over existing techniques in one-dimensional problems and this project intends to extend the approach to problems in two or three dimensions. Such an extension is highly nontrivial since the mathematical tools used in one dimension are only of limited use.<br/><br/>Inverse problems arise in a wide variety of scientific and engineering disciplines as a way to analyze biological or inorganic specimens, analyze manufactured devices for defects, perform remote sensing or geophysical exploration among many other applications. In all of these modalities, from processing multiple radar data to biomedical imaging such as MRI, the collected data is processed by algorithms implementing the solution of an inverse problem based on a specific mathematical model. The investigators propose a method of developing and algorithmically implementing new mathematical models applicable to many, if not all, of these problems. The reason for such wide applicability is the fact that in the new mathematical models the functions of interest are represented with a near optimal number of parameters, thus significantly improving the recovery of information from the measured data. The mathematical and practical significance of this project as well as its challenge lies in extending the methods developed by investigators in one dimension to multiple dimensions. Since techniques of non-destructive evaluation play a vital role in natural sciences, engineering, medical diagnostics as well as such visible applications as airport security, we expect a wide impact of these new mathematical models based on nonlinear approximations.  The numerical methods developed within this project should provide scientists with computational tools to efficiently solve problems beyond the capabilities of many of today's algorithms."

Stable states of the system will attract all nearby configurations, and thus they can play an important role in determining the behavior. On the other hand, if the time-scale on which the system evolves toward that state is very long, one may never be able to wait long enough to see the stable behavior emerge. It is therefore important to also understand the transient behaviors that persist for long times. This proposal is concerned with developing mathematical techniques for both determining if a given state is stable and also for investigating such transient behaviors. In addition, certain bifurcations that capture when a state loses stability are analyzed. This is accomplished through the analysis of three main problems: determining the nonlinear stability of sources, a certain type of time-periodic pattern in reaction-diffusion equations; characterizing transient, yet persistent, dynamics in the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation; and analyzing the loss of stability of spatially periodic waves in a cardiac model and its connection with irregular heartbeats.<br/><br/>One primary goal of the mathematical modeling of physical and biological processes, in general, is to predict the way the system will behave in time. One way to do this is to look for so-called stable states. Stable states attract all nearby configurations, and thus provide great insight into the types of behaviors that will be observed. For example, when studying a model of cardiac dynamics, a periodic solution could correspond to regular heartbeats. If this solution is stable, then, even when subject to disruptions in its natural rhythm, the heart will relax back to regular beating. However, if a bifurcation occurs in which the periodic solution loses stability, this could correspond to a scenario in which arrhythmia, or irregular beating, will occur. Since this behavior is undesirable, one would like to determine, via mathematical modeling, how to adjust certain parameters in the system so that the periodic solution does not lose stability. This proposal concerns the development of mathematical techniques that allow one to determine if a given solution is stable, ways in which the solution could lose stability, and what types of transient behaviors one could observe as the system relaxes to a stable solution.  The analysis is carried out in three main mathematical settings, each of which is related to applications in biology, such as the cardiac dynamics mentioned above, or physics, such as fluid dynamics."

It<br/>comprises three parts.  The first part concerns the discrepancy<br/>between the stability predictions of the standard<br/>Burton-Cabrera-Frank model and recent experiments that have<br/>established the coexistence of step meandering and bunching. <br/>This discrepancy is traced back to the incomplete information<br/>that the classical Gibbs-Thomson relation delivers about the step<br/>chemical potential.  An alternative theory, informed by<br/>thermodynamics, yields a framework for resolving the<br/>aforementioned discrepancy.  The second part focuses on the roles<br/>of electromigration and elasticity in the onset and evolution of<br/>step instabilities.  In both cases, appropriate generalizations<br/>of the Gibbs-Thomson relation are embedded in thermodynamically<br/>compatible formulations of the resulting free boundary problems. <br/>As regards electromigration, the goal is to determine if the<br/>interplay between the drift velocity and the jump in the adatom<br/>grand canonical potential along steps can explain the observed<br/>reversals in the current direction needed to trigger bunching<br/>upon transition from low- to medium- to high-temperature regimes. <br/>With respect to elasticity, the effect of stress on the stability<br/>of an isolated step against meandering and that of a periodic<br/>train of steps against bunching is studied.  In the third part,<br/>the growth of nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy and<br/>electrodeposition is considered.  Because of its small radius,<br/>which implies few steps, the growth of a nanowire is an ideal<br/>setting to examine boundary effects on step instabilities and<br/>compare the standard Burton-Cabrera-Frank formulation to its<br/>proposed thermodynamically consistent alternative.  The role of<br/>the jump in the adatom grand canonical potential during<br/>electrodeposition is probed, especially whether bunching provides<br/>a dissipative mechanism for the minimization of the nanowire<br/>total free energy. <br/><br/>     This project develops a unified approach to a central<br/>problem at the junction of materials science, solid-state<br/>physics, and applied mathematics, namely, the investigation of<br/>the onset and evolution of instabilities during step-flow<br/>epitaxy.  Through a blend of modeling, analysis, and computation,<br/>the investigator and his collaborators develop novel mathematical<br/>theories that resolve discrepancies between experimental<br/>observations and existing models.  Instabilities play a critical<br/>role in the self-assembly of various nanostructures, which in<br/>turn strongly affect the macroscopic performance of devices that<br/>span a wide range of technologies, from optoelectronics and<br/>data-storage devices to biosensors and energy-conversion systems. <br/>A fundamental understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying<br/>these instabilities and their interplay can therefore contribute<br/>significantly to the design and manufacture of increasingly<br/>smaller and more reliable devices with tailored properties for<br/>specific applications."

The project will involve collaborations between theorists and experimentalists so that experiments can be conducted to test the theory and conjectures as well as to provide insights for theoretical development.  <br/><br/>Quantum computing is a rapidly-growing area of multidisciplinary research.  If large-scale quantum computers can be built, they will be able to solve important problems that lie beyond the capabilities of current classical computers.  While the development of quantum computers promises far-reaching implications, there are still many open theoretical questions and experimental challenges that must be overcome.  For example, a quantum computer must employ a method to correct data errors that result from the inevitable uncontrollable interaction between a quantum system and its environment, a phenomenon known as decoherence.  This project aims to further develop the theory and algorithms for error correction in a quantum channel and to investigate the construction of quantum operations connecting prescribed quantum states.

Because of its close connection with<br/>material failure initiation, the phenomenon of cavitation has<br/>received much attention from the materials and mechanics<br/>communities.  Cavitation has also been a subject of interest in<br/>the mathematical community because its modeling has prompted the<br/>development of techniques to deal with a broad class of<br/>non-convex variational problems.  While in recent years<br/>considerable progress has been made via energy minimization<br/>methods to establish existence results, fundamental problems<br/>regarding the quantitative prediction of the occurrence of<br/>cavitation in real material systems remain largely unresolved. <br/>In this project, the principal investigator develops a novel<br/>framework to study cavitation that: (i) is applicable to large<br/>classes of nonlinear elastic solids of practical interest, (ii)<br/>allows for 3D general loading conditions with arbitrary<br/>triaxiality, (iii) incorporates direct information on the initial<br/>shape, spatial distribution, and mechanical properties of the<br/>underlying defects at which cavitation can initiate, and (iv) is,<br/>at the same time, computationally tractable.

This is a core topic in mechanics, of<br/>great importance for understanding and predicting the failure of<br/>real-world materials.  More generally, the project aims to<br/>develop analytical techniques that link the macroscopic<br/>properties of soft heterogeneous materials directly to their<br/>microscopic properties and underlying microstructures, a central<br/>issue in many fields of modern science.

Nevertheless, the principal investigator has developed tools to draw useful conclusions about the size and shape of the source or sources that radiate a particular field from just such limited and noisy data. In particular, the far field radiated by a source can be used to compute a convex set which must be contained within the convex hull of true source (which may be bigger but cannot be smaller). The PI continues to develop algorithms to compute these properties and develop other more detailed descriptions of sources or scatterers from data that is easily acquired. The PI's methods utilize the natural phenomenon of evanescence to estimate the size and location of an source.<br/><br/>Many areas of science and technology, especially those that take place in the laboratory or the medical center, are inundated with data. Remote sensing does not share that luxury. Data typically consists of measurements made by a single radar antenna attached to an airplane or a satellite, dragged behind a snowmobile, or supported between two skiers. The data contains valuable information for locating a land mine, predicting an avalanche, or inferring past variations in climate from the properties of snow and ice. However, in virtually all cases, the data is too limited to compute a complete description of the medium it is probing.

This project will perform theoretical studies of new approaches to the generation of femtosecond light pulses and optical bullets in mode-locked lasers. The underlying mathematical methods are rooted in nonlinear dispersive wave theory and their dynamics and stability in nonlinear, saturable media. New pulse-shaping mechanisms have the potential for major impact on ultrafast science, but current theoretical understanding is rudimentary because a pulse undergoes large changes in its temporal shape, spectral shape, and phase or frequency as it traverses a laser cavity; these in turn pose severe challenges to mathematical models.  Highly-chirped and/or self-similar pulse solutions can exist in the presence of strong dissipation, creating new classes of laser pulses that offer remarkable behavior and performance. Development of improved models proposed here will enable major scientific advances such as the generation of multidimensional solitons and will lead to enhanced instruments for applications. The research aims to be of a truly interdisciplinary nature: combining asymptotic and perturbation methods, scientific computation, and rigorous mathematical analysis with models which are based on experimental observations. <br/><br/>The impact of the proposed research will extend beyond the understanding of nonlinear pulse propagation in laser systems. The concepts developed in this project will bear on a range of topics, from the fundamental science of nonlinear dynamical systems to commercial laser instruments. Lasers that generate femtosecond-duration optical pulses have great potential for expanding the range of short-pulse optical techniques into real-world applications such as precision micro-machining, nonlinear optical imaging techniques, including multi-photon and Raman microscopies, and ocular surgery. It is very likely that performance advances that result from this work will be implemented in research and commercial laboratories, and there is strong potential for commercial development.

In recent years it has become clear that the basic paradigm behind conditioning, the ""distance to good behavior,"" can be extended to a vast variety of problems, linking it in one general picture with the development of error bounds measuring the effect of perturbations and approximations of a problem on its solutions as well as with the convergence rate of algorithms.  The ""good behavior"" of a problem is usually understood as a regularity property of a mapping related to the problem at hand which describes desirable features of its solutions.  In this project we will extend the conditioning paradigm to broad classes of variational problems, including problems in nonlinear programming, calculus of variations, and optimal control.  This task requires background work in the general area of variational analysis as well as the development of highly technical tools for tackling specific problems.<br/><br/>This project aims to establish theoretical foundations for conditioning of variational problems through rigorous analysis of regularity properties of mappings associated with such problems.  The project will lead to a better understanding of the interplay between the theoretical features of a problem and the actual computation of solutions.

The problems in this part are related to determining necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of solutions of the so-called Cauchy problems. Quantile hedging (hedging with high probability of success) problems, solutions of which are characterized by non-linear partial differential equations, will also be investigated in the above context. In the second part, I will develop a new theory for optimal stopping problems when the statistical expectation operator is replaced by alternative ways of measuring future rewards, for example by the so-called risk measures.  These problems are related to stochastic differential games of control and stopping. Saddle points of such games will be determined.  In some special cases, these are related free boundaries with quasi-linear (integro) partial differential equations.  Regularity of the value function and the free boundary curve will be investigated. The relationship between the risk aversion and the shape of the free boundary will also be analyzed.  In the third part, pathwise comparison and convex duality methods will be used to solve optimization problems with objectives of maximizing the probability of reaching certain goals. Utility maximization problems with risk constraints that will be considered in this part are quite relevant given the current economic environment in which large investors face regulatory risk constraints.<br/><br/>The project will lead to several methodological/theoretical developments in the theory of optimal stopping and stochastic control.

The dynamical systems under consideration have applications to option pricing in finance via local limit theory, estimation in nonlinear dynamics, molecular evolution via random substitution models, and brain activity via dynamical modeling. Randomness in dynamical systems is expressed by fluctuations of ergodic averages around the mean, which is subject to central limit theorems, local limit theorems and large deviations. This leads to important questions of data representation and evaluation for stationary observations: here density estimation and U-statistics via martingale approximation and improved Black-Scholes formulas in the theory of financial markets and securities, using extensions of the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model and local limit theorems. Random substitutions, which are a particular class of time-discrete dynamical systems, are used to model molecular evolution. A finer analysis of these systems, their properties and analytic tractability is a main objective of the project using probabilistic boundary theory and subadditive ergodic theory. Random external input creates stochastic behavior for neural activities. The objectives here are ergodicity and fluctuation in the long time evolution of Levina's discrete time ""integrate and fire"" model for neurons and the short time dynamics in the avalanche sizes during the firing period using branching and Poisson processes.<br/><br/>Time evolution of natural phenomena often can only be understood, modeled, and analyzed through the conceptual use of random input.  Uncertainty, which limits the ability to precisely forecast events, is dominant in many applications, for example, biological processes, evolution of financial securities and markets, and data-based prediction in statistics. Uncertainty may originate in modeling inaccuracy, in measurement error in experiments and data collection, or inherently in a system subjected to external influences.  This project aims to develop techniques to reduce the negative influence of uncertainty in specific situations: (1) in statistics to improve information recovery from data using advanced mathematical tools (martingale approximation and conjugacy in dynamical system theory); (2) in molecular evolution by enhancing models for DNA evolution analysis using random substitutions, thus leading to better diagnostic methods; (3) in financial markets by introducing correct and verifiable models that differentiate deterministic features of the market from its remaining stochastic risk, leading to improved forecasts and thus smaller risk; and (4) in neuroscience by clarifying aspects of neuronal signal transmission, which exhibits irregular behavior that currently is not well understood."

The first of these areas is a proposed exploration of a newly discovered   connection between the (one-dimensional) Schroedinger's equation and the geometry of ""bicycle tracks.""  Schroedinger's equation is a fundamental model in many areas of mathematics, physics and engineering.  Many physical phenomena, such as the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, the working of particle accelerators, and many more are explained by the properties of this equation. A completely different object of geometrical study--the so-called ""bicycle tracks""--has been studied for over a century, with no apparent connection to Hill's equations. It was recently noticed by the PI that the two subjects are closely related.  Part of proposed research is to exploit this relationship to   gain new insights into both subjects.   The second area of proposed research deals with systems with rapid imposed vibrations. Such vibrations are used in particle accelerators, in particle traps for low-temperature experiments and in laser ""tweezers.""  Underlying geometry of the phenomenon was understood only recently. The PI proposes to extend his earlier work to broader physical contexts, and to further explore the connection between differential geometry, mechanics and averaging theory in the context of this problem.  This work is expected to show how concepts from differential geometry (curvature, normal family) find their manifestations in mechanics.  In the third area of project, the researcher's goal is two-fold: first, to develop variational techniques for time--dependent Hamiltonian systems, and second, to shed new light on the problem of Arnold diffusion--an instability problem in Hamiltonian dynamics--in specific examples motivated by physics or geometry. <br/><br/>This project deals with three areas of mathematics arising in physical applications. The first part of the project is an exploration of a newly discovered connection between two fields which until recently seemed unrelated: Schroedinger's equation on the one hand, and the geometry of ""bicycle tracks"" on the other.  The former describes the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, the working of particle accelerators, mechanical vibrations, and more. It was recently noticed by this investigator that the two subjects are closely related. This connection opens exciting prospects of each area giving new insights into the other. One such possibility is a striking connection between the motion of water waves on the one hand, and the deformation of tracks on the other.  The second direction of proposed research addresses study of mechanical systems subjected to rapid vibrations. Rapid vibrations have found unexpected practical use in particle accelerators, in particle traps used for low-temperature experiments and in laser ""tweezers,"" the latter enabling biologists to manipulate parts of a cell by light, in an non--invasive way. The gist of a key phenomenon in this area was discovered in the investigator's earlier work. The present project aims to extend this work to wider applications, including fluids and gases subjected to rapid vibration, with applications including cooling, removing impurities from gases, affecting turbulence, and more.  This project will apply tools of differential geometry and differential equations to better understand  physical phenomena mentioned above. In the third area of project, the researcher's goal is two-fold: first, to develop variational techniques for analyzing time-dependent Hamiltonian systems, and second, to shed new light on the problem of Arnold diffusion--an instability problem in dynamics (e.g., of motion of satellites)--in specific examples motivated by physics and geometry."

The goal of the project is to make qualitative predictions on the behavior of the physical systems under study, and at the same time to develop concrete, yet accurate, approximate models. The project consists of three main parts: (a) Analysis of incompressible fluid flows: (a1) vanishing viscosity limits in flows with symmetry and the associated boundary layer; (a2) transport in  two-dimensional inviscid fluids, in relation to enstrophy dissipation and uniqueness of weak solutions. (b) Analysis of elastic solids: (b1) mixed boundary value/interface problems for elastostatics, and more broadly for elliptic operators, in polyhedral domains, with emphasis on the generalized finite element method; (b2) reflection and transmission of elastic waves using wave packet analysis, and applications to seismic imaging. c) Computation of Green's functions for parabolic equations: (c1) closed-form approximate Green's function of degenerate Fokker-Planck equations, and their performance in model calibration; (c2) extension to semi-linear equations. The topics under investigation relate to phenomena not yet fully understood, inherently multiscale, where direct computer simulation is challenging. A refined mathematical analysis is particularly needed in the presence of complexities, in the form for example of nonlinear equations, singular geometries, illposedness and instability as in the case of inverse problems.

Progress in these areas has potential impact on various disciplines in science and engineering. <br/>Turbulence, in part a) above of the project, is amplified near walls, enhancing mixing and transport in fluids with applications in many areas from climate and pollution models to models of fish migration.

Interface problems, also in part b) of the project, model physical phenomena in composite materials, such as fiber-reinforced polymers and fiberglass, with widespread applications to industry, from aerospace to health. Finally, Fokker-Planck equations, in part c) above of the project, arise in statistical mechanics of many-particle systems, and more generally in probability, with applications to semiconductors, plasma physics, and pricing of contingent claims.

For this type of problem, an optimal control/strategy, if it exists, will also depend on the initial time and/or the initial state.  Therefore, in general, it will no longer be optimal immediately after the initial time.  This feature is referred to as the time-inconsistency.  To find time-consistent solutions to the time-inconsistent problem, the investigator will introduce a method of multi-person hierarchical differential games.  It is expected that the limiting game as the number of players goes to infinity should lead to a time-consistent equilibrium control/strategy to the original problem.  With such a general approach, this project will carefully investigate the following cases: (1) State equation is a linear ordinary differential equation or stochastic differential equation and the cost functional is convex.  For such a case, the quasi-Riccati equation technique will be applied/extended to find the time-consistent equilibrium control; (2) State equation is a stochastic differential equation with the cost functional containing some functions of conditional expectation of the state. For such a case, the problem will be transformed to a controlled forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) parameterized by the initial time and the initial state.  Proper techniques involving maximum principle and dynamic programming, including stochastic partial differential equations, will be developed to solve the problem; (3) State equation is a stochastic Volterra integral equation.  For such a case, the theory of backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIE) recently developed by the investigator will play an essential role, and time-consistent solution will be expected by combining the theory of BSVIEs and multi-person differential games.  <br/><br/>In real world, as time goes by, it is common that people change their minds or objectives in what can be described as an inconsistent way (due to, for example, change of income and/or living standard, etc.).  Similarly, various changes of the environment (advances of technology, new limits of resources, etc.) lead people to inconsistently modifying their ways of running business from time to time.  In both cases, one faces time-inconsistent problems, yet time-consistent strategies are desirable.  The above considerations served the main motivation of the research in this project.<br/><br/>Mathematically, this project will substantially enrich the general theory of deterministic and stochastic optimal control theory from a new aspect.  It will have impact on stochastic analysis, mathematical finance, optimal control theory, and differential games.  From the point-of-view of applications, the theories developed in this project will provide useful insights for time-inconsistency, nonlinear preferences, and dynamic cumulative prospect theory, etc.  Therefore, the results will provide principles for people who are handling problems of optimal investment, asset pricing, risk management, resource (such as oil, power, etc.) allocation, production planning, etc.  The expected results will be of interest to relevant theoretic researchers, practitioners in various type industries, as well as a number of government agencies."

The first part consists of a family of problems arising in the study of phase transition equations, including those that model superconductivity and superfluidity. When a certain parameter becomes asymptotically large, these materials form vortices, which are regions of high energy and spin. This part of the project studies the dynamical behavior of asymptotically large numbers of vortices, each of which contain an asymptotically large amount of energy. The second part of the project analyzes the nucleation and dynamical behavior of vortices in models for thin micromagnetic materials. Such problems arise in magnetic information storage devices. The analytical methods used in the first and second part of the project come from geometric measure theory and the calculus of variations. The third part of the research project entails an analysis of water waves over variable topographies. The analytical methods employed will include bifurcation theory, harmonic analysis, and spectral theory, along with numerical experiments. Tied to the three research areas are several educational projects that aim to train undergraduate and graduate students in analysis, along with the goal of raising interest in applied mathematics.<br/><br/>In fluid dynamics and materials science, vorticity roughly measures the local rotation of either a fluid or a phase function. In many important physical contexts, vorticity is a crucial component, and in many cases understanding the vorticity leads to understanding of the entire physical problem. The first two parts of the project study the qualitative behavior of vorticity in two physics problems of importance to materials science, superconductors and thin micromagnetic films. These materials are of increasing use in applications, such as in powerful magnets and information storage devices. The third part of the proposal centers on understanding the behavior of ideal fluids with free boundaries, which arise in the study of waves on the surface of the ocean or fast-moving streams. The equations that model these problems are complicated; however, since these problems arise with great frequency, their analysis is important. Educational and training objectives are clearly and closely tied to the research projects."

To improve the design of implantable medical devices, the<br/>investigator and her colleagues develop fundamental understanding<br/>of, and modeling tools for, polymer and solvent interactions that<br/>result in swelling of the polymer.  Many implantable devices<br/>consist of plastic and metal components that are affixed to each<br/>other by adhesives.  When such a device is placed in the human<br/>body, the plastic parts, made from polymer, interact with the<br/>surrounding fluid and swell, while the metal parts are not<br/>affected by the fluid.  The consequent swelling mismatch causes a<br/>high stress at the interface, which can lead to deformation of<br/>the components and, if interfacial shear stresses exceed critical<br/>values guaranteed by the adhesive manufacturer, to interface<br/>delamination.  Deformation and delamination can cause devices to<br/>fail.  The ability to model the behavior of the components is<br/>critical in the design of implantable medical devices, such as<br/>defibrillators, pacemakers, and neurological devices.  This<br/>project addresses the questions:<br/> (1) How does polymer swelling proceed without polymer chain<br/>relaxation?  (Only elasticity is accounted for, and viscous<br/>effects are neglected.) <br/> (2) How does swelling proceed when polymer chains relax within<br/>the same time frame?<br/> (3) How does swelling proceed if there is mechanical strain<br/>applied to the sample?<br/> (4) How does swelling proceed if two samples made of the same<br/>polymer but with different initial swelling are bonded together?<br/><br/>     Many polymers can absorb an amount of water equivalent to<br/>about 1 percent of their own weights; hydrogel can absorb water<br/>many times its own volume.  Swelling of polymers occurs in many<br/>applications, particularly in implantable biomedical devices,<br/>made of metal and plastic polymer components, that typically are<br/>buried in wet tissue.  Polymers can relax mechanical loading and<br/>deformation over time due to viscoelastic properties. <br/>Swelling-induced stress or size changes can relax as well.  The<br/>actual stress and geometric changes in polymers are determined by<br/>the combined relaxation and swelling process.  Each of these<br/>processes is related to water diffusion, polymer chain motion,<br/>and water-polymer interactions.  Estimation of these processes<br/>and interactions is critical for understanding swelling-induced<br/>deformation, delamination, and stability, key factors in the<br/>design and quality control of medical devices.  Building on an<br/>existing collaboration between Medtronic Inc and the University<br/>of Minnesota, the investigator and her colleagues develop<br/>mathematical models, analysis, and computational and<br/>visualization tools to improve fundamental understanding of<br/>polymer and solvent interactions; the tools can be used to<br/>identify unsuitable polymers and so reduce the number of<br/>laboratory experiments performed by polymer scientists at<br/>Medtronic by more than half.  Students and postdocs are part of<br/>the project, which also includes seminars, workshops, and<br/>outreach activities sponsored jointly with Medtronic."

Tools developed for shape optimization can also be used to dramatically improve the performance of shooting methods for two-point boundary value problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations.  This project concerns the development and implementation of new algorithms for shape optimization of Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids in nearly singular geometries, and for the computation of time-periodic solutions in fluid mechanics.  New adjoint-based optimal control methods will be developed to compute gradients of objective functions and constraints governed by partial differential equations featuring singular integrals, non-local operators, or hysteresis.  The solutions of these optimization and boundary value problems occur in multi-parameter families that will be studied using numerical continuation algorithms capable of identifying bifurcations and following folds in the manifold of solutions.<br/><br/>Shape optimization is fundamental in the design of a wide range of engineering systems such as fuel-efficient vehicles and aircraft or micro-fluidic ""lab on a chip"" devices used in chemistry and molecular biology.  One of the goals of this research is to develop shape optimization techniques for materials that behave partly as viscous fluids and partly as elastic solids.  Applications include designing inkjet printers, recycling and manufacturing plastics, and understanding bio-locomotion in invertebrates.  Another goal of this research is to develop numerical methods for computing solutions of the equations of fluid mechanics that evolve to an exact copy of their initial state at a later time and then repeat themselves forever. These solutions are helpful in understanding complex phenomena such as ocean waves or the onset of turbulence in a pipe.  They should also prove useful in dynamic shape optimization problems, where the goal might be to optimize the average speed over one cycle of a swimming stroke.  Broader impacts of this project include course and curriculum development, organization of seminars and minisymposia, community outreach, advising of students and postdocs, and hosting of DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellows who wish to do a summer practicum at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory."

The theoretical approach has the potential to be adapted to a wider variety of practical situations that are similar from a mathematical point of view. Using this approach, the project investigators have recently begun the development of a fast and accurate hybrid numerical method to study the effects of solubility of surfactant on the two-phase flow of immiscible fluids in the practically important but theoretically challenging limit of large Peclet number or slow diffusion.  Surfactants influence the dynamics of fluid mixtures by altering the surface tension at interfaces between immiscible fluids and are energetically favored to remain on an interface.  However, in many examples the slow diffusional mobility of a surfactant that is soluble in the bulk flow near to but not on an interface can exert an important influence on the interface dynamics.  The large bulk Peclet number limit of this investigation introduces a separation of spatial scales that presents a substantial challenge for traditional numerical methods.  The conceptual underpinning of the approach taken here combines analytical, singular perturbation techniques in the small diffusion limit with fast and accurate numerical methods for two-phase interfacial flow. An important benefit of this approach is that highly accurate surface-based methods, such as the boundary integral or boundary element method, can be adapted to the study of surfactant solubility.  Without the treatment that is under development by the investigators these methods do not apply.<br/><br/>The project is expected to develop innovative theoretical models and numerical methods for the analysis and simulation of surfactant-mediated drop breakup and tip-streaming with soluble surfactant.

In fact, in spite of their remarkable properties,<br/>wavelets are not very efficient in capturing the intrinsic<br/>geometry of multidimensional phenomena.  In recent years,<br/>directional multiscale methods such as the shearlet<br/>representation, introduced by the investigators and their<br/>collaborators, have emerged as the most effective extension of<br/>the wavelet framework to the multidimensional setting.  Indeed,<br/>the shearlet representation encompasses the mathematical theory<br/>of affine systems and, to date, is the only method able to<br/>combine optimal sparsity and fast transforms through the power of<br/>multiresolution analysis.  The proposed research focuses on<br/>applications of the shearlet approach to a number of challenging<br/>problems of analysis and processing of multidimensional data. <br/>First, the shearlet representation is applied to provide a<br/>precise geometric characterization of the discontinuities of<br/>multivariate functions and distributions.  Combining techniques<br/>from harmonic analysis and differential geometry, this provides<br/>the groundwork for the development of improved algorithms for<br/>edge detection and feature extraction.  Second, the shearlet<br/>framework is applied to develop a new generation of methods for<br/>the regularized inversion of ill-posed problems.  Building on the<br/>ability of shearlets to provide sparse representations of Fourier<br/>integral operators, efficient decompositions for the Radon and<br/>Ray transforms are computed.  These are used to develop<br/>algorithms for the Radon inversion from local and incomplete data<br/>and for image deconvolution.  Third, a novel mathematical and<br/>computational approach for viewpoint-invariant texture retrieval<br/>is introduced.  This is achieved by jointly designing a framework<br/>for feature extraction and similarity measurement in an<br/>appropriate statistical setting, and relies on the unique ability<br/>of shearlets to capture local geometric information. <br/><br/>     Over the past several years, there has been a continuously<br/>increasing pressure to handle more efficiently the ever larger<br/>and higher dimensional data sets generated from a wide range<br/>applications such as electronic surveillance, remote sensing, and<br/>medical imaging.  The challenge is to rapidly, accurately and<br/>reliably extract the relevant information, so that it can be<br/>efficiently processed, transmitted and stored.  The project<br/>focuses on the applications of the shearlet representation -- a<br/>method introduced by the investigators and their collaborators<br/>that provides a unique combination of optimal sparsity and<br/>computational efficiency, within an innovative mathematical and<br/>computational framework.

Unlike regular diffusion, in which the dependence of the mean square displacement of a randomly walking particle on time is linear, in anomalous diffusion the mean square displacement behaves as a power function of time. If the exponent is less than one the diffusion process is slower than normal diffusion and is called subdiffusion, while if the exponent exceeds one it is faster than normal and is called superdiffusion.  A mathematical description of anomalous diffusion involves integro-differential operators which have to be derived from appropriate continuous time random walk models, and which are difficult to study. Specifically, the investigators study (i) Pattern formation in growing domains, both for normal diffusion and anomalous diffusion, focusing on the singular perturbation case when some of the diffusion coefficients are asymptotically small; (ii) Turing pattern selection in reaction-anomalous diffusion systems, in particular, the selection of stripes or spots; (iii) Localized states in reaction-superdiffusion systems that appear due to the phenomenon of pinning of the front e.g. between the stripes and time periodic cells; and (iv) Drug delivery problems which include the development of an approximate analytic theory of subdiffusive problems with moving free boundaries; the study of models of bioerodible controlled drug delivery devices governed by subdiffusive transport of the chemicals, transdermal drug release in the presence of an electric field i.e. accompanied by iontophoresis and others.<br/><br/>Controlled drug delivery has been attracting a great deal of attention in the medical community for years as an efficient way of providing treatment for a wide class of diseases. The common principle on which various drug delivery devices are based is mass transfer of the given drug towards particular organs, in which either the mass transfer rate, or place, or both are prescribed according to certain medical protocols. Much progress has been achieved in the design and development of various controlled drug delivery systems, and many people routinely take medicine designed for controlled release. Mathematical modeling of drug delivery systems is very important since it can provide a better understanding of and a quantitative description of the physical, chemical and biological processes governing the performance of the systems. On the basis of this description, better controlled drug delivery systems can be designed. There exists experimental evidence that drug diffusion toward the biological target is not normal but rather very slow, so-called subdiffusion, as the drug molecule has to diffuse through a very crowded environment. The investigators study drug transport governed by subdiffusion in order to obtain a better understanding of drug delivery processes. In addition, the investigators study other types of problems in which subdiffusion as well as superdiffusion (which is faster than normal diffusion) are important. This is pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems. Subdiffusion often occurs in biogels, porous media and polymers while superdiffusion is typical of some processes in plasmas, semiconductors, surface reactions and many others. Reaction-diffusion systems are ubiquitous in many branches of science and have been attracting the attention of scientists, engineers and mathematicians for decades. The formation of such fascinating structures as spiral waves, spatially-regular, stationary patterns with various symmetries (hexagonal, stripe, etc.) as well as chemical turbulence have made reaction-diffusion systems the subject of numerous ongoing investigations. Although many aspects of anomalous diffusion have been extensively studied, nonlinear dynamic and pattern formation aspects have been the subject of only a very limited number of works."

(2) Ground state energy fluctuations in a one-dimensional Anderson (tight-binding) model with a Bernoulli random potential and a sharp form of Lifschits tail estimates, i.e. decay of integrated density of states at the bottom of the spectrum.

Randomness models disorder, imperfections, defects (in disordered systems and materials) or noise in evolving systems.  In the first case, it does not fluctuate with time (quenched randomness); in the second--it does.  Depending on this and also on the specific details in which it enters the physics of the system, effects of randomness can be of very different nature, more or less pronounced and, from the point of view of applications, more or less desirable.  The influence of randomness on the behavior of physical systems can be profound.  To mention just a few examples: presence of noise may give rise to an unexpected force acting on a diffusing particle; presence of disorder may completely change the symmetry of a quantum system (made of superconductors, for example).  A third, famous example is that of localization:  random defects can change a conductor to an insulator even when their density is very low (i.e. there are very few of them).  All these effects--studied in the present project--have very different nature, their detailed mathematical analysis requires different methods, but they are all united by the use of probability theory to formulate and study the relevant mathematical models."

This proposal focuses on a largely unexplored area, namely, mathematical analysis and modeling of networks that are composed of dynamical systems, whose coupling structure evolves over time, on a time scale that ranges from fast to slow. The development of the general rigorous theory of dynamical networks with on-off connections and its application to three specific types of engineering, ecological, and neuronal networks constitute the research component of the proposal. The first type is a class of stochastically switched engineering networks, such as power converters, communication and information processing networks with fast on-off connections. The second type of networks is interconnected ecological metapopulations, under the realistic assumption that the migration among the patches is sporadic and due to rare and short term meteorological conditions. The third type of networks is neuronal networks with time-varying connections. Research funded under this grant integrates knowledge from different disciplinary areas in applied mathematics and engineering, including stability and bifurcation theory, graph theory, information theory, ergodic theory and averaging.<br/><br/>In many biological, ecological and engineering networks the coupling strength and the connection topology can vary in time. The proposed research applies rigorous mathematical techniques to investigate the interplay between time-varying network structure and overall network dynamics, in view of the time-varying network's use in information processing and its role in synchronization and pattern formation. In particular, the project investigates how the addition of fast switching connections can enhance the performance of networks with static links. The project also addresses the question of vulnerability of networks. Specifically, how well can networks process information when part of the individual systems or links are destroyed, and what advantages do time-varying networks of dynamical systems have over networks with static structure. The results will help to better understand the functioning of realistic networks in nature, as well as give general guidelines for designing information processing networks in engineering. The proposed research integrates research activities into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum through developing an interdisciplinary graduate course in the field of dynamical networks and mentoring undergraduate research projects.

In particular, optimal design of joint ventures between two firms is addressed, that is, the optimal time to enter/exit a project, the optimal effort each should invest in it, and how they should share the profits/losses, thus extending the classical real options theory to the case of two agents.  New models for finding optimal compensation to managers are developed, in which the manager may have better information than the investors, and in which the investors may acquire better information at a cost.  Global properties of prices formed in equilibrium of financial markets with many agents are analyzed, in order to study what factors influence the volatility and the risk premium of the stock market.  In addition, the investigators model how prices locally evolve due to changes in  liquidity, for example in the presence of fast high-frequency traders.  Finally, in a model of a market with many interacting agents, the project explores how the average number of defaults and average loss evolve in the limit when the number of agents grows.<br/><br/>This project is particularly timely given that one of the reasons for the recent crisis in financial markets is the way traders and managers have been compensated.  It will help provide insight into what types of compensation schemes are optimal for the parties involved and for the society in general.  Another issue that needs better understanding if a similar crisis is to be prevented in the future, is how the markets evolve due to the interaction of many agents, and how lack of liquidity influences the behavior of the market participants and the prices. In particular, this research sheds light on the formation of asset prices, on portfolio strategies, and on the frequency of defaults that can be expected in markets with many agents, as well as how prices are formed in  markets with varying degrees of liquidity.  Thus, the results of the project will shed light on which issues to focus on when regulating compensation in financial markets and regulating the financial industry in general."

One central problem to be addressed is the existence<br/>of a critical electric field necessary to induce the fluid/solid<br/>transition in ER fluids.

Such microstructures can be identified with random<br/>matrices, and the investigators study the evolution of<br/>microstructural features with such techniques. <br/><br/>     Composite materials arise throughout the physical and<br/>biological sciences and across most types of engineering.  One of<br/>the key features of these types of problems is the critical<br/>dependence of the effective material properties on the parameters<br/>characterizing the system.  For example, an electrorheological<br/>(ER) fluid is a suspension of particles in a viscous fluid such<br/>as oil.

It focuses on their connections with second order, fully nonlinear partial differential equations, and the application of these connections to diverse problems such as worst case design, stochastic targeting, motion by curvature, and optimal transport.  The primary idea is to use the theory of viscosity solutions of partial differential equations to characterize when a function has convex level sets.  From this point several branches of inquiry will be followed.  For example, the characterization of quasiconvex functions through a nonlinear partial differential equation suggests a PDE construction of the quasiconvex envelope of a given function ? analogous to the well known PDE construction of the convex envelope of a given function.   Another possible construction is the quasiconvex-quasiconcave envelope of a function of several variables (which would have significant application in continuous game theory). Interestingly, there is a very strong connection between the characterization of quasiconvex functions using partial differential equations and the characterization of surfaces evolving by the motion of the boundary by mean curvature. This project could yield a more stable type of approximate motion by curvature.  This project will also study of the connection between the quasiconvex characterizing differential equation, stochastic target problems, and deterministic differential tug-of-war games. Finally, quasiconvex functions arise naturally in the calculus of variations with a worst case cost. This project will consider several of problems of this type including an extension to optimal transport theory with worst case cost of transfer, and variational problems with various constraints.<br/><br/>Quasiconvexity (a.k.a. level set convexity) is an important generalization of convexity.  Quasiconvex functions have been widely used for decades in economics and management science, where they arise naturally as preference/objective functions.   A very important application and extension was found in optimal control and differential games with a worst case cost.  Significant applications to structural engineering, materials science, image processing, semiconductor design, aircraft landing strategies, and chemotherapy dosing for carcinoma management all fall in the category of worst case design and involve functions of the type considered in this project.  Expansion of a region in space governed by the physics at the boundary such as the edge of conflagration plasma (e.g., the front of a forest fire) is determined by equations which are derived and studied in this project.  The connection with stochastic target problems is an important approach to control problems in which one seeks to reach an objective with much more certainty than simply the average objective value.  Such problems have applications ranging from evolutionary biology to image reconstruction.  In classical optimal transport one tries to minimize the average cost of transporting one distribution of particles to another while maintaining the total mass. This project will study minimizing the maximum cost of transportation of the particles. Such problems have applications in the physics of the rearrangement of molecules, the construction of public transportation networks, and in the biochemistry of how malignant tumors metastasize."

This project will use the equilibrium approach to further our grasp of so-called incomplete markets, i.e., the markets which--just like the real-world markets--have a limited ability to mitigate risk. <br/><br/>The investigator will study a number of questions centered around the notion of a stochastic equilibrium in incomplete continuous-time financial markets. The goals of the proposed research are two-fold. On the conceptual level, it aims to provide a general methodology for the specification of continuous-time asset-price models from the market primitives and to establish a new modelling framework for the analysis and better understanding of incomplete financial markets and their equilibrium dynamics. A novel concept of completeness constraint is introduced in order to capture the fruitful idea that market incompleteness can be interpreted as an exogenously-imposed constraint.  On the technical level, it furnishes tools for the mathematical analysis of the framework described above, based on the existing and new stochastic-, convex- and functional-analytic and PDE-based methods. These tools are, then, used to establish the existence of equilibria and to study their properties.  The mathematical core is the study of the notion of stability for the optimal solutions of stochastic control problems as functions of the modelling inputs. The obtained stability results can be interpreted in terms of the aggregate demand functions and used to grant existence of equilibrium markets with the help of the appropriate (classical and new) fixed-point theorems."

In other words, the project focuses on soliton theory for initial profiles that are much broader than rapidly decaying or periodic. It is well-known that slow decay at infinity may lead to new phenomena. For instance, certain smooth but slowly decaying initial data may turn into rough or even blow-up revealing a very complicated relation between local and global behaviors. Standard techniques of PDEs or numerical analysis are ineffective to tackle such issues.  The IST is much better suited to study such phenomena as it combines both global and local properties of initial data, linearizes the problem, and provides accurate asymptotic behavior. Although the spectrum of the underlying differential operators (e.g. Schrdinger in the case of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation) is much more complicated than for the classical IST, it can be suitably expressed in terms of the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function which is well-defined for virtually any reasonable initial profile.  The main thrust of this project is a study of the IST in this setting. In particular, the effect of different spectral components of the differential operator in the Lax pair on the solution of the corresponding nonlinear PDE will be investigated. <br/><br/>The inverse scattering transform was first discovered in the 60s for the KdV equation of shallow-water waves. Soon after, it was found for many other important nonlinear PDEs and now is regarded as a fundamental breakthrough in mathematics, connecting different branches of pure mathematics and theoretical physics, with numerous applications ranging from hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. The importance of extending the range of validity of IST, which is the principal aim of the project, is recognized by both mathematicians and physicists. The results are expected to be of a very applied nature and could be employed for the study of wave propagation on different backgrounds (including noisy), tidal waves, certain meteorological phenomena, understanding freak waves or any other applied problems where initial data do not approach zero at infinity, and in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma, astrophysics, etc. Given their remarkable pedigree, diversity of mathematics involved, and richness of applications, the topics of the project provide a great educational experience through research for the undergraduate and graduate students involved."

The nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) and its vector generalization are universal asymptotic models for quasi-monochromatic waves in nonlinear media. Both NLS and vector NLS are completely integrable and can therefore be solved by the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) method. However, this method for vector NLS in the normal dispersion regime (defocusing regime) is not yet fully developed. Hence, the complete development of this method and description of the soliton interactions is a principal part of the project. The coupled Maxwell-Bloch system, which arises as a model in atomic physics, laser physics and optics, will also be investigated by a suitable adaptation of the IST method. Further, the IST method will be extended to the recently derived short-pulse equation, which provides a more appropriate model than the quasi-monochromatic approximation. Theoretical development of the IST for these systems and elucidation of the soliton dynamics will be guided by numerical simulation and direct methods for constructing special solutions.<br/><br/>Because of their physical applicability in such diverse fields as water waves, magnetic spin waves, optical fibers, waveguides and Bose-Einstein condensates, NLS and other systems investigated in this project are of wide scientific relevance. Dynamics of their solitary wave (soliton) solutions is also of keen interest from the point of view of applications, as interaction of vector solitons sets forth the experimental foundations for designing controlled logic gates and all-optical computers, of the phenomenon of self-induced transparency, as well as a mechanism for polarization switching of light in multi-level media.  The equations investigated in this project are not only models for phenomena at the frontier of physical science, but also have intrinsic mathematical value. <br/>The development of a modern IST for these equations will advance the fundamental understanding of complex physical phenomena in a unified mathematical framework and provide concrete information about the behavior of such systems.

To improve the mathematical understanding of these models, to clarify how exogenous and endogenous forces interact to influence aggregation pattern and morphology, and to provide biological insight into aphids and locusts, we carry out three projects.

Using the model from (1), we quantify the social kernel.

Currently, these may be specially designed double strands, or a single long scaffolding strand held in place by many short staple strands, but either way, optimal paths for the strands through the target graph must be determined. A second construction method for self-assembly of DNA nanostructures uses k-armed branched junction molecules, called tiles, whose arms are double strands of DNA with one strand extending beyond the other. These arms attach to one another when the extended segments consist of complementary bases, thus forming the edges of a graphical structure. Combinatorially, tiles may be represented by vertices with labeled half-edges. Here the minimum number of tiles required and their combinatorial structures must be determined.<br/><br/>Two new graph invariants together with generalized transition polynomials, the topological Tutte polynomial, cycle double coverings, and genus results from topological graph theory apply to minimizing the molecular building blocks used in self-assembling nanostructures. For linear single strand methods, we will develop optimal strategies for locating the strands, characterize graphs that may be good candidates for these construction methods, and use graph polynomials to capture the topological properties of these constructs. For branched junction molecule methods we will provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of tile sets achieving the minimum number of tile and bond-edge types, and efficient algorithms for generating these sets. This is done under a range of different laboratory settings: whether flexible or rigid armed tiles are used, whether or not the incidental creation of same-size or smaller graphical complexes is acceptable, and whether the target graph is of fixed size (e.g. a polyhedron) or arbitrarily large (e.g. a lattice)."

A fundamental scientific and mathematical problem is to understand how these random variations influence the system at a macroscopic level. The investigator will study partial differential equations with random coefficients. In some regimes, the macroscopic system is well-approximated by the solution to a simpler ""effective equation."" In other regimes, however, the macroscopic effective equation is insufficient to characterize the system's behavior because random microscopic variations produce residual fluctuations in the macroscopic system.  In this case, it is important to understand the deviations from the mean behavior. The first part of the project is to characterize the random fluctuations of the wave-like and pulse-like solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and some related equations. Because of the random fluctuation in the coefficients, the solution is random, and it is important to understand how the statistical character of the solution depends on statistical properties of the medium. The second goal is to study random fluctuations of solutions to higher-dimensional models for interface motion. The third goal of the project is to study fluctuations of solutions to elliptic equations with random coefficients.<br/><br/><br/>Understanding the effect of random microstructure on a macroscopic mathematical model is an important problem in many scientific and engineering applications. How can one quantify uncertainty in predictions of a model when only some statistical properties of the model parameters are known? The analytical techniques developed through this project will have an impact in the area of uncertainty quantification for PDE-based mathematical models.  The specific equations to be studied include reaction-diffusion equations which arise in models of phenomena in turbulent combustion, population ecology, and neuroscience, for example.  The project also will consider elliptic equations which arise in applications such as hydrology and materials science. In these applications, material properties like permeability or electrical conductivity vary randomly and only some statistical properties of these parameters are known."

The scheduling aspect becomes even more difficult and complex when several therapeutic agents are involved. For these combination therapies no medical guidelines are in place yet and mathematical modeling and analysis are able to give valuable insights into establishing robust and effective treatment protocols. Mathematical models for combination therapies are quite complex and, due to the various therapies pursued, are described by multi-input control systems. In this project, geometric methods from modern optimal control will be applied and developed as needed to analyze these systems when chemotherapy or radiotherapy are combined with anti-angiogenic treatments. Starting with simplified, but biologically validated models, increasingly more realistic medical features such as the pharmacokinetics of the agents and tumor immune system interactions will be incorporated. For these models unconventional mathematical structures arise that have not been analyzed in the context of biomedical applications before and are worthwhile to be investigated on their own merit. Our analysis employs tools that go well beyond the application of standard necessary conditions for optimality and aims at a full synthesis of optimal controls, i.e., a complete solution to the problem for arbitrary initial data. These solutions will set theoretical benchmarks to which other - simpler and practically realizable - protocols can be compared. The ultimate goal is to design robust and effective realizable protocols for combination therapies.

Direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows at large Reynolds numbers, that occur in practical applications, such as in geophysical modeling and mixing in industrial processes, are out of reach even for the state-of-the-art computer power.

The investigator develops concrete constructions of<br/>fusion frames and the algorithms needed for their implementation.  <br/>Working directly with engineers guarantees that advances here have<br/>Immediate implementation.  The techniques are also applied to<br/>produce Grassmannian frames for quantum physics -- especially<br/>Quantum information theory, quantum state tomography, and quantum<br/>cryptography.  Finally, frame theory has shown that the 1959<br/>Kadison-Singer Problem is equivalent to fundamental unsolved problems<br/>in a dozen areas of research in pure mathematics, applied mathematics,<br/>and engineering.  This project develops the needed frames for resolving<br/>what is now one of the most significant open problems in mathematics. <br/><br/>     We have now entered a new era where the Defense Department,<br/>Homeland Security, and industry must process amounts of data that<br/>overwhelm even current computer capacities.  Especially for<br/>defense, it is critical to be able to process these data in real<br/>time, which is becoming more and more difficult.  The problems<br/>caused by this ""information overload"" are escalating rapidly<br/>every year and need to be addressed immediately and quickly. <br/>Therefore, it is of vital national interest to automate as much<br/>of the information fusion process as possible.  But at this time,<br/>in the area of information fusion the fundamental mathematics<br/>necessary for such an automated system is far behind the current<br/>needs.  The investigator and his students develop the mathematics<br/>necessary for tackling these critical needs.  This includes<br/>methods for storing and processing information in parallel --<br/>i.e. dividing it into multiple subsystems for simpler processing<br/>and then ""fusing"" the results to get the desired outcomes.  It<br/>also includes developing distributed sensing networks that can<br/>keep an area under surveillance while taking into account severe<br/>physical limitations of the systems such as low communication<br/>bandwidth, limited signal processing power, limited battery life,<br/>or the topography of the surveillance area.  Such an automated<br/>system must be able to combine a large number of sources of quite<br/>disparate information while leaving almost no room for error. <br/>The investigator and his students address these needs as well as<br/>try to anticipate the next level of difficulties that will arise."

The topics to be investigated are: small viscosity regime of second grade fluids; uniqueness of weak solutions for certain linear perturbations of the two-dimensional Euler equations; the vanishing viscosity limit of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with helical symmetry; the search for hypotheses on the structure of invariant measures or stationary statistical solutions of the two and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with anomalous dissipation; the search for energy cascade for flows in domains with physical boundaries; two-dimensional cascades with large gap bimodal forcing. Turbulence is a common phenomenon in fluid motion, in which macroscopic quantities (velocity, pressure, temperatures, etc.)  no longer have a deterministic relation with global parameters of the flow. Direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows at large Reynolds numbers, that occur in practical applications, such as in geophysical modeling and mixing in industrial processes, are out of reach even for the state-of-the-art computer power. Therefore, there is an urgent need to pursue this challenging problem analytically, by developing rigorous mathematical and statistical tools to investigate it, and to test these tools computationally. <br/><br/>While turbulence is an everyday occurrence, our understanding is still lacking in many aspects. Quantifying the effect of small scales on the dynamics of large scales is fundamental in modern multiscale science. The goal of the project is to enable a predictive analytical study of turbulent flows. This study will impact wide-ranging applications, from geophysical modeling, such as dispersion of pollutants in the ocean, to biological and industrial modeling, such as design of polymeric materials. The project will consolidate the well-established collaborative efforts of the principal investigators with their Brazilian counterparts, and may lead to new collaboration, especially among the junior research personnel. International collaboration among scientists is a key to economic competitiveness in global markets. Four US and three Brazilian academic institutions are involved in the project. The international dimension of the project is further emphasized through two planned workshops.

Closely related is the question on how to measure risk in these markets.  The difficulty lies in the fact that transaction costs lead in a natural way to set-valued constructions. Set-valued risk measures for random solvency cones are studied.  An example is the superhedging price of a multivariate claim under transaction costs.  This link makes it possible to study price bounds that are more reasonable from a practical point of view like good deal bounds and indifference prices, which have already proven to be a powerful pricing mechanism in frictionless incomplete markets.  Another goal is to solve a hedging problem in markets with transaction costs when the risk of falling short a contingent claim is evaluated by a set-valued risk measure.  The above problems are solved by means of a recent convex duality theory, particularly designed for set-valued functions.  Especially, dual problems for the main set-valued problem and its subproblems are established and conditions for strong duality will be studied.  The chosen model itself, a set-valued optimization problem, as well as the proposed solution methods are new in mathematical finance and<br/>beyond: The approach also extends concepts from optimization theory.<br/><br/>Models for markets with transaction costs are more realistic than frictionless models.  The finance industry benefits from research in hedging, pricing and risk managing techniques as there is a need to cope with bid-ask-spreads for traded assets caused by transaction costs.  In complex market situations it is an advantage to have flexible tools for risk evaluation in terms of more than one currency and corresponding risk managing techniques.  Thus, this research project leads to a better understanding of multivariate risks."

It is aimed at answering some outstanding questions concerning their asymptotic behavior and a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the pattern formation associated with these equations. In particular, one of the central goals is to provide rigorous justifications for both the pattern formation observed in fluid mixing--the so-called 'strange' eigenmodes, as well as for the existence of kinematic dynamos.  The investigator takes two distinct approaches; the first one is to extend the existing theory of principal Floquet bundles and exponential separation to a class of non-autonomous linear equations featuring advection by velocity fields with periodic and general time-dependence and subject to more physical boundary conditions.  The second more ambitious approach is via non-autonomous inertial manifolds, which provide an avenue for a complete decomposition in Floquet bundles.  While the theory of attractors is now very well developed, the theory of inertial manifolds is lagging in many respects. The question of existence of inertial manifolds for many physically relevant parabolic PDEs, including the Navier-Stokes equations, for which most of the theory was originally developed, is still open.  The PI investigates the possibility of extending the transformation method, which he recently developed for a class of viscous Burgers equations and a class of nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation to a larger class of convection-dominated parabolic equations that fail to satisfy the spectral-gap condition. The transformation method exploits deeper and more subtle interplay between the diffusive and convective terms, which has been largely ignored in other approaches so far.<br/><br/>The research project lies at the crossroads of several different fields of mathematical physics, ranging from global climate and ocean dynamics, fluid mixing and turbulence to flame propagation and polymer dynamics.  It employs methods from the theory of partial differential equations and the theory of infinite and finite-dimensional dynamical systems.  Many interesting and important physical phenomena are modeled by convection-dominated parabolic partial differential equations which feature both a diffusive term that has an entropic effect and leads to irreversible loss of structure, as well as convective terms that lead to more organized states.  These two mechanisms are not separate, but act rather in unison, leading to pattern formations, whose understanding is one of the central problems of mathematical physics.   This project is aimed at identifying and exploiting some subtle mechanisms of the interplay between diffusion and advection in order to mathematically rigorously explain the formation and properties of these patterns. Results of this research have immediate practical implications.  For example, they lead to understanding of how parcels of fluid move and mix, which has an impact in climatology, pollution dispersion and marine ecology."

Brownian control problems(BCP) have been proposed  as formal diffusion approximations for a broad range of controlled networks.Currently there is a critical lack of general theory that establishes rigorous connections between a network control problem and its associated BCP. The first goal of this research is to establish that for a wide range of control forms, network structures and optimization criteria, the value functions of suitably scaled controlled network models converge to that of the corresponding diffusion control problem. The second goal  is the study of qualitative properties of diffusion control problems arising from the above asymptotic analysis.  These problems correspond to a family of singular control problems with state constraints in non-smooth domains. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations for such control problems are a challenging class of degenerate elliptic nonlinear partial differential equations with gradient constraints and somewhat non-standard boundary conditions. Existence, uniqueness and regularity theory for HJB equations for a range of such control problems and cost criteria will be developed. Wellposedness of such equations is a central ingredient in development of numerical schemes for obtaining near optimal controls.  Additionally, regularity is key in reading off useful qualitative information on the form of an optimal control.  An example of such  information is the characterization of an optimally controlled process as a reflected diffusion over a domain determined in terms of a suitable free boundary problem. Such characterization results for singular control problems are some of the most elegant and useful results in the field and their study for problems with state constraints will be a focus of this research.<br/><br/>Dynamic control problems that motivate this work arise from a wide range of application areas, such as, telecommunications, manufacturing, service engineering, computing, etc.  Control in such networks can take a variety of forms, examples include, scheduling, sequencing, routing and admissions of jobs, and input and processing rate controls.  Networks of interest are in general quite complex and thus  one seeks tractable approximate models. The overall theme of  this research is the development of  techniques for obtaining good scheduling policies for general families of such stochastic processing systems using the mathematical theory of diffusion approximations.  The work will lead to improved design, stability and regulation of complex manufacturing, communication and computer systems. Research project will support the training of two graduate students and  develop international collaborations and with faculty from non-Ph.D. granting institutions."

The project will resolve a number of open questions. The development of a rigorous foundation for analyzing the stability of viscoelastic flows has long presented an unresolved challenge. Unlike the case of Newtonian flows, there are no applicable theorems of a general nature that link stability to spectral properties or allow deducing nonlinear stability from linearized stability. The project will build on recent developments concerning ""advective"" systems that promise the possibility of a rigorous study of the stability of creeping flows of viscoelastic fluids. Another part of the project involves formulation and analysis of models for complex yield stress behavior. Phenomena such as yield stress hysteresis, time dependence of yield stress and thixotropy will be explained by a combination of fast and slow dynamics which arises in a singular limit of certain models of viscoelastic flows. The infinite Weissenberg number limit provides another class of problems rife with unresolved mathematical and numerical issues. Work under the project will address the well-posedness of equations which describe the infinite Weissenberg number limit, and singular perturbation problems associated with this limit. The PI will also continue his research on the controllability of viscoelastic flows. Such flows are not fully controllable.<br/>The stress tensor in a viscoelastic fluid is subject to certain positive definiteness restrictions which, physically, result from the fact that polymer molecules can be stretched by a flow, but cannot be forced to retract. A precise quantification of this positivity requirement, however, is in general quite difficult.<br/><br/>Complex fluids, such as polymers, pastes, and emulsions, arise in numerous applications in the plastics and food industries, as well as biological systems. The equations modeling such fluids are only partly understood. The project will address several important issues arising in the study of these equations, leading to a better understanding of phenomena as well as better methods of their numerical simulation. Flow instabilities, yield behavior of some fluids (which start to flow only when loaded above a certain threshold), problems of the highly elastic limit, and control of flow are among the problems addressed in this work. Several graduate students are already participating in this research."

The dynamics of each individual node, such as a neuron, are highly nonlinear, the underlying network topology is anything but homogeneous, and the most relevant network phenomena exhibit structural features over a multitude of spatiotemporal scales. To advance the understanding of pulsed-coupled networks arising from the study of complex information-processing systems, it is critical to develop a general conceptual framework capable of formulating coarse-grained, statistical descriptions of large-scale pulse-coupled network dynamics over complex network topologies. Current mathematical tools, such as techniques from statistical mechanics, cannot be readily applied to these pulsed-coupled systems, since most of the assumptions upon which these techniques are based (e.g., stationarity, homogeneity of the interaction network, etc.) simply do not hold. The aim of the proposed research is to take a first step towards tackling these conceptual issues via: (i) The systematic extension of kinetic theory formulations of uncorrelated homogeneous pulsed-coupled network dynamics to incorporate pairwise correlations between pulse-coupled nodes within the network, as well as fluctuations in network activity that arise as a consequence of network topology (ii) The search for an appropriate definition of entropy for pulse-coupled network systems that will serve as a unifying principle to both (a) extend the maximum entropy principle that has been successful in simplifying the dynamics associated with certain idealized pulsed-coupled network systems, and (b) characterize the nature of global fluctuations of network dynamics over realistic network topology.<br/><br/>A development of a theoretical framework of organizing principles that can capture statistical behaviors of network dynamics over complex topologies is potentially transformative in understanding of general information transmission and processing over general network topologies. A successful implementation of theoretical methodologies proposed here will have strong impact on how we model large-scale, pulse-coupled network dynamics, in particular, neuronal network dynamics, and on how we theoretically investigate brain dynamics from a new coarse-grained perspective. This would be a first step towards undertaking the scientific challenge of addressing how structural connectivity underlies functional and effective connectivity in the brain. It is important to emphasize that the general theoretical issues addressed in this proposal will have ramifications in assisting the analysis and understanding of many other dynamics on complicated networks, such as chemical reaction cascades, genetic networks, traffic networks etc, in particular to systems neuroscience. The proposed work will provide postdocs and graduate students with exciting research projects in applied mathematics as well as in theoretical problems arising from systems neuroscience."

The same type of system, defined on a graph, is currently studied extensively in the theory of quantum information and computation. In that context, the degrees of freedom are qubits (or, more generally, qudits), which are the basic entities carrying quantum information, on which quantum algorithms are implemented as a sequence of unitary transformations.

As fundamental research and technology advances, the results and techniques developed in this project are expected to have an impact in technological applications such as quantum information processing, quantum cryptography, quantum computing, and the modeling of electronic or spintronic devices that exploit the quantum properties of novel materials.

It focuses on waves modeled by nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, and related equations, that propagate along boundaries or interfaces (such as discontinuities in vorticity, vortex sheets, material boundaries, and shock waves). These surface waves often display a complex nonlocal, nonlinear behavior which is not well-understood. The principal investigator will derive and study reduced asymptotic equations that describe these waves in a range of physical applications. A typical feature of the resulting nonlocal quasilinear equations is that they are Hamiltonian, and they may be expressed in both spectral and spatial forms, leading to connections with multilinear harmonic analysis. Fundamental questions concerning these equations include the life-span of smooth solutions, the formation and physical interpretation of singularities, and the global existence of weak solutions.<br/><br/>Surface waves are waves that propagate along a boundary or interface. Since they are guided along an interface, they decay more slowly than bulk waves, which explains why the surface seismic waves generated by an earthquake are the most destructive far from their source. Surface waves are widely used in technological applications, such as ultrasonic surface acoustic wave devices in cell phones or nanophotonic surface plasmon devices, because they are directly accessible to detection and manipulation. Small-amplitude waves are well-described by linear equations, but nonlinear effects become important at larger amplitudes and lead to qualitatively new phenomena such as the formation of singularities (for example, shock waves in a compressible fluid). Nonlinearity makes the mathematical analysis of these problems very challenging. An additional feature of surface waves is that the effects of nonlinearity may be nonlocal because what happens at one point on the surface can influence what happens elsewhere on the surface through the bulk medium. The principal investigator plans to study the fundamental qualitative properties of such nonlinear, nonlocal surface waves in the context of a wide variety of physical problems. The results will have potential applications in fluid dynamics, including transonic flow, elasticity, magnetohydrodynamics, geophysics, and condensed matter physics."

Coherent structure solutions of  PDEs  often arise due to a combination of nonlinear and dispersive effects. Nonlinearity tends to concentrate energy and dispersion tends to spread it out; their balance often results in persistent or long-lived coherent structures. We will study the dynamics of coherent structures - their stability and scattering interactions. We shall also consider the interaction of such coherent structures with spatially inhomogeneous media. Inhomogeneities (spatially varying coefficients in the PDEs) introduce another class of localized states called ""defect modes"".  We will study the nonlinear dynamics and energy exchange between coherent structures with defect modes and radiation modes.  Finally, we will apply our previous work on energy transfer between discrete (bound state) and continuum (radiation) modes in energy conserving PDEs to the question of control of wave propagation, e.g. designing a photonic structure to maximize the lifetime of a  designated optical state. Our mathematical approaches range from rigorous analytical methods to formal asymptotic methods to numerical simulation of PDEs and optimization.<br/><br/>Advances in the design and fabrication of micro- and nano-structured media are driving mathematical research to determine their effective properties and those of waves propagating in such structures. Such microstructures are important components in current and future communication and information processing technologies. For example, they enable the manipulation of light (photons) in a manner analogous to the way electricity (electrons) has been manipulated in solid state computer chips for many years. Advantages come through greater speed and virtually dissipation free propagation in photonic media. Due to the size, multi-scale character and complexity of these problems, relying on full computer simulations of the governing partial differential equations is not practical for the problem of device design. The mathematical problems explored in this project are aimed at the development of systematic approaches to characterization of such microstructured media and an understanding the properties of waves traveling through them. These will be used to develop hybrid analytical / computational approaches to the problems requiring the control of coherent structures."

In fact, in spite of their remarkable properties,<br/>wavelets are not very efficient in capturing the intrinsic<br/>geometry of multidimensional phenomena.  In recent years,<br/>directional multiscale methods such as the shearlet<br/>representation, introduced by the investigators and their<br/>collaborators, have emerged as the most effective extension of<br/>the wavelet framework to the multidimensional setting.  Indeed,<br/>the shearlet representation encompasses the mathematical theory<br/>of affine systems and, to date, is the only method able to<br/>combine optimal sparsity and fast transforms through the power of<br/>multiresolution analysis.  The proposed research focuses on<br/>applications of the shearlet approach to a number of challenging<br/>problems of analysis and processing of multidimensional data. <br/>First, the shearlet representation is applied to provide a<br/>precise geometric characterization of the discontinuities of<br/>multivariate functions and distributions.  Combining techniques<br/>from harmonic analysis and differential geometry, this provides<br/>the groundwork for the development of improved algorithms for<br/>edge detection and feature extraction.  Second, the shearlet<br/>framework is applied to develop a new generation of methods for<br/>the regularized inversion of ill-posed problems.  Building on the<br/>ability of shearlets to provide sparse representations of Fourier<br/>integral operators, efficient decompositions for the Radon and<br/>Ray transforms are computed.  These are used to develop<br/>algorithms for the Radon inversion from local and incomplete data<br/>and for image deconvolution.  Third, a novel mathematical and<br/>computational approach for viewpoint-invariant texture retrieval<br/>is introduced.  This is achieved by jointly designing a framework<br/>for feature extraction and similarity measurement in an<br/>appropriate statistical setting, and relies on the unique ability<br/>of shearlets to capture local geometric information. <br/><br/>     Over the past several years, there has been a continuously<br/>increasing pressure to handle more efficiently the ever larger<br/>and higher dimensional data sets generated from a wide range<br/>applications such as electronic surveillance, remote sensing, and<br/>medical imaging.  The challenge is to rapidly, accurately and<br/>reliably extract the relevant information, so that it can be<br/>efficiently processed, transmitted and stored.  The project<br/>focuses on the applications of the shearlet representation -- a<br/>method introduced by the investigators and their collaborators<br/>that provides a unique combination of optimal sparsity and<br/>computational efficiency, within an innovative mathematical and<br/>computational framework.  The notion of optimal sparsity, in<br/>particular, implies that this approach has the ability to very<br/>effectively and reliably identify the most relevant features<br/>contained in the data.  Specifically, this project leads to<br/>advanced techniques for edge detection, feature extraction, and<br/>texture retrieval from medical, industrial and satellite imagery. <br/>This results in innovative and improved computational algorithms<br/>for the analysis and processing of high-dimensional data and<br/>facilitates technological advances in sensitive applications such<br/>as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, data classification and<br/>electronic surveillance."

In particular, optimal design of joint ventures between two firms is addressed, that is, the optimal time to enter/exit a project, the optimal effort each should invest in it, and how they should share the profits/losses, thus extending the classical real options theory to the case of two agents.  New models for finding optimal compensation to managers are developed, in which the manager may have better information than the investors, and in which the investors may acquire better information at a cost.  Global properties of prices formed in equilibrium of financial markets with many agents are analyzed, in order to study what factors influence the volatility and the risk premium of the stock market.  In addition, the investigators model how prices locally evolve due to changes in  liquidity, for example in the presence of fast high-frequency traders.  Finally, in a model of a market with many interacting agents, the project explores how the average number of defaults and average loss evolve in the limit when the number of agents grows.<br/><br/>This project is particularly timely given that one of the reasons for the recent crisis in financial markets is the way traders and managers have been compensated.  It will help provide insight into what types of compensation schemes are optimal for the parties involved and for the society in general.  Another issue that needs better understanding if a similar crisis is to be prevented in the future, is how the markets evolve due to the interaction of many agents, and how lack of liquidity influences the behavior of the market participants and the prices. In particular, this research sheds light on the formation of asset prices, on portfolio strategies, and on the frequency of defaults that can be expected in markets with many agents, as well as how prices are formed in  markets with varying degrees of liquidity.

Theme 1 of the project defines a new non-orthogonal<br/>fusion frame.  Preliminary studies show that the matrix<br/>representation of the new fusion frame operator can be diagonal<br/>over the same example where the existing fusion frame operator is<br/>completely sparse-less.  Because the fusion operation ultimately<br/>involves the inverse of the fusion frame operator, and because<br/>subspace transformations are generally unavailable in practical<br/>data fusion applications, such a new fusion frame with sparse or<br/>diagonal fusion operator becomes crucial.  Theme 2 studies a<br/>notion of multi-fusion frames based on multiple non-orthogonal<br/>projections onto one subspace.  Nearly surprisingly, the new<br/>multi-fusion frame operator defined on one proper subspace can be<br/>easily positive and invertible.  A number of theoretical issues<br/>are to be understood.  Rooted in studies of themes 1 and 2, theme<br/>3 outlines a notion of reflective sensing and multiple reflective<br/>sensing.  Their theory and applications in side-measured<br/>tomography and multi-path wireless signal receiving are examined. <br/>It is relevant to point out that the implementation of<br/>non-orthogonal projection operators is naturally achievable,<br/>based on earlier work by the investigator on pseudoframes for<br/>subspaces. <br/><br/>     The project relates to signal processing applications. <br/>Signal processing generally refers to making the signal easy to<br/>handle or of better quality.  It is everywhere seen in our modern<br/>society.  In this project, the principal novelties introduced to<br/>signal processing are the new notion of non-orthogonal fusion<br/>frames and ideas of performing data fusion from, e.g., wireless<br/>signals received from multiple paths.  Fusion frame is a notion<br/>developed specifically for various data fusion applications. <br/>Data fusion means combining data measured by different devices or<br/>by different means in order to obtain refined data.  The<br/>advantage of non-orthogonal fusion frames lies in the fact that<br/>they greatly improve efficiency of the data fusion procedure in<br/>practical sensor networks, particularly when the amount of data<br/>is large.  The project aims to develop effective methods of<br/>combining data detected in an array of sensors where information<br/>overlay (among sensors) is abundant and unpredictable.  With<br/>extremely complicated information overlaps, exact and efficient<br/>data combination is made possible by non-orthogonal fusion<br/>frames.  In particular, the project explores image fusion to<br/>provide a combined image of much greater precision or resolution<br/>without ad-hoc procedures present in conventional techniques. <br/>Data fusion problems arise in many applications, ranging from<br/>commercial imaging to geographic survey, mapping, wireless<br/>communication, multi-sensor/camera surveillance systems, and a<br/>great number of sensor network applications."

The second is the ""light stopping"" phenomenon, which requires the development of a new inverse-scattering-transform technique and soliton theory for the Maxwell-Bloch equations with nonvanishing boundary conditions at infinity. The third is light propagating through a combined, lambda-configuration metamaterial, which requires the derivation of a new model to be studied through a combination of exact solutions, asymptotic, and numerical techniques, and may give rise to descriptions of novel phenomena such as simultaneous color and direction switching and a related nonlinear version of Anderson localization, as well as mechanisms for loss compensation in metamaterials.

First, he considers exact relations and<br/>links for effective tensors of fiber-reinforced elastic<br/>composites, by applying the general theory developed by him and<br/>his collaborators.  The general theory provides a strategy for<br/>finding every relation and link.  However, the actual execution<br/>of that strategy is far from trivial.  The case of<br/>fiber-reinforced elastic composites is both important for<br/>applications and incredibly challenging technically, because the<br/>microstructure is two-dimensional while the properties of the<br/>composite are represented by three-dimensional fully anisotropic<br/>elastic tensors.  This topic builds on the successful solution of<br/>a similar, simpler problem in the context of Hall-effect<br/>conductivity.  A second problem concerns morphological stability<br/>of phase boundaries in materials capable of undergoing<br/>martensitic phase transformations.  The investigator studies the<br/>possibility of a configuration in which the only mode of<br/>instability is the global motion of the phase boundary. <br/>Mathematically this corresponds to the failure of the generalized<br/>second variation to stay positive.  The difficulty is that all<br/>other stability criteria are required to be satisfied.  The<br/>resolution of this issue opens the way to a complete<br/>understanding of all instabilities of configurations with smooth<br/>phase boundaries.  In the context of periodic composites,<br/>morphological instabilities may occur locally within a period<br/>cell.  Their interaction with the effective behavior of a<br/>composite is investigated, following prior work for structural<br/>and material instabilities. <br/><br/>     Heterogeneous media, or media with internal structure, are<br/>of great importance in applications.  Composite materials, which<br/>have by now become ubiquitous, are one example.  Another example<br/>is shape memory alloys and other smart materials.  These two<br/>groups of materials are very different, yet have some important<br/>common features.  A well-known connection between the two<br/>theories can be used to shed light on the less well-understood<br/>theory of martensitic phase transformations responsible for much<br/>of the shape memory behavior.  One aim of this project is to<br/>understand elastic properties of fiber-reinforced elastic<br/>composites.  Such composites may combine two cheap but imperfect<br/>materials to produce a new material that is either rare or not<br/>found in nature at all.  For example, modern skis use composites<br/>to create a material that bends easily but is incredibly stiff<br/>with respect to torsion.  However, there are limitations to what<br/>can be achieved by composites.  The investigator maps out those<br/>instances where the benefits of creating composites are<br/>dramatically reduced due to the presence of ""exact relations,""<br/>i.e. relations between material moduli that cannot be altered by<br/>making composites, no matter how hard one tries.  The present<br/>work focuses on a very widely used class of fiber-reinforced<br/>composites.  Another aim of the project is to understand<br/>instabilities in models of non-linear elasticity and shape memory<br/>alloys.  One widely known type of elastic instability is<br/>buckling.  Martensitic phase transitions responsible for shape<br/>memory behavior are another kind of instability.  These examples<br/>show how important instabilities are in applications.

A particular feature of the approach is that it links the swimmer?s motion to an explicit analysis of its internal forces and shape-changing strategy.  The former is determined by the choice of respective scalar multiplicative controls, while the latter is regarded as a geometric control.  These types of controls are novel in the context of mathematical controllability theory for partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This field is of great interest in biological and engineering applications, especially when dealing  with propulsion systems in fluids.

Phantom traffic jams can be explained as instabilities that occur in certain types of macroscopic traffic models. Under appropriate conditions, if the traffic density exceeds a critical threshold value, small perturbations amplify and grow into nonlinear traveling waves. These traffic waves, called jamitons, are observed in reality and have been reproduced experimentally. In this project, a mathematical analogy between jamitons and detonation waves in reacting gas dynamics is established and exploited: phantom traffic jams are the analogs of instabilities in the fluid's motion, and jamitons are the analogs of detonation waves. Using the Zel'dovich-von Neumann-Doering theory from combustion theory, the analogy allows the prediction of the exact shape and travel velocity of the jamitons. A key feature in the analysis is the presence of a sonic point, which acts as an event horizon (similar to the one that occurs in a black hole) across which information cannot propagate. Traffic waves are studied theoretically and by numerical simulations. A particular goal is to understand phantom traffic jams well enough to allow the development of effective countermeasures.<br/><br/>A ''phantom'' traffic jam is a small congestion in vehicular traffic that occurs spontaneously, in the absence of bottlenecks, obstacles, or any discernible causes on the road. Observations show that uniform traffic flow can develop inhomogeneities, which turn into traveling traffic jams. These traffic jam waves (''jamitons'') enforce unexpected braking maneuvers, and thus impose stress on drivers and materials, waste fuel and increase pollution, and are hot spots for potential vehicle collisions. In this project, the behavior of phantom traffic jams and jamitons is studied. Theoretical analogies between traffic modeling and gas dynamics, hydraulics, and astrophysics, are established and used to advance the understanding of traffic flow. These connections yield insight into the situations under which phantom traffic jams can occur, and allow the prediction of the shape and velocity of the resulting jamitons. A fundamental understanding of phantom traffic jams is a key step in devising appropriate countermeasures to avoid or ameliorate them. The development of effective ways to manage or prevent phantom traffic jams could have a considerable impact on the reduction of fuel consumption and pollution. Two possible strategies that will be incorporated into the models and investigated are: assisted driving devices in the individual vehicles, and adaptively controlled speed limits on highways. A crucial component of this study is the interplay between theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The research in this project involves three international collaborations, as well as graduate and undergraduate research projects."

The theoretical part of the project considers the classification, representation and chain conditions of these structures, and the relationship among Rota-Baxter related operators, shuffle type products and special operads such as the dendriform, pre-Lie and PostLie operads. <br/><br/>The Rota-Baxter operator is an algebraic generalization of the integration operator in analysis. The study of this operator was independently carried out by mathematicians, with motivation from probability theory, and by physicists, as solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Further important applications were subsequently found in several areas of physics and mathematics, including quantum field theory, Yang-Baxter equations, number theory, operads and Hopf algebras. The highly recursive, tree-like definition of the Rota-Baxter operator has also generated interest in its connection with computational mathematics and combinatorics. Further study of this operator will contribute to the understanding of the role it plays in such diverse areas."

Previous work identified when network architecture forces synchrony to be present in such systems (generalizing network symmetry to a combinatorial notion of a balanced coloring).  Balanced colorings also lead to quotient networks and previous work also showed that robust phase shift synchrony can be associated to symmetry in a quotient network.  These theories were motivated by studies of locomotor central pattern generators of animal gaits.  The studies have progressed and several general questions are now studied like:  Are all robust phase shifts present in periodic solutions of network equations the result of symmetry (using quotient networks), what are the patterns of oscillations associated with network architecture, and do these patterns always appear through bifurcation? (Surprisingly the answer to the last question is no; additionally, network architecture can change Hopf bifurcation in ways that transcend symmetry.)  How network dynamics affects Takens reconstruction is studied (is it possible to reconstruct network dynamics from the output of one node) and the dynamics of small networks (can general network studies lead to a better understanding of motifs in Systems Biology) is studied.<br/><br/>The study of networks of differential equations is central to much of modern biology (from biochemical networks through protein interaction networks and gene transcription networks to ecology through food webs).  Recent work by many research groups (usually based on chemical kinetics equations) has shown that network architecture does affect the kind of solutions that appear in coupled systems.  Moreover, these solutions lead to function and to conjectures about how large biological networks work.  General mathematical studies of network dynamics are providing both the tools needed to investigate more specific networks and an understanding of the kinds of phenomena that network models can produce.  The project involves studying general theories for network dynamics, specific examples of networks that promise to yield new (mathematical) phenomena, and specific application areas (such as the ways in which sound waves are processed in the cochlear region of the inner ear, which in part is based on a network model of inner hair bundles)."

They give rise to a variety of inverse problems for wave type equations where the unknowns may be the initial conditions or the coefficients. Some of the goals of this project are to develop analytic tools to understand the dependence of the boundary wave field on the coefficients, and algorithms to recover tissue parameters. To this end, the investigator and colleagues study inversion with variable sound speed, develop more refined models for the boundary measurement process incorporating possible reflections, and study the structure of the range of the forward operator to enhance reconstruction from limited data. A second class of problems addressed in this project relate to an older tool from tomography, namely single photon emission computed tomography. A decade ago, there were significant advances in the theory of the attenuated x-ray transform in two dimensions. In this project, the investigator and colleagues study some limited data problems for SPECT (single-photon emission computerized tomography) in three dimensional space.<br/><br/>The problems addressed in this proposal arise in medical imaging where the overarching problem is to obtain diagnostically significant information about what is happening inside the body without having to open it. However, problems which are mathematically similar arise in other areas such as geological exploration, non-destructive testing in an industrial setting, and finding the location and orientation of buried objects (e.g. nuclear waste at Hanford). For each such area of application and new measurement technology, there are usually new mathematical questions to be answered to find effective and reliable methods to reconstruct the unknown properties of medium from external measurements. This project addresses problems arising in two areas: the first is to adapt theoretical advances in two dimensional reconstruction theory for the transform of single photon emission tomography to the three dimensional setting of clinical scanners; the second is to develop theory and algorithms for reconstruction in thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography. These are among a new class of hybrid imaging methods which hold the possibility of providing information on biological activity which is complementary to the structural information obtained from traditional scanning techniques."

The underlying biological mechanisms of these novel approaches are not fully understood and several important questions including how to best schedule these therapies over time still need to be answered. The scheduling aspect becomes even more difficult and complex when several therapeutic agents are involved. For these combination therapies no medical guidelines are in place yet and mathematical modeling and analysis are able to give valuable insights into establishing robust and effective treatment protocols. Mathematical models for combination therapies are quite complex and, due to the various therapies pursued, are described by multi-input control systems. In this project, geometric methods from modern optimal control will be applied and developed as needed to analyze these systems when chemotherapy or radiotherapy are combined with anti-angiogenic treatments. Starting with simplified, but biologically validated models, increasingly more realistic medical features such as the pharmacokinetics of the agents and tumor immune system interactions will be incorporated. For these models unconventional mathematical structures arise that have not been analyzed in the context of biomedical applications before and are worthwhile to be investigated on their own merit. Our analysis employs tools that go well beyond the application of standard necessary conditions for optimality and aims at a full synthesis of optimal controls, i.e., a complete solution to the problem for arbitrary initial data. These solutions will set theoretical benchmarks to which other - simpler and practically realizable - protocols can be compared. The ultimate goal is to design robust and effective realizable protocols for combination therapies. Due to its applied and interdisciplinary character, the project contains a substantial educational component of interest to students from various fields including Mathematics, Biology and Engineering. Existing efforts to attract women and minorities to the project will be continued."

Seismology, for instance, is in great demand of new algorithms. The current preferred numerical methods--finite difference schemes that make no reference to the underlying geometry of waves--have a serious scalability issue, and give no hint on how to resolve the hard nonlinearity of the inverse problem. We argue that insights from microlocal and harmonic analysis suggest shifting much of the computational burden to a pre-processing predictive of wave kinematics: 1) by passing to a numerical representation in phase space for the operators related to the wave and Helmholtz equations, algorithms for the forward problem can be developed to restore near-linear complexity in the wave field data; and 2) fitting diffeomorphisms directly in phase-space by optimal transport ideas is predicted to resolve some of the nonconvexity issues otherwise arising when the inverse problem is solved using successive linearizations.<br/><br/>Moore's law of exponential increase in computing performance is not often matched by exponential progress in the computational sciences. The culprit is the lack of scalability of mainstream algorithms: the size of problems that can be solved grows more slowly than hardware capabilities. In increasingly many applications, the input of mathematicians is needed to help engineers and applied scientists rethink the design of numerical codes to avoid this curse of scalability. This proposal is an effort to take a step back and introduce new algorithmic ideas for seismic imaging, the discipline concerned with imaging the subsurface of the Earth. Seismic imaging is the energy sector's main predictive tool for hydrocarbon, water, and geothermal energy prospection. It is at the heart of monitoring techniques for reservoirs and carbon sequestration experiments. It has proved useful to geophysicists who debate the geological composition of the Earth's mantle. High-resolution seismic imaging is also starting to enable the Army and the Air Force to detect IEDs. All these remote imaging problems have by now become formidably complex computational questions that our generation will be responsible for solving."

While many models have arisen in these disciplines, mathematical theory is far behind fast growing application needs.  The distinguishing feature of the problems under study is the optimal control of endogenous delays.  These delays reflect the age of individuals to be harvested or the lifetime of obsolete equipment to be replaced due to technological innovations.  While such models have immense potential for applied sciences, prior use has primarily been restricted due to the assumption of constant delays.  The use of variable endogenous delays will provide greater modeling flexibility and open new horizons in qualitative analysis of the models.  Optimal control with endogenous delays will be reduced to the analysis of integral equations with unknown upper limits of integration.  Such equations represent a completely new mathematical object and will be part of the study.  Thus, the project outcomes will enhance both mathematics with new results in the optimal control and integral equations and applications with new investigation techniques relevant to applications. <br/><br/>Models based on equations with delay are currently employed by various interdisciplinary groups of scientists in economic growth theory, operations research, management sciences, environmental protection, life sciences, population biology, and related areas.

As a consequence, the research will foster collaboration among scientists from different countries and disciplines and stimulate new contacts.  Societal benefits include the ability to allocate usage of novel technological inventions and optimal management of natural resources under environmental and climate changes.  The project also will attract attention of mathematical community to new applications and increase participation of African-American undergraduates in research.

Phantom traffic jams can be explained as instabilities that occur in certain types of macroscopic traffic models. Under appropriate conditions, if the traffic density exceeds a critical threshold value, small perturbations amplify and grow into nonlinear traveling waves. These traffic waves, called jamitons, are observed in reality and have been reproduced experimentally. In this project, a mathematical analogy between jamitons and detonation waves in reacting gas dynamics is established and exploited: phantom traffic jams are the analogs of instabilities in the fluid's motion, and jamitons are the analogs of detonation waves. Using the Zel'dovich-von Neumann-Doering theory from combustion theory, the analogy allows the prediction of the exact shape and travel velocity of the jamitons. A key feature in the analysis is the presence of a sonic point, which acts as an event horizon (similar to the one that occurs in a black hole) across which information cannot propagate. Traffic waves are studied theoretically and by numerical simulations. A particular goal is to understand phantom traffic jams well enough to allow the development of effective countermeasures.<br/><br/>A ''phantom'' traffic jam is a small congestion in vehicular traffic that occurs spontaneously, in the absence of bottlenecks, obstacles, or any discernible causes on the road. Observations show that uniform traffic flow can develop inhomogeneities, which turn into traveling traffic jams. These traffic jam waves (''jamitons'') enforce unexpected braking maneuvers, and thus impose stress on drivers and materials, waste fuel and increase pollution, and are hot spots for potential vehicle collisions. In this project, the behavior of phantom traffic jams and jamitons is studied. Theoretical analogies between traffic modeling and gas dynamics, hydraulics, and astrophysics, are established and used to advance the understanding of traffic flow. These connections yield insight into the situations under which phantom traffic jams can occur, and allow the prediction of the shape and velocity of the resulting jamitons. A fundamental understanding of phantom traffic jams is a key step in devising appropriate countermeasures to avoid or ameliorate them. The development of effective ways to manage or prevent phantom traffic jams could have a considerable impact on the reduction of fuel consumption and pollution. Two possible strategies that will be incorporated into the models and investigated are: assisted driving devices in the individual vehicles, and adaptively controlled speed limits on highways. A crucial component of this study is the interplay between theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The research in this project involves three international collaborations, as well as graduate and undergraduate research projects."

A stochastic model is used to analyze the differences between the economic default and the traditional default.  The analysis is built on the classical fluctuation theory in probability.  Simulation of the model is compared with recent empirical findings from defaulted bond prices.  Sensitivity analysis in terms of key economic factors provides additional insights to the timing and prediction of default events.  The second part of the project is to analyze default dependence using a graphical model.  Techniques from algebraic geometry are explored to establish the well-posedness of the model and to provide algorithms for calibration. A more structured and dynamic version of the model is then further investigated for CDO prices, for studying loss distributions, and for comparing with other factor models. The third part of the project is devoted to a particular aspect of liquidity risk, namely, market liquidity and optimal execution.

The research employs geometric approaches to study these problems. In particular, it investigates invariant manifolds that play a key role in organizing complex oscillations. New computational methods for computing these manifolds are one focus of the research. Indeed, there is a general lack of methods for computer investigation of manifolds. Creation of a comprehensive ``smooth computational geometry'' is a long term goal of the research. The project also seeks to develop methods for fitting models to data. It is rare that all of the parameters of a complex dynamical model can be measured or that systematic methods are used to estimate these parameters from empirical time series data. With multiple time scale systems, this is a particularly difficult optimization problem because abrupt changes in the dynamics are not readily fit by the quadratic models upon which smooth optimization algorithms are based. This project seeks to identify where these abrupt changes occur. The methods also enable accurate sensitivity analysis that describes the rates of change of model trajectories as parameters are varied. They are designed to contribute to the toolkit of methods available for designing engineered systems with periodic operating states rather than ones which are steady.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems theory is astonishingly successful in relating widely disparate phenomena observed in population dynamics, chemical reactions, lasers and much more. This project follows this tradition, seeking to explain universal dynamical behaviors observed in rhythmic processes, many of which display complex oscillations.  Respiration, the heartbeat, circadian rhythms, menstrual cycles and animal locomotion are a few examples of biological rhythms to which the methods apply. All the primary modes of locomotion of higher animals: walking, running, slithering, swimming and flying result from cyclic motions of the body. Bursting oscillations that are ubiquitous in the nervous system exemplify temporal complexity: epochs of active firing of neurons alternate with quiescent periods. In mixed mode oscillations of non-equilibrium chemical reactors, epochs of large and small amplitude oscillations alternate. Multiple time scales are inherent in these complex oscillations. Thus, this project develops new methods for the analysis of dynamical systems with multiple time scales and the results yield a deeper mathematical understanding of how rapid changes in a system can result from variations of slow components. Geometric models reduce the mechanisms for such changes to their simplest forms and provide mathematical explanations for enigmatic results obtained from numerical simulations of systems with multiple time scales."

If the abundances of the constituent molecules of a reaction network are sufficiently high then the reaction network is typically modeled as a coupled set of ordinary differential equations.  If, however, the abundances are low then the standard deterministic models do not provide a good representation of the behavior of the system and stochastic models are used.  The simplest stochastic model treats the system as a continuous time Markov chain. More complicated models tend to be hybrid in nature with some components modeled discretely, some diffusively, and some absolutely continuously (that is, solutions of ordinary differential equations with stochastic inputs from the other components).  This project has two related goals.  The first is to develop rigorous results relating network structure---typically the simplest information to obtain experimentally about networks---with qualitative properties of the dynamics of reaction networks, and to do so in both the deterministic and stochastic settings.  The second goal is to develop and analyze numerical simulation methods for stochastically modeled systems that account for both the natural scalings and basic mathematical structure of reaction networks.  Stochastically modeled reaction networks often involve multiple natural scales and it is crucial that these natural scales be accounted for when developing and analyzing numerical simulation methods.  Also, all of the equations that describe reaction networks are of a very specific mathematical structure that can be utilized to develop efficient algorithms in both the discrete and continuous stochastic contexts.<br/><br/>All of the questions being addressed in this proposal have motivation from the biosciences. Recent advances in experimental methods concerning the dynamics of the cell (such as green fluorescent protein) have increased interest in how biological molecules interact at the cellular level over the course of time.  Because Brownian forces are significant at this level, stochastic models for these intracellular reaction networks, combined with analytical and computational tools, are essential if they are to be well understood.  This project will also provide a fertile training ground for graduate students.  In particular, there is a high demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with the interest and expertise necessary to contribute to the solution of problems arising in biology."

We consider two broad classes of problems where rare events are either of direct interest or a determining factor of the performance of the Monte Carlo scheme. For the first class of problems, importance sampling and particle branching methods have proven to be powerful tools. A unifying approach for the design of these types of schemes is to exploit an important connection between well-designed schemes and the subsolutions to an associated Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The approach has been successfully applied in the setting of piecewise homogenous dynamics such as queueing networks. The research project aims to consider more complicated models such as small noise diffusions with fast oscillating components where the dynamics are fully nonlinear.  With regard to the second class of problems, a particularly important topic is the approximation of the invariant distribution for systems with multiple metastable states by the occupation measure of a related Markov process. Moving from one metastable state to another is a rare event, and its treatment is the key question in the design of efficient Monte Carlo schemes. There are many ad hoc algorithms available.  However, these algorithms do not always work well and have to be applied with some care. The research project will rigorously analyze some existing algorithms as well as design new ones with better performance. Two classes of fast simulation schemes that are of particular interest for this problem are parallel tempering and importance sampling.<br/><br/>In many branches of science, such as biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering, the study of rare events or events with very little chance of happening is often of central interest. For example, in the study of proteins or biomolecules, physics-based models are employed to study the interaction of atoms or molecules. Due to the complexity of the model, analytical calculation is impossible, and the primary tool of analysis is simulation, which provides valuable insight into the dynamic evolution of the system. However, the simulation can take an exceedingly long time before the system moves from one configuration to another (a rare event).  In the context of highly reliable and secure systems, the rare event is something to be avoided, and accurate assessment is a key tool for purposes of design. To accelerate simulations in situations with important rare events, many ad hoc algorithms have been proposed. For the many schemes that lack a firm theoretical foundation, key design quantities are usually selected only on the basis of prior experience.  As a consequence, these schemes may work in specialized situations, but can also perform quite poorly in general. This research project has two goals. One is the rigorous analysis of existing schemes, which can be very useful in understanding the power of the schemes as well as their limitations.  The second goal is to develop, based on the analysis of existing approaches, new schemes whose performance is provably better than the existing ones. This work will be of use not only to theoreticians who are interested rare event simulation, but also to a large community of practitioners and scientists who use simulation as a basic tool for their research."
