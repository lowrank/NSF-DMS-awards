"9404591","Mathematical Sciences: Second-Order Optimality Conditions   for Problems with Constraints","DMS","APPLIED MATHEMATICS","11/01/1994","10/25/1994","Vera Zeidan","MI","Michigan State University","Standard Grant","Deborah Lockhart","10/31/1996","$40,000.00","","zeidan@math.msu.edu","426 AUDITORIUM RD RM 2","EAST LANSING","MI","488242600","5173555040","MPS","1266","0000, 9146, MANU, OTHR","$0.00","9404591  Zeidan       A general optimal control problem is considered in  which the control and/or state constraints are of the form  of an inclusion in a convex set.  The accessory problem when  the data functions are differentiable with Lipschitz  derivatives will be derived.  A new term is expected to  appear and hence, this is a generalization of the envelope-  like effect (introduced by Kawasaki). The results will be  expressed only in terms of the original data.  New second-  order necessary conditions for strong local minimality of  the above problem form the second part of this project. This  is a long-standing problem. The key idea of this research is  based on suitably modifying the time transformation,  introduced by A. Ya. Dubovitskii and A. A. Milyutin, in  order to obtain a new problem to which the second-order  necessary conditions for weak local optimality (developed in  the first part of the proposal) could be applied.  The third  part of this project is to develop the sufficiency theory  for the case when pure state inequality constraints and  control set constraints are present.  This research involves  a modified Riccati equation and the study of connections  between the three concepts:  Riccati equation, coupled  points, and positive definiteness of the second variations.       This project lies at the heart of optimal control  theory, a subject which was developed in the 1950's mainly  to deal with problems emanating from engineering,  natural  resources, and economics. This field, which is a branch of  optimization, could be described as follows:  Find a  candidate that produces the smallest cost (or the largest  return) while meeting given requirements.  The latter are  referred to as constraints.  ""First order optimality  conditions'' serve to produce a list of possible candidates  for the smallest cost.  In practice, many of them do not  furnish the least cost.  Hence, there is a need for another  test to screen the candidates and to obtain a short list.  This test evok es what are known as ""second order  conditions''.  In this project, second-order optimality  conditions for optimal control problem with very general  constraints will be derived.  In fact, several recent  problems in aerospace science, industrial process control,  robotics and mathematical economics can be formulated as  optimal control problems with such general constraints  (state and/or control set).  However, in this complicated  setting no satisfactory second order conditions are  presently available.  Thus, when accomplished, this research  will provide new tools to assist engineers and economists in  the selection of optimal strategies.  ***"

However, the  properties of the specific system cannot be discovered unless one  knows what the possibilities are, and the possibilities are often  revealed only by the general abstract theory. Practice and theory  progress best hand-in-hand. Three projects are proposed in this  proposal.  They all deal with basic mechanisms by which complex  and chaotic structures arise in real systems. The theoretical  results are useful in giving better understanding to experimental  and numerical results from a system of chemical reaction, insulin  secretion in pancreatic beta cells, and electrical pulses along  nerve axon. They are also important in guiding future experiments  and practical applications of these systems.    Three projects are proposed. The first project concerns a type of  degenerate heteroclinic loop bifurcation with application to the  existence of pulsing waves in a two-phase flow through a packed  column.  The second project concerns the orbit-flip homoclinic  bifurcation in the Rinzel-Terman model for the electrical  activity of pancreatic beta cells.  The bifurcation is related to  the transition from continuous spiking to intermittent spiking of  the membrane potential.  The third project concerns strategy and  numerical technique for locating bifurcation values of a  diffusion parameter in a system of bistable reaction diffusion  equations.  These values are such so that a heteroclinic loop  corresponding to traveling front and back waves changes its twist  type, which often signals the generation of chaotic dynamics."

The underlying equations are those that arise in elasticity and viscoelasticity and the desired singularity is a discontinuity. Problems that will be considered include: the existence of singular solutions to quasilinear elliptic systems; the existence of, and admissibility criteria for, singular solutions to hyperbolic systems; the existence of minimizers with singularities for problems in the calculus of variations; and, the determination of whether known discontinuous solutions to a quasilinear elliptic system are in fact minimizers of the corresponding problem in the calculus of variations.   The problems that the principal investigator will analyze arise in mathematical models for a number of plastics and glasses. The purpose of this investigation is to predict the failure of such materials under the application of external forces and/or high temperatures. The failures of interest are those due to the formation of microscopic holes. When external forces are applied to certain plastics these holes grow in size and then combine to form cracks in the material. In glasses that are used to construct fiber optic cables such holes have been found to form when a laser beam is directed down the length of the cable. Particular issues that will be addressed are: the initiation and dynamic growth of a solitary hole; the formation of secondary cracks upon the surface of a solitary hole; and, the manner in which a change in temperature can cause the formation of such holes.   ______________________________________________________________________________"

The case is considered in which a vortex ring is  formed by ejecting an amount of fluid from an opening.  In the  first part of the project, the focus will be on the initial  formation process of axisymmetric rings.  Viscous effects  dominate the flow in an initial time interval and affect the  vortex trajectory and total shed circulation.  The effects of  viscosity by adapting a successful 2-dimensional Navier Stokes  solver for high Reynolds number flow to the axisymmetric case  will be investigated.  Inviscid effects of the flow using a  vortex sheet model will also be studied in order to determine  whether present similarity theory predictions can be adjusted to  better predict the initial flow.  The second part of the project  concerns 3-dimensional dynamics of vortex rings formed at an  opening.  The development of a numerical method to compute  3-dimensional vortex sheet separation at an edge will enable the  study of the stability of these flows, as well as the effects of  nonaxisymmetric openings and nonaxisymmetric forcing.  For this  purpose, a 3-dimensional vortex filament method will be developed  which incorporates vortex separation at a sharp edge and  implements a fast summation algorithm to enable high resolution  calculations.    Understanding the dynamics of vortex rings is essential to  understand more complicated flows such as those that occur in  combustion processes, or in the airborne vortex structures  presenting a hazard to aircraft.  An inviscid numerical model has  been developed for axisymmetric vortex rings generated at a  circular opening.  This model was proven by comparison with  experiment to recover detailed information about the real flow.   In the present work, this model will be extended to 3-dimensional  flows, and will be used to study the stability of the flows, the  effects of non-axisymmetric openings a nd nonaxisymmetric forcing,  as well as the potential applicability of present theoretical  results to predict the flow.  Several of these aspects of the  flow are difficult to understand experimentally or analytically,  and the computations promise to give a deeper insight into the  flow dynamics. In order to perform this work, current numerical  tools available for 2-dimensional flows will be expanded to  3-dimensions."

New reductions  of the self dual Yang-Mills system will be considered. The self  dual equations have been shown to be a master integrable system  from which virtually all known soliton equations are contained as  special cases. Novel classes of solutions will be studied  including those recently found which can be expressed in terms of  classical automorphic functions whose solution structure possess  complex singularities which are natural boundaries in the complex  plane. Nonlinear integrable systems will be used in computational  simulations in order to establish the existence of and to  analytically understand the phenomena of numerical chaos. New  solutions to physically important forced nonlinear wave equations  will be developed.   Many of the nonlinear equations we are  studying are universally important asymptotic approximations in  physical phenomena. Applications include nonlinear optical wave  propagation, internal and surface waves in fluid dynamics,  lattice dynamics, and relativity. The use of solitons in the  technological application of long distance communication has been  widely noted. In this research project, multisoliton solutions  and their interaction properties will be analyzed in order to  significantly improve the effectiveness of soliton based  communication systems. This is usually referred to as wave length  division multiplexing (WDM) in optical communications. One of the  forced nonlinear wave systems which will be studied involves  moving pressure distributions in surface waves, such as ships  moving at critical speeds."

It goal is to provide a constructive approach  to the existence and identification of Markov controls for adaptive and singular  control problems.  The mathematical tools developed extend and provide a new  approach to the solution of stochastic control problems. The focus will be on linear  programming (LP) methods which arise naturally when the objective is to optimize  a long-term average criterion. These LP methods will be extended to finite horizon  and infinite horizon discounted criteria. A direct characterization of the stationary  distributions identifies Markov controls and allows the value to be obtained as the  solution of an infinite-dimensional LP rather than as a solution to the  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation. The form of the constraints  leads to a natural approximation procedure which allows numerical computation of  nearly optimal controls.       This project is supported jointly by the Applied Mathematics Program and  the Statistics and Probability Program. Its goal is the development of a new,  constructive approach to the solution of adaptive and singular stochastic control  problems and of approximation procedures for the numerical computation of nearly  optimal controls. This research is expected to have many important applications.   Two such example are the task of managing a portfolio of stocks so as to optimize  some financial goal, and the problem of valuing options. The theory of option  pricing is well-understood when there are no transaction costs, but existing  methods are no longer appropriate when costs are part of the transaction. Other  examples of adaptive control applications range from robotic manipulators to flight  contpol systems of high-performance aircraft. All these systems have to operate  over a wide range of working conditions, leading to great variability in the system  paramete rs.  The complexity of these systems requires the implementation of  adaptive controllers. The practical implementation of the controls further requires  sophisticated numerical methods to find nearly optimal adaptive controllers."

A particular emphasis of this part of the  proposed research will be on the large-time asymptotic behavior  of orbits (trajectories) in almost periodic monotone dynamical  processes. Various instability phenomena are described by a  parabolic system of complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. The  investigator proposes to establish the local (in time) existence,  uniqueness and complex analytic extension of solutions to the  parabolic system. This will be followed by a development of  suitable global estimates in the Lebesgue-Hardy spaces over a  region in multi-dimensional complex space in order to prevent all  the derivatives of the solution from blowing-up in finite time.  For the Ginzburg-Landau equation it should be possible to obtain  such estimates directly from the equation.

These properties are essential for the design of  measurements to be performed on the physical structure.

Although  it has been found that their appearance and dynamics play a  crucial role in the transition to turbulence and in fully  developed turbulence, our knowledge about streaks in wall-bounded  shear flows is rather limited despite remarkable progress over  the past years.

The purpose of this project  is to develop, analyze, computationally implement, and test  methods for the reduction of such equations to accurate, small  dynamical systems.  This is a subject of intense research  interest in its own right; at the same time, it provides a bridge  to the study of many complex physicochemical and engineering  systems, with important implications for the simulation,  analysis, prediction and control of their dynamic behavior.  An  integral part of this work is the application of the techniques  to models of realistic systems of current research interest, such  as pattern formation in catalytic and electrochemical reactions.   The investigator and his colleagues believe that the attempt to  tackle realistic problems strengthens the theoretical and  computational aspects of the research, and provides new ideas and  directions."

Scalar NLS is the model equation for monomode fibers, while  coupled systems of NLS equations describe birefringent fibers,  switching devices, fiber-fiber links, etc. While the integrable  theory and near-integrable perturbation methods are  well-developed for scalar NLS, these fundamental results are  still open for coupled NLS equations. We propose to develop  several interconnected projects in this proposal: the spectral  transform construction of pulse train solutions for coupled NLS;  explicit characterization of integrable instabilites; numerical  codes to implement the spectral transform in conjunction with  full pde codes for the precise optical perturbations of coupled  NLS pdes; nearly integrable perturbation methods to understand  the observed simulations. Ultimately, our goal is to predict and  understand the robust, optimal transmission and switching limits  of present fiber optic technology, in cooperation with and driven  by industry collaborators.  Fiber optics technology is  fundamental to modern communications and the electronic  superhighway. Advantages in this technology can clearly be  achieved by accurate models and simulation of the transmission  along these various fibers. While long-distance communication  lines are now on sound mathematical and engineering grounds,  various new fibers and applications lead to more complicated  model equations and quite different issues need to be understood.  The fundamental governing equations for fiber optics consist of a  single nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, while the newer  applications are governed by coupled NLS equations. The theory  and nonlinear diagnostic tools for the solitons of NLS are NOT  yet known for the coupled NLS pdes--these valuable methods are  precisely the goals of our proposal. We intend to develop these  methods on the equations of practical interes t, with the  collaboration of optics experts in academics and industry, and  focused on the problems of technological concern."

The first is related to stability  and stabilizability of control systems, and the second to  observability and reachability. Within the area of stability, the  research program will rely upon the integration of three closely  related topics with the ultimate goal of developing an  understanding of the effect of disturbances on control design.  The first topic focuses on the analysis of the stability of  general dynamical systems through an analysis of the structure of  reachable sets and their prolongations, so that a converse  Lyapunov function for general dynamical systems can be developed.  The second topic concerns so-called input-to-state stability, and  the third topic concerns the development of universal formulae  for designing explicit stabilizing feedback laws. The main goal  in the second major area of this investigation is to analyze the  relationship between different representations of systems.  Attention will be focused on clarifying the connections between  different notions and results related to observability which have  been developed within the frameworks of differential algebra and  differential geometry. Also to be investigated are conditions  under which a state space system admits integral input/output  equations.       Roughly speaking, control theory concerns itself with  changing the behavior of dynamical systems so as to meet desired  performance objectives. The analysis and design of control  systems play fundamental roles in manufacturing automation and  many other applications. The main issues addressed in this  research deal with the problem of stability of control systems  subject to disturbances, that is, with the question of how to  assure that the quantities of interest ultimately behave in an  appropriate manner regardless of the specific nature of the  disturbances acting on the system, and with identification of  systems, that is, with the questi on of how to obtain models of  the system, or ""plant"", on the basis of data obtained from  observations of its operation.  ***"

For a given  algebraic group action, two basic questions are classification (a  method for determining whether or not two elements are in the  same orbit) and orbit closure (a description of the elements in  the topological closure of an orbit). The main purpose of this  research is to solve the classification problem for the output  feedback action on the space of state space systems,  using  methods from algebraic geometry, algebraic geometry software, and  linear algebra.  For the action of the full feedback group on the  space of generalized state space systems, a classification has  been established; this project will solve the orbit closure  problem in this setting.       The principle behind many automated systems, from aircraft  control systems to thermostat regulated heating systems, is that  of control by feedback, in which current information about the  device and its environment is used as input in order to effect  necessary adjustments.  ""State feedback"" refers to the situation  in which full information is available; when only partial  information is available, adjustments are made based on ""output  feedback.""

This research  focuses on mathematical models of feedback control systems, in  which two major projects will be pursued.  The first is to  determine which mathematical models of control systems can be  obtained from a given one by applying output feedback, thus  reflecting the range of situations that could arise in a physical  system when output feedback is utilized.

This work is exciting  for several reasons. First, many of the issues being addressed  are not only of fundamental theoretical importance, but they also  have potential to provide new insights into engineering and  technological design and processing. Secondly, because of the  presence of the fluid mechanics laboratory sited within the  mathematics department at Pe nn State, the group has the ability  to combine theoretical, numerical and experimental work in a  rarely realized close collaboration. In addition, some of the  work on development of optimal numerical techniques will have  impact in a much broader arena of science and engineering  activity than just the confines of the present study."

As the theory does not presuppose that displacements and  rotations are small, its governing equations are not linear. Recent  numerical experiments have indicated that these equations are  approximately but not completely integrable in the sense of the  theory of solitons. As a first step toward the development of a  theory of the vibrations of structures whose elements obey the  nonlinear theory, information will be sought about the qualitative  properties of solutions for boundary data appropriate to such  single elements as cantilever beams. Other problems under  investigation in rod theory bear on issues that arise in theories  of the tertiary structure of DNA molecules. To have a theory of the  dynamics of rods that accounts for internal dissipation, the theory  of elastic rods will be generalized to one appropriate to nonlinear  viscoelastic materials. In a separate area of research, a study  will be made of the role of nonlinear effects in the theory of the  stability of solid bodies against changes of shape caused by  surface diffusion. Recent research has shown that a familiar result  in the linearized thery of the stability of circular cylinders  against surface diffusion, to the effect that a cylinder is stable  against all sinusoidal perturbations of wavelength less than the  circumference of the unperturbed cylinder, must be modified when  nonlinear terms in the governing equations are taken into  account.The research to be performed under the project on the  mechanics of rods is expected to have implications for the design  of methods of controlling the vibration of structures, for  understanding factors that affect the stability of motions of  helicopter rotor blades, for obtaining an understanding of the  phenomenon of supercoiling in DNA, and for finding  the mechanisms  of the action of the enzymes called topoisomerases.

Roughly speaking, FDE's are equations in which an  unknown function of time t, x(t), appears and x'(t), the  instantaneous rate of change of x(t) with time, depends in a  specified way not only on x(t) but also on the past history of  the function x. For example,in some models the rate of increase  of a population of a class of mature red blood cells at time t  may well depend on population levels of those same mature cells  six to ten days earlier. A rigorous mathematical theory of of  nonlinear FDE's poses serious challenges and various equations of  interest in applications have been neglected. We propose to study  some classes of examples which were, until quite recently,  considered intractable, but for which it now seems possible to  obtain a wide variety of surprisingly detailed theorems.         The starting point of this proposal is the study of the  equation (*), ax'(t) = f(x(t),x(t-r)), r = r(x(t)), where f and r  are given functions and a>0. Equation (*) and generalizations of  equation (*) arise in a variety of applications. In joint work  with John Mallet-Paret, the author has shown that, under natural  assumptions on f and r and for all sufficiently small a, equation  (*) has nonconstant periodic solutions. These periodic solutions  often seem to have strong global stability properties.  Furthermore, in many cases it has proved possible to determine  the limiting profile of shape of such periodic solutions as a  approaches zero. In this proposal we consider many questions  about equation (*), and we discuss possible extensions of results  for (*) to much more general classes of equations."

In such models the cells of a  lattice interact according to rules based on abstractions of the  physics governing a system.  This approach examines the  interactions between the parts of a system--interactions that  lead to the behavior of the system as a whole--and allows  evaluation of what aspects of the underlying detailed physics are  most import to the overall dynamics.  One main goal of the  proposed research is the development of a cellular-computational  model of braided streams that incorporates the basic physics of  free-surface flow over a movable bead.       To date such models have usually been evaluated only  qualitatively due to a lack of a quantitative method of  comparison between the models and data from real systems.  The  second main goal of this project is to develop new data-analysis  techniques base=d on recent advances in dynamical-systems  mathematics that will facilitate quantitative testing of  cellular-computational methods.  Our approach is to treat  downstream series of measurements in spatially extended systems  like the time series of dynamical systems.  Graphs of spatial  ""attractors"" that characterize the downstream development of  various geometrical variables, and discrete iterative plots that  show how the value of these variables influence the values  further downstream, both quantify the interactions between the  parts of a spatially extended system and characterize the  behavior of a system as a whole.  Analyses such as these, applied  to data from natural systems, laboratory experiments, and  computational models, will provide a more effective quantitative  test of the models that existing techniques.  In the proposed  projects such tests will be applied to the braided-stream model  mentioned above and to existing models  of aeolian and subaqueous  bedforms, using data collected form laboratory and field examples  of all three systems.  ***"

These processes include  complex pattern formation and growth problems in diffusion  dominated systems, and wave interactions on the ocean's free  surface.  Closely related are problems with singular or nearly  singular behavior, such as flows undergoing changes in  topological type, or water wave breaking.  The main objective of  this proposal is to investigate such problems in fluids and  materials by developing and applying state-of-the-art numerical  methods to large-scale computation, and understanding important  constituent processes through analysis and modelling.  All these  problems, while arising in quite disparate physical settings, are  strongly mediated by the presence of surface tension or energy,  and often share mathematical structure.    In this proposal, we bring together mathematical and numerical  analysis, modelling, and large-scale scientific computation to  study certain fundamental problems in fluid dynamics and  materials science. One such problem is understanding pattern  formation in diffusion dominated systems. This has important  implications in the production of metallic alloys.  The complex  patterns that are observed to form within the alloys during their  production, strongly affect the bulk properties of the resulting  alloys, such as their strength and toughness.  Other problems  involve the motions of free surfaces in fluid flows.  Two  important instances are the interactions of waves on the ocean's  surface, and the dynamics of flows undergoing changes in  topological type, say as characterized by the production of  bubbles through the mixing of two fluids.  All of the above  problems are similar in the sense that the relevant phenomena is  heavily influenced by surface tension at the interface (called  ""surface energy"" in the materials science context).  As such,  they  can be studied by some common analytical and computational  tools."

The proposer and collaborators have recently  introduced some promising new methods for studying the stability  of simplified models of solitary water waves. We plan to extend  these methods to study waves in various systems of importance,  including the full water wave equations and simplified models of  particle physics and phase transitions. A second major topic of  investigation will be the study of low velocity flow in fluids  near the liquid-gas critical point, both in zero-G and 1-G  conditions. High compressibility and anomalous physical  properties characterize this regime, and several phenomena have  been observed in experiments in spacecraft and on earth which are  unexplained or only partly explained.  The proposed stability  analyses involve the use and further development of several  mathematical tools, including the Evans function, and Krein's  perturbation determinant. Both are analytic functions whose zeros  correspond to eigenvalues or resonance poles. The use of linear  stability analysis to prove nonlinear stability will be further  developed for solitary waves of dispersive equations. Also, a new  way of reformulating Hamiltonian systems, so that constraints  become conserved quantities, will be investigated for: water  waves, flexure of cables in zero-G, and anisotropic materials  that are `stiff' in one direction. Recent developments in applied  mathematics regarding `zero-Mach number flows' in combustion will  be adapted and extended for studying near-critical pure fluids."

The  problems under investigation in this proposal are both  technologically interesting and among the most difficult in  computing.  The work encompasses: (1) applications of statistical  mechanics to fluid mechanics and turbulence theory; (2) the  analysis of stochastic systems with filamentary subsystems, in  particular polymers and quantum vortices; (3) the exploitation of  variable temperature and annealing techniques to untangle and  recognize knots and possibly fold proteins; (4) the analysis of  kinking in moving filaments and singularities in moving surfaces  by interface algorithms based on hyperbolic conservation law  theory and differential geometry; and (5) coupling these moving  interface algorithms with mean curvature flow analysis to design  algorithms for grid generation.

The structures  of interest are induced by  individual characteristics like (chronological or class) age,  size, location etc.  A particular goal is to identify those  structures the introduction of which into a previously  unstructured model changes the dynamical behavior of the model  solutions.  Specifically, he examines the influence of class age  and chronological age on models of endemic diseases, the impact  of body size structure on populations of zoo-plankton, and  evolutionary aspects in structured metapopulation models.   Mathematically, the introduction of population structure  typically converts small systems of ordinary differential  equations into large systems of ODEs or into integral,  integro-differential, functional differential or partial  differential equations.  These equations are studied as evolution  equations (dynamical systems) in an appropriate Banach space,  which typically is infinite dimensional or has a large finite  dimension.  The study uses methods of linear and nonlinear  functional analysis and dynamical systems theory.  While  establishing existence and uniqueness is a necessary and often  not trivial step, the focus is on studying the qualitative  behavior of solutions addressing stability, damped and undamped  oscillations, persistence, and permanence.         In order to interpret, forecast, manage and control the  dynamics of microbial, plant, animal and human populations it is  necessary to understand the interaction between inherent  population structures (as given by age, body size, location etc.)  and population development.  The investigator develops  mathematical concepts and tools to formulate and analyze  appropriate models for this interdependence.  Particular points  of interests are how population structure affects stability,  resilience, persistence and extinction of populations; fu rther,  how to interpret population data in terms of individual  well-being.  The latter is relevant, e.g., for the use of  micro-organisms in testing detergents.  Important examples of  structured populations are structured metapopulations.  Many  populations live in a patchy environment, leading to the  formation of local populations that often go extinct and are  recolonized by individuals immigrating from other local  populations.  The number of populations forming metapopulations  of the above kind increases because the formerly continuous  habitats of many species are fragmented.  Metapopulation dynamics  are important issues in conservation biology and re-establishment  of naturally extinct species."

In many applications, symmetry is  introduced either by the supposition of a regular geometry or by  the interchangability of parts in a complex system.  It has been  well established that the existence of regular patterns in  experiments and in computer simulations are often due to  symmetry.  Only recently has it been shown that the existence of  intermittency in the dynamics and patterns in the time-average of  solutions or experiments can also be forced by symmetry.

The mathematics involves the formulation and analysis of  reaction diffusion models for multiple populations of spines, to  model the amplitude and timecourse of potentials arising in  cylindrical structures (dendrite or muscle fiber) receiving  synchronous input from multiple clusters of synapses.  Important  biological properties considered are the amplitude of the quantal  currents, shape of the postsynaptic process, the inherent  uncertainty of an input actually occurring (probability of  release), and the precise distribution of voltage gated channels.  Theory is related to experimental data and drives new experiments.       The functions of all excitable cells, both nerve and muscle,  are regulated with precision by transmembrane potentials.  This  project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between a  mathematician and a neurobiologist to study, using experiments and  mathematical modeling, the spatial and temporal distribution of  electrical potentials in complex neuronal structures.  A  mathematical model is developed to simulate amplitude and  timecourse of potentials arising in cylindrical structures  (dendrite or muscle fiber) receiving synchronous input from  multiple clusters of synapses. The investigators use  multiterminally innervated muscle fibers to test the predictions  of the model, and conversely use the model to augment their  understanding of synaptic physiology.  The multiterminally  innervated muscle fiber allows an unusual array of experimental  and morphometric measurements, and has the added advantage of  being the topological equivalent of a dendrite having clust ers of  input spines.

These include (1)  questions of optimization, hedging, and valuation of contingent  claims in incomplete markets and/or under constraints; and (2)  questions of economic equilibrium in incomplete or ""effectively  complete"" markets. With regard to (1), it is expected that the  problem of portfolio optimization with random endowment streams  will require non-standard techniques from functional and convex  analysis. Questions of pricing are formulated in terms of a new  kind of stochastic control problem where the terminal reward  function has a random component. Issues related to (2) include  the establishment of the martingale property for certain  exponential local martingales, and the representation property of  a given set of martingales as stochastic integrals with respect  to a second, given set.       Existing methods for pricing financial instruments (for  example, contracts whose value will be revealed at some future  date) assume that financial markets are ""complete"" of ""perfect""  in the sense that it is possible to exactly calculate the present  value, and hence the price, of such instruments. In reality, this  is not the case; markets are ""imperfect"" or ""incomplete"" due,  among other things, to investment constraints, transaction costs,  different interest rates, different patterns of information, etc.  Thus, it is very important to develop new methods for pricing  financial instruments in imperfect markets; such methodologies  will be investigated in this project. In a similar vein, standard  economic equilibrium theory provides ways to determine prices for  financial assets so that individual agents' utilities are  maximized and ""markets clear"" (that is, supply equals demand) -  but again, only in the context of perfect markets. This project  will develop an equilibrium theory which is more g eneral and at  the same time also more applicable by being able to deal with  imperfect markets."

In order to explain, describe, and  predict phenomena of such a kind in a specific applied system,  people  need to know a mathematical classification of transitions from  simple  to complex behavior and a theory of evolution of stationary  (established) motions during the changes of parameters.  The  theory of  nonlocal bifurcations of strange attractors is an adequate  mathematical tool to study changes in conduct of dissipative  systems  which allows one to control and, in principal, to govern their  behavior.  Stationary motions (regimes) of real systems  correspond to  attractors in their mathematical models.  Simple regimes  correspond to  simple attractors while the complex ones correspond to so called  strange attractors.  Mathematical image of the onset to complex  behavior is a bifurcation of a rising of a strange attractor;  mathematical image of evolution of complex behavior is a  scenarium (or  a chain of bifurcations) of evolution of a strange attractor.  In  the  proposed work we are going to study bifurcations leading to  appearance  of strange attractors and to describe scenaria of their  evolution.  We  propose to apply the developed mathematical technique to such  systems  as coupled oscillators, laser systems, circuit systems of  electrical  engineering and others.   In particular, we want to study the  problem  of stochastic synchronization, i.e., similar behavior of  dissipatively  coupled dissipative individual subsystems.  The phenomenon of  stochastic synchronization is interesting, for example, for the  problem of secure communications.  It also plays a fundamental  role in  the explanation of deterministic behavior of nonequilibrium  media.  We  are going to describe mechanisms of the occurrence of stochastic  synchronization in the language of nonlocal bifurcation theory   and  strange attractors.    The problem of appearance and evolution of strange attractors  during  the changes of parameters in one-parametrical families of smooth  vector fields is very important from the mathematical point of  view.  It also plays a fundamental role in studying of specific  dissipative  systems from applications.  In the proposed work we are going to  study  the nonlocal codimension one bifurcations on the boundary of the  Morse-Smale systems which may lead to the birth of strange  attractors  and, also scenaria (i.e., chains of bifurcations) which can be  responsible for characteristics of strange attractors.  In the  first  problem, we propose to classify behavior of homoclinic and  heteroclinic trajectories at the bifurcation moment, single out  situations related to appearance of strange attractors and  describe  the arising attractors in terms of symbolic dynamics.  In the  second  problem, we want to study scenaria of appearance of new positive  Lyapunov exponents in strange attractors and investigate their  crises which are related to nontransversal intersections of  stable and  unstable manifolds.  We are going to apply expected results to  investigate some specific systems (coupled oscillators, laser  systems  and others) in the form of dissipatively coupled dissipative  individual subsystems.  We propose to describe mechanisms of  occurrence of stochastic synchronization phenomenon in such  systems.  For identical subsystems, stability of spatially-homogeneous  solutions  implies stochastic synchronization.

The Navier-Stokes equations can be used to  model compressible, slightly compressible, and incompressible  fluid flow.  The equations are complicated enough that numerical  as opposed to analytical solution methods must be employed.  The  numerical calculation of each type of flow (e.g., compressible  versus incompressible) presents its own particular difficulties.   In this project, the focus is on the efficient determination of  the solutions to the slightly compressible Navier-Stokes  equations in an infinite domain.  These solutions represent low  Mach number flow, and are pivotal to the modeling of sound  propagation.    In the case of slightly compressible flow, at least two time  scales are present in the solutions.  The presence of the two or  more time scales generally makes efficient numerical calculations  difficult to achieve.  In this project, however, the presence of  multiple time scales is actually used advantageously.  Recent  research has shown how certain solutions containing multiple time  scales can be expanded into a sum of simpler solutions (i.e.,  solutions containing essentially one time scale).  In the  analytic portion of this project, the general behavior of this  sum of solutions is examined.  The goal of this project is to  develop, implement and analyze a numerical solver which makes use  of this understanding of the behavior of these solutions.  The  efficiency and accuracy of this new implementation will be  compared with that of existing numerical schemes.  This solver is  expected to be an improvement over existing solvers in  efficiency, accuracy and ease of use."

There are four projects that will  be undertaken as components of this research program.  The ""Zero  Dispersion Limits of Nonlinear Wave Equations"" and ""Macroscopic  Lattice Dynamics"" projects both involve the study of the limiting  behavior of dynamical systems with small amounts of dispersion.   The goal is to construct macroscopic models that consist of  modulation equations for families of exact solutions of these  systems, and to identify those regions of phase space in which  such models are valid.  Both analytical and numerical tools will  be employed, and both integrable and non-integrable systems will  be considered.  The ""NLS Limit of the CGL Equation"" project  studies the complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation as a model for  ""turbulent"" dynamics in nonlinear partial differential equations  in which the ""inviscid"" limit is the nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS)  equation.  This relationship is in direct analogy to that of the  driven Navier-Stokes equations to the Euler equations in  incompressible fluid turbulence.  The structures of the NLS  equation (which is even integrable in one space dimension for the  cubic case) will be used to provide coordinates for the CGL phase  space.  The ""Moment Closure Hierarchies for Kinetic Equations"",  and ""Numerical Schemes for Hyperbolic Systems"" projects study a  systematic nonperturbative derivation of a hierarchy of closed  systems of moment equations corresponding to any classical  kinetic theory and the numerical schemes to implement them.   Unlike earlier moment closures, every member of the hierarchy is  a hyperbolic system with relaxation terms and entropy, and hence,  is formally well-posed.  Every member also formally recovers the  Euler limit, while members beyond the second recover a  Navier-Stokes correction consistent with the true Navier-Stokes  system.  The related ""Kinetic Theory"" project is more theoretical  in natur e.  It will try to rigorously establish the linearized  Euler limit of the Boltzmann equation and the existence of the  Boltzmann shock profile.  Both of these are long standing open  problems that may be amenable to the techniques developed in  earlier work with Bardos and Golse.  The ""Global Ocean  Circulation Modeling"" project studies the long-time effects of  topography and hydrostatic imbalance on shallow inviscid  incompressible flows, with a free boundary, over a varying  bottom.  An asymptotic expansion of the three-D Euler equations  leads to a system of shallow water equations that captures weak  hydrostatic imbalances and dispersion due to topography, yet  inherits several structural properties of the two-D Euler  equations.  For example, it conserves an energy norm, possesses a  circulation theorem, and has a Hamiltonian form.  This structure  will facilitate both the analytical study of this system and the  development of sound numerical schemes.    The unifying theme that runs through the projects supported is to  understand how collective large-scale behavior of dynamical  systems arise.  From a physical perspective this effort could be  viewed as a study of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.  But  it is more than that, for it strives to discover and study new  nonlinear phenomena that could impact the way models are  developed for many important physical processes.  The projects  are divided into four groups.  The first group impacts the  theories of super-fluidity and super-conductivity.  The second  contributes to our understanding of turbulent fluids.  The third  will find application in a wide range of problems such as  hypersonic flight and nano-scale semiconductors.  The fourth is a  first step in the effort to develop global climate models that  are both accurate and economical."

In the turbulence studies,  the aim is to understand the origins of short-lived coherent  structures and their role in causing intermittent and  non-Kolmogorov-like behavior.  It is important first to gain a  clear picture of weak turbulence theories, the reasons for more  than one Kolmogorov finite flux solution, and to understand the  roles that these solutions play in producing inverse cascades and  the roles that inverse cascades may play in originating collapse  structures.  The principal aim of the studies on pattern  formation  is to extend the previous far-from-onset theories to include a  description of pattern behavior when the local wavenumber is  driven outside of a stability band known as the Busse balloon.   The results of the research so far have led to a properly  regularized theory of patterns that can handle pattern  singularities such as dislocations and disclinations.  Moreover,  the latest work suggests that all point defects of almost  periodic  patterns are composed of the two elementary disclinations.       Patterns of an almost periodic nature arise all over the  place.  One sees them in the sand ripples under an advancing or  receding tide, in geological formations, on the coats of animals,  as fingerprints.  They occur in systems driven far from  equilibrium by some external stress that acts to destabilize  spatially and temporally uniform states and preferentially  amplify  certain shapes and configurations.  Geometrical symmetries, such  as rotation in the plane, lead to degeneracies (the wavelength of  a periodic pattern may be chosen but the direction remains  undetermined) and the competition betwee n the various amplified  states leads to patterns that often consist of a mosaic of almost  periodic patches separated by grain boundaries, domain walls and  point defects.  The goal of this research is to build a  macroscopic field theory for patterns that will unify and  simplify  the behavior of systems seemingly unrelated at the microscopic  level and that can capture both the smooth (field) and singular  (particle) components of the pattern."

The physical motivation for  much of the analysis arises from problems in theoretical chemistry.

As a  result, we are at a point where dynamical systems research can play a  role in the interpretation of this new experimental data.  Many of the  questions of interest are global and geometrical in nature.  For  example, answers to questions related to intramolecular and  intermolecular energy transfer depend on the geometry and dynamics  associated with surfaces of various dimensions and shapes in phase  space.  There is a need for applied mathematical research in this area  since most of the work of theoretical chemists in this area has been  carried out with low dimensional models.  Since most realistic models  of molecules are higher dimensional, it is important to develop  mathematical techniques that apply to high dimensional systems as well  as understand higher dimensional dynamical phenomena in general.

Near such regions  the invariant manifold geometry is much more complicated than the  standard ``invariant tori'' picture and new methods need to be  developed. Also, one often encounters singular perturbation phenomena  near such resonance regions which forces one to treat ``elliptic'' and  ``hyperbolic'' phenomena simultaneously.  One promising method for  such problems is the so-called ``energy-phase'' method developed by  Haller and Wiggins, largely in the context of two-degree-of-freedom  systems, which enables one to join together the ``elliptic'' and  ``hyperbolic''  phenomena that arises near resonances. We will extend  this method to multi-degree-of-freedom systems.  At the same time we  will be interested in understanding mechanisms that give rise to  complicated ``chaotic'' behavior that are ``intrinsically high  dimensional'', i.e. behavior that is not just a ``scaled up''  version  of typical low dimensional behavior.  One result of this research will  be the development of mathematical methods for understanding  intramolecular and intermolecular energy transfer in more realistic  molecular systems."

These  patterns are associated with narrow reaction zones in which rapid  changes in the dependent variables occur across narrow spatial  regions.  The solutions are obtained using an adaptive  pseudo-spectral method in which coordinate transformations are  introduced during the course of the computation to better resolve  the reaction zone and the associated patterns.  He considers the  formation of modulated traveling waves (MTWs) in cellular flames,  transitions between different types of MTWs and transitions  between MTWs and chaotic patterns, one-step and multiple reaction  mechanisms, the role of thermal expansion of the gas on the  formation and evolution of the patterns, and the formation of  spatial and temporal patterns in condensed phase gasless  combustion.  He also further develops the numerical method to  account for problems where there are multiple regions of rapid  variation.       It has been observed that many combustible mixtures do not  necessarily burn in a unifrom pattern.  Rather, ripples and other  patterns can occur along the flame.  The formation of such  patterns is believed to be an important stage in the transition  from laminar combustion (in which the burning occurs in a  regular,  predictable manner) to turbulent combustion (in which the burning  occurs in an erratic, seemingly random fashion).  An  understanding  of the transition process is an essential prerequisite to control  of the transition process to lead to more efficient burning.  In  many instances these patterns can not be predicted by analytic  means and experiments are much less advanced than for nonreacting  flows.  In the project, the investigator studies the problem of  the formation of patterns and the transition to turbulence in  combustion.  The project uses supercomputer computations to study  the formation of these patterns and the physical mechanisms  underly ing them.  The study relates both to gaseous combustion,  i.e., the burning of fossil fuels, and gasless combustion, in  which a solid burns directly.

The focus is on two conformation spaces: polygonal  knots, and harmonic knots, where harmonic knots are those given  by finite Fourier series parametrizations.  Recent theorems  relate the invariants given by these energy functions to  classical invariants such as crossing number.  So this project  should lead to a better understanding of knots realizable with  relatively low degrees of freedom.       Knot theory is the mathematical study of the everyday  objects called knots.  Once thought the purview of theoretical  mathematicians, knot theory has recently found a wide range of  applications, in fields as diverse as molecular biology and  cosmology.  For example, DNA molecules are usually knotted, and  in the replication process must somehow become untangled.  In  this project the investigators apply sophisticated computing  techniques to the study of knots.  In particular, they continue  the development of a new approach to knots: physical knot theory.   The mathematical knot is given physical properties, and knot  types are distinguished by computations involving these  properties.  For example, knot conformations can be assigned an  energy, and then knot types can be distinguished by considering  minimum energy conformations.  The conceptual basis of the  approach is familiar to researchers in biology, chemistry, and  physics as well as mathematics.  The project produces both  theoretical results and software."

The goal of this study is to better understand practical  performance of interior point methods and eventually to develop  new interior point algorithms with superior numerical efficiency.       The advent of interior point methods has revolutionized the  field of mathematical programming.  On the theoretical side,  interior point methods have been used to prove that some important  classes of optimization problems have polynomial complexity, which  means that such problems are computationally tractable even when a  large number of variables are involved.

The purpose of the present proposal is to  extend interior point methods to new classes of problems and to  investigate their properties in a systematic way both from a  deterministic and a probabilistic point of view.

The work will involve both the development of  further theoretical knowledge on the numerical methods being used  and the further development of a large computer package (BIEPACK)  to solve BIE on surfaces in three dimensions.  The numerical  analysis problems to be studied include the further development  of theory for the approximation of surfaces, the numerical  integration of singular and nonsingular functions over surfaces,  the use of graded meshes to approximate functions that are  ill-behaved around edges and corners of the surface, and the  iterative solution of the large dense linear systems of equations  which arise when discretizing the BIE.  In addition, new topics  involving the use and numerical solution of BIE are to be  considered.  These include: (1) the use of BIE of the first kind  in solving the Dirichlet and Neumann problems for Laplace's  equation; (2) the approximation and solution of hypersingular  BIE; and (3) the use of ""clustering methods"" to reduce the cost  of the numerical integration and matrix-vector multiplications  that are a part of most numerical methods.  Many of the results  of these studies will be incorporated into the present package  BIEPACK, to both improve its present programs and to extend it to  new BIE.  It is also planned to apply numerical methods that were  developed for BIE to the solution of integral equations arising  in computer graphics, and in particular, the ""rendering  equation"".    Many engineering problems involve the solution of a mathematical  equation called ""Laplace's equation"" or perturbations of it; and  the name ""potential theory"" is given to the study and application  of Laplace's equation and closely related equations.  The Laplace  equation itself occurs in applications such as fluid mechanics  (irrotational incompressible fluid flows), heat transfer,  gravit ational fields, electrostatic fields, and others.   Variations on Laplace's equation occur in fluid mechanics  (Stokes' flows), linear elasticity theory, electromagnetic and  acoustic wave propagation, and other topics.  The solution of  Laplace's equation is a function defined for all points of some  region in space, and the objective is to find this function.  In  three dimensions, this can be a very time-consuming process.   Many analytical and numerical techniques are used to solve  Laplace's equation and related equations, including finite  difference methods, finite element methods, and boundary integral  equation methods.  One of the advantages of the latter is that  the problem is re-defined as a new equation over the boundary of  the original region on which the Laplace equation of interest is  defined, and this can often lead to time savings in the overall  solution process.  The new problem is called a ""boundary integral  equation"" or BIE.  The intention of the present study is to  improve numerical methods for the numerical solution of BIE, as  well as to develop a further theoretical understanding of  numerical methods for solving BIE.  These results will be used to  improve a package, called BIEPACK, that has been developed for  the numerical solution of many BIE for Laplace's equation.  It is  also planned to apply numerical methods that were developed for  BIE to the solution of integral equations arising in computer  graphics."

Chaos and solitons have generally been portrayed as  being disparate with the consequence that quantum theory and  chaos have been generally dissociated.  However, the present line  of research points toward mathematical affinities between quantum  field theory and multidimensional nonstationary solitons; these  affinities indicate simpler methods for describing quantum  processes, derivable from classical chaos and network theories.

A spatially-homogeneous chaotic system is defined to be  extensive if its fractal dimension grows linearly with the volume  of the system.  Theorists hope that extensively chaotic systems  may be amenable to a thermodynamic-like description that  characterizes complex systems through laws relating intensive and  extensive macroscopic (coarse-grained) variables.  Specific  research problems studied are: the identification and analysis of  simplified mathematical models that have experimentally relevant  features of extensive chaos; a comparison of different spatial  correlation lengths for quantifying extensive chaos; a study of  the variation of dimension density and other intensive variables  with system inhomogeneities; the development and testing of  algorithms for estimating fractal dimension densities from time  series; the analysis of the lengthscales and timescales involved  with the transition between non-extensive and extensive chaos; the  identification and testing of Langevin descriptions of extensively  chaotic regimes; and the development of related numerical  algorithms and optimized computer codes for scalable parallel  computers such as the Duke 32-node CM-5 computer.       Many nonequilibrium physical systems---both natural and  manmade---are complex in that they evolve nonperiodically in both  space and time.  An increasingly important theme in many modern  areas of science and technology is how to quantify this complex  behavior.  Why do systems become complex as one varies parameters,  how does one complex state differ from another, and how does  transport of energy and matter depend on complexity?  Recent  experimental advances in the study of fluid flow, of liquid  crystals, of nonlinear optics,  and of chemical excitable media  have identified a new and important class of complex systems to  understand: large homogeneous sustained nonequilibrium systems  that undergo a sudden change from a time-independent homogeneous  state to a non-transient temporally and spatially disordered state  (spatiotemporal chaos).  This research uses a combination of  mathematical analysis and large-scale parallel computing to  explore the properties of carefully chosen models of  spatiotemporal chaos.  Of particular interest is to understand how  complexity grows with the size of a physical system (extensive  chaos) and whether a thermodynamic-like description can be found  in the limit of infinite system size.  An improved understanding of  extensive chaos should improve the design, control, and  optimization of engineering applications, improve the forecasting  of nonperiodic time series, and improve the validation,  efficiency, and accuracy of large-scale computer simulations for  complex systems."

These  issues arise in  the analysis of experimental data in molecular biology and  synthetic  polymer chemistry.  The applications include model building and  theoretical  proofs of the structure and mechanism of enzymes that act on DNA,  the  quantization of topological entanglement of molecules in random  polymer  systems, the development of algorithms for the numerical  computation and  simulation of macromolecular structure, and the implementation of  these  algorithms to create mathematical data that one can compare with  experimental data.  In the topological approach to enzymology,  enzymes  vital in cellular metabolism are reacted with circular DNA  substrate.  A  topological enzyme signature is observed in the family of DNA  knots and  links produced by the reaction.  One long-range goal of this  research is  the development of a complete set of experimentally observable  topological  parameters with which to describe and compute enzyme mechanism  and the  structure of the active enzyme-DNA synaptic intermediate,  allowing  mathematical proof of 3-dimensional enzyme-DNA structure, and the  ability  to predict results of future experiments.  Many recent advances  in  3-dimensional geometry and topology (such as the Cyclic Surgery  Theorem)  are useful in the analysis of data from these topological  enzymology  experiments.       The results of this basic research project have potential  utility in  biotechnology, rational drug design and the design and  manufacture of  synthetic polymers.  Before one can harness the manufacturing  power of  bacterial cells, one must first understand what these cells are  capable of,  and then how to control these processes.  In order to combat  viruses in  human disease, and to exploit the ability of viruses to control  cellular   processes, one must understand at a fundamental level what  viruses are  doing.  An integral part of this understanding process is the  study of the  spatial configuration of large flexible molecules.  For example,  the  3-dimensional shape of cellular DNA, RNA and proteins is  crucially  important to their biological function.  Cellular DNA is highly  twisted and  convoluted, and for information retrieval and cell viability,  some  geometric and topological features must be introduced, and others  quickly  removed.  Some enzymes maintain the proper geometry and topology  of DNA in  the cell by passing one strand of DNA through another via an  enzyme-bridged  transient break in the DNA; this enzyme action plays a crucial  role in cell  metabolism, including segregation of daughter chromosomes at the  termination of replication.  Other enzymes break the DNA apart  and  recombine the ends by exchanging them.  These enzymes regulate  the  expression of specific genes, mediate viral integration into and  excision  from the host genome, mediate transposition and repair of DNA,  and  generate antibody and genetic diversity.  These enzymes perform  incredible  feats of topology at the molecular level; the description and  quantization  of such enzyme action absolutely requires the language and  computational  machinery of topology."

The latter will in general transcend the region of conducting  fluid and, ideally, extend to all of space.  Typically, both the  interior and exterior magnetic fields must be determined and  suitably matched at the interface separating the fluid from the  solid material or vacuum outside.  Most prior mathematical work  has been concerned with special situations where boundary  conditions for the magnetic field (or related quantities) are  given on the surface of the fluid region and the exterior field  can be disregarded.  In the general case, little is known beyond  basic existence and uniqueness results.  Even if the problem can  be shown to be analytically well-posed, formidable difficulties  occur when trying to numerically approximate the solution.  Major  drawbacks include the unbounded support of the magnetic field and  the fact that it exhibits jump discontinuities across interfaces  separating media with different magnetic properties.  It is the  goal of the proposed research to develop general analytical and  numerical methods tailored for the rigorous treatment of  increasingly complex problems of this kind, in stationary as well  as time-dependent situations.  The numerical and computational  feasibility of the approach will be investigated and compared to  that of alternative procedures.  It will then be studied to what  extent the approach carries over to more complex situations  featuring many magnetically different media and nonsmooth  geometries.  At later stages, some extended models of MHD will be  considered, including non-Newtonian fluids, Hall current plasmas,  and thermally coupled flows.  Another long-term goal is the  analytical and numerical investigation of MHD problems involving  free boundaries.    Magnet ohydrodynamics (or MHD) is the theory of the macroscopic  interaction of electrically conducting fluids with a magnetic  field.  It is of importance in connection with many engineering  problems, such as sustained plasma confinement for controlled  thermonuclear fusion, liquid-metal cooling of nuclear reactors,  and electromagnetic casting of metals.  It also finds  applications in geophysics and astronomy, where prominent  examples are the so-called dynamo problem, that is, the question  of the origin of the Earth's magnetic field in its liquid metal  core, and the equilibrium and stability of magnetic stars in  their own gravitational fields.  The difficulties addressed by  this research are most pronounced in models describing typical  applications in engineering, such as the magnetic shaping of  liquid metals or induction manufacturing of specialized  materials, where one encounters fairly complicated geometries  with several conducting fluids and current-carrying solid  conductors interacting at a distance via the universal magnetic  field."

Part of the project will involve the study of turbulence, based  on a dynamical systems approach; according to dynamical systems  theory the permanent regime for a turbulent flow is  mathematically represented by an attractor that is a compact set  in the phase space.  It is hoped that the study of this attractor  can improve understanding of the physics of turbulent flows.    The approximation of attractors by smooth finite dimensional  manifolds called Approximate Inertial Manifolds (AIMs) is part of  this study.  On the one hand these manifolds are related to the  concept of slow manifold used in meteorology for data  assimilation.

Thus, it is believed that approximations  of this attractor can lead to efficient new algorithms for the  numerical simulation of turbulence.  Finally, a significant part  of the effort will be devoted to problems related to climate and  global changes.  Various models for climate will be investigated  from the mathematical and computational points of view in order  to see how they are connected and what are their domains of  validity.  Such models include the primitive equations of the  atmosphere, the primitive equations with vertical viscosity, and  the geostrophic and quasi geostrophic equations.  Models of this  type will be studied for the atmosphere and for the ocean  separately and also for the Coupled system of Atmosphere and  Ocean (CAO).     The understanding of the equations of fluid mechanics and  turbulence as well as the development of efficient numerical  codes for the solution of these equations are challenging  problems of considerable importance in p articular in industry or  for studies in meteorology or global climate change.  The aims  for this project are three fold: (i) to explore what can be  learned about these problems from the theoretical and  computational viewpoints, using the dynamical systems approach to  turbulence; (ii) to develop new efficient computational  algorithms taking into account the physics of turbulence and well  adapted to the current evolution of large scale computing towards  parallel computing; and (iii) to devote special attention to the  problems related to the study of climate and global changes."

The engineering demands for  ever higher performance, or even optimality, often require  completely new control designs since classical linearization  techniques for control design is often inadequate in such  situations. By employing techniques from various areas of pure  mathematics, such as differential geometry, major improvements in  exact linearization algorithms, with applications to nonlinear  autopilot design, for example, are expected."

The models come from biology and chemistry.   Several  important topics are addressed.  The first topic is to provide  mathematical existence proofs for traveling waves and standing  patterns for these models.  The methods of geometric singular  perturbations are used to ascertain these existence results.   Related  to this topic is the study of the stability and bifurcations of  these  waves and patterns.  Another project is devoted to developing a  predictive model of biofilms.  Some biofilms can serve beneficial  purposes, while others can cause extensive damage in the natural  or  industrial environment.  Understanding the processes and  interactions  occurring in these systems, and formulating conceptual and  mathematical models enable one to control biofilm processes, and  thus  reduce their negative effects or enhance their positive effects.       At present an understanding of wave propagation in  biological and  chemical contexts is quite limited, especially in comparison to  wave  phenomena in other physical systems (water waves, acoustic waves,  etc.).  One reason for this is that the equations are difficult  to  analyze.  These equations typically exhibit a number of different  time  scales, i.e., the systems are singularly perturbed.  Despite  these  difficulties, wave propagation in these systems is a very  important  phenomena.  By way of example, reentrant waves on myocardium are  thought to be the pattern of excitation responsible for  ventricular  tachycardia.  The investigator studies wave phenomena, motivated  by  several problems in biology and chemistry.  Of particular  interest is  biofilm modeling.  In the vernacular, a biofilm might be called  slime  or sludge.  Biofilms occur in nature without human interaction,  or can  artificially be introduced to industrial or natural systems.   Because  of their pervasive effects on water quality, power generation,  energy  eff iciency, and product quality, their negative effect is felt in  most  U.S. industries.  Biofilm processes can also offer distinct  process  advantages, including capacity for higher process throughput,  more  efficient separation/purification, and bioremediation of  hazardous  waste sites.  The potential of biofilm process control has yet  been  fully realized due in part to a lack of fundamental knowledge of  these  processes."

These processes include  complex pattern formation and growth problems in diffusion  dominated systems, and wave interactions on the ocean's free  surface.  Closely related are problems with singular or nearly  singular behavior, such as flows undergoing changes in  topological type, or water wave breaking.  The main objective of  this proposal is to investigate such problems in fluids and  materials by developing and applying state-of-the-art numerical  methods to large-scale computation, and understanding important  constituent processes through analysis and modelling.  All these  problems, while arising in quite disparate physical settings, are  strongly mediated by the presence of surface tension or energy,  and often share mathematical structure.    In this proposal, we bring together mathematical and numerical  analysis, modelling, and large-scale scientific computation to  study certain fundamental problems in fluid dynamics and  materials science. One such problem is understanding pattern  formation in diffusion dominated systems. This has important  implications in the production of metallic alloys.  The complex  patterns that are observed to form within the alloys during their  production, strongly affect the bulk properties of the resulting  alloys, such as their strength and toughness.  Other problems  involve the motions of free surfaces in fluid flows.  Two  important instances are the interactions of waves on the ocean's  surface, and the dynamics of flows undergoing changes in  topological type, say as characterized by the production of  bubbles through the mixing of two fluids.

In  particular, the mathematical objective is to establish  relationships between coherent structures, instability and  dynamics as pertains to the development of weakly-turbulent  behaviors in simple nonlinear systems. The basic strategy  involves both the identification of the primary structural modes,  and the determination of their dynamics and interaction  properties. A combination of asymptotic analysis, dynamical  systems methods and numerical computation are employed to obtain  clear illustrations of the mechanisms by which spatial structures  are created and sustained by nonlinearity. This, in turn,  provides an analytical basis leading to a physical understanding  for the underlying nonlinear phenomena.     A familiar example of  a spatio-temporal evolution is the video record of satellite  weather maps as often shown on the evening news. While the  imagery of spatial features that evolve over time is a common  theme for many physical and biological phenomena, our  quantitative understanding of these processes is actually quite  limited.

Spectral methods break  up  the boundary into smaller pieces, on which the functions are  approximated by polynomials of high degree.  Higher-degree  polynomials approximate the functions more accurately.  The use  of  polynomials allows for fast calculation of an approximate  solution.  For problems involving regions of complicated  geometry,  combining these ideas produces a computational method of  significant flexibility and accuracy.  The method is used to  calculate properties of fluid flow and transport in fibrous  porous  media.  Such problems arise throughout the chemical industry and  in  many fundamental biological contexts -- for example, in the pulp  and paper industry, and in the study of fluid circulation in  plants."

These problems arise from,  for example, fluid dynamics, rarefied gas dynamics, and phase  transitions.  The important physical quantities, such as mass,  momentum and energy, are governed by systems of nonlinear partial  differential equations.

The natural  domain for these problems is unbounded --- the exterior of the  scatterer.  This work will identify approximate reformulations of  the problem on a bounded domain which can be solved by Galerkin  methods, in particular the finite element method.  The general  idea is to truncate the unbounded domain through the selection of  an appropriate artificial boundary and a corresponding boundary  condition.  An exact boundary condition can be used, but its  non-local temporal and/or spatial dependence is an obstacle to  efficient numerical computations.  The primary objective of this  project is to find approximate boundary conditions which are  defined locally, can be implemented numerically, and yield  accurate approximations to the exact solution of the scattering  problem.  A major challenge will be to develop the mathematical  tools which can be used to balance the competing constraints of  computational complexity and the different approximation errors.    When an electromagnetic signal hits an obstacle, one portion of  the wave continues into the object while another part of the wave  is reflected back into the surrounding medium.  The goal of this  project is to devise accurate and efficient numerical algorithms  for determining the different components of the electromagnetic  wave.  The mathematical statement of this problem involves the  solution of partial differential equations on an unbounded  domain.  The fact that the domain is infinite complicates the  search for an efficient numerical solution of this problem.  The  purpose of this research is to identify approximate  reformulations of the problem which can be solved numerically  without significantly degrading the quality of the computed  solution.  Initial studies will be directed towards the  two-dimensional scalar problem.  The ulti mate objective is to be  able to solve the vector-valued problem in three-dimensional  space.

For this reason, the proposer will be developing codes which can  be used on high-performance parallel computers.

The investigation will concentrate on systems  governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Many feedback  control design methods yield a solution (i.e., an optimal  control) which is written in terms of a feedback operator and the  optimal state. For finite dimensional systems, this control can  also be written as a product of gains and states and decisions  regarding sensor design can be made using the form of the gains.  In many PDE control problems, the gain operator is a bounded  linear transformation between Hilbert spaces. Representation  theorems often can be applied to obtain an Rintegral  representationS of the gain operator that provides the basis for  numerical approximations and analysis.

Robust control designs will be used to  formulate the corresponding sensor design problem. The optimal  sensors/actuators for the PDE systems may be spatially  distributed, though one may wish to approximate the optimal  designs and implement a finite number of sensors and actuators.

The nodal lines are places on the membrane  where there is no excitation when the membrane is excited at  a natural frequency.  There are two major  parts to the  project.  The first is to obtain perturbation results for  the natural frequencies and mode shapes.  Since the  frequencies are not well spaced in higher dimensional  problems, small divisor problems must be solved. The second  major part of the project is related to the fact that nodal  domains (connected domains in the membrane defined by the  nodal lines) can be long, thin strips whose diameter is as  large as the diameter of the membrane.  What is required  then is to define approximate nodal domains whose diameter  goes to zero as the order of the eigenvalue goes to  infinity.       The goal of this research is to establish methods for  finding properties of vibrating systems from indirect  measurements, in particular, measurements of natural  frequencies and nodal lines.  The natural frequencies can be  determined by spectral analysis of impulse response data.  The nodal lines can be measured by directing a laser at the  vibrating surface when the membrane is excited at a natural  frequency.  The lines where the Doppler shift in the  backscatter is minimized are the nodal lines. From this data  the amplitudes of external forces on the membrane and an  expression for a (nonconstant) density of the membrane may  be determined from explicit formulas for these quantities.  These formulas are expected to be very useful for obtaining  efficient numerical algorithms to identify the quantities in  question.  ***"

Several key mathematical questions  will be investigated, each with substantial practical  implications: 1) global estimates for a linearized inverse  problem for the wave equation in the presence of caustics; 2) the  relation between nonsmooth propagation of singularities and  linearization; 3) design of objective functions to give  quasiconvex optimization formulations of inverse problems; and 4)  accommodation of attenuation and dispersion; for example, inverse  problems in viscoelasticity.

The goal is the development of techniques for determining the  eventual state of the system, whether it be of simple form,  steady-state or periodic, or even chaotic. The reduction of  complex systems is essential in forcing the arbitrarily  complicated behavior to be susceptible to analysis. The  separation of a system into fast and slow time scales affords a  reduction that is particularly attractive as the complexity of  the high-dimensional behavior is retained through the patching  together of fast and slow structures. Such a reduction forms the  context for much of Jones' proposed work.       In recent work with Burns, Jones has uncovered a mechanism  for the stabilization of surprising resonant motions involving  the slow variation of certain parameters. This has been applied  to explain the spin/orbit resonance of Mercury, and a general  theory is envisaged which will be adaptable to many other  problems of resonance, particularly in the context of planetary  motions. In physical systems with spatial dependence, information  is transported in a fixed direction by travelling waves. Jones  will further develop his techniques for determining the stability  of such waves, thus offering a discriminant to assess their  physical observability.  It is anticipated that the methods will  be extended to cover the case of optical pulses, which will help  in determining the feasible methods for  multiple pulse  transmission in nonlinear optical fibers. Nonlinear optics offers  a particularly fruitful area of application as optical processes  occur on a very fast time scale. The transition between different  phases of materials, the sharpness of which reflects a fast  spatial scale, can occur in exotic patterns. Techniques will be  developed, based on the stability theory for travelling waves,  for determining the underlying mechanisms for such pattern  format ion."

Both theoretical and  computational issues are addressed.  The theoretical objective is  to make a significant impact on the traditional perturbation  theory for stochastic matrices and Markov chains. One goal is to  completely describe the nature and characteristic features of  sensitive Markov chains and to build a clear and concise theory  of perturbations in the eigensystems of stochastic matrices. This  perturbation theory will be used to better understand the  convergence and stability properties of a variety of multilevel  algorithms for computing stationary probabilities.  The  computational aspect is concerned with the numerical  determination of stationary probabilities associated with  large-scale irreducible Markov chains with special emphasis on  those which are nearly uncoupled (systems comprised of a  collection of loosely coupled subsystems).  The focus is on the  development, implementation, and analysis of  aggregation/disaggregation algorithms.  Both iterative and exact  aggregation/disaggregation methods are to be considered along  with some hybrid A/D techniques.       This research focuses on the analysis of stochastic matrices  and associated Markov chains concepts. Markov chain techniques  constitute a unifying theme and are the basis for an extremely  wide variety of mathematical models which are used to describe,  predict, and analyze the dynamics of large evolutionary systems.  Markov chain models are fundamental mathematical tools in areas  as diverse as engineering, economics, physical science, and  social science. In particular, analyzing and computing stationary  probabilities associated with large scale Markov chains is a  primary concern in problems involving queueing models and  networks, telecommunications, computer performance evaluation,  economic modeling and forecasting, manufacturing systems  modeling, and more generally in applications  where stochastic  models are used to understand the behavior of systems that evolve  with time. This project emphasizes both computational and  theoretical issues, and special attention is devoted to the  analysis of nearly uncoupled problems (systems comprised of a  collection of loosely coupled subsystems). The following specific  research topics are to be investigated:  (1) As they evolve with  time, many physical systems eventually settle down into some sort  of steady state.  If the physical system is modeled by utilizing  the theory of Markov chains, then the steady state nature of the  system is characterized by a set of probabilities called  ""stationary probabilities.""  Consequently, analyzing the behavior  of the stationary probabilities is a fundamental issue. The  theoretical component of this research involves studying the  stability properties of stationary probabilities. The results of  this research should clarify the understanding of the mechanisms  which contribute to either the stability (or instability) of the  underlying physical system being examined.  (2) The computational  facet of this project is to develop new algorithms for computing  stationary probabilities and to develop new methods by means of  which such algorithms can be analyzed. In practical applications  such as those mentioned above, it is usually the case that the  physical system under question involves an extremely large number  of components, but these components can often be grouped into  clusters for which there is strong interaction within any given  cluster but weaker interaction among the clusters themselves  (e.g., consider the economy of the United States).  This research  effort devotes special attention to analyzing and computing the  stability and steady state nature of such systems.  Mathematically, this involves computing and analyzing the  stationary probabilities of such systems.

The main object of this  project is to give a careful mathematical analysis of a theory  due to E.N. Parker which claims that coronal heating is primarily  due to the formation of certain violent disruptions in the suns  magnetic field (the formation of current sheets) associated with  solar flares. Due to the relationship with sun spots and solar  flares the issue of coronal heating is directly tied to the  practical issues of variations in the earth's climate and  electromagnetic interference. The main focus of the analysis will  be the study of tube like loops of magnetic field lines with ends  anchored in the suns surface or photosphere. It is proposed that  current sheets form when the ends of such a tube are twisted more  than a certain critical amount.       In attempting to understand the phenomenon of current sheet  formation in Parker's model of coronal heating, the equations of  ideal 3D magnetohydrodynamics will studied in an open flux tube  geometry. Existence of solutions will be considered subject to  prescription of the twist in the magnetic field lines from one  end of the tube to the other. It is conjectured that smooth  solutions will exist up to a certain critical twist, at which  point current sheets will form i.e. the curl of the magnetic  field (the current) will become a singular measure, the singular  part supported on a set of finite two dimensional measure. The  transition from subcritical to critical values of the twist is  conjectured to correspond to a critical exponent in a geometric  type of Sobolev inequality linked to the topology of the field  line structure. The main emphasis will be placed on the constant  pressure or force free case of ideal MHD. Existence of solutions  will be studied through the use of an  iteration scheme which  avoids the lack on compactness inherent in many variational  approaches to the problem."

Because such patterns often  exhibit a high degree of symmetry the techniques employed in the study  are designed to take full advantage of such symmetries. In practical  applications these symmetries are usually not exact. Therefore a  particular emphasis of the proposed work is to study the effects of  small symmetry-breaking ``imperfections'' in the system. The proposed  work is thus designed to make symmetry-based techniques applicable to  realistic systems. The proposal focuses on the effects of distant  endwalls on patterns in the form of propagating waves, patterns of  oscillations in acoustically excited spherical bubbles and the  formation of three-dimensional patterns in morphogenesis.    This is a proposal to study bifurcations and pattern formation in  systems with symmetry. Such systems occur naturally in a variety of  applications. The proposal focuses on pattern formation near onset. In  this regime the process is described by amplitude equations. In  symmetric systems these must respect the assumed symmetries. The  resulting equations enable one to compute not only the possible  patterns but also their relative stability. The proposal focuses on  extending this approach to three-dimensional patterns (such as those  created by the Turing instability or the modes of oscillation of an  acoustically excited bubble). In addition in order to make the  technique applicable to realistic systems in which the assumed  symmetries are usually only approximate the proposal emphasizes the  study of small externally imposed symmetry-breaking imperfections.  Such imperfections may have important  qualitative consequences and  may be responsible for the introduction of chaotic dynamics into  systems that would otherwise be nonchaotic.  ***"

Comparisons of these results with an exact crack-line solution  for Mode III, and with detailed numerical finite element  solutions, show that their radius of validity is so small as to  render them physically inapplicable. A new analytical approach is  proposed that avoids the overly restrictive separability  assumption. The approach combines asymptotic analysis of the  governing equations in distance r from the crack tip with a  singular perturbation analysis in the crack Mach number (crack  growth speed/elastic shear wave speed) that utilizes coordinate  straining. Since the approach thus builds on quasi-static crack  growth solutions, it will make use of the recently-derived   analytical family of plane strain near-tip solutions, and also  their analytical extension to very large regions of validity,  obtained by the proposer. While the research proposed involves  analyzing one of the simplest physically realistic  elastic-plastic material models for initial study, it is  anticipated that the work will provide a new mathematical tool  for deriving analytical solutions for dynamic elastic-plastic  crack growth in more sophisticated materials models also         The proposed research seeks to develop analytical solutions,  valid over a physically significant size scale, for the stress  and deformation fields near the tip of a rapidly propagating  crack in elastic-plastic materials such as ductile metals. More  generally, we seek to develop mathematical methods for finding   such solutions for rapid crack growth in general material types.  These solutions will provide a fundamental understanding of how  the material near a rapidly propagating crack tip behaves , and  since this near-tip material region controls whether and how the  crack will grow, the solutions sought will serve as the basis for  analytical crack growth and stability criteria. We seek to   predict, among other things, how the material's resistance to  crack growth is affected by crack propagation speed. Dynamic  fracture can occur when a cracked structural component is loaded  beyond the stability level, or when it is subjected to impact  loading, or when it experiences a thermal shock.  Predictions of  the ensuing rapid crack growth, facilitated by the results  anticipated from this research, are crucial for accurate design  and safety assessments."

These  trajectories will consist of a sequence of slow and fast stretches  following one another, and may be responsible for irregular behavior  of nearby trajectories, and thus of the mechanical systems under  investigation. One such system describes irregular beats in the  amplitudes of two coupled mathematical pendula. The second class of  physical systems under investigation is laser optics. The proposed  research will investigate the occurrence of irregular dynamics of  soliton-like optical pulses in the Maxwell-Bloch partial differential  equations describing ring lasers. These dynamics will result in  intermittent blinking, on a very short time scale, of the laser  output. Both analytical and computational methods will be used in the  course of this research.    This proposal describes intended research in two problem areas  concerning near-integrable dynamical systems. The first proposed area  concerns multi-bump orbits homoclinic to resonance bands. The work  proposed here will utilize  the Melnikov method, geometric singular  perturbation theory, and the exchange lemma to describe new classes of  such orbits as well as new techniques that can be used to find these  orbits in concrete physical problems. Multi-bump orbits homoclinic to  resonance bands consist of a succession of fast bumps interspersed  with segments on which trajectories move very slowly in time.

The main  approach is to use singular perturbation methods to derive reduced equations  which capture essential nonlinear phenomena in their simplest form. These  reduced equations are then studied using modern analytical and numerical  methods. Specific problems include the transition from regular to irregular  reflection in weak shock reflection, nonlinear waves in random media, and  nonlinear waves in classical field theories.        Many kinds of waves --- such as sound waves, elastic waves, and  magnetohydrodynamic waves --- are described by hyperbolic partial differential  equations. At large enough amplitudes, these waves are nonlinear. The effects  of nonlinearity are often dramatic and are qualitatively different from the  predictions of a linear theory. For example, nonlinearity leads to the  formation of shocks, or sometimes to other kinds of singularities, and to  various kinds of nonlinear instabilities. This proposal concerns a wide  variety of physical problems involving nonlinear hyperbolic waves. The  problems include the reflection of shock waves, the propagation of large  amplitude sound waves through turbulent fluids, and the analysis of  orientation waves in a massive liquid crystal director field."

Beyond its initial use in medical imaging, it has found a growing  number of scientific and industrial applications.  Ordinary  tomography is not local; the standard formulas for reconstruction  at a single point require measurements at all lines within some  plane containing the point.  Local tomography produces the  reconstruction of a linear combination of functions related to f.       This reconstruction is local; for reconstruction at a point,  attenuation measurements are needed only along lines very close  to that point.  This makes it possible to reconstruct a region of  interest within a large object without having to scan the whole  object.       The term computed tomography describes a class of methods  for imaging the interior of opaque objects.  Characteristic of  these methods is that the image is computed from a large number  of indirect measurements.  Mathematically, the image represents  some density function, and the  measurements are  line integrals  of this function.  A well-known example is CAT scans.  Here the  density function is the x-ray absorption coefficient, and the  measurements are obtained by recording the attenuation of thin  x-ray beams traversing the patient.  Beyond its original  application in medical imaging, computed tomography has found a  growing number of scientific and industrial applications.  The  research involves applications of tomography in areas such as  medical imaging (imaging the coronary arterial tree), biological  research (imaging the fine structure of tissue using the emerging  technology of high-resolution Micro-CT scanners), and quantum  optics.   Part of this research project concerns the technique of  `local tomography'.  While ordinary tomography requires scanning  the whole object, local tomography allows for scanning only a  region of interest.  Local tomography is of practical interest  sin ce it requires less expensive scanning equipment, reduces  x-ray exposure, and makes it possible to image objects too large  to be scanned in their entirety.  At present, local tomography  allows one to identify the shapes of different features, but does  not produce the correct density differences.  The goal is to  develop a method which allows reconstruction of density  differences.  This will further increase the usefulness of local  tomography for many applications. Furthermore, questions of  optimal sampling, resolution, and reconstruction algorithms in  three-dimensional local tomography will be investigated in  collaboration with researchers at the Mayo Clinic, who are  building a high-resolution Micro-CT scanner.  The second part of  this research continues work in Shannon sampling theory and its  application to computed tomography.  Shannon sampling theory is  of fundamental importance in signal processing.  The aliasing  error for sampling non-bandlimited functions on non-equidistant  but periodic sampling sets will be investigated, and more general  classes of sampling sets will be studied.

The solutions to such a system are  discontinuous, and, being not uniquely determined by their  initial data, are selected via the so-called entropy criterion.  While the entropy criterion is treated in the literature as an  extra condition that is checked afterwards, the P.I. developed  approaches where the entropy criterion plays the very central  role in analyzing the properties of a scheme, or in the  derivation of the scheme itself. The emphasis here will be on  establishing the entropy criterion and the nonlinear stability of  high order accurate schemes for multidimensional systems of  conservation laws.  This work is aimed at clarifying the role of  the so-called entropy criterion for the numerical approximation  of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The P.I. developed  new methods of analysis and numerical analysis, and established  that several numerical schemes are consistent with the entropy  criterion. Such a result guarantees that a method is nonlinearly  stable, and produces the physically meaningful discontinuous  solutions. The techniques also provide new insight on the schemes  used for shock wave calculations, and suggest possible  improvements. The focus here will be on developing flux-splitting  methods, second-order Godunov-type schemes, and truly  multidimensional schemes for systems of conservation laws. The  analysis will include concept such as: entropy dissipation  estimates, tracking of monotonicity regions, the compensated  compactness method, the measure-valued solutions, etc. Further  insight about the nonlinear stability will be obtained by  considering the issue of uniqueness and continuous dependence  with respect to the initial condition."

More specifically, I propose  to work in two different directions: (1) Dynamics of coupled  relaxation oscillators and (2) Persistence of invariant sets in  Hamiltonian systems.  The first of these directions aims at  understanding what happens when simple oscillators are coupled  together. Systems of this kind arise in numerous physical settings,  particularly in biology and electric circuits.  While an individual  oscillator behaves in a simple and predictable way, several such  simple ""cells"" put together can behave in a totally unexpected and  mysterious way. I propose to study the ""anatomy"" of this interaction  of simple ""cells"" which produces complex and rich behavior of the  ""organism"".  The second topic, in contrast to the first,  deals with  Hamiltonian systems which model many situation where energy  dissipation can be neglected, such as motion of particles in particle  accelerators, geometric optics and celestial mechanics. There are  still deep fundamental unanswered questions in the theory of such  systems due to their richness and complexity, although remarkable  progress has been made in the 1960s (the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser  theory) and in 1980's (the Aubry-Mather theory). It is proposed to  address some of these questions on a particular class of systems  (first introduced by Hedlund) which is more tractable than the general  case on the one hand, but is sufficiently rich to give new insights  and hints on the other.    Two research directions are proposed: first, the dynamics of coupled  relaxation oscillators, and second, persistence of invariant sets in  Hamiltonian systems.  In the first of these areas I propose to develop  qualitative theory of coupled relaxation oscillators, extending the  classical work of Cartwright--Littlewood as well as the more recent  work  on periodically forced relaxation oscillators.  In the last  couple of years two int eresting phenomena were discovered in this  area, and I hope that there are more to be found.  The second of the  two directions deals with understanding the behavior of invariant  sets in symplectic maps of R^4 under strong perturbations from the  integrable case. I plan   to consider a special class of systems,  namely, geodesic flows on a 3D torus with a particular kind of  Riemannian metric introduced by Hedlund. This is sufficiently simple  to be tractable on the one hand and yet sufficiently nontrivial to  give insight into the general situation."

The equations describing such  problems are then said to be `equivariant' with respect to this  symmetry group.  The focus of this project is to continue to  study systematic techniques for exploiting symmetry in the  numerical solution of such equivariant equations.  This  exploitation leads to more stable solution methods and to a  greatly increased numerical efficiency.  One of the methods  studied by the investigators (the symmetry reduction method) can  be viewed as a generalization of Fourier Transform methods (which  exploit symmetry under a cyclic group).  Among other projects,  the investigators further develop the symmetry reduction method  and study hidden symmetries, optimal equivariant preconditioners  for problems that are only `nearly'equivariant, domain reduction  via symmetries, the numerical solution of nonlinear equivariant  equations and bifurcation phenomena.  Preliminary numerical codes  are further developed into a collection of codes for a range of  important applications.         Geometric symmetries have always played an important role in  theoretical physics and some branches of applied mathematics.  However, exploiting these symmetries has only lately been  developed in the areas of numerical analysis and computational  mathematics.  The aim of this project is to use geometric and  algebraic techniques to give efficient algorithms for solving  large numerical problems that enjoy such symmetries.  Very large  problems are broken down (via symmetry considerations) into  smaller problems that can be handled independently and more  efficiently on modern architectures of high-performance  computing. Problems that are only `nearly' equivariant (i.e.,  where certain symmetry structures have imperfections) occur quite  frequently in engineering (e.g., in elasticity or flow problems,  or in structural mechanics).  An efficient exploitation of these  imperfect sym metries would reduce the computational effort for  solving such problems.  This has two direct benefits: firstly,  one can solve moderately sized problems much faster, possibly in  real time; secondly, very large problems that are inaccessible  via standard methods can be solved with this symmetry reduction  method."

Sensitive criteria in MDP's permit adjustments for the underselectiveness of the average per unit time reward criterion in cases where initial stages are important and they also provide deeper insight into the nature of optimality conditions and equations. Up to now, sensitive criteria have been studied only for MDP's with finite or countable state spaces. Models with a continuous state space are more relevant in many applications, for instance, when there are incomplete observations. The purpose of the proposed research is to extend the theory of sensitive criteria to MDP's with a Borel state space. First of all models with an absolutely continuous transition function will be studied. For such models, we expect to obtain (by means of limit theorems for general state space Markov chains, Laurent expansions of resolvents, and, especially, new techniques for aggregation and compactification of the set of feedback controls) the following results: 1)validity of the lexicographical optimality equation, 2) existence of deterministic stationary sensitively optimal policies, and 3) effectiveness of a lexicographical policy improvement algorithm to get such a policy. Markov Decision Processes provide important tools for the analysis of many control and management optimization problems in which randomness plays a significant role. They are often used to optimize an operation's resource allocations among competing requirements (for example, inventory costs in maintaining a certain number of spare parts for a system versus down time costs for the system versus costs of repairing defective parts of the system in a given amount of time). In many of these problems, the long-run average cost (or reward) is the natural objective function to optimize. However, long-run average criteria are in sensitive to costs or rewards associated with initial stages, which, under certain circumstances, can lead to nonoptimal policies. Sensitive criteria have only been successfully analyzed for the case when the possible states of the system are finite or countable. There are many realistic situations, however, when the appropriate state space is a continuum, for example, when incomplete observations are involved, which is often the case. It is the purpose of this research to extend the theory of sensitive criteria to Markov Decision Processes with Borel state spaces (which are general enough to include all known situations of importance)."

It has been shown recently that wavelets are useful as activation functions in neural networks, permitting faster adaptation to required tasks than do sigmoidal activation functions, in common use up to now. The success of wavelet methods has already been impressively demonstrated in important optimization problems using radial basis functions. The work of this project develops better theoretical underpinnings for the construction of neural nets that learn efficiently, and studies minimal complexities of neural nets that emulate ""intelligent"" tasks, e.g., recognition of visual images. The investigators also study the construction of wavelet-based algorithms for image compression. They examine the optimization of signal compression, aiming at an improved theoretical understanding of how such signal compression works from the standpoint of the mapping between functions and their wavelet transforms. Applications of the mathematics proposed here are closely related to the creation of ""intelligent"" systems using neural network technology. This technology in many ways emulates the operation of biological nervous systems. The present work is based on indications that the actions of biological neurons have in some cases been too well emulated in artificial neural systems. It has been shown in the work of Girosi and Poggio and others that attaining desired behavior in neural networks can be better achieved with networks that have ""localized activation functions,"" i.e., ones for which output eventually decreases with very large inputs. An additional issue related to effecting proper input-output behavior using neural networks is knowledge of the basic complexity of certain desired tasks, and how neural networks can best achieve this level of complexity. Such tasks (e.g., the visual recognition of object s) can already be performed by biological neural networks, and have a complexity that can be defined and studied in a relatively precise way, to determine how complicated artificial neural networks need to be in order to emulate the behaviors of the biological networks. In addition, the work on signal compression using wavelets has a two-fold impact. The first involves the improvement of techniques for compression, e.g., storage of large quantities of video, audio or other data on compact media (such as compact discs, hard disks, or random access memory). The second is related to the fact that if such data are compressed to smaller sizes, certain kinds of information may be extracted from them more easily. For example, it is easier to find evidence of an irregular heartbeat (or precursors to arhythmia) using a computer if the cardiological data have been compressed in a way that allows them to be more easily manipulated. These and other applications have made the data compression issues that are studied here an area with high priority in mathematical signal processing."
