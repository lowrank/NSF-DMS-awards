For the linear material                       models, the principle interest is dynamic crack growth with                     emphasis given to boundary value problems relevant to                           composites.  The focus of this effort is toward obtaining                       analytical solutions to initial/boundary value problems                         incorporating a crack-tip-failure-zone into the model; the                      fracture criterion utilized is based upon the work input to                     this failure zone.  Various crack-tip constitutive models are                   studied.                                                                            For the nonlinear material models, the principal focus is                   on finite element methods for analyzing crack growth.                           Initially, quasi-static crack growth and small strains is                       assumed, the nonlinearity entering through the constitutive                     equations.  Subsequently, dynamic effects and geometric                         nonlinearity will be considered.  The principal goal of this                    work is the development of finite element simulations for                       growing cracks in nonlinear viscoelastic material utilizing a                   fracture criterion based upon incorporation of a                                crack-tip-failure-zone into the model.  Again, various                          crack-tip constitutive models will be studied."

In addition,                   they plan to establish the well-posedness of several models for                 reservoir simulation, including their derivation via                            homogenization techniques and the study of their regularity                     properties.

The error of the approximate solution lies within the                           theoretical bound for the global error, yet the cost of                         computation is proportional only to the number of unknowns in                   the discretized equations.  Until recently, most of the                         research in this area concentrated primarily on nested                          conforming finite element spaces.  However, nonconforming                       finite elements are often used in applications because they are                 easier to program.                                                                  In previous work, results on full W-cycle multigrid                         convergence for nonconforming finite elememts have been                         obtained by the principal investigator in the study of P1                       nonconforming finite element applied to the Poisson equation                    and the Morley finite element applied to the biharmonic                         equation on polygonal domains.  In this project, these results                  will be applied to the stationary Stokes equations and extended                 to domains with smooth boundary.  Multigrid algorithms will be                  developed for nonconforming methods in linear elasticity and                    plate bending and also for mixed  methods that are equivalent                   to nonconforming methods.  The convergence of V-cycle                           nonconforming methods will be investigated.  Numerical                          experiments will be performed for each of these problems."

The theoretical aspects of this project may be considered as                    applied analysis and efficiency in computations and                             implementation is emphasized in the applications.  One of the                   problems addressed is to determine the approximation power of a                 multivariate spline space.  Once it is known, the next step is                  to identify a much lower dimensional subspace with the same                     approximation power so that specific features of this subspace                  can be used to efficiently construct approximates with optimal                  order of approximation.  Another problem is to develop                          efficient schemes that guarantee the optimal order of                           approximation.  Since interpolation is sometimes expensive to                   attain, and in some situations may not even be desirable, it is                 also important to study the constrution of quasi-interpolants.                  Recently the investigators have characterized all                               quasi-interpolants induced by a compactly supported function to                 gridded data.  From this, one should be able to study                           quasi-interpolants with ""minimum support"".  For scattered data,                 the problem will be approached via vertex splines.  One of the                  most important applications of multivariate splines is the                      construction of approximants that have certain shape preserving                 characteristics.  Part of this project is to apply the theory                   developed during the previous project to investigate the                        implications of that approach to shape preserving problems.                     Finally, the basic problems on dimension and construction of                    local bases of the important subspaces will be investigated                     further."

More specifically                         Mischaikow is concerned with deriving algebraic invariants                      which describe invariant set, determining how they can change                   through bifurcations, and determining which geometric                           structures are imposed on the invariant sets by the algebraic                   invariants.  The guiding philosophy in this development comes                   from the fact that many differential equations that arise as                    models of biological, chemical, or physical systems share the                   following three characteristics:   (1) they are derived from                    idealized descriptions of complicated phenomena, (2) they are                   parameterized systems and the exact values of the parameters                    are not known,  and (3) they are non-linear.  Thus, from an                     applied point of view describing the global and robust                          structures of the solutions to these differential equations is                  of great importance.                                                                 Mischaikow's research makes extensive use of the Conley                    index and, in particular, of a relatively new tool called the                   connection matrix."

Three areas will be                              considered. (i) The effects of small time delays on                             stabilizing controls for systems described by hyperbolic                        partial differential equations. (ii) The robustness of                          the stability of viscoelastic systems in the presence of                        time delays vis a vis elastic systems.  The former                              appear, in some cases, to be less sensitive than the                            latter when time delays are introduced into their                               damping.  Hence viscoelastic systems may serve as more                          suitable models for flexible structures than elastic                            systems. (iii) A reexamination of controllability and                           stabilizability for elastic systems with a view to                              considering ""approximate"" definitions of these concepts                         which are robust with respect to perturbations involving                        time delays."

A procedure is introduced and will be                    examined in light of efficiency and applicability for finding                   all the isolated zeros of deficient polynomial systems which                    need to be solved repetitively with varying coefficients. The                   procedure is based on the cheater's homotopy, a continuation                    method which follows paths to all solutions.  All solutions are                 found with an amount of computational work roughly proportional                 to the actual number of solutions, while previous general                       methods normally require an amount of computation roughly                       proportional to the total degree.                                                                                                                               The research will further investigate the structure of the                      deficiency on a case-by-case basis.  The main concern is, in a                  specific case, to find an initial polynomial system for the                     homotopy that is simple to solve and also produces few                          extraneous homotopy paths."

There are many applications for the theoretical                            developments described above.  For instance, the control of                     robot arms and the reduction of damaging oscillations in large                  flexible structures on Earth or in orbit, are examples of                       practical benefits resulting from this work."

It is one place where both the                        mathematics and the biological experiments are tractable .. all                 of the needed coefficients are measurable in the laboratory.  The               basic model does not allow for the delay between nutrient uptake                and reproduction (cell division).  A model which does allow for a               delay does so in a way which tries to capture the complicated                   physiology involved in a single constant.  This project will                    develop new mathematical methods wich incorporate the cell cycle                (or cell growth) and will analyze their behavior.  The models                   will be either functional differential equations (cell cycle) or                partial differential equations (cell growth).  Another                          modification of interest is to remove the well stirred hypothesis               of the chemostat and let the nutrient and the cells move by                     diffusion or convection .. resulting a reaction diffusion                       equation or (in the discretization) a gradostat.

Singular perturbation methods will               be employed.  Equations of this type arise in a number of                       applications such as optics, physiology and mathematical biology.                    Considerable progress has been made on these equations.                    Emphasis will be placed on understanding the dynamics of                        solutions having prescribed values given over an interval.  A                   particular instance would be to give conditions for the existence               of slowly varying solutions.

Work on inverse scattering continues efforts to study higher               dimensional problems by means of a new approach derived from                    methods of several complex variables: the d-bar method.  Although               this approach has had considerable formal success in two space                  dimensions and some success in higher dimensions, very few                      problems have been analyzed rigorously.  In particular, work will               be done on problems with large potentials or with general                       singular scattering data.                                                            Recent analyses of the d-bar-Neumann problem associated to                 domains in a complex manifold have shown that the corresponding                 trace of the heat kernel (for the heat equation) has a small time               asymptotic, expansion whose coefficients are integrals of local                 geometric invariants, including the logarithmic terms.  Very                    little is known about these invariants beyond some general                      results about their form and degree of homogeneity.  Work will                  continue in efforts to elicit more concrete information.                             New proofs of the boundedness of the Cauchy integral and                   other singular integral using special bases has opened up areas                 of exploration both in operator theory and numerical analysis.                  Using basic Littlewood-Paley theory, one can translate the T(1)                 theorem of David and Journe into an effective numerical tool.                   This powerful result establishes the boundedness of a singular                  operator solely through its action on the constant functions.                   Work will be done in representing integral operators in wavelet                 bases as matrices which decay rapidly off the diagonal.  These                  techniques can be shown to produce considerable reduction in                    complexity in the discrete approximation to the operators.  A                   wide range of applicability of these ideas to signal and image                  processing is expected as a consequence of this research.                            Other work will focus on relationships between the Cauchy                  integral, analytic capacity and rectifiable sets.  Work directed                at characterizing rectifiable curves has led to new insights into               the traveling salesman problem.  Further applications will be                   considered relative to the problem of estimating the integral of                the derivative of a conformal mapping and on determining the                    relationship between analytic capacity and Favard length of                     compact planar sets.

The mathematics                    involves matrix-valued functions on planar regions such as the                  disc. Among these there is a particularly well-behaved class of                 functions called analytic. Best-approximation of more or less                   arbitrary functions by analytic ones, and finding analytic                      functions that take on prescribed values at prescribed points in                the region are problems that turn out to be important in the                    design of feedback stabilized control systems. By applying                      methods of functional analysis and operator theory, Helton seeks                efficient ways of solving problems like these.                                       Helton's point of view is that commutant lifting in operator               theory is nearly equivalent to interpolation theory for matrix-                 valued functions. He will seek to develop a nonlinear commutant                 lifting theory, and to link it with the existing theory of                      nonlinear control systems. He will investigate qualitative and                  numerical aspects of optimization over spaces of analytic                       functions; computational experiment and theoretical insight will                support one another mutually in this part of the project.                       A further aspect of the work involves matrix completion, filling                in the entries of a partially specified matrix so as to make the                result have a particular property such as positivity. Throughout,               Helton will keep in view applications to optimal control and                    worst case design in the frequency domain."

The principal investigator plans to develop this theory                    further for a number of applications.  These include (1) the                    classical plane Couette flow which is linearly stable; (2) free                 stream disturbances and the problem of boundary layer                           receptivity; (3) compressible boundary layers; and (4) unbounded                flows with inflectional profiles such as wakes and shear layers."

In previous work it was shown that in games with                  Lipschitz continuous value, the directional derivates satisfy                   certain inequalities.  In the proposed research it will be                      shown that given a Lipschitz continuous function that satisfies                 these inequalities and the same boundary conditions as the                      value, one can obtain optimal strategies, in cases where they                   exist, by considering the values of the control variable at                     which the inequalities are achieved.  In cases where optimal                    strategies do not exist, near-optimal strategies will be                        obtained.  A method for constructing such a function in many                    cases will be given.  A method for determining the value                        function by a backward recursive solution of the inequalities                   will also be developed.  Computational feasibility, proof of                    convergence and estimates of the rate of convergence will also                  be considered.  Since the value function is a viscosity                         solution of the Isaacs equation, the adaptability to the                        problem at hand of numerical techniques for finding approximate                 viscosity solutions of first order partial differential                         equations will be investigated.  Another method of                              approximating solutions that will be investigated is that of                    approximating the continuous time game by a sequence of                         infinite multi-move games corresponding to discretization of                    the time interval.  The convergence of the solutions of these                   multi-move games to the solutions of the continous time game                    will be established and estimates of the rate of convergence                    will be obtained.

The parametric problem is lifted to an ordered field                  containing an infinitesimal to obtain a single problem, the                     original algorithm is run in the new ordered field, and the                     solution is lowered to the original field to obtain a short                     path of solutions to the parametric problems; this sequence is                  referred to as a lift, solve, and lower.  To see that the two                   avenues are related we note that piecewise affine homotopy                      methods regularly employ infinitesimals and can be used to                      solve parametric problems, and the lift, solve, and lower                       sequence applies to piecewise affine homotopy methods.                               Specific tasks and projects to be studied under these                      headings include variable dimension algorithms for infinite                     dimensional problems, parametric linear programs, average                       analysis of homotopy and simplex methods, matrix scaling,                       design centering, computing dynamic curves, various aspects of                  computing in ordered fields and problem characterization,                       transfer principles in ordered fields, a compiler for                           algorithms computing with an infinitesimal, solution and                        combinatorial analysis of economic models, and parametric                       production problems."

The basic aim of statistical mechanics                  is to obtain the large scale thermodynamic behavior of a many                   particle system from a knowledge of the microscopic interaction                 between the particles.  The thermodynamic behavior is described                 as a function of a few parameters such as temperature and                       destiny.                                                                             The principal investigator will study a classical gas with                 short range interaction at high temperature.  He plans to show                  that at a sufficiently high temperature there is no phase                       transition.  The main task is to study the high density system                  and show that it is approximately gaussian.                                          He will also study ground state energies of systems with                   long range Coulomb interaction.  These systems are particularly                 important since the electromagnetic Coulomb force is ubiquitous                 in nature.  For a system of charged Bosons in a jellium                         background, he wants to show that the thermodynamic limit of                    the ground state energy per particle is, at high densities,                     given precisely by a formula of Foldy.  This would show that                    the Bogoliubov ansatz, which is widely used in heuristic                        theories of superfluidity and superconductivity, is valid in a                  certain case."

The first objective is to prove injectivity and                     support theorems for generalized Radon transforms in the setting                of real analytic measures on real analytic submanifolds, possibly               in the presence of a group action. Such results for classical                   Radon transforms have been extremely useful for group                           representations, partial differential equations, and tomography.

The gist of the mathematics in this project is as follows.                 Take a manifold (surface, solid, or higher-dimensional analogue)                and a function defined on it. Suppose the manifold is sliced up                 in some fashion and the average of the function over each slice                 is known. The problem is to reconstruct the original function. A                good example is the function that gives the density at each point               of a solid body whose inside is not directly accessible. X-ray                  images give average densities along lines in the direction of the               beam. Tomography is the science of deducing densities inside the                object from an economical number of these images."

Instances of                  such functions are integrable and bounded data fitting, and                     penalty functions for nonlinear programming.  The general                       approach is to use a trust-region framework, and iterative                      methods, in the spirit of gradient projection methods, to solve                 the subproblem at each iteration.  It is intended that the                      algorithms will be most suitable for nonlinear problems in which                the constraints are partially separable (i.e. the contraint                     derivative matrix has a block-diagonal structure).  Important                   examples of such problems include constrained discrete optimal                  control, and multicommodity network flow.  Particular attention                 will be given to implementation of the algorithms on parallel                   computer architectures.                                                              Iterative solution methods for large-scale linear                          programming problems will also be investigated.  These methods,                 which use as a framework some well-established techniques for                   general constrained optimization, have the advantage that                       factorization of the constraint matrix is never required.                       Instead, iterative methods (such as successive over-relaxation or               a gradient projection/conjugate gradient technique) are used to                 solve the convex quadratic programming subproblems at each                      iteration.  Implementation of these various algorithms on                       vector/parallel processors will be carried out, to determine both               the effectiveness of the underlying approach, and the extent to                 which computer architectures can be utilized."

Often                the differing time scales make it necessary to solve very large                 systems of mildly nonlinear equations, which is possible only                   with methods derived from iterative linear equation solvers.  The               objective of this research is the application of new iterative                  method techniques to transient problems, stressing the                          implementation on parallel computers.  Two approaches are                       considered here, one to solve a set of implicit difference                      equations that are usually nonlinear, and the other to develop                  methods of the waveform type, which is iteration applied to a                   functional formulation of the transient problem.  The methods to                be employed consist of the analysis and algorithms developed for                both initial value problems and for the iterative solution of                   linear algebraic equations.  Large scale problems are of                        particular interest, and require, especially for 3D simulations,                iterative methods on new processors.  This work emphasizes the                  use of currently developed software technology for immediate use                in the scientific and engineering communities.

One example of the                     former is to determine the location of the water/ice interface                  in a region where the temperature on the boundary of the region                 is specified so as to be subcritical in some locations and                      supercritical in others.  Inverse problems arise, for instance,                 in the attempt to locate the heat source inside an object by                    measuring the temperature and heat flux at the surface.

This project examines questions                   of existence and unicity of solutions and seeks to provide a                    better understanding of this class of differential equations."

The three ideas                 are largely independent.  Part A concerns the development of an                 effective method to determine whether or not a particular                       solution of an evolution equation is stable to small changes in                 initial data.  Stability theory advanced significantly after                    the discovery by Arnol'd (1965) and others of a systematic                      method to construct Lyapunov functionals.  Even so, the methods                 currently available are unable to determine whether a flow as                   simple as stably statified, paralled shear flow is a stable                     solution of Euler's equations in two dimensions.  One goal is                   to devise a generalization of current methods that might settle                 the question.                                                                                                                                                      The focus in part B is on the Kadomstev-Peviashvili (KP)                     equation with periodic boundary conditions.  The equation is                    known to be completely integrable, so there is reason to                        believe that the initial value problem for the KP equation with                 periodic boundary conditions is solvable.  The KP equation also                 provides accurate models of a class of water waves, and it is                   intimately connected with the theory of Riemann surfaces in                     algebraic geometry.  In fact, the problem is so rich that                       progress in almost any direction would valuable.                                    The objective in part C is to construct a new kinetic                       theory for a large collection of wavepackets that interact                      primarily through resonant triads.  If successful, the theory                   would result in a  Boltzmann-type equation, whose equilibrium                   solutions would provide an equilibrium spectrum of wave                         energies, analogous to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for                   molecules.  An earlier version of such a theory was given by                    Segur (1984); the work in this part of the project would                        correct a deficiency in that model."

For stability problems in collisionless spherical systems, the                  principal investigator intends to modify the so-called                          energy-Casimir method in its Hamiltonian setting so as to                       include inequality constraints.  This method has been proven to                 be successful in stability problems of fluids and plasmas.  The                 immediate goal is to establish the nonlinear stability of                       certain spherically symmetric equilibria which have been                        studied previously by Antonov.                                                       Motivated by recent results on vortex dynamics the                         principal investigator also plans to analyze the stability and                  bifurcation of equilibria and periodic orbits in a symmetric                    Hamiltonian system (with a reversion).  Particular emphasis                     will be placed on stability computations and on the role played                 by reversibility of these systems, in the presence of symmetry.                      Nonlinear stability questions are of fundamental                           importance in stellar dynamics.  The results may be used to                     explain the appearance of spherical galaxies and globular star                  clusters.  Results on symmetric Hamiltonian systems will be                     applicable to a wide range of physical systems possessing the                   same underlying symmetry structure."

For single-input                    systems it is known that optimal trajectories can exhibit                       undesirable features such as chattering bang-bang arcs if the                   dimension of the system becomes too large.  This may be due to                  a lack of possibility to influence the system via the control                   vector field.  To explore that scenario this project seeks to                   analyze the local structure of small-time reachable sets in                     dimension n for increasing values of n, in particular, to                       develop tests for optimality of complex concatenations of bang                  and singular arcs, and ii) to investigate multi-input systems                   using higher-order approximating cones which take into account                  specific structures of trajectories under consideration.

Aside from its evident theoretical relevance, such a                  knowledge might also be practically of interest for any                         possible future approach to design involving nonlinear                          components."

Smith.  It was introduced                   formally in the mathematical literature in 1985 by F. Keinert                   and K.T. Smith and independently (with a different                              implementation) by E.I. Vainberg and M.L. Faingois.                                  Local tomography allows the reconstruction of a function                   closely related to the attenuation coefficient of an object,                    within a region, from the attenuation along lines meeting that                  region, while standard tomography requires the attenuation along                all lines meeting the full object.  This has significant                        implications in regard to x-ray dose, resolution, the required                  dynamic range of the x-ray sensors, demands on the x-ray tube,                  scatter, compression distortions, scanner size, the size of the                 object to which tomography can be applied, the number of                        numerical computations, and the volume of data that must be                     collected, stored, and processed.

The objective of this project is to acquire that                  understanding, to write sound and effective numerical algorithms                for local tomography, and to make them available to practitioners               and researchers."

Then bounds will be derived using the fact that laminates are                   extremal in the set of composites.                                                   The behavior of composite materials is of fundamental                      technological importance.

The first such problem is determining whether a given                      system of differential equations can be derived from a                          variational principle. This problem comes in various forms,                     including the direct problem of whether the system as it stands                 is the Euler.Lagrange equations of some variational problem, or                 the more difficult question of finding an integrating factor                    which would make the system equivalent, in some sense, to some                  Euler.Lagrange equations.  Coupled with this question is the                    determination of the Lagrangian itself, possibly in some                        particularly nice form that depends only on the lower order                     derivatives.  Finally, the algorithms developed for computing                   dissipative decomposition of differential equations will be                     extended to deal with equations involving several independent                   variables.                                                                           The proposed library of manipulating programs would                        significantly speed up this line of research into the systems of                differential equations of mathematics and mathematical physics."

The first area deals with boundary-value problems                 for differential-difference equations.  The goal is to initiate                 an in-depth study of representative classes of problems of mixed                type (involving both positive and negative shifts) and problems                 with small delays.  The second area concerns singularly perturbed               integral equations.  The emphasis will be on problems whose solu-               tions involve boundary and interior layer phenomena.  Various                   classes of kernels will be considered including those with singu-               lar behavior.

There are very few geometric algorithms that                 do not have some graph theoretic component, either in their very                structure or in their use of data structures.                                        The main thrust of this research is to explore geometric                   problems that arise in applications to robotics and computer                    vision, and bring to these problems the many tools of graph                     theory.  In some cases, new problems need to be formulated and                  solved; in other cases, the methods currently being used will be                investigated to see if there are possible improvements that may                 come from the application of graph theoretic concepts and                       algorithms.  The basic goal is to prove (worse-case) bounds on                  the computational complexity of problems, either by producing an                efficient algorithm if one exists, or by proving a ""lower bound""                such as NP-hardness.

The gradostat is a laboratory system related to the chemostat and simulates ecosystems with spatial heterogeneity in the form of substrate gradients. The mathematical model for competition in the gradostat is an example of order.preserving dynamical systems which have been studied in great detail in recent years. The study will give better understanding of growth dynamics in gradient.like environments and suggest new experiments to be performed with the gradostat.

The principal investigator will study model equations which are integrodifferential equations where delay is described by a kernel in the Volterra integral which reflects growth being affected by consumption at all previous time, i.e. distributed delay. The goal is to determine if competitive coexistence can be expected with growth delay in general, or only with certain special forms of delay."

One goal of the mathematics is to intuit and test conjectures about general kinds of constraints on the connectivity, in order that the network be able to function appropriately.

Classically, the limit is thought to be a vortex sheet, but recent studies suggest that vortex sheets develop curvature singularities in finite time, and that at the time of singularity formation, the vortex sheet changes from a weak solution to a measure-valued solution of Euler equations. Moreover, different regularizations may lead to different results, making the nature of the limit of vanishing viscosity a central concern. The different numerical methods are considered in order to obtain a direct check on the accuracy of the results, to make a direct comparison of the performance of these methods on shear flows and to identify areas for improvement in each method. Results of the numerical calculations will be used to study how viscous effects modify the tendency for vortex sheets to develop curvature singularities. Numerical results will also be used to help answer the open mathematical question: do different regularizations of the Euler equations converge to different limits as the regularization vanishes?"

Two broad classes of algorithms are distinguished. The first class of algorithms path-follow using Euler predictor and Newton corrector steps, and develop nonmonotonic iterates. Here the emphasis is on basic formulation, implementation and analysis. The second class of algorithms utilize restarts of the homotopy. They develop monotonic iterates, correspond to affine rescaling variants of Karmarkar's projective algorithm, and mesh well with the simplex algorithm. This project will develop an explicit null-space affine rescaling approach in which search directions are computed inexactly. An iterative method is the primary technique used to solve associated linear systems."
