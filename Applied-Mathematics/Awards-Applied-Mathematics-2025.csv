Historically, these invasion processes have been poorly understood, with clear results available only for special systems of limited interest and are difficult to study computationally.  This project involves the development of a broad, model-independent framework for studying complex invasion fronts both theoretically and computationally, which can be used to make efficient predictions of invasion speeds and resulting spatial structures in broad classes of physical systems. The development of computational tools will focus on making these theoretical advances available to be put into practice by a broad range of scientists. Furthering the understanding of the selection of spatial structures in the wake of invasion fronts has particular promise for semiconductor manufacturing technologies which aim to harness this self-organized pattern formation to efficiently create nanomaterials with desirable electrical and optical properties. The project will involve both undergraduate and graduate students in the research, helping to develop the next generation of applied mathematicians.<br/><br/>Prior mathematical results on invasion fronts have been limited to models satisfying restrictive monotonicity assumptions, which do not cover invasion fronts which make up many crucial examples in fluid dynamics, materials science, and more. In the first part of the project, the investigator will prove rigorous results for the prediction of invasion speeds and selected wave numbers of patterns in partial differential equations models, under conceptual assumptions on spectral stability of coherent front solutions. In the second part, the investigator will advance the theoretical understanding of when propagating fronts are ``pulled'' along by their tail or ``pushed'' ahead by their interface, and use this understanding to develop efficient algorithms for numerically continuing fronts and predicting selected speeds and wave numbers. In the final part of the project, the investigator will extend theoretical results on front propagation from one spatial dimension to higher dimensions, and investigate related transverse instabilities which play a key role in invasion dynamics in systems modeling bacterial motion, vegetation growth, and cancer dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of the project is both to advance a scientific understanding of important physical phenomena, as well as to make quantitative predictions whenever possible. The problems under study are motivated by real-life applications with potential societal benefits. In the first part of the project, the Principal Investigator studies the interaction between incompressible fluid flows and walls, focusing on two problems. The first problem pertains to the motion of inviscid fluids in containers with permeable walls that allow for injection and suction, and how the rate and direction of injection and suction affects the flow. This problem has many applications from the study of fluids in sections of pipelines, to modeling of underground wells. The second problem focuses on a simplified model of the Earth, consisting in a fluid-filled solid shell, representing the Earth?s crust and mantle, containing a solid core, and on the long-time combined motion of the fluid-solid system. In the second part of the project, the Principal Investigator examines the effects of material transport and diffusion in certain fluid models. Two problems are considered. The first problem concerns flame front propagation in combustion and phase separation in fluid mixtures, for instance binary alloys. The second problem concerns modeling of fluid planets, such as certain exoplanets, combining the effects of rotation, gravitation, convection and magnetism. The last part of the project focuses on elastic materials, more specifically problems stemming from applications in seismology, where the Earth?s crust is modeled as an elastic solid. Remote monitoring of buried faults and magma chambers from satellite data during quiescent periods with no detectable seismic activity is investigated. The project includes also training activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The focus of this proposal is to study various problems characterized by singularities and ill-posedness of partial differential equations modeling the behavior of incompressible fluids and elastic solids. These problems are tackled using primarily analytic techniques, but also computational tools. The goal of the project is to make progress in our understanding of important processes, such as phase separation in mixtures, and make quantitative predictions, such as the reconstruction of unknown parameters in inverse problems. The project consists in three main parts: I. Wall interactions in hydrodynamics models; II. Transport, dissipation, and their interplay in non-linear systems; III. Boundary inverse problems for geophysical models. The project addresses questions motivated by fundamental physical phenomena. Hence, the project is both timely and relevant. Part I concerns the behavior of incompressible flows near rigid walls. Injection and suction can stabilize boundary layers. Fluid-structure interaction is mediated by boundary forces. Part II concerns the combined effect of advection and dissipation in non-linear systems. Long-wave instability can be mitigated by dissipation. Strong advection can accelerate phase separation. Convection, dissipation, and geodynamo all contribute to planetary motion. Part III concerns remote probing of geophysical systems. Fault monitoring is key to predicting earthquake nucleation. In volcanoes, the magma chamber is often inaccessible. The three parts of the project are distinct, but connected in a cohesive research program by the underlying themes of singularity and ill-posedness.This research brings about challenging mathematical questions, which requires novel ideas and techniques: singularities in various forms, from non-smooth domains, to non-standard interface and boundary conditions, to ill-posedness and instability, for instance, permeate the entire project. Several of the problems under study, such as shape optimization in Part III, have a computational component that is also addressed. Progress on these problems is likely to have impact in other fields. The project offers training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, as well as dissemination to the broader scientific community and outreach to society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach allows for reversible control of physical behavior and has gained traction in fields like quantum engineering, photonics, and acoustics. Although experimental studies have observed intriguing phenomena like edge conduction in these materials, the theoretical foundation?especially in continuum models described by partial differential equations?is incomplete and, at times, contradictory. The investigator develops a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding Floquet materials using continuum models, with the goal of explaining fundamental features such as wave localization and energy transport. The project serves the national interest by advancing foundational science in applied mathematics and mathematical physics, and contributing to emerging technologies that rely on wave manipulation.

The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluids and are fundamental to science and engineering, with applications ranging from weather forecasting and ocean modeling to aircraft design and pipe flow. Despite their widespread use, key theoretical questions remain unanswered?most notably, the global regularity and uniqueness of solutions in three space dimensions. This question is one of the seven Clay Millennium Prize Problems. The proposed research aims to develop a new mathematical and computational approach to uncover possible mechanisms that lead to singularity formation in the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. This work is significant because understanding how such singularities form could provide new insight into turbulence, which plays a central role in many physical systems. The broader impacts include the interdisciplinary training of graduate students in mathematical analysis, modeling, and large-scale simulation. This research directly supports NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare.<br/> <br/>The investigator develops a novel approach to study the potential finite-time singularity in the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with smooth initial data of finite energy. The project begins by analyzing a generalized version of the equations in a space of fractional dimension slightly above three. In this setting, the space dimension is treated as a tunable parameter that helps eliminate scaling instability and reveals the formation of an asymptotically self-similar blowup solution. The investigator then considers the vanishing viscosity limit as the space dimension approaches three. The numerical evidence suggests that the potential singularity is not of exactly self-similar, but rather of Type II with logarithmic corrections. Using a novel two-scale dynamic rescaling formulation and a derived leading-order reduced two-dimensional system, the investigator aims to identify and eliminate unstable modes in the solution. This will allow the construction of a stable singularity profile and potentially enable a computer-assisted proof of finite-time blowup in a generalized Navier-Stokes system. The successful execution of this research could provide a pathway toward resolving the Clay Millennium Problem and advance the theoretical understanding of turbulence. Graduate students involved in the project will gain valuable experience in rigorous partial differential equation analysis and high-performance numerical computation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fluid flows such as gases are important in nature. Their study is crucial for understanding the dynamics in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, including gas dynamics, material science, geometry, turbulence, and shell theory. While one-dimensional problems in this field are relatively well understood, the theory for multi-dimensional cases remains mathematically underdeveloped. This project seeks to advance the mathematical understanding of multi-dimensional conservation laws and their applications in both fluid dynamics and geometry, and will integrate research and education, therefore also contributing to the development of the future STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The research will focus on four core problems: (1) the existence and stability of the transonic contact discontinuity in the three-dimensional axisymmetric nozzle in gas dynamics: this is a free boundary and mixed-type problem, the free boundary is characteristic, and this study will shed light and provide new methods on the general multi-dimensional theory of conservation laws; (2) the existence of a global solution to the transonic flow past a three-dimensional axisymmetric cone in gas dynamics: new ideas and techniques will be developed to solve this mixed-type PDE problem; and  (3) the global smooth solution to the Gauss-Codazzi equations of isometric immersion of surfaces: a global smooth solution to the underlying hyperbolic system of balance laws yields a smooth isometric immersion of surfaces, and a longstanding open problem is to find such a global smooth solution when the curvature of the surface has the optimal decay rate and oscillations.

Due to their inherent complexity, one of the central goals of the project is to create more accurate large-scale representations that go beyond classical statistical descriptions. The investigator will in particular focus on second order systems and systems with non-identical particles or agents, which appear in models from plasmas and astrophysics/cosmology to networks of biological neurons.<br/><br/>These systems are often governed by large coupled systems of ordinary or stochastic differential equations (ODEs/SDEs), posing significant challenges for both analysis and computation. Reducing this complexity is a key question that is often answered through the notion of mean-field limit and the concept of propagation of chaos. However, in practice, applications have a fixed number of particles and the mean field approximation may become inaccurate over long time scales since the exact solution may deviate from the mean-field limit exponentially fast. The investigator studies the deviations to the mean-field limit to derive more accurate descriptions, and better capture the long-time behavior. A key approach in the project revolves around clustering expansions of the joint law of the system, through the notions of cumulants and their recent extension to dual cumulants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many cases, these structures are universal, meaning they arise independently of conditions such as initial data and, in some cases, even of the governing equations. The project will develop and apply mathematical tools to identify and characterize emergent asymptotic phenomena in nonlinear wave models, with a particular focus on non-generic or anomalous behavior.

While these three classes of evolution equations are well-understood in the one-dimensional spatial setting, the questions of existence, regularity and large-time behavior of solutions for the more realistic multi-dimensional models are mostly open.

The goal is to study the open question of existence of multidimensional strong solutions, subject to sub-critical initial data, and their large-time behavior with short-range communication kernels. (ii) Nonlinear Conservation Laws. Nonlinear scalar conservation laws admit a regularization effect, where the entropic time evolution of bounded data gains spatial regularity of fractional order s< 1/3.

This project focuses on topological phases of matter, a novel class of materials that conduct electricity along their edges in a way that remains unaffected by defects or noise. This makes them ideal to improve quantum computations - which are notoriously sensitive to noise. This project aims to stimulate innovations in quantum technology by unlocking a deeper understanding of how electrons behave in these materials. The project investigates how stable currents emerge between topologically distinct phases; compute their profile and their speed; and derive effective equations for their propagation. The educational component of this project seeks to inspire students by emphasizing the vital role of mathematical skills in today's professional landscape. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to organize a monthly talk series, ""Y Math?"", which features industry leaders showcasing how mathematics drives innovation across diverse fields. <br/><br/>The first research track of this project focuses on topological insulators, materials whose Hamiltonians have a spectral gap and a topologically non-trivial Fermi projector. For straight interfaces, the bulk-edge correspondence predicts that the conductance along an interface between insulating phases of matter is equal to the Hall conductance jump across the interface. The PI seeks to extend this principle to curved interfaces by extracting from the edge conductance an intersection number that accounts for the non-trivial geometry. The physical interpretation is that each connected component of the interface supports a number of edge modes equal to the Hall conductance difference. The PI also intends to compute high-frequency corrections to the bulk-edge correspondence in the continuum - where this principle is sometimes violated. The second research track of the project focuses on Weyl semimetals, three-dimensional crystals with conical intersections in their band structure. Despite an extensive physics literature, there is no known example of Schrödinger operator with Weyl points. The PI plans to show that Weyl points nonetheless appear generically in the band spectrum of Schrödinger operators in three dimensions and produce explicit examples as parity-breaking perturbations of face-centered and body-centered cubic crystals.

The equations studied are completely integrable systems, for which there are many more analytical techniques available than for more general equations.  However, at the same time integrable equations are known to arise from more general equations in certain limiting cases.  Each time that a new result is established for a completely integrable model that arises in this way, a version of that result immediately applies to all of the more general models.  These properties make the study of integrable models both mathematically compelling and also of prime physical relevance.  This project uncovers new solutions of integrable equations of recognized importance and studies their exact and asymptotic properties.  Knowledge of the solutions obtained impacts several application areas such as marine engineering (prediction/properties of large-amplitude surface water waves or ""freak waves"" and deformations of the free surface between layers in a density-stratified ocean) and condensed matter physics (Bose-Einstein condensation).  As part of the project, computer codes and a textbook are being produced for public consumption.  Three PhD students are being partially supported to work on the project.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project addresses open problems in the theory of internal waves in fluids and related evolution equations that are fundamentally nonlocal.  Long-time asymptotics for the Benjamin-Ono equation are being established, and soliton gases are being constructed for this equation.  A nonlocal model of nonlinear Schroedinger type is being studied.  Pivoting to more classical nonlinear Schroedinger equations and their relatives, dynamical stability of slowly-decaying rogue waves on the zero background (""rogue waves of infinite order"") is being analyzed, uniformity of asymptotic behavior of such solutions in the large is being determined, a mechanism for generating such waves from extreme self-focusing is being explored in several models, a family of solutions continuously interpolating between rogue waves and solitons is being analyzed, and a universality result is being proved for the first time in the setting of the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation.  The project also addresses open questions in the theory of Painleve equations, establishing an isomonodromic representation for general special-function solutions and studying asymptotic limits in the parameter space for which in some cases there are outstanding conjectures in the literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particles repel or attract one another, and importantly, this repulsion or attraction may become increasingly strong as particles become increasingly close together. In principle, the equations of physics, such as Newton?s laws of motion, allow to completely determine the behavior of each particle in the system for arbitrary periods of time. However, in practice, the large number of particles, and therefore the complexity of the system, far exceeds even the best computing resources. To answer questions of interest, one needs a simpler effective description that is a good approximation. Following the prescriptions of statistical mechanics, much effort over the years has been devoted to achieving a reduction in complexity through a point of view focused on the probability of finding at a given time a particle in the system at a certain position in space and moving with a certain velocity. A first approximation, known as the mean-field limit, effectively captures the ?typical behavior? of a particle in the system through a solution of a single equation, which is much simpler than the equations governing the exact motion of all the individual particles. However, our understanding of the mean-field limit over the timescales relevant for the system?s relaxation to equilibrium is quite poor. Additionally, the mean-field description ignores correlations between particles, created by their interactions and the thermal effects of the particles? environment, which capture the disorder of the system. Little is known about this disorder, which is encoded in the probability of deviations from the mean-field limit. The distribution of these deviations is the next-order approximation beyond the mean-field. The project will advance our understanding of how the system disorder grows with the number of particles and changes over time. The results are of direct application for the modeling of states of matter, such as plasmas, as well as problems with particle-like behavior, such as vortices in fluids or superconductors and the training of neural networks. The methods developed to tackle these problems, based on measuring how the energy or entropy of a system varies in space and time, will establish new connections between different areas of mathematics of independent interest. A key feature of the project is the integration of research and educational activities, promoting the goals of the Federal 5-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan. Through summer courses for advanced high-school students, new undergraduate curricula focused on mathematical communication, working groups, and supervising undergraduate and graduate student projects, the research program will provide opportunities for the mentorship and training of a new generation of researchers in the U.S. at this intersection of mathematics, physics, and statistics.<br/><br/>Building on the investigator?s extensive work, the project addresses fundamental, open questions for the large time, beyond leading order description of Coulomb/Riesz gases. The two main lines of investigation are (1) central limit theorems for fluctuations around the mean-field limit and cumulant expansions that capture the system disorder and corrections to the mean-field limit; (2) the interplay between generation of chaos in these systems (the phenomenon of the particles becoming independent and identically distributed in the joint large time and system size limit), log Sobolev inequalities (LSIs), and relaxation estimates for gradient flows. The project develops both the physical and mathematical understanding of Coulomb/Riesz gases. (1) advances several new conjectures for the scaling of fluctuations and cumulants, their limiting dynamics, and the optimal rate of convergence to Gaussianity, quantifying the disorder as a function of the system size, length scale of observation, temperature, and singularity of interaction. These questions are all open except in limited cases, and the project stands to shape the future direction of the field. (2) develops the new connection between generation of chaos and LSIs for Gibbs measures, which has wide application beyond Coulomb/Riesz gases, with emphasis on LSIs for nonconvex energies, which is a major challenge in the field. The project develops new mathematical tools, such as commutator and gradient flow relaxation estimates, which have potential applications across analysis/PDE and probability. Lastly, Coulomb/Riesz gases are an important testing ground for the longer-term goal of answering fundamental questions of statistical mechanics for more general systems arising in machine learning, physics, and statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These dynamics often involve rare events that can have large impacts, such as changes in protein structures or genetic evolution. Inaccurate predictions of these events can hinder our understanding of biological processes, drug design, and our ability to prepare for extreme events. This project seeks to improve our ability to predict and control these rare but critical events by identifying key patterns in energy landscapes and developing new methods for estimating fluctuations and controlling extreme events in complex spaces. The insights gained will not only help in predicting extreme events but also improve our understanding of various interactive behaviors, such as material design and social opinions. Educational initiatives will promote interdisciplinary learning and advance the growth of applied mathematics and related fields.<br/><br/>This project aims to predict and control rare, significant events in interactive dynamics on complex configuration spaces. The goal is to advance the theoretical understanding of Hamilton-Jacobi equations (HJEs) and control theory for multiscale interactions by addressing key challenges, including non-uniqueness of stationary solutions, fluctuation estimates in multiscale interactions, and singular optimal control in probability spaces. Theoretical developments will be applied to practical problems, such as rare event simulations, to enable more predictable dynamics in complex systems.  First, the investigator will develop a systematic method to select stationary solutions to HJEs, providing a uniformly converging vanishing viscosity approximation and a global energy landscape. Second, a novel decomposition for species concentration and reaction fluxes in non-equilibrium multiscale reactions will be introduced, along with a singular limit framework for fluctuation estimates. Third, rigorous justifications for the singular limit of variational solutions for HJEs with state constraints will be achieved via the equivalence between optimal control and optimal path measures for transition problems in infinite dimensional spaces, particularly in the presence of boundary singularities.

These equations are pertinent to a wide array of real-world applications and have been extensively researched. For instance, they are essential in understanding related phenomena in physics and biology, such as formation of severe weather conditions and collective animal behavior. Additionally, they play a vital role in addressing some of the nation?s most pressing issues such as weather prediction, aircraft design and collective dynamics modeling. Developing mathematical theories in this area is both challenging and immensely valuable for comprehending intricate behaviors. The primary focus of this project is to investigate the steady states of these equations. The main goal is to develop a comprehensive analytical framework that enhances the understanding of these steady states, including their existence, singular behavior, and stability. An integral part of this project is the educational component, which will offer training opportunities for students and provide platforms for professional development of young researchers in PDEs and analysis. <br/><br/>This project contains three interrelated directions. The first direction focuses on the three-dimensional (3D) incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), progressing toward a comprehensive understanding of an important class of steady states with scaling-invariance property. The plan is to first address the existence of these solutions and then investigate their singularity behavior and classification. The second direction aims to understand the stability of steady states of the 3D incompressible NSE, building on the results from the first direction, where new analytical tools with more general applications are developed. The third direction studies the aggregation-diffusion equation. The goal is to study the steady states of the equation and whether the dynamics converge to the steady states, as well as the stability of the related interaction energy. This project is jointly funded by the Applied Mathematics program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will yield important new methods for modeling chemical mixing, biologically active fluids, and geophysical systems. Improving methods for these domain settings will provide more effective tools to address important problems such as the spread of pathogens or pollutants or to quantify the degree and type of climate hazards. The investigators will develop new methodologies for calibrating and designing effective measurement strategies of these various fluid systems, which simultaneously resolve degrees of the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. This project involves the training and active participation of a number of graduate students and other earlier career scientists. The cross institutional and cross disciplinary nature of this project will provide unique opportunities for the participants.<br/> <br/>Recent advances in computational infrastructure combined with novel mathematical formulations and newly discovered algorithms have allowed the extension of the Bayesian approach to new classes of physics-constrained inverse problems. Solutions typically take many times the computational power of a single solve of a nonlinear forward map based on a partial differential equations (PDEs) where the estimation concerns a function rather than a finite collection of numerical values, namely where we are interested in estimating an infinite-dimensional unknown parameter. The investigators will undertake a research program at the intersection of stochastic and functional analysis, high-performance computing, nonlinear PDEs, and fluid dynamics. Specifically, the investigators will (1) consider a series of physically motivated PDE inverse problems with infinite-dimensional unknowns; (2) develop novel algorithms adapted to efficiently sample from infinite-dimensional measures; (3) develop the ergodic theory for certain classes of infinite-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to rigorously assess rates of convergence in sampling target posterior measures; and (4) analyze consistency in the large data observation limit for infinite dimensional models. The project contributes effective frameworks for the measurement of turbulent fluid flows from sparse, irregular data while developing sampling methods of broader interest across computational statistics and data science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include ecological dynamics in a varied environment and fluctuating flame fronts in combustion. Nonetheless, such systems often exhibit tractable behavior when viewed at large or fine scales. This ""asymptotic"" behavior plays a major role in applications, and often has a universal character that unites the study of disparate systems. In this project, the principal investigator (PI) will combine several mathematical methods to identify and justify asymptotic phenomena in partial differential equations (PDEs) originating in the sciences. This work has the potential to shed light on a variety of systems including ecological invasion, atomic deposition, and fluid shock formation. The PI is committed to undergraduate and graduate mentorship, with the particular aim of supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds. <br/><br/>This project will explore the asymptotic behavior of various deterministic and stochastic PDEs in significant limiting regimes. The project comprises three interconnected lines of work. (1) The PI will study the long-time propagation speed and front structure of solutions to reaction-diffusion equations in heterogeneous and random environments. This investigation encompasses a dual analysis of associated branching particle systems. (2) The PI will combine analytic and probabilistic methods to study long-time and white-noise limits of several physically motivated stochastic PDEs, including stochastic conservation laws and stochastic heat equations near criticality. (3) The PI will investigate the action of weak viscosity on internal shock formation in the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. This involves a delicate coupling between hyperbolic and parabolic approximations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
"2525548","Collaborative Research: Stability and Instability of Periodically Stationary Nonlinear Waves with Applications to Fiber Lasers","DMS","APPLIED MATHEMATICS, International Research Collab","01/01/2025","02/25/2025","John Zweck","NY","New York Institute of Technology","Standard Grant","Stacey Levine","08/31/2025","$28,247.00","","jzweck@nyit.edu","1855 BROADWAY","NEW YORK","NY","100237606","5166867737","MPS","126600, 729800","5998","$0.00","Since the introduction of the soliton laser in the 1990's researchers have developed several generations of short pulse, high energy fiber lasers for a variety of applications. These lasers are configured to produce periodically stationary pulses by propagating light many times around a loop. Although different physical effects change the shape of the pulse as it traverses the loop, the pulse returns to the same shape once each period (round trip). A significant challenge for the modeling of these lasers is that from one generation to the next there has been a dramatic increase in the amount by which the pulse breathes, necessitating novel mathematical approaches. This project will develop theoretical and computational methods to determine periodically stationary pulse solutions of nonlinear wave equations modeling laser systems and to analyze their stability (robustness in the presence of random noise and other system perturbations). The project will provide computational tools to aid in the design of high energy lasers for medical applications, and of frequency combs for highly accurate measurements of time and frequency, with applications to geo-location systems, time and frequency standards, the calibration of astronomical instruments, and trace gas sensing. The project will provide broad training in applied mathematics for doctoral students and mentoring for junior faculty. In addition, the project will support complementary activity focused on pedagogical innovations. <br/> <br/>The laser models to be studied in this project are based on variants of the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Classically, the spectrum of a stationary nonlinear wave is given by the zero set of the Evans function of the linearized differential operator. The stability of periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of fiber lasers will be characterized in terms of the spectrum of the monodromy operator of the linearization about the pulse. Since the stability problem for time-periodic solutions is formulated on a cylinder, rather than on the real line, any generalization of the Evans function will involve Fredholm determinants of operators on infinite-dimensional function spaces rather than classical determinants of matrices. To avoid the extreme stiffness of the differential equations used to compute the Evans function in this infinite dimensional context, the point spectrum of the monodromy operator will be identified with the zero set of an infinite-dimensional Fredholm determinant of a Birman-Schwinger operator on an infinite cylinder. Numerical methods will be developed to compute Fredholm determinants of such Birman-Schwinger operators. These methods will then be employed to determine stability regions in design parameter space for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of experimental fiber laser systems. The generic instability of stationary solutions of reaction diffusion equations has recently been established by applying a related topological invariant called the Maslov index to the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators. A novel version of the Maslov index will be used to establish general stability results for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
