Unpredictable changes can affect the way fluids mix and move and this work seeks to elucidate these effects by developing new mathematical tools to study how random fluctuations affect fluids.  The principal investigator will also explore how unpredictable changes can lead to chaotic and unstable behavior in fluids, which is important for understanding phenomena like turbulence. This effort will train future scientists to continue this work. Findings will be shared with other researchers and the public. By combining different areas of mathematics, a deeper understanding of how fluids behave will be achieved. This endeavor brings together scientists from different fields to share ideas and work together, potentially leading to new discoveries.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the influence of random fluctuations on mixing properties in fluid models, including advection-diffusion and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The research focuses on the interplay between deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping fluid behavior, examining two interconnected themes: (1) Microlocal approach to mixing by random velocities - by employing the new techniques using pseudodifferential operators, this project aims to develop a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the influence of random fluctuations on mixing properties in various fluid models, including advection-diffusion and nonlinear PDEs; (2) Lyapunov exponents in Infinite-Dimensional Systems - this project aims to advance techniques for studying Lyapunov exponents in infinite dimensional stochastic systems, particularly developing methods for proving the existence of projective stationary measures and the finiteness of Lyapunov exponents. Expected outcomes include an enhanced understanding of mixing and transport in fluid systems and a characterization of chaos in infinite-dimensional systems. The project also seeks to achieve a proof of exponential lower bounds for advection-diffusion equations in compact domains with quantitative dependence on diffusivity. The results of this research will advance the theoretical understanding of fluid dynamics and potentially generate practical implications for fields such as climate modeling, oceanography, and engineering. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Applied Mathematics and the Analysis programs in the Division of Mathematical Sciences as well as the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historically, these invasion processes have been poorly understood, with clear results available only for special systems of limited interest and are difficult to study computationally.  This project involves the development of a broad, model-independent framework for studying complex invasion fronts both theoretically and computationally, which can be used to make efficient predictions of invasion speeds and resulting spatial structures in broad classes of physical systems. The development of computational tools will focus on making these theoretical advances available to be put into practice by a broad range of scientists. Furthering the understanding of the selection of spatial structures in the wake of invasion fronts has particular promise for semiconductor manufacturing technologies which aim to harness this self-organized pattern formation to efficiently create nanomaterials with desirable electrical and optical properties. The project will involve both undergraduate and graduate students in the research, helping to develop the next generation of applied mathematicians.<br/><br/>Prior mathematical results on invasion fronts have been limited to models satisfying restrictive monotonicity assumptions, which do not cover invasion fronts which make up many crucial examples in fluid dynamics, materials science, and more. In the first part of the project, the investigator will prove rigorous results for the prediction of invasion speeds and selected wave numbers of patterns in partial differential equations models, under conceptual assumptions on spectral stability of coherent front solutions. In the second part, the investigator will advance the theoretical understanding of when propagating fronts are ``pulled'' along by their tail or ``pushed'' ahead by their interface, and use this understanding to develop efficient algorithms for numerically continuing fronts and predicting selected speeds and wave numbers. In the final part of the project, the investigator will extend theoretical results on front propagation from one spatial dimension to higher dimensions, and investigate related transverse instabilities which play a key role in invasion dynamics in systems modeling bacterial motion, vegetation growth, and cancer dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of the project is both to advance a scientific understanding of important physical phenomena, as well as to make quantitative predictions whenever possible. The problems under study are motivated by real-life applications with potential societal benefits. In the first part of the project, the Principal Investigator studies the interaction between incompressible fluid flows and walls, focusing on two problems. The first problem pertains to the motion of inviscid fluids in containers with permeable walls that allow for injection and suction, and how the rate and direction of injection and suction affects the flow. This problem has many applications from the study of fluids in sections of pipelines, to modeling of underground wells. The second problem focuses on a simplified model of the Earth, consisting in a fluid-filled solid shell, representing the Earth?s crust and mantle, containing a solid core, and on the long-time combined motion of the fluid-solid system. In the second part of the project, the Principal Investigator examines the effects of material transport and diffusion in certain fluid models. Two problems are considered. The first problem concerns flame front propagation in combustion and phase separation in fluid mixtures, for instance binary alloys. The second problem concerns modeling of fluid planets, such as certain exoplanets, combining the effects of rotation, gravitation, convection and magnetism. The last part of the project focuses on elastic materials, more specifically problems stemming from applications in seismology, where the Earth?s crust is modeled as an elastic solid. Remote monitoring of buried faults and magma chambers from satellite data during quiescent periods with no detectable seismic activity is investigated. The project includes also training activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The focus of this proposal is to study various problems characterized by singularities and ill-posedness of partial differential equations modeling the behavior of incompressible fluids and elastic solids. These problems are tackled using primarily analytic techniques, but also computational tools. The goal of the project is to make progress in our understanding of important processes, such as phase separation in mixtures, and make quantitative predictions, such as the reconstruction of unknown parameters in inverse problems. The project consists in three main parts: I. Wall interactions in hydrodynamics models; II. Transport, dissipation, and their interplay in non-linear systems; III. Boundary inverse problems for geophysical models. The project addresses questions motivated by fundamental physical phenomena. Hence, the project is both timely and relevant. Part I concerns the behavior of incompressible flows near rigid walls. Injection and suction can stabilize boundary layers. Fluid-structure interaction is mediated by boundary forces. Part II concerns the combined effect of advection and dissipation in non-linear systems. Long-wave instability can be mitigated by dissipation. Strong advection can accelerate phase separation. Convection, dissipation, and geodynamo all contribute to planetary motion. Part III concerns remote probing of geophysical systems. Fault monitoring is key to predicting earthquake nucleation. In volcanoes, the magma chamber is often inaccessible. The three parts of the project are distinct, but connected in a cohesive research program by the underlying themes of singularity and ill-posedness.This research brings about challenging mathematical questions, which requires novel ideas and techniques: singularities in various forms, from non-smooth domains, to non-standard interface and boundary conditions, to ill-posedness and instability, for instance, permeate the entire project. Several of the problems under study, such as shape optimization in Part III, have a computational component that is also addressed. Progress on these problems is likely to have impact in other fields. The project offers training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, as well as dissemination to the broader scientific community and outreach to society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project studies theoretical frameworks for liquid crystal systems which require the development of advanced mathematical techniques. The research focuses on two areas: ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, which exhibit switchable electric polarization and show promise for improved electro-optical devices, and liquid crystals with very high symmetries that require mathematical tools like tensors for an accurate description. The mathematical methods proposed in this project should improve computational simulations and help understand structural ordering and defects in these materials. By developing new theoretical models and computational methods, this work supports advances in sensing and simulation technologies. This project also contributes to education and workforce development in science and engineering, involving the training of both graduate and undergraduate students in this research area. <br/><br/>This proposal presents two research directions investigating novel structures in nematic liquid crystals. The first focuses on ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, a recently observed phase that was long predicted theoretically and enables polarity switching. These materials develop singular structures similar to domain walls in ferromagnetic systems, occurring in regions where polarity transitions sharply between states. The second research area examines nematic liquid crystals with symmetries beyond the typical head-tail symmetry, including tetrahedral and cubic symmetries that can be characterized using appropriate order parameters. For these high-order symmetries, higher-order tensors provide a more natural description than the second-order tensors used in classical Landau-de Gennes theory. Both research topics have practical relevance for sensor development and computational mesh generation for scientific simulations. The work requires developing new mathematical tools from tensor analysis, calculus of variations, and partial differential equations to characterize the complex structures observed in physical experiments and numerical simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluids and are fundamental to science and engineering, with applications ranging from weather forecasting and ocean modeling to aircraft design and pipe flow. Despite their widespread use, key theoretical questions remain unanswered?most notably, the global regularity and uniqueness of solutions in three space dimensions. This question is one of the seven Clay Millennium Prize Problems. The proposed research aims to develop a new mathematical and computational approach to uncover possible mechanisms that lead to singularity formation in the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. This work is significant because understanding how such singularities form could provide new insight into turbulence, which plays a central role in many physical systems. The broader impacts include the interdisciplinary training of graduate students in mathematical analysis, modeling, and large-scale simulation. This research directly supports NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare.<br/> <br/>The investigator develops a novel approach to study the potential finite-time singularity in the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with smooth initial data of finite energy. The project begins by analyzing a generalized version of the equations in a space of fractional dimension slightly above three. In this setting, the space dimension is treated as a tunable parameter that helps eliminate scaling instability and reveals the formation of an asymptotically self-similar blowup solution. The investigator then considers the vanishing viscosity limit as the space dimension approaches three. The numerical evidence suggests that the potential singularity is not of exactly self-similar, but rather of Type II with logarithmic corrections. Using a novel two-scale dynamic rescaling formulation and a derived leading-order reduced two-dimensional system, the investigator aims to identify and eliminate unstable modes in the solution. This will allow the construction of a stable singularity profile and potentially enable a computer-assisted proof of finite-time blowup in a generalized Navier-Stokes system. The successful execution of this research could provide a pathway toward resolving the Clay Millennium Problem and advance the theoretical understanding of turbulence.

Traditional physics-based models offer scientific interpretability but often rely on idealized assumptions that limit accuracy.  Conversely, recent advances in machine learning approaches have led to more accurate predictive models, but these are inherently ""black boxes,"" lacking scientific insight into the underlying physical mechanisms. This project will use observable data to systematically adapt and modify existing physically derived models, thus staying true to both the traditional and data-driven approaches. The methodology is adaptable to a wide range of goals, such as optimizing predictions, matching observed statistics, or identifying unknown model parameters.  Applications of this work will include problems of great interest to society and industry by identifying more efficient models for turbulence, which has ramifications from weather prediction to the development of engines and design of aircraft.  The investigators will also apply this method to develop reliably predictive models for groundwater flow, a key issue for national water and food security.  Further, the project will advance education and workforce development by mentoring undergraduate and graduate students and facilitating interactions with National Laboratories and private-sector stakeholders. <br/><br/>The project builds on recent combined efforts of the investigators demonstrating an algorithm capable of ""on-the-fly"" parameter and model discovery.  The investigators will mathematically rigorously justify this algorithm (and similar renditions of it), quantify its limitations, and lay the mathematical foundation for further improvement. The investigators will apply this method to identify large eddy simulation (LES) models for turbulent flows, and to correct reduced-dimensional models (e.g., from three dimensions to two dimensions) can be modified to accurately capture important statistics.  The data assimilation technique will be extended to the Richards equation for groundwater flow, and the new parameter identification algorithm will be used to identify the precise form of spatially varying diffusion tensors which is critical for porous media and groundwater flows. The project will also develop algorithms for optimal sensor placement (where optimality is defined as accurately representing key characteristics of the system from partial observations available from limited mobile and/or static sensors), enhancing the ability to accurately reconstruct and predict full-system behavior from sparse measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They appear at low temperatures in a variety of materials. Some of these materials are minerals found in nature or are derived from them, and others are synthesized in the cutting-edge laboratories of today using trapped cold atoms or optical lattices. Mathematically, these systems are studied in the ground state, which is the state of smallest possible energy of the systems. In experiments, this corresponds to temperatures near absolute zero. These special states of matter have attracted a great deal of attention in the past few decades especially due to their relevance for quantum information science and technology. Any advantage of quantum information processing (including computation) derives from the special properties of quantum entanglement. It is therefore important to characterize the structure of such states in a rigorous manner. Topological phases represent types of specially entangled quantum states. They can be classified by so-called topological invariants which explain why these phases are particularly robust against noise and other perturbations. This robustness is an essential requirement in applications of topological insulators to quantum memory. The term `insulator? refers to the appearance of a gap in the energy spectrum above the ground state. A key property is the stability of the ground state gap under moderate perturbations of the Hamiltonian. The principal investigator studies this spectral gap in a series of paradigmatic model systems. The topological characterization translates into a succinct description of the elementary excitations of the systems. In two-dimensional systems (thin layers) this description is in terms of a novel type particles called anyons. This study is motivated by the possibility of anyon based quantum computation in solid state devices. Attracting and educating talented junior researchers and preparing them for the future quantum science and technology workforce is an integral par of the project.<br/><br/>Mathematics is crucial to the precise and quantitative description of topological phases. At the highest level, different phases in two dimensions are often characterized by a modular tensor category. The principal investigator works with junior collaborators to prove results about the existence and stability of the spectral gap for types of many-body quantum systems for which such mathematical results are currently lacking. For example, in the case of the pseudo-potential models introduced by Haldane and others, the detailed analysis of the operator product structure of the ground states undertaken in this project, may open a new avenue for progress on the spectral gap problem. A related topic is the study of ground state phase diagrams. In addition to the study of topological indices, the principal investigator and his graduate students work on obtaining more detailed descriptions of the entangled ground state phases using string order parameters and new dualities, which have been conjectured in the recent literature. At the technical level, this involves applying the techniques of operator algebras and functional analysis, and also requires further development of those techniques. Spectral analysis for many-body fermions subject to a magnetic field in two dimensions, is an example where new technical advances are pursued. National and international collaborations will be a key part of this activity, both by using online collaboration tools and in person conferences, schools, and research visits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the thin boundary layer of fluid along the wing of an aircraft or a moving car can be only a few millimeters thick, and yet the dynamics of this thin layer can have a dramatic effect on the flight characteristics of the aircraft in terms of maneuverability, speed, and fuel efficiency. These so-called viscous boundary layers are one very important small scale in fluids. Another example are the complicated set of whorls and vortices one observes when the fluid is undergoing turbulence, like for example in the wake of a vehicle. In this situation there are many different active scales and the statistics of these patterns has a profound effect on the overall behavior of the fluid, for example, often creating a great deal of additional air drag on the vehicle. A third more subtle example is in the interaction between wave-like motion and a background flow, for example surface water waves traveling across a large gyre. While the small scales may not be immediately visible, in fact they play an important role in determining the interaction between the waves and large scale vortex structures. Accurate understanding of boundary layers, turbulence, and other such small scales, are crucial in a variety of scientific and industrial applications, including in the design of air, land, and sea vehicles and in the understanding of more complicated fluid-like systems such as the weather or confined fusion plasmas. The principal investigator (PI) will work to build firm mathematical foundations for understanding these phenomena more precisely, which could help other applied researchers obtain deeper insights, lead to better modeling, and better computational methods for these problems. Further, a better understanding of these extremes helps pave the way for a better understanding of the interactions and intermediate situations, for example, flows that have a mix of structure and chaos. Finally, overcoming the inherent mathematical challenges to these questions will require multiple innovations that will be of interest to the wider mathematical and scientific community. The research projects are also integrated with the training and mentorship of graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and younger scientists in mathematics and STEM at large in order to help build and maintain a strong scientific and engineering expertise in the United States.<br/><br/>The PI will work to develop a more mathematically rigorous understanding of three behaviors observed in incompressible fluids at high Reynolds numbers and in similar systems: (A) chaos and turbulence in statistically stationary models subjected to random forcing; (B) the structure and stability of sharp transition layers, such as boundary layers and shock layers; (C) the interaction of large scale waves (such as atmospheric Rossby waves) with the small-scale filamentation created by disturbing a large background shear flow or vortex. The primary long term goal motivating Program (A) is to provide a proof for the observed positive Lyapunov exponents and anomalous dissipation (e.g. as the celebrated Kolmogorov 4/5 law) from the stochastically-forced three-dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes equations or other similar turbulent models. For program (B) it is to determine the dynamics of laminar boundary layers over long times in the presence of large scale flows. For program (C), it is to provide mathematical analysis of filamentation/inviscid damping dynamics interacting with large-scales waves in a nonlinear system, as this frequently arises in many applications, such as in weather dynamics and plasma physics. The PI has chosen several specific problems that will advance the theory towards significant insights while being ambitious yet achievable in the near term. Projects have been selected to train and integrate graduate students and post-doctoral scholars into the research, including the PI's current and future mentees.

Reducing this complexity is a key question that is often answered through the notion of mean-field limit and the concept of propagation of chaos. However, in practice, applications have a fixed number of particles and the mean field approximation may become inaccurate over long time scales since the exact solution may deviate from the mean-field limit exponentially fast.

Despite arising in distinct systems, nonlinear waves often exhibit recognizable patterns such as rapidly oscillating wave trains, persistent localized beams, and rogue waves, under asymptotic regimes such as long-time evolution or small-dispersion. In many cases, these structures are universal, meaning they arise independently of conditions such as initial data and, in some cases, even of the governing equations. The project will develop and apply mathematical tools to identify and characterize emergent asymptotic phenomena in nonlinear wave models, with a particular focus on non-generic or anomalous behavior. The outcomes will advance the understanding of wave propagation involving large amplitudes or heavy tails, with broad applications in hydrodynamics and optical telecommunications. The project will also provide research training for graduate students and early-career scientists, broadening its impact beyond technical discovery into education and scientific workforce development.<br/><br/>The project focuses on obtaining quantitative information on nonlinear wave behavior in asymptotic regimes not accessible through current inverse-scattering transform (IST) methods.

To achieve these goals, the investigator will combine and further develop tools from the theory of integrable systems, complex and asymptotic analysis, and numerical methods.

This project investigates a particularly intriguing subset of soft materials called hyperbolic non-Euclidean plates?thin sheets with built-in curvature that causes them to spontaneously buckle into wavy or ruffled shapes. These forms are not only common in nature, but also offer new possibilities for the design of smart materials and soft robots. By uncovering the rules that govern the shapes and behaviors of these systems, the project advances our understanding of geometry in natural design and supports the development of next-generation materials inspired by biology. This research contributes to the national interest by promoting the progress of science through the development of new mathematical and computational tools for studying nonlinear systems and emergent behavior. It strengthens the connection between mathematics, physics, and engineering, while also offering applications in biology and materials science.

Since the number of particles is often very large, rather than analyzing each particle, one would like to understand qualitative and quantitative properties of such systems of particles through some macroscopic, averaged characteristics. In order to identify macroscopic behavior of multi-particle systems, it is helpful to study the asymptotic behavior when the number of particles approaches infinity, with the hope that the limit - which is typically described by a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) -  will approximate properties observed in the systems with a large finite number of particles. An example of an important phenomenon that describes such macroscopic behavior of a large system of particles is the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is a state of the matter of a dilute Bose gas at very low temperatures when the gas moves as a single particle.  Although the BEC was predicted in early days of quantum mechanics by Bose and Einstein, the first experimental realization came in 1995 (subsequently recognized by a Nobel Prize in physics). Since then mathematical models have been developed to understand such phenomena.  Those models connect large quantum systems of interacting particles and nonlinear PDE that are derived from such systems. In this project, the principal investigator (PI) and her team will work on advancing such models and developing new ones by relying on properties of underlying physical systems and on mathematical understanding of nonlinear PDE.<br/> <br/>In particular, recently remarkable progress has been achieved in understanding  how the dynamics of various nonlinear PDE such as, e.g.  nonlinear Schrodinger equation or Boltzmann equation arise from large systems of interacting particles.

The PI seeks to extend this principle to curved interfaces by extracting from the edge conductance an intersection number that accounts for the non-trivial geometry. The physical interpretation is that each connected component of the interface supports a number of edge modes equal to the Hall conductance difference.

In principle, the equations of physics, such as Newton?s laws of motion, allow to completely determine the behavior of each particle in the system for arbitrary periods of time. However, in practice, the large number of particles, and therefore the complexity of the system, far exceeds even the best computing resources. To answer questions of interest, one needs a simpler effective description that is a good approximation. Following the prescriptions of statistical mechanics, much effort over the years has been devoted to achieving a reduction in complexity through a point of view focused on the probability of finding at a given time a particle in the system at a certain position in space and moving with a certain velocity. A first approximation, known as the mean-field limit, effectively captures the ?typical behavior? of a particle in the system through a solution of a single equation, which is much simpler than the equations governing the exact motion of all the individual particles. However, our understanding of the mean-field limit over the timescales relevant for the system?s relaxation to equilibrium is quite poor. Additionally, the mean-field description ignores correlations between particles, created by their interactions and the thermal effects of the particles? environment, which capture the disorder of the system. Little is known about this disorder, which is encoded in the probability of deviations from the mean-field limit. The distribution of these deviations is the next-order approximation beyond the mean-field. The project will advance our understanding of how the system disorder grows with the number of particles and changes over time. The results are of direct application for the modeling of states of matter, such as plasmas, as well as problems with particle-like behavior, such as vortices in fluids or superconductors and the training of neural networks. The methods developed to tackle these problems, based on measuring how the energy or entropy of a system varies in space and time, will establish new connections between different areas of mathematics of independent interest. A key feature of the project is the integration of research and educational activities, promoting the goals of the Federal 5-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan. Through summer courses for advanced high-school students, new undergraduate curricula focused on mathematical communication, working groups, and supervising undergraduate and graduate student projects, the research program will provide opportunities for the mentorship and training of a new generation of researchers in the U.S. at this intersection of mathematics, physics, and statistics.<br/><br/>Building on the investigator?s extensive work, the project addresses fundamental, open questions for the large time, beyond leading order description of Coulomb/Riesz gases. The two main lines of investigation are (1) central limit theorems for fluctuations around the mean-field limit and cumulant expansions that capture the system disorder and corrections to the mean-field limit; (2) the interplay between generation of chaos in these systems (the phenomenon of the particles becoming independent and identically distributed in the joint large time and system size limit), log Sobolev inequalities (LSIs), and relaxation estimates for gradient flows. The project develops both the physical and mathematical understanding of Coulomb/Riesz gases. (1) advances several new conjectures for the scaling of fluctuations and cumulants, their limiting dynamics, and the optimal rate of convergence to Gaussianity, quantifying the disorder as a function of the system size, length scale of observation, temperature, and singularity of interaction. These questions are all open except in limited cases, and the project stands to shape the future direction of the field. (2) develops the new connection between generation of chaos and LSIs for Gibbs measures, which has wide application beyond Coulomb/Riesz gases, with emphasis on LSIs for nonconvex energies, which is a major challenge in the field. The project develops new mathematical tools, such as commutator and gradient flow relaxation estimates, which have potential applications across analysis/PDE and probability. Lastly, Coulomb/Riesz gases are an important testing ground for the longer-term goal of answering fundamental questions of statistical mechanics for more general systems arising in machine learning, physics, and statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These dynamics often involve rare events that can have large impacts, such as changes in protein structures or genetic evolution. Inaccurate predictions of these events can hinder our understanding of biological processes, drug design, and our ability to prepare for extreme events. This project seeks to improve our ability to predict and control these rare but critical events by identifying key patterns in energy landscapes and developing new methods for estimating fluctuations and controlling extreme events in complex spaces. The insights gained will not only help in predicting extreme events but also improve our understanding of various interactive behaviors, such as material design and social opinions. Educational initiatives will promote interdisciplinary learning and advance the growth of applied mathematics and related fields.<br/><br/>This project aims to predict and control rare, significant events in interactive dynamics on complex configuration spaces. The goal is to advance the theoretical understanding of Hamilton-Jacobi equations (HJEs) and control theory for multiscale interactions by addressing key challenges, including non-uniqueness of stationary solutions, fluctuation estimates in multiscale interactions, and singular optimal control in probability spaces. Theoretical developments will be applied to practical problems, such as rare event simulations, to enable more predictable dynamics in complex systems.  First, the investigator will develop a systematic method to select stationary solutions to HJEs, providing a uniformly converging vanishing viscosity approximation and a global energy landscape. Second, a novel decomposition for species concentration and reaction fluxes in non-equilibrium multiscale reactions will be introduced, along with a singular limit framework for fluctuation estimates. Third, rigorous justifications for the singular limit of variational solutions for HJEs with state constraints will be achieved via the equivalence between optimal control and optimal path measures for transition problems in infinite dimensional spaces, particularly in the presence of boundary singularities. The research outcomes will be disseminated through conferences, publications, and online platforms.

Collapse-type phenomena are mathematically described by solutions that remain self-similar as some of their attributes become unbounded in finite time. Self-similarity refers to preservation of shape when an appropriate scaling of space and time and solution amplitude is employed. Collapse phenomena are relevant to the focusing of light beams in optics and to atomic matter waves. Rogue waves have a characteristic length or time scale and extreme amplitudes; they are important in subjects such as hydrodynamics, nonlinear optics, and atomic and plasma physics. Using dynamical systems and computational techniques, this project aims to reformulate the underlying models and provide a unified approach to studying both collapse phenomena and rogue waves by treating the relevant patterns as self-similar solutions. The project is expected to provide insights on the mechanisms and reduced mathematical descriptions of collapse phenomena in some of the prototypical mathematical models that feature these potentially catastrophic focusing events, as well as on the formation, prediction, and analysis of extreme waves in both continuum and spatially discrete systems. The project will offer research training opportunities for students. <br/><br/>The project will explore a recently derived normal form for the study of self-focusing waves of the central dispersive wave model of the nonlinear Schrdinger equation and will seek generalizations for related models (such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation). Stability analysis of such collapsing waves is expected to shed light on the spectral properties and potential instabilities of such systems, their connection to symmetries, their implications for the dynamics in different settings (supercritical, critical, and subcritical), and their reinterpretation in the original ""non-exploding'' frame. A second focus of the project will be the study of rogue waves from a dynamical systems viewpoint, including characterization of stability via limits of time-periodic solutions and rogue waves in higher-order dispersion settings.

These equations are pertinent to a wide array of real-world applications and have been extensively researched. For instance, they are essential in understanding related phenomena in physics and biology, such as formation of severe weather conditions and collective animal behavior. Additionally, they play a vital role in addressing some of the nation?s most pressing issues such as weather prediction, aircraft design and collective dynamics modeling. Developing mathematical theories in this area is both challenging and immensely valuable for comprehending intricate behaviors. The primary focus of this project is to investigate the steady states of these equations. The main goal is to develop a comprehensive analytical framework that enhances the understanding of these steady states, including their existence, singular behavior, and stability. An integral part of this project is the educational component, which will offer training opportunities for students and provide platforms for professional development of young researchers in PDEs and analysis. <br/><br/>This project contains three interrelated directions. The first direction focuses on the three-dimensional (3D) incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), progressing toward a comprehensive understanding of an important class of steady states with scaling-invariance property. The plan is to first address the existence of these solutions and then investigate their singularity behavior and classification. The second direction aims to understand the stability of steady states of the 3D incompressible NSE, building on the results from the first direction, where new analytical tools with more general applications are developed. The third direction studies the aggregation-diffusion equation. The goal is to study the steady states of the equation and whether the dynamics converge to the steady states, as well as the stability of the related interaction energy.

This research will yield important new methods for modeling chemical mixing, biologically active fluids, and geophysical systems. Improving methods for these domain settings will provide more effective tools to address important problems such as the spread of pathogens or pollutants or to quantify the degree and type of climate hazards. The investigators will develop new methodologies for calibrating and designing effective measurement strategies of these various fluid systems, which simultaneously resolve degrees of the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. This project involves the training and active participation of a number of graduate students and other earlier career scientists. The cross institutional and cross disciplinary nature of this project will provide unique opportunities for the participants.<br/> <br/>Recent advances in computational infrastructure combined with novel mathematical formulations and newly discovered algorithms have allowed the extension of the Bayesian approach to new classes of physics-constrained inverse problems. Solutions typically take many times the computational power of a single solve of a nonlinear forward map based on a partial differential equations (PDEs) where the estimation concerns a function rather than a finite collection of numerical values, namely where we are interested in estimating an infinite-dimensional unknown parameter. The investigators will undertake a research program at the intersection of stochastic and functional analysis, high-performance computing, nonlinear PDEs, and fluid dynamics. Specifically, the investigators will (1) consider a series of physically motivated PDE inverse problems with infinite-dimensional unknowns; (2) develop novel algorithms adapted to efficiently sample from infinite-dimensional measures; (3) develop the ergodic theory for certain classes of infinite-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to rigorously assess rates of convergence in sampling target posterior measures; and (4) analyze consistency in the large data observation limit for infinite dimensional models. The project contributes effective frameworks for the measurement of turbulent fluid flows from sparse, irregular data while developing sampling methods of broader interest across computational statistics and data science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include ecological dynamics in a varied environment and fluctuating flame fronts in combustion. Nonetheless, such systems often exhibit tractable behavior when viewed at large or fine scales. This ""asymptotic"" behavior plays a major role in applications, and often has a universal character that unites the study of disparate systems. In this project, the principal investigator (PI) will combine several mathematical methods to identify and justify asymptotic phenomena in partial differential equations (PDEs) originating in the sciences. This work has the potential to shed light on a variety of systems including ecological invasion, atomic deposition, and fluid shock formation. The PI is committed to undergraduate and graduate mentorship, with the particular aim of supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds. <br/><br/>This project will explore the asymptotic behavior of various deterministic and stochastic PDEs in significant limiting regimes. The project comprises three interconnected lines of work. (1) The PI will study the long-time propagation speed and front structure of solutions to reaction-diffusion equations in heterogeneous and random environments. This investigation encompasses a dual analysis of associated branching particle systems. (2) The PI will combine analytic and probabilistic methods to study long-time and white-noise limits of several physically motivated stochastic PDEs, including stochastic conservation laws and stochastic heat equations near criticality. (3) The PI will investigate the action of weak viscosity on internal shock formation in the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. This involves a delicate coupling between hyperbolic and parabolic approximations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These lasers are configured to produce periodically stationary pulses by propagating light many times around a loop. Although different physical effects change the shape of the pulse as it traverses the loop, the pulse returns to the same shape once each period (round trip). A significant challenge for the modeling of these lasers is that from one generation to the next there has been a dramatic increase in the amount by which the pulse breathes, necessitating novel mathematical approaches. This project will develop theoretical and computational methods to determine periodically stationary pulse solutions of nonlinear wave equations modeling laser systems and to analyze their stability (robustness in the presence of random noise and other system perturbations). The project will provide computational tools to aid in the design of high energy lasers for medical applications, and of frequency combs for highly accurate measurements of time and frequency, with applications to geo-location systems, time and frequency standards, the calibration of astronomical instruments, and trace gas sensing. The project will provide broad training in applied mathematics for doctoral students and mentoring for junior faculty. In addition, the project will support complementary activity focused on pedagogical innovations. <br/> <br/>The laser models to be studied in this project are based on variants of the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Classically, the spectrum of a stationary nonlinear wave is given by the zero set of the Evans function of the linearized differential operator. The stability of periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of fiber lasers will be characterized in terms of the spectrum of the monodromy operator of the linearization about the pulse. Since the stability problem for time-periodic solutions is formulated on a cylinder, rather than on the real line, any generalization of the Evans function will involve Fredholm determinants of operators on infinite-dimensional function spaces rather than classical determinants of matrices. To avoid the extreme stiffness of the differential equations used to compute the Evans function in this infinite dimensional context, the point spectrum of the monodromy operator will be identified with the zero set of an infinite-dimensional Fredholm determinant of a Birman-Schwinger operator on an infinite cylinder. Numerical methods will be developed to compute Fredholm determinants of such Birman-Schwinger operators. These methods will then be employed to determine stability regions in design parameter space for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of experimental fiber laser systems. The generic instability of stationary solutions of reaction diffusion equations has recently been established by applying a related topological invariant called the Maslov index to the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators. A novel version of the Maslov index will be used to establish general stability results for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
