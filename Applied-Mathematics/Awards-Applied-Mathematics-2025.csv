This project focuses on topological phases of matter, a novel class of materials that conduct electricity along their edges in a way that remains unaffected by defects or noise. This makes them ideal to improve quantum computations - which are notoriously sensitive to noise. This project aims to stimulate innovations in quantum technology by unlocking a deeper understanding of how electrons behave in these materials. The project investigates how stable currents emerge between topologically distinct phases; compute their profile and their speed; and derive effective equations for their propagation. The educational component of this project seeks to inspire students by emphasizing the vital role of mathematical skills in today's professional landscape. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to organize a monthly talk series, ""Y Math?"", which features industry leaders showcasing how mathematics drives innovation across diverse fields. <br/><br/>The first research track of this project focuses on topological insulators, materials whose Hamiltonians have a spectral gap and a topologically non-trivial Fermi projector. For straight interfaces, the bulk-edge correspondence predicts that the conductance along an interface between insulating phases of matter is equal to the Hall conductance jump across the interface. The PI seeks to extend this principle to curved interfaces by extracting from the edge conductance an intersection number that accounts for the non-trivial geometry. The physical interpretation is that each connected component of the interface supports a number of edge modes equal to the Hall conductance difference. The PI also intends to compute high-frequency corrections to the bulk-edge correspondence in the continuum - where this principle is sometimes violated. The second research track of the project focuses on Weyl semimetals, three-dimensional crystals with conical intersections in their band structure. Despite an extensive physics literature, there is no known example of Schrödinger operator with Weyl points. The PI plans to show that Weyl points nonetheless appear generically in the band spectrum of Schrödinger operators in three dimensions and produce explicit examples as parity-breaking perturbations of face-centered and body-centered cubic crystals. By studying resolvent expansions for adiabatic modulations of these crystals, the PI plans to show that interfaces support topologically protected surface states: three-dimensional analogues of the robust edge states emerging between two-dimensional topological phases. These projects require tools from spectral theory, multiscale analysis and topology that will serve the mathematical community at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particles repel or attract one another, and importantly, this repulsion or attraction may become increasingly strong as particles become increasingly close together. In principle, the equations of physics, such as Newton?s laws of motion, allow to completely determine the behavior of each particle in the system for arbitrary periods of time. However, in practice, the large number of particles, and therefore the complexity of the system, far exceeds even the best computing resources. To answer questions of interest, one needs a simpler effective description that is a good approximation. Following the prescriptions of statistical mechanics, much effort over the years has been devoted to achieving a reduction in complexity through a point of view focused on the probability of finding at a given time a particle in the system at a certain position in space and moving with a certain velocity. A first approximation, known as the mean-field limit, effectively captures the ?typical behavior? of a particle in the system through a solution of a single equation, which is much simpler than the equations governing the exact motion of all the individual particles. However, our understanding of the mean-field limit over the timescales relevant for the system?s relaxation to equilibrium is quite poor. Additionally, the mean-field description ignores correlations between particles, created by their interactions and the thermal effects of the particles? environment, which capture the disorder of the system. Little is known about this disorder, which is encoded in the probability of deviations from the mean-field limit. The distribution of these deviations is the next-order approximation beyond the mean-field. The project will advance our understanding of how the system disorder grows with the number of particles and changes over time. The results are of direct application for the modeling of states of matter, such as plasmas, as well as problems with particle-like behavior, such as vortices in fluids or superconductors and the training of neural networks. The methods developed to tackle these problems, based on measuring how the energy or entropy of a system varies in space and time, will establish new connections between different areas of mathematics of independent interest. A key feature of the project is the integration of research and educational activities, promoting the goals of the Federal 5-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan. Through summer courses for advanced high-school students, new undergraduate curricula focused on mathematical communication, working groups, and supervising undergraduate and graduate student projects, the research program will provide opportunities for the mentorship and training of a new generation of researchers in the U.S. at this intersection of mathematics, physics, and statistics.<br/><br/>Building on the investigator?s extensive work, the project addresses fundamental, open questions for the large time, beyond leading order description of Coulomb/Riesz gases. The two main lines of investigation are (1) central limit theorems for fluctuations around the mean-field limit and cumulant expansions that capture the system disorder and corrections to the mean-field limit; (2) the interplay between generation of chaos in these systems (the phenomenon of the particles becoming independent and identically distributed in the joint large time and system size limit), log Sobolev inequalities (LSIs), and relaxation estimates for gradient flows. The project develops both the physical and mathematical understanding of Coulomb/Riesz gases. (1) advances several new conjectures for the scaling of fluctuations and cumulants, their limiting dynamics, and the optimal rate of convergence to Gaussianity, quantifying the disorder as a function of the system size, length scale of observation, temperature, and singularity of interaction. These questions are all open except in limited cases, and the project stands to shape the future direction of the field. (2) develops the new connection between generation of chaos and LSIs for Gibbs measures, which has wide application beyond Coulomb/Riesz gases, with emphasis on LSIs for nonconvex energies, which is a major challenge in the field. The project develops new mathematical tools, such as commutator and gradient flow relaxation estimates, which have potential applications across analysis/PDE and probability. Lastly, Coulomb/Riesz gases are an important testing ground for the longer-term goal of answering fundamental questions of statistical mechanics for more general systems arising in machine learning, physics, and statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This meeting will be the third event in a sequence of annual JAF DEDS conferences moving between Auburn, UAB, FIU, FSU. The sizable growth of applied mathematicians specializing in partial differential equations and applied dynamical systems in the states of Alabama and Florida has led to new level of research activity in mathematical biology, fluid dynamics, medical imaging, mathematical physics, applied harmonic analysis and spectral theory. This regional conference series connects newly formed and existing research groups and provides opportunity for dissemination of recent results, especially to early career researchers without federal funding, facilitating interaction between an increasing number of regional graduate students and the internationally recognized experts in the field. The Third JAF DEDS Conference will be preceded by a graduate students day on May 20th, 2025, featuring two mini-courses by guest presenters and a professional development panel. Priority for financial support will be given to those with no other sources of support and special attention will be given to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career researchers. <br/> <br/>The tools and techniques from dynamical systems have been used to establish existence and investigate stability of special solutions (pulses, traveling waves, steady states, and fronts) for large variety of differential equations. These solution are often used to model complex physical phenomena across a range of applications, including evolution of surface water waves, coherent structures in optics, combustion phenomena, and plasma dynamics. Motivated by the recent progress, the scientific program of the conference will be centered around a variety of equations from the mathematical physics modeling optical systems, fluid motion and waves in novel materials. These systems are described by equations of Klein-Gordon or Nonlinear Schrodinger type and are either Hamiltonian or dissipative in nature. Understanding them will improve our theoretical knowledge and provide new insights into practical aspects of nonlinear optics, electronic transport in irregular media, new materials, and fluid dynamics. The goal of this conference is to connect researchers working in different aspects of PDE's and Dynamical Systems and to explore the deep connections between these fields, as well as to stimulate interactions among regional experts in these areas, graduate students and junior researchers.

These equations are pertinent to a wide array of real-world applications and have been extensively researched. For instance, they are essential in understanding related phenomena in physics and biology, such as formation of severe weather conditions and collective animal behavior. Additionally, they play a vital role in addressing some of the nation?s most pressing issues such as weather prediction, aircraft design and collective dynamics modeling. Developing mathematical theories in this area is both challenging and immensely valuable for comprehending intricate behaviors. The primary focus of this project is to investigate the steady states of these equations. The main goal is to develop a comprehensive analytical framework that enhances the understanding of these steady states, including their existence, singular behavior, and stability. An integral part of this project is the educational component, which will offer training opportunities for students and provide platforms for professional development of young researchers in PDEs and analysis. <br/><br/>This project contains three interrelated directions. The first direction focuses on the three-dimensional (3D) incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), progressing toward a comprehensive understanding of an important class of steady states with scaling-invariance property. The plan is to first address the existence of these solutions and then investigate their singularity behavior and classification. The second direction aims to understand the stability of steady states of the 3D incompressible NSE, building on the results from the first direction, where new analytical tools with more general applications are developed. The third direction studies the aggregation-diffusion equation. The goal is to study the steady states of the equation and whether the dynamics converge to the steady states, as well as the stability of the related interaction energy.

This research will yield important new methods for modeling chemical mixing, biologically active fluids, and geophysical systems. Improving methods for these domain settings will provide more effective tools to address important problems such as the spread of pathogens or pollutants or to quantify the degree and type of climate hazards. The investigators will develop new methodologies for calibrating and designing effective measurement strategies of these various fluid systems, which simultaneously resolve degrees of the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. This project involves the training and active participation of a number of graduate students and other earlier career scientists. The cross institutional and cross disciplinary nature of this project will provide unique opportunities for the participants.<br/> <br/>Recent advances in computational infrastructure combined with novel mathematical formulations and newly discovered algorithms have allowed the extension of the Bayesian approach to new classes of physics-constrained inverse problems. Solutions typically take many times the computational power of a single solve of a nonlinear forward map based on a partial differential equations (PDEs) where the estimation concerns a function rather than a finite collection of numerical values, namely where we are interested in estimating an infinite-dimensional unknown parameter. The investigators will undertake a research program at the intersection of stochastic and functional analysis, high-performance computing, nonlinear PDEs, and fluid dynamics. Specifically, the investigators will (1) consider a series of physically motivated PDE inverse problems with infinite-dimensional unknowns; (2) develop novel algorithms adapted to efficiently sample from infinite-dimensional measures; (3) develop the ergodic theory for certain classes of infinite-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to rigorously assess rates of convergence in sampling target posterior measures; and (4) analyze consistency in the large data observation limit for infinite dimensional models.

Examples include ecological dynamics in a varied environment and fluctuating flame fronts in combustion. Nonetheless, such systems often exhibit tractable behavior when viewed at large or fine scales. This ""asymptotic"" behavior plays a major role in applications, and often has a universal character that unites the study of disparate systems. In this project, the principal investigator (PI) will combine several mathematical methods to identify and justify asymptotic phenomena in partial differential equations (PDEs) originating in the sciences. This work has the potential to shed light on a variety of systems including ecological invasion, atomic deposition, and fluid shock formation.

The project comprises three interconnected lines of work. (1) The PI will study the long-time propagation speed and front structure of solutions to reaction-diffusion equations in heterogeneous and random environments. This investigation encompasses a dual analysis of associated branching particle systems. (2) The PI will combine analytic and probabilistic methods to study long-time and white-noise limits of several physically motivated stochastic PDEs, including stochastic conservation laws and stochastic heat equations near criticality.
