The emphasis  is on the development of new accurate, robust and efficient  computational techniques.  Approximation strategies involving  standard Galerkin finite element methods, novel least-squares  methods, and mixed finite element methods are studied especially  from the standpoint of their accuracy and stability.

The broad objective of this program is to use the full power  of rigorous mathematics both to analyze the behavior of numerical  methods currently used in scientific computation and to develop  new algorithms exhibiting improved accuracy, stability and  performance.  More efficient and scalable algorithms can have a  significant impact on the development of effective simulators for  understanding physical processes of national importance.  For  example, computer modeling of ground water processes involve the  solution of large complex systems of nonlinear partial  differential equations.  The results of these simulations provide  important predictive information that can influence decisions  with regard to ground water remediation strategies and national  conservation programs.  Due to the complexity in the geometry and  the physical processes, meaningful simulations overwhelm today's  most powerful parallel computers and hence the need for more  effective numerical techniques.  The techniques developed are  applicable as well to problems such as simulation of smart  materials, heat and mass transfer, and high  performance  computing."

The main issue concerns the   possibility of stabilizing a system in the absence of complete information about  the system. For instance, a feedback control which stabilizes a system might  have unmodeled small time delays in the feedback loop that adversely affect  the stability of the system.  It is therefore important to determine when and  how this occurs, and to decide what modifications in the feedback loop are  needed to alleviate the problem.  A related issue concerns systems in which the  only data available for use in a control design is a sampled-data observation of  the actual system, or a numerical approximation of that system. This research  will determine when stabilization of an unknown system is possible based on  such limited information. The approach taken is system theoretic in the sense  that results are developed for a large class of abstract state space systems and  frequency domain systems, and then applied to vibration control problems for  specific systems.  Many of the problems require approaches which combine  partial differential equation techniques, frequency domain techniques and state  space techniques.  %%%  One of the principal issues in the design of stabilizing feedbacks for vibrating  systems is that of design of a feedback control based on incomplete  information of the system.  An important paradigm of such a system occurs in  structural acoustics.  In this problem, sound waves are present within a cavity,  such as an airplane cabin, and part of the boundary of the cavity is subject to  vibrations due, for example, to an aircraft engine mounted near one of the walls  of the cabin.  Wall vibrations may either amplify or attenuate the sound waves,  and one of the applications of this research is to use the wall vibrations to  accomplish the latter.  Modern techniques used to accomplish this use  piezoceramic patches th at impart bending moments on the vibrating wall when  voltages are applied to them.  Numerical experiments suggest that some of  these stabilization schemes may be rendered ineffective by very small time  delays that naturally arise in the feedback loop.  Such delays cannot be  precisely determined, so it is important to decide what modifications in the  feedback loop are needed to alleviate the problem.  This project is will address  precisely such issue in the general context of stabilization of infinite-  dimensional vibrating systems based on incomplete information of the system,  or based on sampled data.  ***"

By combining the  techniques of nonconforming elements, macro elements, singular  functions and mixed formulations, robust finite element methods  that employ relatively few numbers of unknowns can be developed  to overcome these difficulties.  The  investigator develops  multigrid and domain decomposition algorithms for such finite  element methods.       Multigrid algorithms compute the solutions of systems of  equations at a cost proportional to the number of unknowns and  therefore are the most efficient methods for solving large  systems.  Domain decomposition algorithms distribute the  computation over different parts of the physical domain and hence  are very suitable for parallel computers.  They are currently two  of the major ideas in high performance computing.  The results  from this project can lead to fast solvers for problems in  elasticity, plasticity, plates, beams, shells, and fluid  mechanics.  In particular, a new multigrid method is developed for  the computation of stress intensity factors, which are important  quantities in the study of the macroscopic phenomena of materials  such as fatigues and fractures.  These problems arise in the  design of structures such as buildings, bridges, planes, and  ships, and in the analysis of how structures perform.  Hence the  project provides tools for solving problems of manufacturing and  of monitoring and renewing civil infrastructure."

The first main area involves  the question of whether it is possible, even in principle, for  long-term computer simulations of typical nonhyperbolic chaotic  systems to approximately match true system behavior.  Part of this  research involves developing quantitative laws of the expected  waiting time between breakdowns, or mismatches, between computer  simulation trajectories and the trajectories of computer models.  The second major area is ongoing work by the investigator on the  interpretation of physical and biological experiments that  generate aperiodic time series.  Using univariate or multivariate  time series or inter-event time intervals produced by a  deterministic physical process, the phase space of the process  can be faithfully reconstructed as the basis for applications  such as system identification, filtering, prediction and control.  Topological and diffeomorphic embedding theorems guaranteeing  this in various physically verifiable contexts have been the  results of previous and ongoing research by the investigator and  coworkers.       Computer simulations are a staple of modern science.  National policy decisions are being made which rely partially on  the interpretation of long-term computer simulations of nonlinear  models.  The questions explored in the proposal are critical to  the analysis of simulations of nonlinear processes.  One goal of  this proposal is to explore these questions in physically  relevant models, and in particular to isolate and quantify the  limitations of these representations, especially for the purpose  of long-term modeling.  The second focus of this research is the  interpretation of data collected from chaotic systems in  experiments and nature.  Complex deterministic time series are  being identified in physical, chemical, engineering and  biological/medical setti ngs.  As an example, hippocampal slices  from mammals and other small neural systems are studied by the  investigator, in conjunction with a group of medical researchers  headed by a neurosurgeon specializing in epilepsy, with the  purpose of detecting deterministic information processing in the  brain.  The investigator has done previous work on expanding these  conceptual foundations and developing related computational  implementations, and works to widen their areas of validity and  increase their power for the study of complex systems in natural,  experimental, and engineering-related contexts.  New techniques  for these applications are developed in this project, involving  methods from numerical analysis used in conjunction with existing  signal processing methods."

To  build more realistic models. (2).  To search new mechanisms that  can generate new epidemiological phenomena. (3).  To stimulate  mathematical development of more effective tools for model  analysis.  Many of the previously studied models are special cases  of the SEIRS type.  On the one hand, a new analytical method  developed by the investigator and his collaborators makes  rigorous mathematical analysis of the SEIRS models with varying  populations feasible and is a main tool in this project.  On the  other, problems of mathematical interest arising from the model  analysis are thoroughly studied in a general mathematical  setting.  Computation also plays a important role, complementing  analytical methods and testing the model using clinical or  experimental data.       The use of mathematical models to describe the spread of an  infectious disease in a human or animal population has a long  history.  If the disease spreads through direct contact of  individuals, a susceptible individual first becomes infected  through contact with an infectious member; he then stays in the  latent period before becoming infectious; after this he recovers  from the infection with temporary immunity and later becomes  susceptible again when the acquired immunity is lost.  Death due  to both natural causes and infection may occur during the cycle.  The population is divided into four subclasses:  susceptibles,  exposed (those in the latent period), infectious, and recovered,  according to the four stages in the above cycle.  An SEIRS model  for the spread of the infection is a system of ordinary  differential equations that describes how the number of  individuals in each class changes with time and how they  interact, based on various assumptions on the way contacts  between individuals are made as well as on various environmental  effects.  Note that every member of the p opulation is in one of  these classes, so if the disease causes death then the population  size varies with time too.  It is expected that research on SEIRS  epidemiological models with varying population size can  significantly advance our understanding of the transmission  dynamics for many diseases and our interpretation of complex  clinical data, foster more accurate predictions on the time  course of the spread of an infection, and lead to more effective  disease prevention and control strategies.  This is especially  significant today, given the alarming global resurgence of many  infectious diseases."

In this proposal a combination of  numerical and analytical techniques will be used. We propose to  determine the domain of existence of invariant tori both by using  recursive generation of the Fourier series for the tori, and by  continuation of the Cantor sets from the anti-integrable limit. The  goal is to develop methods for estimating practical stability  boundaries and for investigating the transition to chaotic behavior.  Computations will determine the robustness of the tori of various  frequency vectors, leading to a generalization of the noble numbers  that provide the most robust frequencies in two dimensions.  A study  of one dimensional, resonant tori will also be undertaken-these may be  more persistent than two-tori, and form an important component of the  barriers to transport. Transport in four dimensions. will be studied  by numerical computation of exit time decompositions for cylinders of  various homotopy types. Our goal is the development of a geometrical  description of trapping regions and resonance zones and a  characterization of the practical stability domain around an elliptic  point. New techniques for control of transport will be developed for  symplectic systems.    All of the fundamental equations of physics are formulated as  Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We propose to study the structure of  the orbits of these systems with the motivation being to understand  the problem of ""transport."" This is of primary importance in such  areas as particle accelerator confinement, chemical reaction rates,  fluid mixing, plasma confinement in magnetic fusion devices, asteroid  and planetary ring stability, etc. The basic question is: how does a  system evolve from one state (e.g. a confined beam in an accelerator),  to another (e.g. beam hits the tunnel wall), and how long does this  take. Typi cally trajectories must wend their way through exotic  structures such as Cantor sets and self-similar fractals, some of  which exhibit a remarkable ""stickiness"", in order to move through the  phase space. The construction and visualization of these structures  requires careful computer study guided by mathematical insight. A  major problem is that the systems of interest correspond to four and  higher dimensional spaces--our ordinary three-dimensional intuition  fails. In various applications transport is either to be encouraged  (speeding up reaction rates) or discouraged (confining particles); we  will investigate techniques for accomplishing both tasks.  ***"

The main goal of  the research is to provide a better theoretical understanding of  how the spatial aspects of an environment such as size, shape,  and geographic variability can affect populations or communities  inhabiting the environment.  The underlying motivation is to  address questions about such topics as the optimal design for  nature reserves or the likely ecological effects of modifying  environments or introducing new species into them.  The  investigators construct and analyze mathematical models for the  interactions between spatially distributed populations and their  environment and/or other populations.  Most of the models involve  partial differential equations, primarily reaction-diffusion  equations and systems, often with explicit spatial dependence in  the coefficients.  Some of the models are based on specific  biological situations, and others are designed to answer more  general questions about spatial effects.  These two aspects of the  research overlap to some extent.  For example, the investigators  study a model of interactions between aphids and ladybird beetles  that involves multiple spatial scales.  The modeling techniques  are designed to treat that specific system but are also relevant  to other problems involving multiple scales.  A primary goal of  the mathematical analysis is determining whether models predict  extinction or persistence for the populations they describe.  To  address that issue the investigators extend and apply the notion  of uniform persistence from the theory of dynamical systems and  search for alternative approaches to the analysis of persistence.  Other important components of the mathematical methodology are  nonlinear analysis (especially bifurcation theory and related  topics), maximum principles and comparison methods, and the  spectral theory of elliptic operators.  A secondary research goal  is to  obtain new mathematical results that are useful in the  context of applications.       The investigators study ways of using mathematics to  understand ecological problems.  The problems mostly involve  spatial aspects of the environment; for example, how to design  the most effective type of buffer zones for nature reserves, or  how to predict the likely effects of the fragmentation of natural  habitats on the populations that inhabit them.  The problems also  involve interactions between different biological species, for  example predators and prey.  The methodology is to express the  essential features of a biological system in terms of equations  and then to perform a mathematical analysis of the equations to  determine what they predict.  The analysis often requires the  development of new mathematical results, which may be of use to  other investigators.  A typical goal of the analysis is to  determine the effects of various environmental and biological  factors on the persistence or extinction of populations.  A  reason for using mathematical models is that in situations  involving endangered species, genetically engineered organisms,  or large scale environmental change, it is often impossible to do  experiments but crucial to have some idea of what to expect.  Some of the models are directly motivated by problems in refuge  design or pest control.  Others are motivated by basic scientific  questions about the effects of the spatial aspects of  environments on populations, but even those may eventually prove  to be relevant to issues raised in the contexts of environmental  protection and the biological effects of global change."

For the  specific geometries of a three-dimensional cylinder or a two-dimensional  rectangle, the spatial decay of solutions of elliptic partial differential  equations (or systems of equations) arises in consideration of the classic  Saint-Venant principle in elasticity theory.  Such problems also arise in  entry flows for viscous incompressible fluids.  Generalizations to   include principles of Phragmen- Lindelof type are also of interest.  In this proposal, it is planned to analytically investigate a sequence of  boundary-value problems for second-order and fourth-order elliptic partial  differential equations.  Both linear and nonlinear, isotropic and   anisotropic problems are considered.  The results of such investigations have widespread technological impact.  In particular, rigorously obtained asymptotic estimates for the rate of   decay of solutions of continuum mechanics problems are immediately applicable  in engineering analysis and design.  The problems to be investigated  involve mathematical models for advanced composite materials and structures.   %%%    Structures of technological interest such as automotive and aircraft parts,  rocket casings, helicopter blades, hollow shafts and containment vessels,  are often constructed of layers of anisotropic, filament or fiber-reinforced   materials which must be designed to remain elastic.  The proper analysis   of such structures in current high-performance technology requires careful  mathematical analysis of basic issues.  It is proposed to study the safe  and efficient performance of these  structures using results from the theory   of partial differential equations.  In particular, simplified,  cost-effective asymptotic methods will be used.  The scope of the  investigation will include both linear and nonlinear problems, and one of  the underlying goals is that of efficient use of  materials.  It is known, for  example, that considerations of nonlinear effects in composites often lead  to striking differences from predictions of linearized theories.  In view   of the rapid utilization of advanced composite materials in current   technology, mathematical studies on large deformations of such materials  promise to have widespread impact on the mechanics and materials knowledge  and technology base.  Applications to specific composite architectures  of interest, for example, to the Boeing Company and NASA will be made.    ***"

Stochastic adaptive control is the control of an incompletely   known stochastic system.  Typically to solve an adaptive control problem it   is necessary to identify the unknown parameters of the system and   simultaneously to construct a control based on an ergodic cost functional.    The stochastic systems to be considered include finite dimensional, linear   and nonlinear systems and infinite dimensional systems that include both   linear and semilinear partial differential equations.  The control for the   partial differential equations can occur only on the boundary or at discrete   points.  Some specific systems include stochastic models in the mathematics   of finance and in stochastic manufacturing processes.  Since self-optimal   adaptive controls often cannot be determined or may not exist, the   construction of almost optimal adaptive controls will be continued.  An   important component of this study is the computational investigations in   adaptive control which includes the performance of estimation algorithms   and adaptive controls.    Many important physical systems are controlled.  Typically a system is not   completely known and often there are perturbations or errors that can be   naturally modeled by noise.  The control of an unknown system with noise   is called stochastic adaptive control.  This project will investigate some   stochastic adaptive control problems that have applications to some   important physical systems.

Efforts are directed toward the  study of bubbly fluids.  A goal is to develop effective equations  for such fluids.  The first step is to derive the equations of  motion for a finite collection of interacting bubbles.  The  behavior for an infinite number of bubbles is deduced from kinetic  theory, which gives rise to a kinetic equation that is a  coarse-grained description of the mixture.  This procedure has been  implemented to derive two sets of effective equations that  describe concentration and sound waves in an ideal bubbly flow.  In both situations it is observed that the spatially homogeneous  solution may be unstable.  In the first case the instability  results in the bubbles clustering and in the later case it  indicates the bubble oscillations will synchronize to each other.  A damping mechanism similar to Landau damping is found in the  stable case.  This is connected to the spectral theory of linear  operators with a continuous spectrum and has no finite-dimensional  analogue.  The investigator extends this work to investigate the  interaction of acoustic modes with convective modes.  The theory  will also be broadened to include the effects of gravity, liquid  viscosity and bubble size distribution.  With a view towards a more  general theory of bubbly flow, the investigator examines the  effects of a small, slowing varying vorticity field on an ideal  bubbly flow.  It is anticipated that the studies will be performed  in collaboration with a graduate student.  In addition to its  relevance to engineering problems, this project contains  substantial educational aspects.  The student will be exposed to  fluid mechanics, potential theory, Hamiltonian mechanics, kinetic  theory, spectral theory of linear operators, and numerical  methods.  A new graduate level mathematics class is also developed  on the numerical solution of interface problems with level sets.  The advantage of this  approach is that it handles topology changes  naturally and easily.  This class is expected to attract not only  mathematics students but science and engineering students as well,  because interface problems have wide-spread interest.       An important emphasis of this project is to further enhance  the applied mathematics program in the mathematics department at  the University of Michigan and promote education at the interface  between mathematics and engineering.  One aspect of this project is  to develop effective equations for bubbly fluids.  A bubbly fluid  is a dispersion of gas bubbles in a liquid and can be found in a  variety natural and industrial settings.  The effective equations  will give a bulk or coarse-grained description of this mixture.  At  the present time computer resources do not exist to numerically  simulate directly a bubbly fluid.  For this reason considerable  effort has been made in the development of models for bubbly  fluids.  The other aspect of the project is to incorporate  applications of mathematics in a significant portion of  mathematics classes.

The starting place for a theory of open  channels is a theory of electrodiffusion. It has  long been known that a theory should include the  phenomena of shielding or screening, whereby  the ions in the ionic atmosphere in and around  the channel protein help determine the potential  profile of its pore, but mathematical difficulties  were severe, and analysis was usually focused on  the ionic atmosphere at the surface of the  membrane or end of the channel and not the co-  and counter-ions within the channel's pore.  These difficulties have recently been overcome.  The project develops  PNP theory to predict the current through  the channel, given its structure and distribution of  fixed (i.e., permanent) charge. The project uses Poisson's  equation to describe how charge on ions and the  channel protein determines the electric field; and  the Nernst-Planck equations to describe  migration and diffusion of ions in gradients of  potential and concentration.    The study of open channels is an important  component of biotechnology because channels  have great biological importance in their role as  gatekeepers to cells: they are responsible for  signaling in the nervous system; they coordinate  the contraction of the heart, so it can act as a  pump; in general, they are receptors or effectors  for many drugs and natural substances that  control the life of cells. Channels are wonderful  objects to study by high speed computing  because they use such simple physics (diffusion)  to perform important biological function. The  computation of diffusion is much simpler than  the computation of the quantum mechanics  involved in so many enzymatic functions.  Channels are also natural nanotubes and so are of  importance in the emerging area of  nanostructures, materials and manufacturing.  Porin is particularly well suited in this regard  since it  is available in large quantities, it can be  easily modified by the methods of biotechnology,  and its structure is known in atomic detail."

He will attempt to use methods of homogenization theory   in combination with the Bloch-Floquet expansion to understand various types   of resonances for wave propagation in composite materials consisting of an  array of piezoceramic rods embedded in a polymer matrix. He will study   two main classes of such problems. The first is where the acoustic   wavelength is comparable with dimensions of the composite microstructure   (long wave approximation). Here he will attempt to find the dependence of   the quality of electromechanical power conversion on the frequency and the   volume fraction of the piezoceramic phase and explain theoretically existing  numerical data for the thickness-mode resonance. This includes the   ""backing effect, i.e., the dependence of the resonance frequencies on the   stiffness of the backing medium. The second main class of problems that the   investigator will study  is the high-frequency regime when the acoustic   wavelength is comparable to the microstructure scale. The main effort here  is to extend homogenization ideas to the range of frequencies where the  composite material exhibits significant ""cross-talk"" between piezoceramic  rods. He will also study the transitional behavior between  these two  frequency regimes. The proposed work lies at the frontier   between mathematics and composites, and the investigator is planning to   support theoretical results by experimental and numerical data obtained at   the Penn State Materials Research Lab.  %%%   A composite material is a mixture of two or more single phase materials  (constituents) whose properties are far better than that of each constituent.  That is why composite materials are widely used in many areas of modern   technology and manufacturing.  In particular, piezocomposites are the   principal elements of modern acous tic transducers.  High-frequency   acoustic  transducers are used  for ultrasound medical imaging  and non-destructive testing of damaged materials. Low-   frequency transducers are used for underwater acoustics (so-called   hydrophones) as well as for  finding  fish, tracking vessels and   deep-sea seismology. Rapid advances in mathematical sciences within the   last 30 years open the possibility of understanding the general principles   and relationships linking the overall properties of such composite   materials to the properties of their constituents. This in turn makes it   possible to design more efficient, lower cost transducers.   However, progress has been hampered by expensive and time consuming   experiments and  by the enormous complexity of the phenomena. Huge   improvements in the ability to measure the properties of composite   materials have led to better characterization of their properties. However,   this precision of measurement has not been matched by corresponding   improvements in the mathematical theory, which could guide the   experimental study and industrial design of the transducers. This project   will involve devising and improving mathematical techniques and methods   for the study and design of piezoceramic composites for transducer applications.   The investigator will attempt to use modern mathematical techniques and tools   to understand various types of resonances for wave propagation in   polymer piezoceramic composites. This study will provide practical   recommendations for increasing the sensitivity and resolution   range of the transducers.   ***"

In   the first part of the proposal we deal with two unsolved problems of   this kind, namely the microcanonical ensemble for: point vortices;  for classical gravitating hard particles. In both systems one has   encountered technical problems due to nonconcavity of the entropy.  We propose a new strategy that circumvents these problems by   reinstalling concavity in a higher-dimensional parameter space  from which the original problem obtains by some kind of projection.  Progress in this area should significantly advance our understanding   of nonlinear PDE without convexity and their relation to statistical  mechanics. In the second part of the proposed project we deal directly  with properties of systems of nonlinear PDEs that are firmly established  in their relationship to statistical mechanics. Our main interest is in   the symmetry properties of solutions. We recently constructed sharp   isoperimetric estimates for two-dimensional elliptic PDE systems and   compared them to a priori identities of Rellich-Pohozaev type, thus   firstly obtaining conditions under which solutions are radially symmetric   without requiring uniqueness or minimizing properties. We want to   continue this research and optimize the conditions for two-dimensional   elliptic systems such as Ginzburg-Landau and Bennett equations, extend   the technique to higher dimensions and apply it to Thomas-Fermi models,  finally extend the technique to parabolic transport equations such as  Landau-Boltzmann equations, which in particular should yield a global   existence result in time.   %%%  Long-lived vortices are an ubiquitous feature   in turbulent flows, with hurricanes in the Earth's weather system and   the great red spot in Jupiter's atmosphere being two promin ent examples.   Vortices also occur as structural defects in superfluids, superconductors.   Beside being of scientific interest, it is of pressing technical and   meteorological importance to understand precisely the conditions under   which such vortices do form. An integer part of the proposed project aims   at making a significant contribution to this endeavor. The mathematical   framework consists of certain systems of nonlinear partial differential   equations which are deeply rooted in the scientific discipline of statis-  tical mechanics. The techniques which shall be developed in the first part   of the proposed project will allow us to extract the relevant differential   equations from statistical mechanics under far more realistic conditions   than  treated so far. In the second part, we shall further develop a  recent technique of us that yields qualitative and quantitative statements  about the symmetry properties of the solutions to the nonlinear equations.  In favorable cases this reduces the complexity of certain equations   significantly. Beside vortices, we aim at applying our techniques to the  problem of controlling more realistic plasma structures than previously  treated, of the following categories: charged particle beams, which are   of preeminent interest in various branches of technology development;   stellar structures, which are of basic astrophysical interest. Finally,   we see the possibility of an extension of our techniques to a dynamical   set of transport equations for plasmas which have significance, in  particular, for peaceful thermonuclear energy research.   ***"

It  represents an attempt to generalize and to place into perspective the  somewhat limited spatial gradient theories of local interaction. The  investigation is theoretical and is based on the idea of energy minimization.  While the generic problems contained in this work are nonconvex, and must  address this level of difficulty, to a large extent the interests and  objectives lie in understanding the ""penalty"" due to the global nonlocal  structure. The project involves an investigation of the regularity and  existence of minimizers.  It includes a proposal to describe their detailed  form, and a plan to understand how the number of transition boundaries that a  body can coincidentally support relates to the degree of nonlocal influence  and to the size of the body. The identification of length scales and the  application of scaling transformations are suggested as avenues for  understanding the way in which gradient theories may be considered as  approximations. The overall project is expected to lead to a model for  understanding the organization of material phase structures in bodies at  finite scales. The detailed investigations are expected to form a bridge in  the ""regularity gap"" that now exists between the purely local, strongly  irregular, theories commonly associated with the classical ideas of Gibbs,  and the relatively smooth gradient theories historically attributed to van  der Waals, Korteweg, Ginzburg and Landau, and Cahn and Hilliard.   %%%  Understanding the behavior of materials which can change their internal  structure when loaded, heated, or placed in chemical or electrical  environments, is important to the development of advanced applications in  materials science---applications which impact many diverse areas of society,  from energy conservati on to micromachines for medical devices.  The idea that  nondestructive, reversible phase changes can be used to obtain a desired  sensible material behavior is of great potential technological importance,  and understanding how to affect and control such processes is an essential  step in the transfer of this science into technology for the benefit of  society.  Electrorheological fluids sense a small scale structure and stiffen  and become solid-like in the presence of an electric field, and the design of  micro-switches in the area of thin film technologies also depends upon a  similar small scale phenomenon. There is a need to improve our understanding  and predictive capabilities of such materials through the development of  relevant mathematical models. The existence of microscopic domains in  ferromagnetic and ferroelastic materials, shear bands in ductile solids,  finely twinned microstructural laminates in martensite (shape memory alloys,  etc...), and recently discovered high transition temperature superconductors  all underscore the importance of internal, small scale structures.  Experimental observations have provided a wealth of evidence that relates the  gross response of a material body to its underlying microstructure. This  research program investigates the role that long range particle-particle  interactions play in the development of microstructure. It is based on the  global optimization of energy and the idea that the amount of energy that is  stored in each element of a body is influenced by not only the state of the  element, but also by the state of the other elements of the body, in a way  similar to what molecular theory might suggest. The theory is  phenomenological and, as such, is contained within the framework of nonlinear  continuum mechanics. The aim is to determine the significance of nonlocal  theory in describing the behavior of materials which support coexistent phase  structures---materials which depend upon the existence of these  microstructures for their  novel responses.   ***"

The first part is intended to derive asymptotic properties of  singularly perturbed nonstationary Markov chains and perturbed chains with weak and  strong interactions, and to obtain asymptotic optimality in related control problems.   The second part comprises the development of asymptotic properties of global  stochastic optimization algorithms.  By using weak convergence methods, convergence  and rates of convergence are to be established, and the convergence of suitably scaled  sequences to the solutions of appropriate stochastic differential equations is to be  ascertained.  In the third part, by combining stochastic approximation methods with  kernel estimators, passive stochastic approximation algorithms are to be obtained.

This proposal consists of four closely related topics. It is a bridge-building  attempt to link theory and application in stochastic optimization.  Emphasis is on the   development of efficient numerical methods via analysis and numerical  experimentation. The first topic deals with systems that are subject to rapid and  random variations. The results obtained are intended be useful for applications  involving hierarchical decision making, production planning, queuing networks in  communication, and system reliability. To meet the increasing demand for efficient   numerical procedures for global optimization, the second part of the project focuses  on the development of numerical algorithms when random errors in the data have to  be taken into account.  The results are applicable to an ever expanding range of  applications in estimation, identification and optimization problems.  The research  undertaken in the third part of this program derives from steady state estimation and  detection problems in chemical engineering (for a continuously stirred tank and for a  binary distillation column).

A consistent, fully time-dependent, nonlinear lumped  parameter model describing interactions between pressures,  volumes, and flows in intracranial space is refined, validated,  and expanded to include additional physiology, such as  cerebrovascular autoregulation and links to the spinal  cerebrospinal fluid space.  First order processes and relevant  time scales are identified using scaling and asymptotic  techniques.  To achieve the higher resolution necessary to  consider focal events, dynamic modeling within compartments and  consistent linkage of sub-models with the rest of the lumped  parameter system is explored.  Computational methods and  strategies for efficient numerical solution of the nonlinear  model equations are developed.  In particular, results obtained  using hybrid asymptotic-numerical methods show great promise in  the present context where processes occur on disparate time  scales.       This project seeks to develop a realistic yet tractable  mathematical model for pressures and fluid flows in the human  brain.  Toward this end, the current model formulation is extended  to include additional human physiology, such as cerebrovascular  autoregulation, the mechanism which maintains the blood flow in  the brain necessary for adequate oxygen transfer in the face of  fluctuating blood pressure.  New hybrid solution techniques are  developed to carry out efficient and accurate computer  simulations of pressures and flows based on the model equations.  The enhanced model is also validated by comparing its  mathematical predictions with physiological data.  Situations  involving both normal and pathophysiology are studied.

Once developed and validated, the enhanced mathematical  model will be useful to researchers studying applications  associated with biotechnology.  For example, regulation of the  vascular system in the brain plays a crucial role in conditions  such as trauma and stroke.  Currently, nitric oxide is emerging as  a key factor in adjusting brain blood flow.  The enhanced  mathematical model, which includes a vascular regulation  equation, can be used to study the effect of nitric oxide  synthase (NOS) inhibitors on the brain.

So far the stationary solutions have received  most attention of researchers.  However, in recent years the  importance of non-stationary patterns in brain became clear.  The  investigator studies networks which admit periodic orbits and  addresses the apparent discrepancy between discrete and  continuous time networks of this type.  While in continuous  networks one expects generally a convergence to a periodic orbit,  in discrete time networks there are stable stationary solutions.  The project investigates chaotic behaviour of a class of networks  with step-function nonlinearities.  These can be viewed as a  limiting case of a steep sigmoid nonlinearities and are easier to  handle analytically.  The delay in synaptic response of a neuron  is a recognized fact; if one wants to account for its affect the  appropriate model must be expressed in terms of delay  differential equation.  The investigator studies the  discretization of this equation and shows that this  finite-dimensional approximation captures the essential features  of the dynamics of the delay equation.       Artificial neural networks is an area on a crossroads  between artificial inteligence and neurobiology.  Mathematical  models play an important role in this area.  Neural networks try  to model some basic functions of brain (learning, recognizing  trained patterns) without trying to understand the intricate  details of how the neurons work on a chemical or physiological  level.  Neural networks are used today in many areas of apllied  science and engineering.  The network can be trained to recognize  a certain pattern, given slightly perturbed data.  This pattern  must be stationary, i.e. fixed in time.  On the other hand, there  is hardly any process in the brain which is stationary, and most  processes are periodic.  The investigator studies networks that  admit periodic patterns, to understand the relationship between  differen t models and see which one is the most suitable for  applications.  If one were able to train the networks to recognize  complicated patterns (in space and time), that would have an  immediate impact on robotics and artificial inteligence."

This work attempts to apply mathematical methods to aid in  the understanding of physiological rhythms.  Many human  biological processes are governed by waxing and waning of  different quantities.  Some examples are the voltage of the heart  pacemaker, the regular drifting in and out of different brain  states during sleep and the control of oxygen flow in muscles by  rhythmic contractions of small arteries during periods of  exercise.  The approach of this work is to use computer and  mathematical models.  Computing tools and tools for the  visualization of simulations are developed as part of this work.  The main goal is to use the models to bridge the gap between  details about the microscopic workings of cells and their  consequences for behavior.   For example, when muscles work hard,  they consume oxygen and thus need more oxygen from the arteries.  Within the cells that form the arteries are special gates that  sense the amount of ""fuel"" so that as this fuel decreases, the  gates tell the artery to open up.  This feedback loop provides a  way to dynamically alter the rhythm of the artery in order to  insure that the tissue is evenly oxygenated.  Thus, by starting  at the microscopic level of these gates or channels, a model is  built that can explain how the consumption of oxygen is regulated  in tissues.  Another example occurs in the nervous system.  Information from different parts of the brain is transmitted  through special connections between nerve cells called synapses.  Reaction times and cognitive abilities depend on the speed of  this propagation as well as the prevention of propagation into  other regions of the brain.  Much is known about the reactions of  individual nerve cells to stimuli.  Models provide a way of  coupling many such cells  together in order to understand the  behavioral consequences of the individual cell properties.  Is  the whole greater than the sum of the parts?  The goal of this  proposal is to try to answer this question for a variety of  rhythmically controlled physiological processes."

The exact location of  the unstable continuous spectrum will be determined purely in terms of  dynamical systems quantities. Examples of fluid instability due to the  discrete part of the spectrum will be studied analytically and numerically.

The PI is particularly interested  in the following topics: (a) stationary states of magnetized plasmas  with flow and their group-theoretical properties; (b) the stability  and evolution of elliptical self-gravitating fluid masses (the Riemann   ellipsoids) with applications to astrophysics; (c) the linear and  nonlinear dynamics of fixed-boundary ellipsoids containing fluid. The  PI is going to use various analytical techniques including the  constrained minimization, `exact' Galerkin, group-theoretical, and  geometrical optics methods in conjunction with numerical techniques  such as the three-dimensional vortex method, large scale symbolic   manipulations, and visualization, in order to achieve these goals.    Further directions of attack include self-similar, time-dependent  vortex rings, short wavelength instabilities of unmagnetized  and magnetized accretion discs, global instabilities of collisionless   gravitating systems,and spectral problems of hydrodynamics and   magnetohydrodynamics. This research will advance current knowledge of  the behavior of both laboratory and astrophysical fluids and plasmas.  In particular, this research will contribute towards a better understanding  of the properties of nonlinear PDEs of mixed elliptic/hyperbolic type   describing symmetric stationary states of plasmas with flow; the  stability of Riemann ellipsoids and fluid- and plasma-filled bodies;  the evolution of nonaxisymmetric stars, and the validity of the  fission theory of binary stars.  %%%  The dynamics of fluids and plasmas is of great interest to  mathematicians and physicists alike. There are at least two reasons  for this interest. First, fluid and plasma motions  play a fundamental role in nature and technology with applications  stretching from astrophysics, to oceanography, to weather predicti on,  to controlled thermonuclear fusion. Second, a very rich and  sophisticated mathematical apparatus is required in order to  give   an adequate description of these motions.  The equilibrium theory  studies the structure and properties of steady solutions of the  nonlinear equations of fluid and plasma dynamics. These equilibrium  solutions represent special states which do not change in time  when left undisturbed. Usually it is rather difficult to describe equilibrium  solutions, however, it is still much easier then to describe the  general solutions. In addition, equilibrium solutions are the most  interesting ones from a practical point of view. The stability theory  studies the impact of initially small perturbations on a given steady   fluid or plasma equilibrium.  An equilibrium is called stable and can  occur in nature if perturbations do not have a profound effect on its   properties.  An equilibrium is called unstable if under the influence  of perturbations  it either evolves into a different equilibrium, or  loses its steady character altogether.  Over a period of years many   classical stability problems were solved, however, several important  stability problems are still open. The wave theory studies the  behavior of small perturbations in the vicinity of stable plasma  equilibria. The main issues include the analysis of the oscillation   frequencies, the structure of the corresponding eigenfunctions, and  the asymptotic behavior of perturbations in time. The present research  is aimed at advancing current understanding of equilibria,  instabilities and waves. It blends theoretical and symbolic methods with   high-performance computing and graphics. The outcome of this research  will have both theoretical and practical value. Among other things, it  will help to understand the dynamics of plasmas in the so-called  tokamaks (installations which are used for controlled   thermonuclear fusion), and the stability of stars.  ***"

A combination of asymptotic   techniques coupled with practical computational methods will be used to   simulate these systems.  Primary emphasis will be placed upon the   development of approximate analytical solutions to the systems of equations   governing these processing techniques.

Numerical methods will be implemented for calculating front speeds and  controling chaotic flame fronts.

The above proposed works are based on problems arising in  dynamics of reacting flows, and lasers.  Understanding reacting flows is of tremendous practical importance,  and is related to industrial chemical processing, energy consumption,  as well as biotechnological remediation of environment.  In designing internal combustion engines or conducting industrial  chemical processes, one of the immediate concerns is to increase the efficiency of fuel burning, and so minimize the waste gas output  and reduce air pollution. It is known that well-mixed and strongly stirred reacting fluids have more effective contact area and their  reaction efficiency is much higher. On the other hand,  stirred fluids behave in an irregular and chaotic manner, and are not easy to control.  This motivates us to study the properties of  the irregular reacting flows in order to utilize them for our needs.        Mathematical models proposed here serve as a starting  point for pursuing such an investigation where both analytical and  numerical methods can be applied to advance our understanding.  Moreover, the techniques we develop can be very useful to other problems, such as bioremediation of polluted aquifer.  T here similar irregular or chaotic phenomena  exist due to the interaction of chemical species with bacteria  growth. Chaotic phenomena also appear in optical systems where  people try to produce high power laser output for  massively parallel optical computing and processing, image storage,  and high power energy sources. It is essential to be able to  achieve coherence and control of the laser output. Mathematically,  this amounts to studying stability and instability of  the special solutions of the laser system, analyzing the structures and finding good approximations of attractors. The two level laser  model we propose here is the first step towards this goal.   The progress made and the methodology developed in the systematic   study of the two level model will  greatly help us approach more complicated yet more appealing  semiconductor laser systems  in the future."

The methods to be applied here are, first, soliton and   near-integrable systems theory and, second, geometric singularity  theory.The first concerns the modelling of dispersive difference schemes. The  equations of nonlinear optics frequently operate in regimes where  dispersive effects tend to dominate over those of viscosity. A particularly  relevant example of this is the effects of numerical dispersion in modelling   carrier wave shocking of femtosecond pulses. An appropriate model that can  provide a benchmark for these effects is the integrable discrete   nonlinear Schrodinger equations. The integrability of this model enables  one to entertain a precise analysis of continuum limits for this system.  The PI proposes to use the underlying Kahler geometry of this model  to deduce convexity estimates which should enable one to derive a valid  characterization of these limits including the appearance of modulational  instabilities. These characterizations will then be compared to modulation  equations derived by formal averaging as well as to numerical simulations  of non-integrable discretizations of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) pde.  The second topic concerns pattern formation in nonlinear optics.  Experiments reveal a rich variety of transverse patterns for coherent  fields in a nonlinear optical cavity. The Nonlinear Optics group  of the Arizona Center for Mathematical Sciences has derived  mean field models for a cavity filled with an isotropic,   nonlinear Kerr medium, and driven by a linearly polarised input field.  The equations for this model have the form of a damped, driven coupled   pair of defocussing NLS equations and have  been numerically demonstrated to produce patterns and defects of the  type seen experimentally.  The PI and his collaborators are particularly   interested to understand the formation and evolut ion of defects in   pattern forming evolution equations and have developed order parameter   equations which model the behaviour of modulated roll paterns in a variety  of such evolution equations. The PI proposes to derive and study such  modulation equations for the above mentioned mean field model. The  PI has also developed a general approach, based on geometric singularity  theory,  for the description of singularties in systems of pde's. The   goals of this project will be first, to  classify generic types of  defects for the nonlinear optics model and assess their temporal  stability; second, to control the formation of defects to the end of  either eliminating them or using them to encode information in patterns.  Expectations concerning this second goal are supportied by recent sucess  in controlling pattern irregularities in one dimensional models.   %%%    Nonlinear optics, which may be defined as the study of the interaction  of intense light with matter, was born with the invention of the laser  in the 1960's. In those early days such interactions required very large  intensities; however, nowadays such systems can be constructed with only  modest power requirements.  Along with this has come the possibility of  constructing large, so-called wide aperture, devices such as semiconductor  lasers. Such devices will play an important role in many areas of  technology such as satellite communications systems with an ultrafast switching  capacity. With the introduction of these  larger physical scales   one expects to see the formation of  patterns as well as defects in these patterns (analogous to crystalline  defects) which can be  modelled by the equations developed in this   proposal. Understanding how such patterns arise and evolve can play an  important role in efficiently operating and controlling these devices.  In the second project of this   proposal oscillatory  solutions in a special class of interacting lattice   systems will be investigated.  These systems have modelling app lications   which range from theoretical biology to the numerical methods used in   numerically simulating  optical systems. The goal is to obtain, rigorously,   a continuum description, given by partial differential equations and valid   on long spatial and temporal scales, of the microscopic variations in these  lattice systems. Such models can help to explain how a microscopic system,  such as an alpha-helix protein molecule or a coupled laser array,  can behave collectively, and hence macroscopically, in order to contribute  to phenomena on scales much larger than those orignally present in the  microscopic system.   ***"

The investigators undertake a spectrum of  activities essential to the testing of nonlinear population  theory: from the translation of biology into the formal language  of mathematics, to the analysis of mathematical models, to the  development and application of statistical techniques for the  analysis of data, to the design and implementation of biological  experiments.  Laboratory populations of flour beetles of the genus  Tribolium are used in the experiments.  By means of their studies  the investigators provide rigorous experimental tests of  nonlinear population phenomena and behavior.  These include: (1)  dynamical transitions from stable equilibria, to invariant loops  (aperiodicities), to period locking, to strange attractors and  chaos; (2) transient and intermittent dynamics with aims towards  defining practical concepts of intermittency for use with  stochastic population models and the testing of some of the  unusual transient behaviors forecast by stochastic nonlinear  models; (3) the dynamics of meta-populations using beetle  populations linked by migration; and (4) the dynamical behaviors  that can be produced by the interaction of environmental  periodicities with nonlinear demographic effects.       The investigators study how biological populations (in  particular, populations of insects) fluctuate in time and how  different circumstances can lead to drastically different, and  sometimes unexpected, changes in these fluctuations.  This study  is carried out by means of an interdisciplinary program that  integrates the use of sophisticated mathematical models and  statistical analysis with the design and implementation of  l aboratory experiments using species of beetles that are  economically important insect pests.  The investigators seek to  describe and explain a variety of patterns in population  fluctuations, ranging from those that are regular and predictable  to those that are irregular and ""chaotic."" They seek to  understand the environmental conditions that give rise to these  various kinds of population behavior.  This understanding is  essential if the impact on biological populations of  environmental perturbations and manipulations (by Man or by  Nature) is to be predicted.  These impacts have far-reaching  consequences, ranging from food production and pest control to  wildlife management and the conservation of species diversity."

Predation is an  important factor in natural and man-made ecosystems.  Recently, it  has been observed that two species predator-prey models subject  to seasonal forcing exhibit interesting behaviors in the presence  of seasonal variations in the environment.  Most interesting is  the fact that for certain parameter regimes there exist infinite  numbers of coexisting attractors corresponding to oscillations of  different period and amplitude.  In the face of continuing  perturbations from without, such a circumstance promotes the  likelihood of violent and unpredictable variations in system  dynamics, i.e., in the densities of predators and victims over  time.  Put another way, the mathematics suggests that small  variations in ambient conditions, for example, year-to-year  variations in the climate, can induce enormous and wholly  unexpected changes in species abundances.  Interpreted  biologically, the parameter regimes in question correspond to  prey populations the densities of which are predator-limited,  i.e., to the circumstance in which predators keep victim  densities well below their carrying capacity.  That such  regulation is not unusual is evidenced by the fact that victim  populations often explode when ""released"" from predation.  In  agricultural systems, such irruptions can be the unintended (and  economically catastrophic) consequence of pest eradication  programs.  From a mathematical viewpoint, strong regulation of  herbivore populations by their predators corresponds to ""weak  dissipation."" Previous investigation of the two species model  suggests that such situations can usefully be viewed as  perturbations of the Hamiltonian limit, in which case the  dissipation is, perforce, zero.  Because these models include  seasonality, the equations are ""nonintegrable"" with the  consequence that the topology phase space is extraordinarily  complex.  The mat hematical questions thus relate to which aspects  of the Hamiltonian topology are preserved under weak dissipation  and to the rapidity with which these features are eradicated as  dissipation levels increase.       The present project seeks to extend the basic mathematical  model of predator-prey interactions in several directions.  The  generalizations include increasing the numbers of interacting  species and examining the consequences of weak dissipation in the  context of a patchy environment, for example, cultivated fields  distributed among old fields and woodlands.  In addition, the  investigator and his colleagues address agroeconomic issues -  namely, the feasibility of substituting generalist arthropod  predators for insecticides as a principal means of controlling  pest species.  The conventional ecological wisdom is that given  sufficient understanding of predator requirements, such a  substitution is both feasible and desirable.  In fact, the history  of modern agriculture is nothing if not the story of increasing  victim carrying capacity with the consequence that effective pest  control by predation would necessarily correspond to weak  dissipation.  The challenge, therefore, is to devise management  policies that allow for the effective control of economically  significant pests and, at the same time, avoid an increased  potential for devastating outbreaks."

Auxiliary problems in optimal control, differential  games, and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman theory are also part of this investigation.        Many problems in engineering, economics, medicine, and in other fields require  the minimization of some performance criterion subject to various constraints on the  design variables.  In order to simplify the analysis, the most appropriate performance  criterion for a particular application is often replaced by another that is more amenable  to mathematical analysis but is suboptimal for the problem under consideration.  For  example, in the design of the shape of a structural member, the designer may be  primarily interested in minimizing the largest stresses in the member, but in fact may  select design parameters based on minimizing the average of such stresses.  Similarly,  In designing a liftoff plan for a space vehicle, it may be the maximum acceleration and  its attendant forces on the vehicle that should be minimized, not the aver age  acceleration and forces.  In drug or radiation therapy it is the maximum level of the  tumor load that the therapy is attempting to minimize, not the average tumor load.  In  general, replacing a performance criterion based on an average of some density with  one based on the maximum of that density enormously complicates the analysis of the  problem.  This project has the goal of providing the tools, methodology, and theory that  will allow the direct treatment of such problems.  Consequences of the research will be  improved performance in many important applications areas such as those described  above.  ***"

Features  of   solutions to the Ginzburg--Landau equations are to be studied.  Experimental   evidence for the materials they model and numerical simulations  for the   equations themselves indicate that stable solutions contain  coherent pattern   formations (vortex arrays). It is proposed to analyze solutions  for simple   geometries (e.g. cylindrical rods and thin films). The principal  investigator   seeks to establish the existence of these patterns and to  understand the   mechanisms that bring them about. He also seeks to determine how  one can  control the patterns (pin the vortex distributions).

The second part of the proposal deals with the  regularity of   solutions to variational problems related to nonlinear  elasticity. P. Bauman  and the principal investigator have established that solutions to  certain   boundary value problems from two dimensional elasticity are  locally Lipschitz   continuous homeomorphisms. It is proposed to investigate whether  or not these   solutions have singularities. Analytically this is to ask if the  solutions are   differentiable everywhere.  %%%       Scientists describe how a given material can conduct an  electric current  or how an elastic body can be twisted and bent by expressing such  phenomena as   solutions to mathematical equations (called partial differential  equations)   based on the underlying physics in each instance.

For example in the case  of a   superconducting material (a material that can conduct electricity  very   efficiently) it is observ ed that the current naturally circulates  around a   symmetric array of points called vorticies. It is also observed  that if the   current is sufficiently strong the array begins to drift causing  the current   to die off and superconductivity is lost.

The first topic is the determination of the   propagation velocity of combustion waves for a number of combustion   problems. There are a large number of works which use various approaches  to this problem, including the method of matched asymptotic expansions   and those based on a priori physical assumptions concerning the   structure of the combustion wave. These works have led to numerous   approximate formulae for the propagation velocity. However, very few   works have been concerned with a careful assessment of their accuracy  or applicability. As a result, different formulae for the propagation   velocity of the same combustion wave derived in different papers do not   necessarily agree with one another. New approaches to the determination   of the combustion velocity, based on minimax principles have been   developed in our previous work. These approaches allow us not only to   derive an approximate formula for the propagation velocity in a number   of combustion problems but also to determine the accuracy of this   formula. A number of problems of gaseous combustion, with both simple   and complex chemistry, are proposed to study using these novel methods.  The second topic is a study of combustion synthesis waves with wide   reaction zones, which are often observed in experiments. All previous   theories of the process, which is used in materials production,   are based on the assumption of a narrow reaction zone. This is due   to mathematical difficulties in the study of synthesis waves with wide   reaction zones, and the absence of well developed approaches to the   analysis. Development of the theory of wide reaction zone combustion   waves is the primary goal of the proposed project. Preliminary results   show that though waves with wide reaction zones do have very complex   structures, new asymptotic methods allow one to successfully treat the   problem.  Specific topic s discussed in the proposal include   nonadiabatic combustion with wide reaction zones, synthesis waves with  complex chemistry and phase transitions as well as stability of the   propagating wave.  In each of these problems the structure of the   combustion wave, its propagation velocity, burning temperature, degree   of conversion of reactants, etc., will be studied in order to   understand the fundamental mechanisms of the synthesis process with   wide reaction zones.   %%%  Combustion synthesis of materials is a process that uses combustion   waves for materials production. In the simplest manifestation of this   process, a sample consisting of a powder mixture of reactants is   ignited at one end. A high-temperature thermal wave, having a frontal   structure, then propagates through the sample, converting reactants to   desired products. The process enjoys certain advantages over   conventional technology, in which the mixture is placed in a furnace.   These include (i) shorter synthesis times, (ii) less expense, since  the internal chemical energy of the reactants is used rather than the   external energy of the oven, (iii) the use of simpler equipment, and   (iv) purer products, since the high-temperature wave burns off volatile  impurities.  A research program designed to further our knowledge   of the mechanisms involved in combustion synthesis is proposed. The   main object of the proposed research is combustion synthesis waves   involving wide reaction zones, which, though they often occur due to   the heterogeneous nature of the chemical conversion, have not been   theoretically studied because of the mathematical complexity of the  problem. The goal of this project is to understand the fundamental  mechanisms of the synthesis process with wide reaction zones, and thus  to be able to make recommendations for effective control of the  composition and quality of the products.  ***"

Primarily transient   wave propagation problems will be considered, although many of the   techniques will also be applicable in the frequency domain. The boundary   conditions are based on first deriving convergent or asymptotic expansions   of the solution valid in the far field and then constructing differential   operators which annihilate the leading order terms in the expansions.    Generally these operators require specification of an origin from which   outgoing waves are assumed to emanate.  Techniques will be developed in   which interior information is used to improve the performance of the   boundary condition.  In particular, adaptive boundary conditions will be   developed in which the origin is estimated dynamically and locally from   properties of the solution in the interior.  Techniques to increase the order of   the boundary condition without increasing the order of the differential   operator will also be developed.  This will be done by incorporating   inhomogeneous terms into the boundary operator, again using properties of   the computed solution in the interior.  Finally, far field expansions and   associated boundary conditions suitable for damping layers will be   developed, thereby allowing a reduction in size of the layers.    The numerical computation of waves, for example, acoustic and    electromagnetic waves, will be considered.  These problems are typically   governed by equations specified in regions which are unbounded in at least   one direction. In order for the problem to be formulated on a computer it is   necessary that the unbounded region be replaced by a bounded region.    Furthermore, it is necessary that some boundary condition be imposed at the   edge (boundary) of the bounded region.  This boundary condition should   ideally simulate the ori ginal unbounded problem.  However, in general the   boundary treatment will not be a perfect simulation of the unbounded   problem and there will be spurious reflections emanating from the   boundary.  These reflections will propagate into the interior region and   seriously degrade the accuracy of the computed solution.  Thus, it is   essential for accurate computation that these spurious reflections be   minimized.  Boundary conditions will be considered based on properties of   the waves in the far field, i.e., far from the sources where the waves are   generated.  Currently for any given computation the boundary conditions   are generally determined in advance, i.e., at the beginning of the   computation, and are not changed as the solution evolves in time.  Thus,    the boundary conditions make no use of information about the waves in the   interior. Methodologies will be developed in which interior information can   be used to improve the performance of the boundary conditions.  In this   approach, the boundary conditions will change as time evolves, adapting to   the nature of the solution by making use of interior information.  It is   anticipated that the resulting boundary treatment will allow a significant   reduction in spurious reflections.  Thus, the proposed new boundary   conditions offer the prospect of significant improvement in efficiency and   accuracy for the computation of wave propagation problems.  Applications   to acoustic, electromagnetic and elastic wave propagation will be   considered."

Archetypal analysis is a new statistical  method for extracting relevant features from experimental data sets that  has been developed by Cutler and Breiman (Technometrics 1995).  Archetypes characterize extreme data values (those lying on the convex  hull of the data set), and can be thought of as a variation of principal  component analysis, which is also called the proper orthogonal or  Karhunen-Loeve (KL) decomposition by the dynamical systems community.  One of the goals of this project is to compare and  contrast the two  methods, the KL decomposition and Archetypes, in their application to  several experimental dynamical systems, both physical and numerical.  Data sets possessing traveling structures present a special problem to  those hoping to reduce them using the KL decomposition. If the traveling  structure is sufficiently regular the eigenfunctions will be sines  and cosines, since the decomposition produces a Fourier basis from data  that are translationally invariant. Therefore, in situations where the  traveling structure itself is the feature to be extracted, a straight  application the KL decomposition will not suffice.  The proposers are  developing a method that builds on Archetypal analysis to analyze data  with translating coherent structures, by finding, in an objective manner,  archetypes that move with the traveling structure.  The shape of the  structure itself is extracted (or possibly shapes, if the structure  itself is varying as well as translating) along with information on how  the structure is moving across the spatial domain.  Finally, along with  the pattern recognition  problems mentioned above, the third goal of the  proposed research is determining the feasibility of using archetypes as  a basis upon which to do a Galerkin projection of the governing  equations of the dynamical system (when they exist), for modeling  purposes.  %%%  Understan ding, predicting and modeling complex dynamical systems is one  of the preoccupations of the dynamical systems community today.  The  family of techniques dubbed ""dynamical systems theory"" utilized in  this effort is expanding rapidly and in many directions, incorporating  ideas from such diverse fields as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  With the advent of high-speed, large capacity computers, more complex  methods from statistics have become practical in the analysis of data  from dynamical systems.  One such method is archetypal analysis, a new  statistical technique which models the state of the system at a given  time as a mixture of extreme states. The proposers study the application  of archetypal analysis to dynamical systems.  They are comparing  archetypal analysis with other statistical procedures for dynamical  systems, and are developing a new variant of archetypal analysis to  handle moving waves.

Research efforts will focus on particle methods used in conjunction with   finite element or finite-difference methods for determining the fields, and   with implicit time-integrating schemes for advancing particles.  Because   there are seven independent variables in realistic (three-dimensional)   problems, it is not practical to base numerical simulations on classical   finite-differences, finite elements, or spectral methods.  Practical   simulations are based on particle methods, whose implementation requires a   solid understanding of the existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties   of Vlasov kinetic models.  In particular, it is proposed to carry out   investigations in the following two directions: (A). Numerical analysis of   the Vlasov kinetic equations modeling collisionless plasmas.  In particular,   implicit time-integrating methods for advancing particles are incorporated   into the numerical analysis of particle-in-cell schemes for Vlasov-Poisson   systems.  Also the convergence theory of particle approximations for   Vlasov-Poisson systems is extended to treat Vlasov-Maxwell and Vlasov-  Einstein problems.  (B). Numerical analysis of Vlasov kinetic equations   modeling plasmas with collisions.  In particular, nonlinear collision   operators of Landau (Fokker-Planck) type and of Boltzmann type arising in   semiconductor physics are added to the underlying Vlasov-Poisson or   Vlasov-Maxwell system.  The analyses involve stochastic and deterministic   particle methods involving operator splitting into nonlinear convective and   collisional portions.    Much of the interest in kinetic equations is derived from the practical and   economic benefits that  would accrue from applying knowledge of such   equations to problems arising in laser fusion,  plasma physics, and   semiconductors.  Vlasov kinetic equation s mathematically model such   phenomena as diverse as laser-matter interactions occurring in controlled   and laser fusion, and the transport of electrons in quantum environments   present in semiconductors. The research efforts being  supported by the   National Science Foundation have as objective the rigorous investigation of   numerical approximations to Vlasov kinetic models, with the goal of   enabling scientists to perform computations efficiently in determining   energies, moments, etc.  The work undertaken here would affect the current   base of plasma and  semiconductor technology in providing extended   qualitative analysis and robust numerical procedures for the study of   transport of electrons in semiconductors, laser-matter interactions, and the   onset of instabilities in an electron plasma.  In addition, the numerical   analysis of nonlinear mathematical models has had a traditionally wide   audience among applied academic and industrial mathematicians.  This fact   will have a significant impact on the academic or industrial career prospects   of students who decide to pursue advanced degrees in the study of nonlinear   equations of kinetic type."

By their very nature, weeds and  infectious disease agents are unwanted invaders in a host system;  their introduction frequently has adverse effects.  Practical  methods for control of weeds and infectious diseases are under  continual research and development.  However, there is a need for  theoretical justification and predictability of these control  procedures.  This project develops and analyzes mathematical  models that provide quantitive and qualitative means for  evaluation of these control procedures.  Integrodifference  equations provide a realistic starting point for modeling the  biological dynamics of these two processes; the time variable is  discrete but the spatial and state variables are continuous.  Discrete-time models describe plant populations whose generations  are nonoverlapping and epidemics where the observation of cases  or the seasonal movement and population densities of animals  relate to the discrete time interval.  Mathematical models for  weeds and infectious diseases are analyzed to determine the  effects of spatial dispersal, age or stage structure,  multi-population interactions, and general growth assumptions on  model behavior.  Two important questions are addressed: (i) How  fast does the weed or disease spread? and, (ii) What are the  short- and long-term effects of a control procedure?       Determining effective control procedures for weeds and  infectious diseases has become a significant global environmental  problem.  Around the world, native plant communities are being  displaced by nonnative plants and enzootic wildlife diseases are  becoming a threat to humans.  In particular, agricultural land and  rangeland, where the native plant community structure has been  altered, are especially vulnerable to invasions by introduced  plant species.  Humans living in close proximity to  an animal  reservoir of a disease are at an increased risk of contracting  the disease.  It is the goal of this research to apply the  mathematical models and theoretical techniques that are developed  in this project to two important and timely biological problems:  (1) control of weeds in agricultural fields or rangeland and (2)  control of rabies in wildlife populations.  Formulation, analysis,  and numerical simulation of mathematical models provide a greater  understanding of effective methods for the control of the spread  of weeds in fields or rangeland and of rabies in wildlife.  Various control strategies are compared to determine the most  effective short- and long-term strategies that prevent or reduce  the spread while causing minimal damage or change to the  environment and minimal risk to humans."

In this project  the  proposer investigates new nontrivial optimality conditions for  abnormal  trajectories and their role in connection with discontinuities in  the value  function. Most existing results for optimality  do not apply to  abnormal  extremals or require continuity of the value function. The  occurence of  abnormal processes is related to the fact the surjectivity  condition in the  Lyusternik theorem is not satisfied and as a result the classical  nontrivial  results cannot be derived. While mathematically desirable,  continuity of the  value function relates to small-time local controllability and  need not be  satisfied for many control systems with free terminal time.   Abnormal  processes which satisfy the Maximum Principle do so regardless of  the  objective. Hence if they are really optimal this strongly hints  that in a  certain sense they are the only possible candidates to solve the  problem  whereas closeby trajectories fail to do so. Thus optimal abnormal  processes  somehow correspond to limiting or boundary-like behaviors of  optimal  trajectories which strongly correlates them with discontinuities  in the  value function. It is expected that the analysis of  discontinuities in the  value function coupled with existing theory provides a solution  methodology  to the general problem in optimal control. The proposal consists  of two  separate but closely related parts. The first part is a  continuation of  previous work and addresses further developments of the  proposer's earlier  theory of nontrivial optimality conditions for abnormal processes  based on  second order approximations. A high-order generalization of the  Lyusternik  theorem without surjectivity condition and high -order  approximations to the  constraint sets are investigated. Using these results extended  nontrivial  first and second order necessary conditions for optimality of  both normal  and abnormal problems in optimization and optimal control are  analyzed.  A  generalization of the proposer's existing results to a nonsmooth  setting  coupled with direct approximations in the dual space by means of  normal  cones is being pursued. In the second part of the project the  proposer  investigates sufficient conditions for the optimality of abnormal  trajectories. In particular, the proposer analyses the role which  is played  by optimal abnormal extremals in the construction of a regular  synthesis.  %%%  There are two fundamental approaches to finding the solution of  optimal  control problems: 1) finding the optimal processes through an  analysis of  the Maximum principle and 2) finding the value-function as a  solution of the  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Both of these are in general  rather  difficult objectives to achieve and depend on the specifics of  the problem  under investigation. On the other hand, judging by the known  examples the  discontinuities of the value-function seem to relate rather  directly to  abnormal processes. Since both abnormal processes and  discontinuities of the  value function are indicating the limiting behaviors of optimal  trajectories  the proposer expects that there exists a relation between these  two  phenomena in general. In this project the proposer investigates  optimal  abnormal trajectories in optimal control and their role in  connection with  discontinuities in the value function.

The primary  theoretical focus of this work is the analysis of bifurcations to  periodic solutions near resonance for multidimensional  multiparameter systems and the description of related phenomena,  especially the phenomenon of passage through resonance.  The  methods employed include several aspects of the geometric  analysis of nonlinear dynamics and classical perturbation theory:  ``Melnikov'' theory, Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, elliptic  functions and expansion in a small parameter.  There is also an  important computational component; especially, integration of  differential equations, computer graphics and computer algebra.   The theory will be applied to physical systems modeled by systems  of coupled nonlinear differential equations. The primary  application proposed for this project is to study the motions of  a DC motor driven  mechanical linkage.  It is proposed to  determine the existence and stability of periodic motions, the  stabilization of periodic motions by feedback control and the  effects of slow variation of control parameters near resonance.    When mechanical or electrical components are linked together (for  example when a motor is connected to a machine) it is important  to determine the subsequent operational capabilities of the  coupled system. In the design and operational control of coupled  systems the following phenomenon can occur: a small effect  produced by one of the components can have a large effect on the  operation of the coupled system.  This phenomenon can be used to  advantage in electrical devices, for example amplifiers, but  often it has dramatic undesirable consequences when present in  machinery. A motor attached to an elastic support may operate  smoothly until a small change in its rotational speed causes a  large vibration and subsequent failure of the motor or its  linkage.  This is analogous to the classic example of a n opera  singer breaking a wine glass with her voice.  The proposed  research seeks to find methods to determine the effects of  couplings among mechanical or electrical components by developing   techniques to analyze mathematical models for the operation of  such coupled systems.  These methods will be useful in the design  of machinery as well as the design of auxiliary systems needed to  control its operation.  ***"

In the   viscous incompressible case, MHD flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes   equations and the pre-Maxwell equations of the magnetic field. The latter   will in general transcend the region of conducting fluid and, ideally, extend   to all of space. It is mostly this feature, the electromagnetic interaction of   the fluid with the outside world, which gives rise to challenging problems of    mathematical analysis and numerical approximation.  In earlier work, the   authors have developed a novel approach to viscous incompressible MHD   that avoids some intrinsic difficulties of traditional approaches by   employing fluid velocity and current density (rather than velocity and   magnetic field) as the primary variables. The velocity-current method has   been successfully applied to prove the well-posedness of certain stationary   MHD flow problems and to develop an efficient finite-element algorithm   for the numerical approximation of solutions.  One objective of the   proposed research is to extend the velocity-current method, both   analytically and numerically, to more complex stationary problems, as they   arise in liquid-metal technology and other applications. Major tools will be   integral-equation methods, mixed variational formulations, and the coupling   of finite-element and boundary-element methods. In another direction, a   suitable generalization of the velocity-current method will be employed to   analyze time-dependent MHD flow problems. Initially, the focus will be on   qualitative properties of the ensuing systems of integro-differential   equations, via Faedo-Galerkin and semigroup methods; ultimately, the goal   is again the design of efficient algorithms for the numerical approximation   of solutions in physically realistic situations.    Magnetohydrodynamics (or MHD) is the theory of the macroscopic   interaction of el ectrically conducting fluids with a magnetic field. It is of   importance in connection with many engineering problems, such as   sustained plasma confinement for controlled thermonuclear fusion, liquid-  metal cooling of nuclear reactors, and electromagnetic casting of metals. It   also finds applications in geophysics and astronomy, where one prominent   example is the so-called dynamo problem, that is, the question of the origin   of the Earth's magnetic field in its liquid metal core.  Due to their practical   relevance, MHD flow problems have long been the subject of intense cross-  disciplinary research, but except for relatively simple special cases, the   rigorous mathematical and numerical analysis of such problems is largely   terra incognita. The authors have recently developed a novel approach to an   important class of MHD flow problems that circumvents some intrinsic   difficulties of traditional analyses. The objective of the proposed research is   to further pursue this approach in order to design qualitative and   quantitative methods for the mathematically rigorous and computationally   efficient solution of MHD flow  problems in physically realistic situations."

They work toward a general  theory that categorizes cooperative behavior in nature as  kin-selected behavior, group-selected behavior, byproduct  mutualism, or reciprocal altruism.  In pursuit of this goal, their  investigation focuses on cooperative behaviors that can be  excluded on a priori grounds from the first two categories  mentioned above.  Examples of such behaviors are food sharing in  ravens and defensive behavior in lions.  Accordingly, the  investigators focus on reciprocity versus mutualism and develop a  mathematical model with the power to discriminate between these  two categories of cooperative behavior.  The model is important  because many examples of reciprocity in nature have been  hypothesized, but hardly any have been proven: without such a  model, virtually every example is equally interpretable as a case  of mutualism.       The goal of the study is to determine whether animals can  cooperate in nature because they keep score of favors done to --  and favors received from -- specific individuals, or because  acting in their long-term self-interest coincides with acting in  the best interest of their community, even though they do not  keep score.  From a purely scientific perspective, an answer to  this question will advance current knowledge of animal behavior  considerably.  From a more utilitarian perspective, even though  the study's primary subjects are non-human animals in the wild,  the investigators' findings will be relevant to achieving  cooperation among humans as well.  In particular, the study's  findings may help to solve the urgent problem of the commons,  i.e., the problem of designing cooperative social structures for  sustainable management of the global environment."

The mathematical  problems address the general questions:  How  do nonlinear systems relax to equilibrium?  How do interfaces and defects  form and how do they propagate?  These questions arise both for diffuse and  sharp interface models.  We also encounter interesting questions in  phase interface dynamics which are closely tied to interesting questions in  geometry.  We intend to obtain information on the qualitative behavior of  phase states predicted by several new models  as well as classical modelsfor  phase transition.  We will consider isothermal  solid-solid transitions  which occur without a change in the total amount of each species and we will  also study liquid-solid transformations where a heat equation is coupled to  that for the order parameter. There are natural situations where the  perimeter or the geometry of the interface, does not change significantly  during the evolution.  Then a reduction to a finite dimensional dynamical  system is often possible.  A good deal of our effort in these investigations  is spent towards  identifying and  understanding the underlying finite  dimensional  dynamics.  %%%  We investigate  certain physical phenomena where surface  tension  plays a role. Surface tension is responsible for the shape of planets, as  well as for the shape of rain drops.  It is also  the reason why skating on  ice is possible. Generally it is a second order effect.  However when the  other forces balance each other, surface tension can  become the determining  factor.  Here is anexample:  In the first stages of the space program  scientists were puzzled by the fact that as soon as the rocket was exiting  the earth's gravitiational  attraction  the engines would shut off as if they were running out of fuel.  Eventually they realized that in space the fuel in the tank forms into  sphe rical shapes due to surface tension effects with many blobs staying away  from the walls of the container.  We are interested in phase change phenomena , for example those involving  ice and water (different phases of the same substance which can coexist near  the critical temperature of 32F).  Understanding the way certain phases mix  is important for determinig the properties of materials. Superconductivity  is a good example to which our work applies.  For  understanding all this, one, in principle, could start with  the basic  equations  of physics. The problem  with this approach is the enormous  complexity that one encounters  and the difficulty in the numerical  simulation. For dealing with this scientists are proposing  adhoc,  phenomenologically convincing models, which have the advantage of  great  simplicity.  Our work is of qualitative nature. It  aims to establish that  some of  these simple mathematical  models exhibit the wealth of behavior  making them capable of describing and predicting  the  phenomena that are  observed .  ***"

The main objective of this research is to study a group of free   interface problems related to solid combustion and exothermic phase   transitions. The one-dimensional evolution exhibits remarkable   dynamical wealth, while there are indications of its essentially   finite-dimensional character. The existence of a finite-dimensional   attractor and nonlinear interaction of two free boundaries in a   degenerate Hopf bifurcation will be investigated analytically and   numerically. The Principal Investigator will also study two-dimensional   evolution generated by these free interface problems. A rigorous study   concerning well-posedness for problems with various boundary conditions      and interface kinetics shall be combined with  numerical simulation in   order to understand geometry and dynamics of the curved interfaces. An   alternative view of the interface dynamics is provided by   coordinate-free surface evolution equations modeling basic flame   instabilities which include the thermal-diffusive and the hydrodynamic   instabilities. Analytical and numerical study of the surface evolution   equations will be directed toward better understanding of their basic   mathematical nature, such as global well-posedness, uniformly bounded   curvature and smoothness of solutions, and some important dynamical   features including exponential growth of length, fingering and   self-fractalization that are exhibited by the solutions.    %%%    The proposed research is essentially devoted  to the study of    evolution of interfaces: the surfaces that separate the solid and the    melted matter as it solidifies, or those that separate the fuel and    the burned products in combustion of gaseous or solid mixtures of    reactants. The latter is also known as high temperature syntheses and    can be employed for manufacturing of new materials. The shape and the    velocity of the interfaces as they propagate through the substance may    greatly effect the structure and the physical prope rties of the    resulting products.

The work  is the mathematical analysis part of an ongoing project, jointly  with J. L. Lions (College de France) and R. Temam (Indiana  University); that project involves a combination of modeling,  mathematical theory, and scientific computing.  Among the partial  differential equations are the core equations in climatology such  as the primitive equations of the atmosphere-only, the  ocean-only, and the coupled atmosphere/ocean systems.  Part of  the mathematical theory has been attained in previous work about  these core equations of the atmosphere, ocean and coupled  atmosphere-ocean.  A large amount of work such as the existence  and properties of strong solutions and long time behavior remains  to be done, however.  Also, the mathematical analysis of sea ice  equations and some free surface models is also addressed.

The study of these complicated  phenomena and the relevant scientific issues are very challenging  and necessitate a joint effort of scientists in many fields.  The  proposed work takes up this study from the mathematical point of  view.  As is now well-known and as pointed out by John von Neumann  in the fifties, understanding and prediction of the weather and  climate involve a great deal of mathematical analysis and a great  deal of calculation.  This project aims at a better understanding  of the mechanisms of the turbulent behavior of the air and  seawater, as well as tools for better prediction of the weather  and possible global change."

Here is the abstract that you requested:  *************    DMS-9625830: Global Continuation Methods in Nonlinear Elasticity    P.I.: T.J.Healey    Abstract.    We plan to carry out research in global nonlinear analysis of  partial  differential equations of nonlinear elasticity.  A major thrust  of the  proposed work will be focused on problems involving phase change  (weak  solutions and loss of ellipticity).  The analysis of such models  at a very  general level is fundamental to the understanding of martensitic  transformations and shape-memory effects, which are observed in  many  advanced engineering alloys.  Some interesting problems of  classical  nonlinear elasticity will also be considered.  The work has two  major  goals: (i) To obtain new qualitative results and detect new  phenomena - of  both mathematical and physical significance; (ii)  To obtain new  global-continuation (existence) results in problems of 2 and  3-dimensional  elasticity - including problems involving phase transformations.   In  classical problems (rubber elasticity), tools developed by Healey  and  co-workers in previous NSF-sponsored work will play an important  role.  For  phase-change problems, an entirely new approach based upon  higher-gradient  regularization, global continuation and singular limits is being  proposed.    Broadly speaking,the proposed work will provide important  mathematical  underpinnings to difficult nonlinear problems arising in  traditional  engineering fields like structural & mechanical engineering and  also in  more modern areas like materials scien ce. The work has the  potential to:  (i) provide new mathematical tools for the analysis of hard  problems of  engineering practice,leading ultimately to safer and more optimal  design of  structures; (ii) lead to a better understanding of the nonlinear  material  behavior of certain engineering alloys, with potential  applications to  manufacturing engineering and the design of non-passive or  ""smart""  structures.      *********    Let me know if this is not acceptable - I'll be happy to make  changes.

Often in soldering and other processes involving spreading, the drop may   become very thin which indicates the presence of multiple length scales.    Based on the author's previous research, the first approach proposed is a   multi-scale asymptotic analysis (lubrication theory) to derive nonlinear   diffusion equations for the free surfaces; those nonlinear diffusion equations   will be  solved using a spectrally-accurate implementation of the method of   lines.  All quantities of interest may be computed in this approximation   once the required free surfaces have been found. A second approach is also   proposed, via boundary integral equations, under the approximation of   Stokes flow in the drop and film.  This approach relaxes the  requirement   that the drop and film be thin, but still requires that the flow be slow.  We   propose making a direct comparison between the two approaches in order to   evaluate the utility of each in various situations.  The work proposed will   develop models only for the fluid dynamics, and inclusion of reactive   effects will be proposed in a subsequent project.    Important processes in manufacturing involve the spreading of a fluid   droplet in the presence of another fluid; one example is soldering, where, in   many instances, the presence of a thin layer of a second fluid, the flux, is   required for the process to work at all.  Because the use of lead-based solder   is no longer allowed, understanding of this droplet spreading process for   other kind of solder materials would be very helpful in understanding   alternative solder materials. The work proposed in the project is developing   some preliminary models necessary for the development of a complete   model for a spreading solder drop. The proposed program  is to develop   theory for the spreading of a droplet on a flat plate that is covered by a thin   film of a different fluid. Computer codes will be developed that predict how   fast the drop spreads, and the shapes of the drop and the film that covers the   drop. In summary, sophisticated mathematical techniques will be applied to   a problem of technological importance.  The computer codes resulting from   this project are expected to be applicable to related wetting problems in   different technological areas (e.g. coating processes) subsequent to the   completion of this project."

Specific topics   include the study of corner singularities and high Weissenberg number  asymptotics in viscoelastic flows, the development of a basic existence theory  for degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic systems arising in surfactant spreading,  instabilities in ocean currents, the numerical treatment of outflow   boundaries, and Takens-Bodganov bifurcations with symmetry which arise  in double layer convection.  %%%  Part of the work is motivated by problems which are encountered in the   numerical simulation of flows of polymeric fluids. Such simulations are  important in predicting fluid behavior in industrial processes and in  evaluating theories of material behavior. Geometries with corners are  frequently encountered, and the singular behavior arising from such   corners has led to considerable difficulties in numerical simulation,   which have not been adequately resolved. Another numerical difficulty  has arisen from the formation of sharp boundary layers in highly elastic  flows. In both cases, progress hinges crucially on clarifying the   analytical nature of the solution, and the proposed research aims at doing  that. Another important topic in numerical simulation of fluid flows is  the truncation of the flow domain for numerical purposes. Here, the   proposed research is concerned with providing the reasons why certain  procedures work. Surfactant spreading on thin films is important in   biological and medical problems. Mathematically, it leads into a new  type of partial differential equations, which does not seem to have   analyzed previously. The proposed research aims at understanding   fundamental issues related to these equations. Fluid dynamics is rife  with instabilities and formation of new flow patterns. Flows with a high  degree of symmetry, such as conv ection between parallel plates, are known  to allow a rich variety of patterns. The inclusion of a second fluid layer  leads to additional possibilities, which the proposed research will   explore.  ***"

The proposal   consists of two parts. The first part intends to give a rigorous   answer to an open question whether there exist solitary internal   waves with algebraic decay at infinity in a continuously stratified   fluid that is bounded only by a rigid bottom and has a constant   density except for a layer with continuous density stratification.   The proposed research will give a rigorous justification of the   existence of solitary waves derived from a formal model equation,   called the Benjamin-Ono equation. The second part deals with the   existence of periodic waves of large amplitude in a two-layer fluid   without boundaries. A new formulation of the problem will be introduced,   which transforms the governing equations into a single integral equation.   Then the solutions of the integral equation will be studied numerically   and theoretically for any density ratio without restrictions on the   amplitude of solutions. In this project, the main thrust is to show   that the fully nonlinear governing equations for stratified fluids   have solutions of finite and large amplitude and give the various   properties of the solutions using numerical and theoretical approaches.   An interplay of theories in differential equations and functional analysis   will be essential to obtaining the rigorous justifications, while   numerical computation gives some crucial information on the solutions.  %%%         The gravity waves of large amplitude in a fluid of density variation,   also called a stratified fluid, with great depth are of considerable   geophysical interest. Large amplitude internal wave disturbances are   common features in the oceans as well as in the lower atmosphere. In   particular, a solitary wave, whose form is a localized single hump,   and a periodic wave, which always has  a same form after a certain   distance, are relevant to various oceanic and atmospherical phenomena.   The solitary waves of large amplitude have been associated with the   formation of tornados in the atmosphere and the enormous transport of   momentum and energy within the oceans. This work focuses on obtaining   the conditions under which the solitary or periodic waves can exist and   predicting how large the amplitude of the waves can be if they exist.   It will also try to capture the qualitative features of these waves   using numerical computations. The results obtained from this research   may provide some theoretical explanation of the formation of these waves   and give more understanding of certain wave motions in the oceans   and atmosphere so that these waves may be either utilized or avoided   in different physical applications.    ***"

The investigator and his colleague study wave propagation  in such models using established theoretical tools and new  computational approaches, focusing primarily on rotating scroll  waves in three-dimensional excitable media.  As a scroll waves  rotates around its central ""filament,"" the filament moves slowly  through space according to certain laws of motion that are still  poorly understood.  The investigators develop efficient and  accurate computational tools, based on a cellular automaton model  of excitable media, in order to simulate the motion of scroll  filaments in large domains over long periods of time.       The thick-walled ventricle of the mammalian heart is a  three-dimensional excitable medium that propagates waves of  electrochemical activity.  By modulating intracellular calcium  levels, these waves control the beating of the heart.  During a  normal heartbeat the wave induces the muscle fibers of the left  ventricle to contract synchronously and blood is efficiently  expelled from the chamber.  But under pathological conditions  (flutter and fibrillation), the heartbeat degenerates into a  rotating scroll wave of the sort studied in this project.  The  rotating scroll wave causes the muscle fibers to contract  asynchronously, so that part of the chamber is relaxed when other  parts are contracting.  As a result the blood within the chamber  is not pumped efficiently and the heart must be ""defibrillated""  to save the victim's life.  To understand the fundamental  causes  of ventricular fibrillation and its effective treatment, one  needs a better understanding of the onset, development and  annihilation of rotating scroll waves in three-dimensional  excitable media, which is the basic goal of this project."

This proposal focuses on one problem that is of fundamental importance in nonlinear dynamics, and is potentially of great importance in ecological systems: the phenomenon of supertransients in spatially-extended chaotic systems.  Specifically, we will investigate the origin of supertransients, and develop a quantitative scaling theory to explain how and why the lifetime of supertransients increases with system size.  This theory will be developed first for a simple, analyzable model, then to test this theory on a number of model spatiotempral chaotic systems.  We will investigate supertransients in several realistic ecological model systems, and focus on the potential for supertransiency to promote the long term (though not indefinite) coexistence of competing species, and how such coexistence is influenced by system size.  'Me models involve competition among species in patches, with localized dispersal among patches.  This work will contribute to a long-standing debate in ecology about the importance of nonequilibrial dynamics in understanding patterns in species diversity, and the influence of spatial scale on species coexistence.    A full understanding of the dynamics of physical and biological systems requires a consideration of transient dynamics away from equilibrium.  Recently, it has become recognized that realistic models of spatially-distributed ecological systems can exhibit superlong 'chaotic' transients before equilibrium is reached, wherein for all practical purposes a system never reaches its ultimate equilibrium.  Our research focuses on characterizing quantitatively the phenomenon of supertransient behaviors in mathematical models, using both mathematical analyses and extensive numerical simulations, and on ascertaining the potential relevance of supertransients for import ant, unresolved questions in ecology, in particular the long-term coexistence of species competing for limiting resources, but able to disperse in space in heterogeneous, patchy landscapes."

The   development of efficient numerical techniques for the large-scale simulation   is extremely important in understanding these porous media flows.  Due to   wave-like or traveling front problems and highly localized natures in the   coupled differential systems and the enormous size of many reservoir   simulation problems, an important goal of efficient numerical modeling is   the ability to effectively model these effects and the utilization of new   supercomputer architectures.  This project will  concentrate on the   development of finite element methods, computational codes, and   supporting mathematical analysis for underground contamination flows.    The numerical methods will be designed to simulate such complex features   of the flows as shock-line saturation fronts and steep composition gradients,   to produce accurate fluid velocities, to conserve mass locally, and to take   advantage of new parallel supercomputers. Self-adaptive local grid-  refinement methods and efficient implementation techniques for iterative   solution of large linear systems are also studied.    A three-year program of research is proposed into the development of   accurate numerical techniques, efficient computational codes, and   supporting mathematical analysis for  modeling of multiphase flows and   transport in groundwater hydrology which has applications in design of   remediation and cleanup technologies.  The development of improved   methods for assessing groundwater contamination by hazardous wastes  has become increasingly important.  Indeed, groundwater supplies are   increasingly threatened by organic, inorganic, and radioactive contaminants   introduced into the environment by improper disposal or acci dental release.    Estimates of remediation costs at U.S. government sites alone range into the   hundreds of billions of dollars. Protecting the quality of groundwater   supplies is a grand challenge problem of broad societal importance.  There   are also a number of industrial applications of the proposed research.  The   production and management of oil reservoirs are governed by equations and  technologies that are nearly identical to those exploited in groundwater   hydrology.  The manufacture of high quality fiber reinforced plastic   composites for automotive and aerospace applications is controlled by   technology similar to that studied in this project.  Design of semiconductors   uses equations very analogous to those for groundwater transport.  In these   areas, technology transfer can be easily carried out: use of the codes   developed for, industrial collaboration with the researchers of, and   employment of students trained on this project."

The plan is to  explore and    develop ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, advanced  numerical   techniques, asymptotics and rigorous mathematical analysis for  prototypical   problems, to reach a solid, coherent and practical level of  understanding   for the dynamical issues in polymeric liquids, high temperature   superconductors, etc. PI's work will be carried out in close  collaboration  with chemists and experimental physicists. In this initial phase,  PI proposes to study the following problems. (1). Dynamics and  morphology   of phase separation involving polymers. The emphasis is on   understanding the interplay between isotropic molecular  interaction  which drives the phase separation, and the anisotropic molecular  interaction which gives rise to orientational order, as well as  phase separation driven by polymerization. (2). Geometric defects  of  smectic liquid crystals. (3). Efficient and accurate numerical  methods for   complex flows.This includes direct simulation of high Reynolds  number   turbulent flows, turbulence models and polymeric liquids such as  liquid  crystals. The emphasis will be on reliable, practical and  parallelizable   methods which can be used immediately to enhance progress on  other fronts.  %%%  Many areas of technology calls for the manufacturing of  microcellular  foams and composite materials out of polymer solutions. The most  promising   candidate for the next generation of flat panel display devices  are made by  chemically driven phase separation processes in a liquid  crystal-prepolymer   solution. While a vast amount of experimental results have been  accumulated,  both for flexible and rigid polymers, the dynamics of these  processes  and the implication to morphology is very poorly understood.  Theoretical   understanding is hindered by the extreme complexity of these  problems. The   current proposal is a coordinat ed effort between applied  mathematicians,   chemists and physists to tackle this problem. A key component of  this   proposal is the numerical simulation of these processes using   state-of-the-art numerical methods and computers. The fact that  polymers are often large and non-uniform in their sizes makes  this problem  fundamentally different from the phase separation of ordinary  binary  liquids.  ***"

In particular, it is   proposed to analyze the effects of the small scale dissipation or relaxation   processes on large scale physical quantities and their motions. Other   questions such as global existence of both strong and weak solutions,   nonlinear stability of basic wave patterns, uniqueness of weak entropy   solutions, layer behavior of solutions, numerical methods for the computation   of discontinuous flows, and fluid-dynamic limit for kinetic models are also   to be explored. It is planned to continue the current effort to expand the   existing techniques and to develop new tools for studying some of these   problems. One of the main idea is to refine the conventional methods designed   to study smooth flows or unrelaxed systems by taking into account more   internal structures of the underlying discontinuous flows, and study these   problems both theoretically and numerically.    %%%   Nonlinear evolution of partial differential equations arising from   physical balance laws govern many of the most widely encountered phenomena in   nature. Solutions to these nonlinear systems remain a central topic in the   study of wave propagations and are fundamental to the understanding of basic    physical phenomena ranging from compressible and incompressible fluids,   acoustic waves and electromagnetic scattering to wave propagations in   nonlinear composite materials, in reactive gas mixtures, in fiber optics,  as well as in magnetohydrodynamics and general relativity. In this project,   It is proposed to study some of the basic questions for these nonlinear   systems, which are motivated directly by important applications to many fields   such as image processing, aeronautics, composite material, sonar, radar,   medical imaging, geophysical exploration, weather prediction, oil reservoir   simulations etc.. For example, the proposed study of design of high resolution   multi-dimensional numerical methods for calculating sharp fronts for mixed   type partial differential equations is extremely important for the oil   reservoir simulations, design of composite materials, imaging processing,   and propagation of pollutants such as oil in water and air; the proposed   study of boundary layer theory is one of the key ingredients in the   understanding of turbulence, and the design of supersonic aircrafts, etc..   Thus the accomplishment of this project should be of considerable importance   in the improvement and new development of technologies in the above mentioned   fields.  ***"

This is motivated by the desire to improve the   performance of computer programs that simulate the dynamics of   biomolecules, with particular attention to the MDScope simulation program   NAMD/SIgMA.  Much of the proposed work is general and applies directly   to a variety of applications modeled by Hamiltonian systems, such as   astrophysics, some structural dynamics problems, and wave propagation.    Some of the work is less general but can be adapted to other applications.    Typically, the complicated dynamics of Hamiltonian systems is a combined   effect of many simple interactions, often having a range of time scales.  A   key emphasis of the research is the development of sound ""long-timestep""   methods, which exploit the slowness present in many components of the   motion and the possible regularity present in other components.  More   specifically, such methods evaluate some interactions at time increments   that well exceed half the period of the fast modes of the system.  Another   emphasis is the design of time stepping schemes that can compute long   trajectories having the right qualities.  A specific goal is the construction of   a multiple time stepping scheme that can be used both with long timesteps   and for long-time simulations--existing schemes fail in one respect or the   other.  Another specific goal is to reduce the cost of certain calculations,   such as inverse-square-law forces, by reducing their accuracy without   sacrificing qualitative properties.    Mathematical formulas are being devised that can predict typical motions of   large molecules such as proteins and DNA.  The aim is find shortcuts that   enable very fast calculations on large computers.  These ideas are tested for   accuracy and speed, and the more useful ones are put into the software that   biologis ts and other scientists use to study the action of molecules.    Computer simulations can help the scientist to understand how molecules   perform biological functions, which can be very difficult to observe   experimentally. Such studies are also useful in the design of molecules for   agricultural and medical purposes.  Much of the proposed work is general   and extends to other applications in which dissipation is negligible, such as   astrophysics, some structural dynamics problems, and wave propagation."

Basic analyses of the governing systems of nonlinear partial   differential equations will also be undertaken.    Multiple scales problems are difficult because the uniform resolution of the   smallest scales present would lead to a prohibitively large computational   problem, even for the fastest machines likely to be available in the coming   decades. They are also a common feature of scientifically and   technologically important phenomena in a number of distinct physical   settings.

Singular perturbations may be thought of as small   changes in the equations which can lead to large qualitative and quantitative   changes in the solutions.

The following topics are studied: (1)  computation and bifurcations of invariant tori, (2) computation  of Lyapunov exponents and applications, (3) orthogonal  factorizations for time-dependent matrices and applications, (4)  Riccati equations, (5) logarithms of matrices and matrix  interpolation.  In each case the project combines theoretical  analysis and extensive computational testing, and develops  working codes.  Several aspects of this research are being carried  out in collaboration with Timo Eirola, Jens Lorenz, Erik Van  Vleck, Alessandra Papini, Aldo Pasquali, and Ph.D. students  Michael Keeve and Benedetta Morini.  The investigator analyzes and  implements algorithms to compute invariant tori of  parameter-dependent dynamical systems and to study their  bifurcations.  He studies ways to monitor Lyapunov type numbers on  the tori in order to detect their smoothness and understand and  classify their bifurcations and breakdown mechanisms.  The whole  issue of computation of Lyapunov type numbers (or Lyapunov  exponents) is also considered.  Quantitative information on these  numbers is needed in order to obtain a reliable stability picture  for time-dependent linear systems and nonlinear systems.  He  examines applications of this tool to error control.  Efficient  and reliable techniques for computation of Lyapunov exponents  require study of orthogonal factorizations of time-dependent  matrices.  The investigator works on numerical solution of Riccati  equations, and develops an integration code based on Gauss  Runge-Kutta schemes.  He studies techniques for computation of  logarithms of matrices, emphasisizing the case of a sequence of  slowly varying matrices and its application to interpolants of  matrices.  Finally, he is writing a book on numerical dynamical  systems with emphasis on direct approximation techniques .       Differential equations are one of the most powerful models  to describe physical phenomena.  They provide a compact  description of a system by giving a continuous description of how  a given position in (phase) space of a system at a particular  time influences neighboring positions in the immediate future.  The price for such a compact description is that we then need to  solve the differential equation in order to obtain information  about the system.  Solving the differential equation, except in  trivial cases, cannot be done exactly, and we must resort to  numerical techniques.  The investigator devises numerical  techniques for differential equations, motivated by the following  question: What should we approximate, what should we monitor?  Existing techniques are typically very reliable at tracking a  specific solution (a trajectory) of the equation over a short  time interval, but they are inadequate to provide a complete  description of the system, which would need knowledge about many  solutions over long time intervals.  This need is particularly  true for models of complicated phenomena, which may take the form  of systems of coupled oscillators and coupled nonlinear  differential equations, or high-dimensional time-varying matrix  equations.  These cases are of interest in this project and find  applications in almost all applied sciences: from the study of  complicated biological and chemical interactions, to the optimal  control of time-dependent manufacturing processes, to stability  assessment for time-dependent phenomena in general.  In concrete,  the following issues are studied. (1) For many systems, all  solutions eventually approach a finite region of phase space, and  then stay there afterwards.  The investigator devises techniques  that target directly such eventual finite regions, to avoid  transient behavior. (2) A differential equation, because it  mimics a given physical system, usually has built in some key  properties.  For example, in modeling a rigid rotat ion, the  solutions of the differential equation should be rigid rotations.  Unfortunately, most numerical techniques will fail at preserving  even such a seemingly simple characteristic.  The failure of a  numerical method to preserve essential characteristics might have  very unpleasant effects.  The investigator works on techniques  that maintain the relevant geometrical properties of the  solutions. (3) For a given model, the fundamental question is the  one of stability.  How robust is the model? How sensitive are  solutions to small changes in the model? Or, in a deceivingly  different but mathematically equivalent way, how fast is a system  approaching its eventual state? The investigator studies ways to  monitor indicators in order to answer these questions, and also  applies this study to assess error propagation during  discretization."

These topics by and large have not been systematically  covered in the general books dealing with asymptotics, yet are of great  significance in applied science and engineering.  For instance, the central  limit theorem is one of the keystones of probability theory, yet no readily  available source on asymptotics has discussed its applications and  ramifications.  Certain problems in combinatorics, in particular, the  theory of random walks, can be elucidated by asymptotic methods; yet these  have received no unified treatment.  Most books have an extensive treatment  of differential equations, but difference equations, which are just as  important, require their own methods of attack.  Renewal equations, which  arise in investigations in computer science and engineering, have been  occasionally treated but have not yet received the attention they deserve.  The topics to be investigated are motivated by these deficiencies:  the  drunkard's walk and convolution sequences;  the stability and convergence  of the solutions of non-linear difference equations;  the application of  probabilistic methods to problems in applied asymptotic analysis; error  distribution in the numerical inversion of matrices; and renewal equations  arising in the recovery of information in communications systems employing  multiaccess channels.  %%%    Scientists are often interested in what happens ""in the large.""  Examples of this abound in everyday life.  For instance, if the number of  users of the internet continues to grow in some well-defined fashion, what  precisely will happen to the time required to log onto the system?  What is  the likelihood that a medication ingested into the human system will reach  its target after an extended period of time?  How are the populations of a  given agricultural pest and the plants on which it feeds related over an  extended period of time?  Is the future growth in major criminal  offenses  in a city strongly dependent on the current rate of minor criminal  offenses?  Will the population of a country, given sufficient food supply,  continue to grow at a disastrous rate, or are there self-limiting features  of population growth that will prevent this from happening?   The  scientific mathematical language often used to model such situations is  called the theory of difference equations.  In this research program, we  intend to develop new methods for attacking such equations, and hence to  help resolve some practical issues which these equations describe.  ***"

They propose to investigate a broad range of areas in harmonic analysis, operator theory, function theory, and differential equations.  Specific areas of research include analysis of Bergman and Hardy spaces and the operators which act on them, the relationship between the geometry of complex domains and the associated function theory and operator theory,   the theory of wavelets and related constructions and the applications of those tools and ideas in theoretical and computational problems, and harmonic analysis on trees and the exploration of the analogies between analysis on trees and continuous harmonic analysis.     The principal investigators propose research programs in harmonic analysis (in the broad sense).  One of the basic unifying viewpoints in harmonic analysis is the development of systematic techniques to decompose complicated objects into simple, well understood, pieces put together in a straightforward way.  In many cases these same techniques, which were first developed to understand theoretical mathematical constructs, can also be   adapted productively to the analysis and manipulation of data and images.  An important recent example of this is the development of new waveform technologies which have provided important new tools in signal processing.  The detailed research proposed includes both theoretical and applied components.  The latter center on expanding the range of applicability of the new adapted waveforms techniques such as wavelets. Those techniques, originally developed for use in theoretical mathematics, have already   provided important new tools in signal processing.  It appears that they these ideas have great potential for further development as tools for computation and for data analysis.  That development is one of the themes of the proposed research."

It relates to a new method for  the  solution of such problems, based on high-order boundary  perturbation  and analytic continuation techniques, that was introduced by the  principal investigator in the context of diffraction gratings.  There,  the numerical algorithms produced, in many cases, results with  substantially improved accuracy over that given by classical  approaches.  The proposed research concerns new applications of the method in  other  challenging areas of current interest in electromagnetics and  acoustics and the further study and improvement of the numerical  properties of the resulting algorithms. Both the forward and  inverse   scattering problems will be investigated for a variety of  configurations, including scattering by electrically large  bounded  bodies and in ocean waveguides. In particular, the benchmark  problems  of electromagnetic scattering by three-dimensional cubes and of  sound   propagation in oceans with rough surfaces will be treated. Based  on  some preliminary studies, it is expected that the performance of  the  method in these areas will be of a quality comparable   to the one it exhibited in prior implementations.  %%%    The ability to predict the shape of the electromagnetic or  acoustic  field scattered as an incident wave encounters an obstacle or  interface has been long recognized as having major implications  in a  great number of scientific and engineering disciplines. Indeed,  much of  what we ""see"" --be it through visible light or x-rays,   radio or microwaves-- or ""hear"" reaches us through a complicated  combination of phenomena among which scattering is, in most  cases, an   essential element. As such, a better understanding of how light  and  sound waves propagate and diffract has led, in the last few  decades,  to substantial advances in a variety of fields; these include  communications, monitoring, s eismic profiling, tomography and  target   detection, to name just but a few. An important role in these  advances  was the one played by mathematical modeling and, with the advent  of   computers, that of computational science. The present and future  needs, however, demand the development of more efficient,  accurate and  reliable algorithms to deal with complex geometries and media.  Indeed,  the resolution of the scattering in such situations (such as when  dealing with human tissue or undersea topography) often entails  calculating a highly oscillatory field. When using most classical  algorithms these oscillations translate into high computational  costs,  as these methods attempt to capture the variations of the field  at  each point in time and space. Therefore, alternative approaches  whose   complexity does not correlate to that of the field under study  become  very desirable. The present project relates to one such approach,  that  was successfully developed by the principal investigator in the  context of micro-optical devices. The proposed research concerns  new   applications of this novel method in other challenging areas of  current interest in electromagnetics and acoustics where it is  expected to provide a valuable computational tool.  ***"

This model replaces the usual finite linear  system with an integral equation in which the unknown is a Borel  measure. The research includes an analysis of the convergence  properties of this algorithm, numerical methods of implementation by  spline and wavelet bases, and an analysis of the smoothing effects of  these bases.  The convergence results provide mathematical reasons in  terms of the regularity properties of Borel measures, for the  seeming divergence of the numerical implementations of the finite  dimensional EM-ML algorithm. Also, since the EM-ML algorithm has been  recently extended to linear integral equations in which the kernel and  the unknown function are nonnegative, these results provide important  insight into the open problem of convergence of this algorithm. In  addition, the research introduces, analyzes, and develops novel  algorithms for dealing with data errors due to accidental coincidences  and attenuation. The proposers also investigate the mathematical  properties of the probability functions which link the emissions to  the detector geometry in both PET and single photon emission computed  tomography (SPECT). Preliminary work for SPECT links these functions  to the classical Poisson kernel. This study is important for  developing accurate, efficient, fast, alternatives to the EM-ML  reconstruction algorithm.  %%%  The mathematical realization of many problems in science, engineering,  and medicine, give rise to inverse problems which are ill-posed in the  sense of Hadamard, and in which positivity plays an important role.  This proposal deals mainly with the particular example of such a  problem occuring in the nuclear imaging procedure of PET. In this  procedure, a patient is given a radiopharmaceutical which is absorbed  disprop ortionately by various regions of the organ of interest and  emits positrons according to the amount absorbed. These emissions are  collected by PET scanners which surround the region of interest and  then used in reconstruction algorithms which generate images  containing important information about the metabolism of an organ or  region of interest. This information is extremely useful for blood  flow and metabolic activity studies. For instance, it is a valuable  tool in the diagnosis of tumors, in determining their rates of growth;  in psychological studies for mapping activation areas of the brain to  cognitive tasks, in determining the effects of various drugs on the  brain, and in quantitative measures of the health of the human heart.  The proposers develop a refined mathematical model for the PET process  and introduce novel mathematical and numerical methods for the  reconstruction of PET images. These reconstruction algorithms are  sufficiently flexible to deal with significant errors in the PET data,  caused by anatomical obstructions which prevent some of the emitted  photons from being registered in the appropriate detector. An  important component of this work is the development and evaluation of  efficient, reliable, accurate algorithms for reconstructing PET  images.  Although primarily directed to PET studies, the  results obtained in this reserach are also applicable to other medical  and engineering problems, such as those which occur in liver biopsies,  nondestructive evaluation of manufactured items, and the restoration  of blurred images from outer space.    ***"

Parker on solar coronal heating. According to Parker the main  source of heat  in the solar corona consists of very thin regions of intense  current (current sheets) which arise as a mediation between the tendency of  coronal plasma to relax to equilibrium, and certain topological constraints.  Such constraints arise due to the near perfect conductivity of the coronal  plasma, and the anchoring of magnetic field lines at their footpoints or ends in  the dense gas of the photosphere, the footpoints being convected by the  turbulent motion of the photosphere. In attempting to understand the phenomenon  of current sheet formation in Parker's model a variational approach associated  with energy minimization will be used which relies on decompositions of magnetic  fields as a means of characterizing and prescribing field line topology. A  careful study will be made of which field line topologies withstand the weak  Sobolev space limits associated with the relaxation of a plasma towards minimum  energy. A general two-dimensional theory will be developed and applied to the  analysis of well known examples of current sheet formation in the astrophysics  literature. Beginnings of a fully three-dimensional theory will be described  with special emphasis on localized vector potential analogs of the flux  function representation of plasmas in two dimensions. Also topological  constraints involving helicity, and more refined measures of field line topology  measuring higher order linkage will be explored.  %%%  One of the outstanding open problems in solar astrophysics is the existence  of enormously high temperatures in the sun's atmosphere (corona), on the order  of two million degrees Fahrenheit, which have baffled astrophysicists for  generations.

In this project one  of the  leading models of coronal heating, due to E.N.Parker, will be analyzed on a  rigorous mathematical level. It is hoped that this will help resolve  uncertainties, and clarify the basic physical mechanism involved in coronal  heating.  Due to the relationship with sun spots and solar flares(violent  disruptions in the solar corona which propel plasma and associated magnetic  fields toward the earth), the issue of coronal heating is directly tied to  practical issues of variations in the earth's climate and electromagnetic  interference.  ***"

The first step in the framework involves using distributed parameter control theory for PDE  control problems to obtain an explicit infinite dimensional control law.  The controller is  based on compensator design so that state estimates are used (requiring only a small  number of state measurements) as opposed to full-state feedback, in which the full  distributed state must be known.  The next step relies on obtaining integral  representations of feedback control operators in terms of feedback functional gains.  The  use of the special spatial structure of these functional gains allows for approximation  schemes which result in low-order controllers.  Moreover, analysis of local dynamics  motivated by such approximations will give insight into sensor placement and design.

Unlike traditional homogeneous turbulence  theory, these models capture the essential features of the long-lived,  large-scale structures that form in the process of turbulent  relaxation.  Moreover, they furnish definite macroscopic equations for  the coherent structures that persist amidst the microscopic disorder.  The proposed investigations address the formulation, justification and  solution of these statistical equilibrium models.  The goal of the  work is to answer fundamental questions about prototype models drawn  from hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.  Both analytical and  numerical methods are employed.  On the theoretical side, continuum  and lattice models are constructed, and their properties are  established using a synthesis of x-space and k-space methods.

The ultimate goal is a mathematical description of the manner in which waves of combustion originate, interact, respond to disturbances, and undergo transitions.  Work is proposed in four specific areas: two  in which the medium is a single-phase material, i.e., a gaseous mixture, and   two in which the medium is a two-phase material, i.e., a mixture of solid   particles and gas.  In the single-phase context the plan is to study (i) how  flames propagate through a stratified mixture in which the scale of  stratification is comparable to the natural length of the flame, and (ii) how  detonations evolve and propagate (or fail to do so) in regions of temperature,  velocity and concentration gradients, especially in nonplanar configurations.  In the two-phase portion of the study the objectives are (i) asymptotic   reduction of complex models by exploitation of certain natural and realistic  limits of rapid equilibration, and (ii) exploration of regularization issues  arising in the numerical implementation of reduced models.  In all cases the  effort will focus largely on unsteady processes.  It is anticipated that the   problems will be modelled, by and large, by systems of nonlinear partial  differential equations.

One c lass of problems under study deals  with propagation of flames and detonations in stratified mixtures.  This is  an area of practical interest in several contexts, including fire safety   where stratification may have been caused by an accidental spill, and   internal combustion engines where a stratified charge may have been produced   intentionally.  The second class of problems is concerned with the occurence   of explosions in damaged explosives, which can be highly susceptible to  low-velocity impacts or relatively mild thermal insults.  ***"

These problems give rise to challenging   nonlinear initial boundary value problems, the mathematical statements of   which involve one or more nonlinear parabolic equations, governing  the   diffusion of heat and the diffusion of a chemical concentration, and the time   harmonic version of Maxwell's equations.  These equations are coupled   together in a nonlinear fashion and, in addition, nonlinear heat balances are   required in certain applications where surface temperatures produce  significant thermal radiation.  It is proposed to develop and use asymptotic   methods, dictated by certain physical limits, to simplify the mathematical   systems and to develop and use numerical methods to solve the reduced   problems.    The goals of the project are twofold.  The first is the mathematical   understanding of the basic physical mechanisms which make the processes   work.  Such an understanding would give scientists and engineers involved   in microwave processing of ceramics the basic scientific underpinnings to   judge and interpret their experimental findings. The second is the   development and application of asymptotic, numerical, and other    approximate methods required to obtain an accurate description of more   realistic and complicated processes. The successful completion of the   proposed research would allow engineers and scientists to design more   efficient sintering and joining processes for ceramics which would produce   higher quality materials.  It would also help in the design and   implementation of microwave assisted vapor deposition processes which are   highly promising in the construction of composite ceramic materials."

On large scales, particles evolve diffusively  or nondiffusively depending on the fluid flows. One of the focuses of this   project is the sharp criteria for the diffusive regime. Novel variational   methods have been employed to obtain such criteria for steady flows.   The extension of the variational methods to unsteady flows and weakly  compressible flows are proposed. Furthermore, within the diffusive regime,  the influence of fluid velocities on  the transport coefficients, the   effective diffusivity, is of both practical and theoretical importance,   particularly when the molecular diffusivity is small. As such, the fluid   velocities typically enhance the effective diffusivity by orders of magnitude.   The variational methods have been successfully applied to obtain nontrivial   power laws for convection enhanced diffusion in two-dimensional  steady flows.   It remains to be extended to analyze turbulent diffusion in three dimensional   random flows and chaotic diffusion in two dimensional unsteady flows. The   variational methods also provide naturally a framework for numerical   computations of the transport coefficients to which the well established   numerical methods for symmetric problems can now be applied. In the   non-diffusive regime, being an effective tool for  analyzing physical    quantities for finite volume, the variational methods are potentially useful   in studying anomalous diffusion in the infinite volume limit. Finally, it is   of enormous interest to understand  the diffusion time scale and other   transient time scales. The martingale method and the extension of the   contractivity estimates (for symmetric processes) to the singularly  non-symmetric convection-diffusion processes are proposed to study the time   scales problem.  %%%    Since the great scientists A. Einstein and N. Wiener laid the theoretical   foundation for the study of the  Brownian motion, great effort has been made   to understand the combined effect of the Brownian motion on the molecular   scale and the fluid motion on the ordinary scale. Such problem is also of   enormous practical importance since most of the mass and heat transfer   processes in chemical engineering, ground water contamination and global   change in the atmosphere involve both kinds of motion. As it turns out, the   typical smallness in  size of molecular Brownian motion, and chaos and   randomness in convective motion give rise to numerous interesting phenomena   on large scales such as convection enhanced diffusion where the size of the   Brownian motion  is greatly enhanced, multiple scales where the transport   processes behave differently on different scales, and anomalous diffusion for   which an appropriate description is yet to be found. This project proposes a   rigorous  framework and effective methods for studying the convection-  diffusion problem, which has yielded many important results. This and other   hopeful research outcomes will add to our fundamental understanding  of one   of the most basic transport processes affecting our lives.  ***"

The point of departure of  this investigation from  traditional membrane mechanics is the observation that even highly flexible  membranes exhibit some resistance to a change of curvature. This is  known as bending stiffness and is introduced in the improved model by   including a second order derivative dependence in the strain energy  density. The foundational theory has been previously established.  In this proposal, it is sought to apply the theory to a variety of   problems of practical interest with the goal of understanding how bending   stiffness regularizes the behavior of membranes. The basic theme among  these problems is placing a membrane into a state in  which  some region is attempting to support a compressive stress. We anticipate   that the membrane will wrinkle. Standard nonlinear membrane theory fails  to describe this behavior. One objective is to find the qualitative   nature of the wrinkles. Another is to understand how the bending   stiffness stablizes wrinkling deformations. Also the comparison of   results between the zero and nonzero bending stiffness membrane responses  is of extreme interest as it has implications for both mathematics and   mechanics. Specific examples to be considered include inflatables which  are prone to wrinkle, diaphragms, inextensible approximations,  and  vibrations of tense and slack sheets.  %%%        The comfort  technology has given us often requires engineers to  work with thin, flexible sheets, layers, laminates, and coatings of   material. It is problematic for design engineers that these materials will   fold, wrinkle, blister, buckle, and crease during manufacture or operation   thereby reducing their reliability and quality.  Unfortunately, most   mathematical models cannot predict this unwanted behavior,   which makes it difficult for engineers to prevent it. Fortunately, a material   model seeking to  address these shortcomings was developed in  recent years under funding from the National Science Foundation. It is   the purpose of this current proposal to continue this investigation by   using this model to provide examples detailing the formations  of folds and wrinkles in a wide variety of situations leading to a  qualitative and quantitative insight into these engineering   difficulties.  The generality of the model   permits application by  engineers and material   scientists alike to a spectrum of industrial problems ranging from   the blistering of thin coatings to the wrinkling of biomedical   surgical inflatables. Conceivably, the knowledge gained could impact  circuit board manufacture,  air bag safety technology, and even   biomechanical cellular membrane questions which arise in health care.  ***"

It provides a link between stochastic and deterministic  (robust  control) approaches.  Risk sensitive control is related to large deviations theory for  stochastic  processes.  Dynamic two player games also arise naturally in the analysis.   For continuous time models described by controlled stochastic differential equations,  these games (called differential games) are analyzed using viscosity  solution methods  for nonlinear partial differential  equations.  One part of this research concerns risk   sensitive control, with complete state information (state  feedback).  Extensions of  existing theory, and applications to engineering control and financial economics will be  considered.  A second part of this project concerns partial state information (output  feedback) risk sensitive control, where the theory  is less well developed.  A key idea  in the analysis is that  of information state.     The disturbance attenuation problem in control theory is to design feedback control  laws which give system stability  and satisfactory performance in the presence of   unpredictable system inputs (or disturbances).  In risk  sensitive stochastic control,  disturbances are modeled as  random events and an exponential criterion of system   performance is used.  Feedback controls which optimize such risk sensitive criteria  provide better protection against rare disturbances which may cause very poor system  performance.  For example, in routing flows in data communication systems, the control  design seeks to avoid  long delays and buffer overflows due to  rare bursts of heavy  traffic.  Risk sensitive control theory also provides a natural link between stochastic  control theory and another widely used approach (robust  control) in which disturbances  are modeled  in a deterministic (non-random) manner.  ***"

The research component will focus on  the   development and application of dynamical systems theory to  physical   problems in bubble dynamics and accelerators, as well as the  study of split-  operator numerical schemes.  In the area of bubble dynamics, the  research   will focus on the strongly nonlinear differential equations  modeling one-   and two-bubble systems.  In particular, a Hamiltonian formulation  of two-  bubble systems is proposed that reveals the salient features of  their   interaction and facilitates a quantitative global analysis of  these systems.    An improved criterion for the cavitation of isolated bubbles is  also sought.    In the area of accelerators, the work comprises a broad array of  analytical   and numerical questions that involve the rates of nonlinear  growth of shear   layers, the magnitudes of their saturation amplitudes, the  development of   Melnikov theory for integro-differential equations, and the  dynamics of   amplitude-modulated beams in a Radio Frequency Quadrapole.  The  work   on split-operator schemes will involve identifying the explicit  structure of   Nth order partitioned split-operator schemes.  The education plan  aims to   incorporate into the classroom several aspects of the principal  investigator's   experience in applied dynamical systems theory.  On the graduate  level, a   multi-tiered effort is underway through which current graduate  students in   mathematics are trained to conduct applied dynamical systems  research, and   students from other disciplines (mechanical engineering,  cognitive and   neural science, and economics) acquire tools from dynamical  systems for   their research.  The effort also includes the development of a  new course in   nonlinear dynamics of bubble oscillations, research group  activity in   singular perturbation theory, and a complete revision of an   advanced   undergraduate course in  the methods of applied mathematics.    The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early   development of academic faculty as both educators and  researchers.  The   Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a  Foundation-  wide  program that provides for the support of junior faculty  within the   context of their overall career development.  It combines in a  single   program the support of quality research and education in the  broadest sense   and the full participation of those traditionally  underrepresented in science   and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the  importance   the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced  academic   careers which include both research and education."

It will also provide a unique opportunity for cross-disciplinary exchange of research. The conference has received endorsements from the Mathematical Programming Society and the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science, and is being held in cooperation with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  Networks are pervasive in modern life, whether real, as in the case of highways, pipelines, electrical systems, etc., or more abstract network models which represent interconnections among components of a complex system.  Advances in data structures and computer technology and the development of new algorithms have made it possible to solve classes of netwo rk optimization problems that were formerly intractable.

Nonlinear Dispersive  Oscillations,     II. Hele-Shaw Flows and III. Stokes Flows. In project I, the  main     purpose is to analyze the generation and propagation of  oscillations     described by the defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation as  dispersion     goes to zero. Microscopically, the oscillations propagate  according to     the Whitham equations. The proposed method is a construction  of solutions     of the Whitham equations via a hodograph transform. Both  projects II     and III concern the motion of an interface between a more  viscous     fluid and a less viscous fluid to be regarded as invicid. The  viscous     fluid is governed by Darcy's law in the second project, and by  the     Stokes equations in the last one. The emphases are on the  types of     singularity formation in the presence of surface tension,  Hele-Shaw     and Stokes flows in dimension 3. The proposed methods will be  both     analytical and computational.  %%%      Nonlinear dispersive oscillations can be observed in  collisionless shocks     in plasmas and optical shocks in optical fibers. What is  fascinating     about this phenomenon is the phase transition between  different regions.     The goal is to understand the phase transition from  non-oscillatory     to oscillatory regions. Both Hele-Shaw and Stokes flows are  flows in     porous media. It is well known that the interface will be  unstable     when a less viscous fluid drives a more viscous fluid. This  instability     is responsible for water flooding of oil wells, and is of  obvious     importance to oil reservoir engineering. The aim is to  understand this     instability in detail. The principal investigator proposes to  use     some new analytical and numerical techniques to study these  problems.  ***"

Well known physicist  M. Berry formulated three hypotheses about possible physical and  mathematical effects of fractalness: 1) intermittent structure of the  scattering amplitude 2) a slower decay of scattered (coda) waves, 3)  existence of a large number of states in a thin boundary layer which  leads to a nonstandard asymptotic behavior of the spectral function . It  turns out that properties of wave and heat propagation in domains with  fractal boundaries depend on geometrical properties of fractals, and  more profound analysis requires, first of all, classification of fractals.    The authors of the proposal singled out three broad classes of fractals:  cabbage type (domain contains a system of flat cuts accumulated to the  outer boundary), bubble type (domain contains a system of bubbles  accumulated to the outer boundary), and web type (with a system of  thin cylinders). There are many natural objects with a similar boundary  structure: the earth lithosphere, boundary layer of polymer materials in  the process of aging, recrystallized or tempered layer of metals, etc.  Similar structures can also be formed artificially to create a material  with new properties. The authors proved that the eigenvalue counting  function of the Dirichlet Laplacian in cabbage type domains has two-  term asymptotics with the order of the second term equal to one half of  the Minkowski dimension of the boundary, i.e. the modified Weyl-  Berry hypotheses is valid. They also show that this hypotheses fails for  bubble and web type domains.    It is proposed to find the spectral asymptotics (eigenvalue counting  function, theta-function, zeta-function) for the Dirichlet problem for the  Laplacian in bubble and web type domains, and find geometrical  characteristics of the fractal which determine the second term of the  asymptotics. It is proposed to classify the spectru m of the Neumann  Laplacian for cabbage and bubble type domains (determine when the  spectrum is absolutely continuous, dense pure point, discreet) and find  conditions when the Weyl law (existence of the main term of spectral  asymptotics) is valid or the second term of the spectral asymptotics  exists. It is also proposed to find large time behavior of the solutions  to exterior mixed problems for the wave equation in bubble and web  type domains, and in particular , to find large time behavior of the  scattered waves.  %%%    The goal of the proposal is to study the phenomena of reflection,  absorption and scattering of waves by obstacles with very irregular  (fractal) boundaries. It turns out that properties of wave and heat  propagation in domains with very irregular boundaries depend on  geometrical properties of boundaries, and more profound analysis  requires, first of all, geometrical classification of irregularity of the  boundary.

The research project focuses on the consequences of the  stress-driven morphological instability which occurs during film  growth.  In particular, the formation of the ""island"" morphology will  be explained in terms of mathematical models for the morphological  instability.  The research program consists of two projects, one  focusing on single-component films, the second focusing on alloy  films.  In the first project, a ""state of the art"" model for the  formation of three-dimensional islands will be developed.  This model  will include a crucial treatment of the wetting layer between the film  and its underlying substrate.  In the second project, a basic model  will be developed for the more complicated problem of morphology  development in alloy films, where composition variations and stress  variations are coupled.  In both projects the mathematical models are  nonlinear free boundary problems for the shape of the film.  These  problems will be analyzed using applied mathematical techniques which  include analytical, asymptotic, and numerical methods.  In particular,  an asymptotic description for the island shape will be derived which  takes advantage of the fact that islands generally have a much smaller  height than width.  The results of the work will be compared to  observations of islands in strained film systems from both  collaborative research projects and published experimental results.  The models will be evaluated to determine the extent to which they can  be used to predict and control morphologies, as well as to determine  future directions for improving mathematical models of strained film  growth as part of a long-term research program.    %%%    The objective of this research is to develop mathematical models to  predict and control mo rphology development in strained solid films.  Strained solid films are of great technological importance in  semiconductor device applications.  The strained films are grown from  a vapor through the deposition of the solid film onto an underlying  substrate of a different material.  Because of the bonding of the film  to the substrate, the film is grown in a state of stress.  During the  growth of these films, the stresses in the film can lead to the  formation of bumps, or ""islands.""  The presence of these islands has a  crucial effect on the electronic properties of the thin film device,  so a knowledge of what controls island formation enables a better  control over the electronic properties of the strained film device.  The objective of this research is to describe island formation from  physically-derived mathematical models of the film growth process.  This mathematical model represents a complementary alternative to  traditional experiment-based research on strained films.  The primary  benefit of developing such a model is that it allows one to quickly  and easily determine how the growth of the film is affected by the  different material parameters and process parameters.  Thus, the model  has three main applications in the development and production of  strained solid films.  Firstly, by changing the parameters in the  model, the model can be used as a low-cost way to ""experiment"" with  different materials and growth configurations.  Secondly, the  mathematical model can be used to help engineer materials by  determining the necessary process inputs required to achieve a  strained solid film with specified physical and electronic properties.  Finally, the mathematical model can assist in the determination of  optimum and/or acceptable processing conditions for the manufacture of  strained films in industry.    ***"

It is   expected to contribute in the areas of  Multivariate Splines, Multivariate   Polynomial Interpolation, Radial Basis Function Approximation, Wavelets,   and Gabor Expansions.  The first topic concerns polynomial interpolation.    Several years ago, the proposers came up with a scheme that assigns, to any   data on any finite discrete pointset in several dimensions, a polynomial   interpolant of least possible degree, and with various other desirable   properties. It is proposed to develop an error formula for  that scheme, in   preparation for its application in cubatures or in the construction of   trivariate finite elements. The second topic deals with applications of the   theory of approximation from shift-invariant spaces, a theory that was   developed by the proposers and others.  One suggested application, of a   theoretical  nature, but pertinent to wavelets, explores the (surprising)   connection between the smoothness of functions in a refinable space and the   approximation orders provided by such a space.  Another, very unexpected,   application of shift-invariant space theory is in the area of approximation to   scattered data from the span of translates of a radial basis function. The   suggested approach is based on a new conversion formula that allows the   extension of many approximation schemes on uniform grids to general   grids.  The last topic deals with the representation of functions in one or   more variables via  decomposition/reconstruction techniques.  A thorough   understanding  reached in prior research on general shift-invariant systems   is now used in the constructions of new wavelet and Gabor systems.    Special attention is given to exploiting the freedom offered by the   redundancy inherent in oversampled systems.    Computer solutions of physical problems (including the problems to be   att acked by high performance computing) require a description of the   various physical aspects of the problem in the only language a computer   understands, namely numbers. The resulting mathematical description (of a   car door or the human heart, of pictures taken from a  satellite,  of the   moisture content of air as a function of longitude, latitude and height above   sea level, etc.) is of necessity inexact, and this makes it very important to   develop efficient methods of representation, i.e., methods of acceptable   accuracy and using not too many numbers. The proposal concerns the   development of such methods (for  descriptions involving several   parameters) and of means for ascertaining their accuracy and efficiency."

This work will also include  an extension of passive  system theory  to systems which are not necessarily affine in the  control variables.  %%%  Dynamical systems can exhibit complexity for a variety of  reasons; for example, complexity  arises in using microchip technologies to design devices for  sensing, or controlling, the  position and speed in an airplane, an automobile, or a high-speed  train.  Complexity can  also arise in mathematical models of physical and industrial  systems because of the  complex nature of the physical forces acting on a system. An  example of this phenomenon  is windshear, caused by a microburst of air, which can be  experienced during take-off and  landing of commercial aircraft.  The interaction of windshear  forces with the forces required  to achieve lift an aircraft is quite complex, often producing  nonintuitive reactions to pilot  induced forces.  The purpose of this research is to determine  ways to take advantage of  the potentially dramatic, though nonintuitive, effects caused by  the complex interactions of  physical forces with physical systems.   ***"

This leads to the computation of performance characteristics for these systems with applications in production management and systems reliability.  (b) Secondly, saddlepoint methods are used to approximate special functions arising in Statistics and applied Mathematics including Bessel and hypergeometric functions of scalar and matrix argument.  The matrix argument functions cannot always be accurately approximated and, when they can, the computational times needed are often prohibitive.  By contrast , the saddlepoint approximations are highly accurate and can always be computed in a couple seconds. (c) Saddlepoint approximations are developed for the multivariate cumulative distribution functions arising in sampling theory.  (d) Saddlepoint theory related to the generalized inverse Gaussian distributions is also investigated.    Concepts and models for stochastic systems and networks are now found in all areas of science.  Examples include various models for computer system networks, ecosystems, production management methods in manufacturing, and reliability testing.  The first part of this project develops methods that will allow for statistical inference with such models so as to assess various performance characteristics related to such systems.  These evaluations in turn allow for the description and prediction of outcomes for the system as well as for system construction and design.  Ultimately these model-based descriptions and predictions pertain to the real phenomena that underly the models.  The second major part of this proposal concerns the approximation of important special functions that arise in the use of statistical methods and applied mathematics.  Special functions were created by mathematicians because they repeatedly arise in the  solution of a wide range of important scientific problems. The special functions addressed here are called Bessel and hypergeometric functions and are perhaps the most important, widely encompassing and general of the special functions in Mathematics.  These functions historically have played a central role in the physical and mathematical sciences and are extremely difficult to compute.  The proposal suggests highly accurate approximations to these functions that can be computed in a fraction of the time that is currently needed for their approximation."

They work toward a general  theory that categorizes cooperative behavior in nature as  kin-selected behavior, group-selected behavior, byproduct  mutualism, or reciprocal altruism.  In pursuit of this goal, their  investigation focuses on cooperative behaviors that can be  excluded on a priori grounds from the first two categories  mentioned above.  Examples of such behaviors are food sharing in  ravens and defensive behavior in lions.  Accordingly, the  investigators focus on reciprocity versus mutualism and develop a  mathematical model with the power to discriminate between these  two categories of cooperative behavior.  The model is important  because many examples of reciprocity in nature have been  hypothesized, but hardly any have been proven: without such a  model, virtually every example is equally interpretable as a case  of mutualism.       The goal of the study is to determine whether animals can  cooperate in nature because they keep score of favors done to --  and favors received from -- specific individuals, or because  acting in their long-term self-interest coincides with acting in  the best interest of their community, even though they do not  keep score.  From a purely scientific perspective, an answer to  this question will advance current knowledge of animal behavior  considerably.  From a more utilitarian perspective, even though  the study's primary subjects are non-human animals in the wild,  the investigators' findings will be relevant to achieving  cooperation among humans as well.  In particular, the study's  findings may help to solve the urgent problem of the commons,  i.e., the problem of designing cooperative social structures for  sustainable management of the global environment."

The mathematical  problems address the general questions:  How  do nonlinear systems relax to equilibrium?  How do interfaces and defects  form and how do they propagate?  These questions arise both for diffuse and  sharp interface models.  We also encounter interesting questions in  phase interface dynamics which are closely tied to interesting questions in  geometry.  We intend to obtain information on the qualitative behavior of  phase states predicted by several new models  as well as classical modelsfor  phase transition.  We will consider isothermal  solid-solid transitions  which occur without a change in the total amount of each species and we will  also study liquid-solid transformations where a heat equation is coupled to  that for the order parameter. There are natural situations where the  perimeter or the geometry of the interface, does not change significantly  during the evolution.  Then a reduction to a finite dimensional dynamical  system is often possible.  A good deal of our effort in these investigations  is spent towards  identifying and  understanding the underlying finite  dimensional  dynamics.  %%%  We investigate  certain physical phenomena where surface  tension  plays a role. Surface tension is responsible for the shape of planets, as  well as for the shape of rain drops.  It is also  the reason why skating on  ice is possible. Generally it is a second order effect.  However when the  other forces balance each other, surface tension can  become the determining  factor.  Here is anexample:  In the first stages of the space program  scientists were puzzled by the fact that as soon as the rocket was exiting  the earth's gravitiational  attraction  the engines would shut off as if they were running out of fuel.  Eventually they realized that in space the fuel in the tank forms into  s pherical shapes due to surface tension effects with many blobs staying away  from the walls of the container.  We are interested in phase change phenomena , for example those involving  ice and water (different phases of the same substance which can coexist near  the critical temperature of 32F).  Understanding the way certain phases mix  is important for determinig the properties of materials. Superconductivity  is a good example to which our work applies.  For  understanding all this, one, in principle, could start with  the basic  equations  of physics. The problem  with this approach is the enormous  complexity that one encounters  and the difficulty in the numerical  simulation. For dealing with this scientists are proposing  adhoc,  phenomenologically convincing models, which have the advantage of  great  simplicity.  Our work is of qualitative nature. It  aims to establish that  some of  these simple mathematical  models exhibit the wealth of behavior  making them capable of describing and predicting  the  phenomena that are  observed .  ***"

(1) 'Linear' motors driven by nucleotide hydrolysis,  including (i) the kinesin and myosin superfamily which move along  microtubules and actin filaments, respectively, and (ii) HSP70,  which drives the translocation of proteins across intracellular  membranes; (ii) RNA and DNA polymerase, which move along the DNA  double helix. (2) 'Rotary' motors driven by electrochemical  gradients, including (i) ATP synthase, the mechanochemical engine  that synthesizes ATP, and (ii) the bacterial flagellar motor,  which drives the motion of many prokaryotic organisms. (3) Motors  driven by polymerization free energy, including the microtubule  depolymerization process that moves chromosomes during anaphase  mitosis, and the polymerization motors which drive the motion of  certain pathogenic bacteria and viruses, such as Listeria and  Vaccinia.  The approach in each case is to begin by formulating  analytical stochastic models consisting of Langevin mechanical  equations or Fokker-Planck diffusion equations that describe the  mechanochemical and statistical behavior of the molecular  machinery.  These models then are analyzed mathematically where  possible and by numerical simulation in all cases.  The mean  mechanical properties of these protein motors are derived, such  as force-velocity curves, along with their stochastic properties  such as trajectory variances.  Results are presented in a visual  format that facilitates comprehension by biologists and  comparison with experimental data.       The most striking feature of biological cells, and indeed  the hallmark of life itself, is their constant motion.  These  motions are of two kinds: those that move the cell from one place  to another, and those that move vital material from one place to  another within the cell.  Both kinds of motions are driven by  specialized protein molecules that function as ti ny robotic  motors, powered by chemical energy.  The world in which these  protein machines operate is dominated by Brownian motion, which  gives their movements a statistical character.  Although these  molecular machines operate on a length scale of nanometers and a  force scale of piconewtons, they are absolutely essential to the  life of the cell.  Recent advances in instrumentation have made it  possible to measure the mechanical properties of individual  protein motors, and recent advances in high-performance computing  have enabled their simulation in realistic detail, including the  effects of thermal fluctuations.  Taken together, these advances  provide an unprecedented opportunity to deduce how biomolecular  motors work.  This is done through the formulation of mathematical  models, and through the careful comparison of model predictions  with experimental data."

He analyzes formation of chromosome aberrations after  induction of DNA double strand breaks by radiation during the  interphase part of the cell cycle, using probabilistic models for  DNA geometry, motion, and reactions at the macromolecular level.  For example, one area concerns the combinatorics and kinetics of  illegitimate recombinations, involving the exchange of fragments  between several different chromosomes.  Polymer models are used  for large-scale chromosome structure and motion.  Statistical  questions arise when very detailed experimental information about  specific individual chromosomes is made available by modern  fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques; these he addresses  by extending already developed Monte-Carlo simulations.  The  study involves developing computer algorithms, explicitly solving  stochastic process models, and collaborating with experimental  groups.       Ionizing radiation damage to chromosomes is being studied  mathematically.  When ionizing radiation hits cells, as occurs for  example in tumor radiotherapy or radiation accidents, one gets  breakage and large-scale reshuffling of DNA molecules.  The  resulting chromosome aberrations have been implicated as symptoms  or causes of most major radiobiological effects.  They are  especially important in biodosimetry, the estimation of past  exposure to radiation dose by looking at residual cellular  damage.  They are also a window on fundamental biology because  they are influenced by, and symptomatic of, chromosome geometry  and motion.  Recent developments, whereby specific human  chromosomes can be ""painted"" different colors, have dramatically  increased the amount of information obtained from aberration  studies.  A very rich and colorful variety of aberrations can now  be observed.

The results allow systematic comparisons of  cellular radiation damage effects observed by different  laboratories using different chromosome painting schemes.  In  addition, mechanistic modeling of how chromosome aberrations  evolve in time is helping to attack the main mystery of  radiobiology: how to extrapolate from the larger doses needed for  statistically significant experimental results to the much  smaller doses relevant to risk estimates for large human  populations subjected to radiation from environmental or man-made  sources."

Despite differences in their  individual natural frequencies, the oscillators spontaneously  synchronize to a common frequency.  Examples include chorusing  crickets, fireflies that flash in unison, and synchronous firing  of cardiac pacemaker cells.  The investigator and his colleagues  study the principles underlying these self-synchronizing systems,  using analytical, computational, and experimental methods.  The  mathematical investigations concern the dynamics and stability of  mutual synchronization, analyzed with techniques from  perturbation theory, nonlinear dynamics, and statistical  mechanics.  The experimental aspects of the project deal with the  chorusing behavior of the snowy tree cricket, regarded as a model  experimental system for studying mutual synchronization.

The main reason for   concentrating on approximation questions is that although much is known   about the properties of integral functionals and much progress has been   made in the design of efficient and reliable optimization routines for finite   dimensional linear and nonlinear optimization problems, the use of these   routines to solve infinite dimensional problems has been hampered by   serious shortcomings in what we know about the approximation of infinite   dimensional optimization problems, in particular by finite optimization   problems.    Stochastic optimization models provide tools that support decision making   under uncertainty. These are ``decision'' problems whose data is only known   in a statistical sense, i.e., there is uncertainty about the values to assign to   some of the parameters of the problem, and at best one might have some   statistical information about these parameters.  Typical stochastic   optimization problems are: the choice of a flexible manufacturing plan   when the demand is not known with certainty, asset/liability management   problems, policy setting for pollution controls that are affected by   atmospheric conditions, the design of structures (such as bridges,   skyscrapers) that are going to be subjected to (randomly distributed) seismic   shocks, etc.. Mathematically, stochastic optimization problems are very   difficult to solve because one must, in one way or another, take into account   all possible outcomes of these random parameters. That is why the design of   an approximation theory for such problems is essential, and that is what is at   the core of this project."

Also the role of  particle-like objects in the Yang-Mills Higgs equations and other systems    will be studied. These equations are essentially systems of parabolic  and hyperbolic type  respectively. One of the aims of the work is to   understand how the dynamical properties of the ``particles''  are  reflected in the analytical properties of the equations. This is    interesting since the particles represent a genuinely nonlinear  effect. The particle-like objects are solutions which are independent  of time and are characterized by a  topological winding number.  Reduced descriptions of the dynamics of these ``particles''    in terms of finite dimensional systems  have been obtained together  with rigorous bounds  on the validity of the approximations. These  allow an understanding of the forces between the ``particles'' and  also their scattering properties.  This in turn leads to an    understanding of the original equations, in particular to conjectures  and theorems about the large time behavior of the solutions. In turn  it is to be hoped that a study of the large  time behavior of these  equations may be a useful tool in analyzing the static particle-like  solutions themselves.   %%%    In mathematical descriptions of the physical world there is a division  between ``fields'' and ``particles''. The former are continuous media  in which information propagates in a  wave-like fashion, while the  latter are discrete objects. However certain equations which give a  ``field'' description of some physical situation have solutions which  are themselves ``particle-like''. This provides a bridge between the  two types of description. A real world situation in which this occurs  is superconductivity: vortices appear in superconductors as  particle-like objects within a continuum description. They are very   important in technological applications of superconductors because the  vortices produce a resistance to passage of current through the  material and hence reduce the efficacy of the material in modern  technology. It is therefore extremely important to be able to    understand the interactions of vortices with each other and with the  rest of the material in order to fully realize the great technological  potential of superconducting materials in  high speed computer design,  power transmission,  modern rail systems and other areas.  ***"

Therefore, this system is   the starting point for any prediction about the microscopic properties of a   plasma.  The Vlasov-Poisson equations also play another very important   role. Recent research which involved the proposer demonstrated a close   relationship between the Vlasov-Poisson equations and the two dimensional   Euler equations in vorticity form.  The Vlasov-Poisson equations have a   simpler mathematical structure than the Euler equations which makes the   Vlasov-Poisson equations easier to analyze and solve numerically, and leads   to many explicit solutions.  Consequently, the Vlasov-Poisson equations   form an excellent system of model equations to study before considering   any open problems for the two dimensional Euler equations.  The proposer   will consider some fundamental problems for the Vlasov-Poisson equations   pertaining to the lack of uniqueness and singularity formation for weak   solutions and to the theory of statistical equilibrium solutions.  Many (but   not all) of these problems are related to unsolved problems for the Euler   equations.  The proposer will also study some fundamental open problems   for the Euler equations with vortex sheet initial data, using Vlasov-Poisson   results to motivate and guide this work.  Finally, the proposer will study   some interesting issues regarding the numerical solution of both the Vlasov-  Poisson and Euler equations.    Fluid dynamics is the study of continuous media like air and water.    Scientists formulate problems in this field by applying the fundamental laws   of physics such as the conservation of mass, momentum and energy.  For   most problems this procedure leads to sets of mathematical equations which   are too complicated to solve.  Based on physical  and/or mathematical   intuition the scientist then tries to find a simplified formulation of the   original problem  which is simple enough to solve and sufficiently   complicated to  describe the essential features of the original problem.  The   mixing process between layers of fluid which have different densities, like   air and water, or layers of fluid moving at different velocities is very   complicated and occurs in a wide variety of important applications in fields   including aerodynamics, meteorology and oceanography.  For example, the   flow of air over an airplane is very complicated.  In order to predict the   trailing wake behind an airplane, or the mixing process in a fluid, scientists   often use a simplified model of a fluid called a vortex sheet.  This is the   simplest realistic description of this and many other problems.    Unfortunately, despite the wide-spread use of vortex sheet models in many   problems in fluid dynamics, many mathematical properties of vortex sheets   remain poorly understood.  The goal of this proposal is to provide  answers   to many of the fundamental questions about the mathematical properties of   vortex sheets.  Successful completion of the proposed work will lead to an   increased understanding of the strengths and limitations when using vortex   sheets to model complicated flows.  The starting point for this work is the   simplest set of equations which describe a plasma, a fluid in which the   microscopic properties of charged particles are modeled.  Therefore, this   study should also lead to an increased understanding of the properties of a   plasma containing a concentrated beam of electrons."

Mathematical studies investigate the key modeling elements that lead to oscillations observed in some serious hematopoietic diseases. Study of the erythropoietic model extends to a related system for thrombopoiesis for which more clinical problems have been observed. This research improves a current age-structured model so as to match better experimental data following a phlebotomy, including the effects of plasma regeneration, the accelerated maturing and active destruction in the aging of erythrocytes. Mathematical analyses examine the significance of the state-dependent delays in the reduced age-structured model and parameter sensitivity. Research continues in collaboration with Dr. J. W. Zyskind on the modeling of initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli. Mathematical models are developed to support current theories on the most important biochemical events beginning the DNA replication cycle. Interest centers on the role of the stable protein DnaA, which experimentally has been shown to play a key role. The models consider the significance of an eclipse period for DnaA mRNA synthesis following initiation, the existence of an unknown protein recently discovered that inactivates DnaA, and the competition for binding important activation sites with a growth dependent protein, Fis. Mathematical studies continue on cellular control systems in exponentially growing cells and extend to examine what happens when cells experience starvation. Both proposed areas of study use mathematical models to provide a better understanding of the fundamental controls in important biological systems. The f ear of contamination of the blood supply by the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, results in many surgical patients providing their own blood for the operation. The mathematical models in this proposal allow the study of optimal schemes for regeneration of red blood cells, which could indicate ways for increasing this supply. This leads to a lower demand on the general blood supply and increased security of the blood supply for the self-donors. In addition, there are several serious hematopoietic diseases (diseases linked to the formation of different types of blood cells) that are poorly understood. The proposed models provide a non-invasive means to examine which aspects of this complicated biological control system are most likely to result in the observed problems. This gives clinicians more information on possible therapeutic treatments and narrows the search for the primary cause of the disease. The mathematical models for the initiation of DNA replication in bacteria again provides a non-experimental approach to better understand an important biological process. In this case, the study examines the control of the cell cycle in bacteria, which is fundamental to cell growth and reproduction. Biotechnology relies heavily on the bacterium, E. coli, for many of its experiments and products, so a better understanding of the cell cycle aids this industry as well as providing some answers to basic questions in cell biology."
