The analysis involves nonlinear systems for compressible flows, mixtures, and polymeric fluids, which are relevant to several practical applications in science and engineering, and kinetic models describing self-organized dynamics, which are important in biology, physics, and bioengineering. The project includes training and research opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The existence of statistically stationary states in randomly driven systems in fluid dynamics is of basic importance from both mathematical and experimental points of view. On the one hand, the existence of an invariant measure provides information on the generic long-time behavior of the system. On the other hand, under ergodicity assumptions, they provide a link between experimental observations, for example in turbulence theory. This project aims to (a) establish well-posedness results for variational solutions to deterministic systems and (b) analyze weak martingale solutions and invariant measures for randomly forced systems. The variational framework developed in this investigation will be employed for the construction of numerical algorithms for the approximation of nonlinear systems that arise in science and engineering. One of the goals of the project involves connecting the theoretical and computational results to experiments, in order to optimize theoretical models for more accurate predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their interactions are understood as dynamic consequences of participants? trading behaviors. The interactions yield market growth over time and sometimes trigger systemic risk events in unexpected ways. The main goal of the project is to understand mathematically interactions and their consequences in large financial markets. In order to analyze both homogeneous interactions with the market averages and heterogeneous interactions among similar participants, graphical interactions are modeled and analyzed with the methods in the system of stochastic partial differential equations with probability distribution constraints. The analysis of complicated financial markets in the project will provide mathematical tools for comprehensive understanding of financial networks among investors and can be applied to the similar network structures observed in other fields such as Biology, Data Science, Physics and Social Sciences. The award will support the opportunity for research experiences for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.<br/> <br/>The focus of this project is to understand the dependence structures in the stochastic processes in the system of nonlinear stochastic differential equations of mean-field type and of directed chain interactions in large financial markets. With the directed chain interactions, the local dependence structure is preserved in the limit and the stochastic chaos does not necessarily propagate. Four subproblems are considered. First, the directed chain interactions are extended to the interactions through random tree or network structures. The outputs are sufficient conditions on drift and diffusion functional for the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the stochastic differential equations. Second, network detection problems are examined by a class of newly introduced, stochastic partial differential equations through stochastic filtering. Third, the dependence of stochastic volatility of multiple financial securities are analyzed and compared with rough volatility models driven by the fractional Brownian motion. Fourth, the optimization problem of market participants is analyzed in the mean-field stochastic game with directed chain interactions. The goal of solving this problem is to derive the master equation for the large population equilibria and provide understandings of competition and cooperation among investors in financial markets.

However, nonlinear dispersive waves are ubiquitous in nature, appearing in many fields ranging from water waves to optics, acoustics, ferromagnetics, condensed matter, cosmology and beyond.  When dissipation and nonlinearity are the dominant physical effects in a system, the regime of small dissipation often gives rise to shock waves (the most familiar manifestation being a sonic boom).  The analogous phenomenon when dissipation is replaced by dispersion is that of dispersive shock waves.  These are non-stationary coherent, multiscale oscillatory structures.  Physical media giving rise to dispersive shock waves range from water waves to superfluids, nonlinear photonics, and magnetic spin systems.  For example, in fluid dynamics, dispersive shocks are known as undular bores.  Even though much work has been done over the past fifty years to understand these phenomena, many fundamental questions remain.  A first component of this project involves the development of mathematical tools for studying the behavior of solutions of certain nonlinear evolution equations describing nonlinear wave phenomena in more than one spatial dimension.   The second component of the project involves the application of these tools to study a variety of areas of interest, ranging from water waves to optics, networks, and statistical physics.   Finally, the project will also serve as a vehicle for training several Ph.D. students.<br/><br/>The mathematical study of nonlinear media giving rise to dispersive shocks often leads to certain systems of hyperbolic conservation laws.  Over the last fifty years, various methods have been applied with success to study these kinds of systems.  However, the behavior of solutions of dispersive nonlinear wave equations in more than one spatial dimension is not as well understood.  In particular, a mathematical characterization of formation and propagation of dispersive shocks in two spatial dimensions is still largely an open problem.  Recent work by the PI has opened up new avenues to study some long-standing open problems in this regard.  Specifically, this project comprises four classes of problems:  (i) Use of the Whitham modulation equations for the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation (the so-called KP-Whitham equations, which were recently derived by the PI) to study the temporal evolution of piecewise-constant soliton initial data and the formation and dynamics of dispersive shock waves in 2+1 dimensions.  (ii) Study of the integrability structure of the above-mentioned KP-Whitham equations and their exact solutions.  (iii) Derivation and application of Whitham modulation equations for various (2+1)-dimensional evolution equations of nonlinear Schrodinger type.  (iv) Application of small dispersion limits and Whitham modulation theory to characterize phase state diagrams of p-star networks and certain random matrix models.  The overarching theme of the project is to advance our understanding of dispersive wave phenomena in more than one spatial dimension.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the applications include surface water waves, rogue waves in the ocean, tsunamis, optical waves such as those that occur in waveguides and lasers, acoustic waves, and associated shock waves. This research effort focuses on solving a number of open problems that will substantially extend the ability of mathematicians to explain the behavior of large power wave phenomena that arise widely in applications while developing a deeper understanding of this behavior. A postdoctoral associate and undergraduate students will be trained through active participation in this research.<br/><br/>The mathematical analysis of nonlinear wave motion presents difficulties because the underlying equations are nonlinear for which there is far less mathematical understanding than small power linear waves. One of the methods that can be used to analyze a class of nonlinear wave equations discussed in this proposal is termed the inverse scattering transform (IST). The PI has experience with this method and has found new classes of physically significant equations with interesting underlying symmetries to which IST can be applied. The method also applies to multidimensional equations and associated solutions which decay in all directions. Key properties of these latter solutions will be understood, and they can be connected to fundamental equations in quantum mechanics and optics. Research will also be conducted on a class of waves called dispersive shock waves (DSWs). DSWs are shock waves that are dispersive in nature; the underlying equations are dispersive not dissipative. Consequently, DSWs are not like atmospheric shock waves which are are strongly affected by dissipation. DSWs arise in many applications including water waves, nonlinear optics, plasma physics, and Bose-Einstein condensation amongst many others. The theory of DSWs will be extended in order to obtain improved approximations to the underlying equations in one dimension and a detailed multidimensional analysis will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such observations reveal the presence of differentially rotating fluid atmospheres embedded with features in the form of large-scale eddies and jets that greatly influence the climate of the celestial body.  Understanding the formation, evolution and global momentum and energy balances of these features remains a challenging problem. Rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection, i.e., a rotating layer of fluid heated from below, represents a canonical paradigm for advancing our knowledge and is the subject of this project.  The ultimate aim of the project is to determine unambiguously whether the large scale vortices (LSVs) observed in rapidly rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection are a consequence of the proximity of the flow to shallow, approximately two-dimensional  turbulence or due to the ability of the LSVs to shape the correlations among the small scale three-dimensional fluctuations that appear to drive its formation. This determination appears to be fundamental to understanding the propensity for shallow layer geophysical and astrophysical flows to produce LSVs and jets and will open new directions for studying these natural flows. Broader impacts of the project include the involvement of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars in the research.   <br/><br/>Large scale structures, including vortices and jets, are ubiquitous in geophysical flows and play a fundamental role in energy transport in the interiors and the atmospheres of minor planets, gas giants and stars. This project is dedicated to providing a detailed understanding of the basic mechanisms behind the spontaneous formation of large-scale structures from small scale turbulent fluctuations. The ultimate aim of the project is to determine unambiguously whether the large scale vortices (LSVs) observed in rapidly rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection are a consequence of the proximity of the flow to 2D turbulence or due to the ability of the LSVs to shape the correlations among the small scale fluctuations that appear to drive its formation. This determination appears to be fundamental to understanding the propensity for shallow layer geophysical and astrophysical flows to produce LSVs and jets and will open new directions for studying these natural flows. A comprehensive examination of the split (forward and inverse) energy cascade that appears characteristic of these flows is thus undertaken. This is accomplished by utilizing (i) novel reduced asymptotic models that extrapolate to extreme parameter settings, (ii) new reformulations of the Navier-Stokes fluid equations that extend the computational capabilities of direct numerical simulations, and (iii) theoretical analysis that dissects the amplitude-phase relationships between the teleconnected large-scale structures and small-scale turbulence.  The new asymptotic modeling and rescaling approaches to the fluid equations provide a unique capability of achieving physically realistic scale separation between large- and small-scale fluid motions. Importantly, the fundamental mechanisms of energy transport leading to the spontaneous formation of large-scale vortices and jets constitutes a complex problem that reaches across disciplines in the mathematical and physical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thermal noise is present in any voltage measurement of an electrical circuit and the intensity of the noise increases with both the temperature and the resistance of the circuit elements. One goal of this project is to develop a method to estimate the electrical properties of a circuit from thermal noise measured while heating some circuit elements. One practical application would be to monitor laser welding. We expect that the laser hot spot generates noticeably higher thermal noise with intensity depending mostly on the nearby electric properties. But a defective weld that does not bridge two parts does not conduct electricity well, so one should be able to distinguish a good weld from a bad one based on thermal noise alone. The same principle may also be used in Atomic Force Microscopy to measure the conductivity of a sample. This project will explore these new uses of thermal noise, using mathematical tools to extract valuable information from a usually undesirable andignored quantity. In particular we anticipate to answer questions such as what electric properties can be recovered from thermal noise? How can these be recovered? We will use simulations to illustrate our ideas, with an eye on applications. Another goal of this project is to control heat using small heat pumps called Peltier devices. We use mathematical tools to show that an idealization of these devices can be used to thermally isolate an object, that is, making the temperature surrounding the devices and the object indistinguishable from the ambient temperature. The mathematical framework we will develop could be used for heat control in electronics and to design devices for slow release of drugs. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project has two main thrusts. The first thrust is about harnessing ubiquitous thermal fluctuations to image the properties of a body and the second thrust concerns active thermal cloaking. An example for the first thrust is Johnson-Nyquist noise, that is, the random currents or voltages that can be measured at the terminals of any resistive electrical component. The voltage variance is proportional to the temperature and the resistance. Thus the resistance can be found from the temperature and the voltage variance. We will consider a similar problem on conducting bodies where the problem is to find the electrical properties (impedance) of a body from the voltage or current covariance measured at a few electrodes (which may be placed either inside the body or on its boundary) all while locally heating the body. A discrete analogue of this problem will be considered for finding the impedance of elements in electric circuits. Johnson-Nyquist noise is a manifestation of the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem, a fundamental statistical physics result relating the fluctuations about an equilibrium of a system to the dissipation in thesystem. Thus the inverse problems that we plan to study may have applications to other linear systems subject to random externalfluctuations, e.g. thermo-elastic fluctuations. For the second thrust, we will study cloaking strategies for the heat equation that rely on active surfaces to dissimulate objects or heat sources/sinks and are grounded on potential theory (Green identities) for the heat equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The search for composites that guarantee higher levels of performance requires the development of mathematical models able to accurately predict the behavior of such materials. Particularly interesting are time-dependent composites: passive materials, such as viscoelastic composites, exhibit a time-dependent response when subject to static loadings, due to the dissipation of energy carried out by the viscous component; on the other hand, active materials, such as space-time composites, in which energy accumulates or dissipates depending on the change of the applied field, provide entirely new ways to channel waves. The first goal of the project is to provide accurate models to predict the static response of passive time-dependent composites and to describe wave propagation in active composites. The second goal of the project concerns inverse problems: given the response of an inhomogeneous medium, not necessarily a composite, the aim is to develop reconstruction formulas to determine the internal geometry of the medium, a fundamental problem in geotechnical and medical applications for which one wants to recover the internal structure of a body. For instance, for a homogeneous elastic body with a viscoelastic inclusion, the objective is to determine the volume and the shape of the inclusion by applying suitable loadings and by measuring the corresponding response at a specific moment of time. San Francisco State University is a Research Undergraduate Institution; several undergraduate students will be involved in this research and will be trained through their participation.<br/><br/>The nature of the project will bring forward mathematical advancements in several areas with focus on the following research avenues. (i) Wave equations with time-dependent coefficients: the project aims at exploring the behavior of solutions of such equations in the presence of dissipation, dispersion, nonlinearity, and more than one spatial dimension. The ultimate goal is to address the issue regarding the implementation of space-time composites to design one-way propagation devices and to engineer filtering devices and absorbers. (ii) The theory of Herglotz-Nevannlina-Pick functions: such theory plays a crucial role in the description of the behavior of passive and causal materials and one of the objective of the project is to broaden its applications to bound the response of two- and three-dimensional passive time-dependent composites in time, by using the analyticity of the effective properties tensor, and to solve inverse problems regarding lossy inhomogeneous media, by using the analyticity of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. (iii) Boundary integral formulations: one of the objective of the project is to determine the elastic fields in a two-dimensional unbounded isotropic medium with an elastic inclusion of arbitrary shape, by applying the single layer potential technique and by choosing a suitable set of functions for the series expansion of the elastic fields.

Remote sensing data can be used for environmental monitoring of atmospheric pollution, for evaluation of health of forests and crops, for detecting fine details on the earth's surface, and for tracking of satellites and other flying objects. As ever more, finer-resolution data becomes available, a better understanding of how these are affected by clutter in the environment is important. Such understanding is also needed in the context of designing schemes for imaging and communication through turbulent media, of the type found for instance in the turbulent (cluttered) atmosphere, as well as in the context of biomedical imaging. Further developments of such techniques require a deep understanding of how the probing wave field is affected by the local medium or tissue fabric, the clutter. The project also involves techniques for better understanding and modeling of financial and economic time series, which is useful for monitoring and stabilization of markets. Important questions relate then to how one can design schemes for early detection of when the fabric, the local clutter statistics, of the market is changing and we are entering a new market regime. Similar challenges relate to analysis of internet traffic, such as detecting changes to normal traffic flow caused by an intruder. The project aims to develop fundamental mathematical frameworks that allow one to deal with such important challenges, moreover, to use modern tools associated with machine learning in the detection of fabric changes. Graduate students will be trained through involvement in the research.<br/><br/>The challenge of a rigorous characterization of laser beams propagating through multiscale media and interfaces is of fundamental importance both from the physical and mathematical perspectives. This project studies new approaches that allow one to model wave propagation in complicated non-classic media, particularly through so called non-Kolmogorov turbulence. Such modeling is becoming increasingly important in the context of propagation through the atmosphere and furthermore in biomedical imaging. The analysis will involve asymptotic analysis of statistical moments of fields governed by partial differential equations with random coefficients and exploit scale separations in the system. Novel imaging techniques increasingly make use of wave spectral information, or information in the covariance structure for the polarization modes of the wave field itself or its intensity, that is, speckle correlations. To evaluate such imaging techniques based on wave spectral information, one needs information about higher-order moments to assess image stability, or noise level, and to optimize the schemes. A main objective of the project is to further the theory that describes this statistical structure and, moreover, to use it in the context of classic and deep learning imaging modalities. Specifically, novel approaches for modeling wave propagation in multiscale and complex media will be used in the design of imaging approaches that can detect changes in the local tissue fabric in the context of biomedical imaging. The investigator will also study modeling and estimation in the context of complex economic time series with a multi-fractal character, with applications to detection of market regime changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Throughout this project, the investigator will continue his own research into these problems, while mentoring graduate students by involving them in theoretical and computational aspects.<br/><br/>This project involves exploiting local structures within underlying kernel spaces to study linear and non-linear kernel approximation with non-uniform geometry and multi-scale, anisotropic kernels. One aspect of this project treats kernels of finite smoothness for which there exist highly localized Riesz bases. Such bases confer a number of well-understood analytic benefits, but their true promise is in improving kernel based algorithms; the investigator will employ these local structures to stabilize and speed up computation, and to develop novel mesh-free numerical methods for scattered data and partial differential equations. Another aspect involves Gaussians and other infinitely smooth kernels having extreme localization in both space and frequency. The investigator will study and develop nonlinear approximation methods that use multi-scale, anisotropic operations to treat functions which are sparse in a variety of representation systems, employing techniques from harmonic analysis and statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such observations reveal the presence of differentially rotating fluid atmospheres embedded with features in the form of large-scale eddies and jets that greatly influence the climate of the celestial body.  Understanding the formation, evolution and global momentum and energy balances of these features remains a challenging problem. Rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection, i.e., a rotating layer of fluid heated from below, represents a canonical paradigm for advancing our knowledge and is the subject of this project.  The ultimate aim of the project is to determine unambiguously whether the large scale vortices (LSVs) observed in rapidly rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection are a consequence of the proximity of the flow to shallow, approximately two-dimensional turbulence or due to the ability of the LSVs to shape the correlations among the small scale three-dimensional fluctuations that appear to drive its formation. This determination appears to be fundamental to understanding the propensity for shallow layer geophysical and astrophysical flows to produce LSVs and jets and will open new directions for studying these natural flows. Broader impacts of the project include the involvement of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars in the research.   <br/><br/>Large scale structures, including vortices and jets, are ubiquitous in geophysical flows and play a fundamental role in energy transport in the interiors and the atmospheres of minor planets, gas giants and stars. This project is dedicated to providing a detailed understanding of the basic mechanisms behind the spontaneous formation of large-scale structures from small scale turbulent fluctuations. The ultimate aim of the project is to determine unambiguously whether the large scale vortices (LSVs) observed in rapidly rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection are a consequence of the proximity of the flow to 2D turbulence or due to the ability of the LSVs to shape the correlations among the small scale fluctuations that appear to drive its formation. This determination appears to be fundamental to understanding the propensity for shallow layer geophysical and astrophysical flows to produce LSVs and jets and will open new directions for studying these natural flows. A comprehensive examination of the split (forward and inverse) energy cascade that appears characteristic of these flows is thus undertaken. This is accomplished by utilizing (i) novel reduced asymptotic models that extrapolate to extreme parameter settings, (ii) new reformulations of the Navier-Stokes fluid equations that extend the computational capabilities of direct numerical simulations, and (iii) theoretical analysis that dissects the amplitude-phase relationships between the teleconnected large-scale structures and small-scale turbulence.  The new asymptotic modeling and rescaling approaches to the fluid equations provide a unique capability of achieving physically realistic scale separation between large- and small-scale fluid motions. Importantly, the fundamental mechanisms of energy transport leading to the spontaneous formation of large-scale vortices and jets constitutes a complex problem that reaches across disciplines in the mathematical and physical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fluids are all around us, and we can witness the complexity and subtleness of their properties in everyday life, in ubiquitous technology, and in dramatic phenomena such as tornados or hurricanes. There has been an enormous wealth of knowledge accumulated in the broad area of fluid mechanics, yet it is quite remarkable that many of the most fundamental and relevant in applications questions remain poorly understood. Of particular interest is the question whether solutions to equations describing fluid motion can spontaneously form singularities. Understanding singularities is important because they often correspond to dramatic, highly intense fluid motion, can indicate the range of applicability of the model, and are very difficult to resolve computationally. Moreover, there are indications that mechanisms responsible for singularity and small-scale formation are also involved in production of turbulence. The project aims to analyze singularity and small scale formation process for some of the key equations of fluid mechanics. Some equations with related structure inspired by problems originating in biology will be considered as well. The award will provide opportunities and research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars.<br/><br/>The award is concerned with analysis of several equations in fluid mechanics and related models motivated by biological phenomena. The main theme is the analysis of singularity and small scale formation in solutions. The surface quasi-geostrophic equation comes from atmospheric science, and models evolution of temperature near the Earth's surface. The incompressible porous media equation describes flow of fluid of variable density through porous media. One research direction will focus on better understanding of nonlinear mechanisms responsible for fast generation of small scales and potentially singularities in the solutions of these equations. Another direction aims to further analyze the Hou-Luo scenario for singularity formation in the three-dimensional Euler equation. The scenario was proposed several years ago based on extensive numerical simulations, and so far all simplified models and settings that have been analyzed rigorously suggest finite time blow up. Here the main goal will be to better understand the boundary layer where intense growth of vorticity is observed, and to design and explore models that are increasingly close to the actual equation. The research will also include analysis of equations modeling collective behavior and chemotaxis in biology. Here the focus is on analysis of regularity, long time dynamics, and boundary effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Realizing this promise requires addressing many mathematical and computational challenges: in framing scientific and technological problems for solution by data-driven approaches, in interpreting and analyzing data, and in designing efficient and reliable algorithms. There is an urgent need for mathematical scientists who are equally adept at wielding modern applied and computational mathematics on the one hand, and the tools of data-driven modeling, statistical inference, and scientific computing on the other. Furthermore, as interdisciplinary research and development become more common in industry, academia, and government, it is imperative that such mathematical scientists be generalists, able to communicate and work with specialists from diverse fields. This Research Training Group (RTG) addresses this need by increasing the number of mathematical scientists capable of working effectively at the interface of applied mathematics/statistics and modern data science. By focusing on specific applications requiring both mathematical innovation and data-driven modeling and by forming teams of mathematical scientists and domain experts, the RTG will enable trainees to address new challenges in innovative ways using their mastery of relevant mathematics, statistics and data science, and domain knowledge. Recognizing the challenges of advanced studies in STEM fields, the RTG will promote close, small-group mentoring at all levels. The expected outcome is mathematical scientists adept at working at disciplinary boundaries and intellectually equipped to tackle a wide range of scientific and technological challenges. It is expected that some of the trainees will continue in academia, where the proposed training activities can be improved and propagated; others will work in industry and government, applying their knowledge and skills to solve problems of practical significance.<br/><br/>The RTG will support research on applied mathematics and data-driven modeling at the University of Arizona (UA), which is home to a large and vibrant mathematical science community. It is organized around a number of application-centered Working Groups, with foci ranging from analysis of gene regulation data to the modeling and forecasting of power grids. Each research project will impact both fundamental methodology and practical applications. The Working Groups are structured to enable vertically-integrated mentoring of RTG trainees at all levels -- undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral, and to enable trainees to work closely with Mathematics faculty and domain experts. Additional training activities include courses on foundational topics, e.g., optimization, machine learning, Monte Carlo methods, as well as practical skills such as software carpentry. By providing research training at the interface between the traditional domains of applied mathematics and the cutting-edge field of data-driven modeling, the RTG will both advance scientific knowledge and increase the number of US citizens and nationals with much-needed scientific and technological expertise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The methods will entail event-triggered feedback control, whereby the systems use feedback about their states and their surroundings, help decide future optimizing courses of action, and where events like potential violations of constraints are used to determine when to change the controls. The project will seek finite-time control methods, which enable control objectives such as tracking and station keeping to be realized by prescribed finite-time deadlines. Using applied mathematics to control ecological robotic systems will promote scientific progress, by leading to more effective ways to understand the effects of pollutions, oil spills, or other environmental stresses in complex, dynamic, and unstructured marine environments. The work will be collaborative with two Ph.D. students whose research at the interface of engineering and mathematics will help prepare them for a wide variety of potential careers. The investigators will also deliver presentations on elementary aspects of the project to grade school students in Louisiana or New York. This outreach can help inspire a diverse, qualified cadre of students to consider pursuing careers in engineering or mathematics. The project's applied part will focus on algorithmic development and marine robots. Additionally, this research will have the potential for applications in other settings with event-triggered controls, safety or timing constraints, and uncertainties, such as renewable energy networks or intelligent transportation systems.<br/><br/>The project will help address significant challenges in control theory for nonlinear control systems with communication or state constraints or optimization requirements, using three strategies. The first will design event- or self-triggered feedback controls for systems with time deadlines, whose triggers are computed from output measurements, and which determine when to recompute the control to avoid undesirable operating modes, with the goal of ensuring finite time convergence. This will help overcome the obstacles to using standard feedback controls, which require the user to continuously or frequently recompute control values without optimizing cost criteria or meeting time deadlines, and which therefore are less suitable in engineering applications. This will build on the nonlead investigator's prior work in event-triggered nonlinear control theory that developed several constructive design tools for various classes of nonlinear systems. The second will develop robust forward invariance methods under event- or self-triggered controls, which help predict and quantify the degree of uncertainty that control systems can tolerate without violating tolerance and safety bounds. This will build on the lead investigator's prior work that computed bounds on allowable uncertainties in marine robotic curve tracking. The third involves finite time learning-based adaptive dynamic programming that approximates optimal policies, to help overcome the curse of dimensionality that arises in traditional dynamic programming. This will build on the nonlead investigator's prior work in adaptive dynamic programming that proposed computational algorithms to learn suboptimal controllers from input-state or input-output data.

The research in this field is well-motivated by real-life applications where resources can be allocated based on predicted waiting times, for example in call centers, health care, and cloud computing. Traditionally, in controlled queueing problems, it is assumed that the parameters of the underlying random models are known. In this project, the investigator will account for uncertainty by assuming the more realistic case where the parameters of the model are unknown. The project will generate policies that are easy to implement and broadly applicable for queueing network models under uncertainty, which will lead to better performance and resource utilization. Moreover, the project aims to develop new mathematical tools and techniques for these problems. The models in this project stem from real-world problems and the results will impact both applied probability and operations research. This research project will support under-represented minority groups and train both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research project is on the asymptotic analysis of controlled queueing systems under heavy traffic with uncertainty about the parameters of the model. Two types of uncertainty are considered: Knightian and Bayesian. In the Knightian case, the decision-maker considers a worst-case criterion to be minimized by taking into account a class of models. The asymptotic analysis is performed using a limiting stochastic game, where the involved players are the decision-maker and an adversary player. In the Bayesian case, the decision-maker has a prior belief on the parameters of the model, which is continuously updated by observing the system. Here, the learning aspect of the optimization problems is of interest. The exploration/exploitation nature suggests a connection to multi-armed bandit problems. The research objectives are: (1) to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that builds uncertainty about the queueing models into the diffusion scaling heavy traffic regime, balancing between capturing uncertainty and robustness, and attaining easy-to-implement policies; (2) to consider simple policies, which are known to be asymptotic optimal in the case without uncertainty, and to examine their performance under uncertainty; and (3) to combine the following streams of research: queueing theory, diffusion approximations, uncertainty, and learning, and moreover, to develop new mathematical results beyond what is known in each stream considered separately.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Then, the properties of the equilibrium strategies and pricing rules will be studied in various extensions of the problem such as stochastic liquidity and risk-averse agents with natural distributional assumptions. For the second topic, the interaction between the learner and the adversary will be stated as a zero-sum stochastic game. Then, the long-time behavior of these games will be studied using tools from partial differential equations, stochastic analysis, and mean-field theory.

This is a fundamental task in scientific fields like biology, material science, economics, and astronomy, where in a typical scenario researchers possess a large number of unlabeled data, but only a few (or none) expert labeled data points, as these are typically very expensive to obtain. This project focuses on the mathematical analysis of data science algorithms for unsupervised learning. Broadly speaking, the aim of the investigation is to contribute to the development of mathematical foundations for data science and artificial intelligence by providing rigorous mathematical theory supporting methodologies used in practice, as well as by proposing principled novel ones. The investigator will not only study individual algorithms, but find common structure between them and highlight their otherwise unclear unity.<br/><br/>Among the many methodologies for unsupervised learning found in the literature, graph-based methods occupy a prominent role, and they will be the focus of this investigation. These are algorithms that rely on having access to similarity graphs, which endow data sets with a geometric structure. Different graphs capture different features of a given data set and hence are useful for different tasks. The project will focus on the following concrete directions: 1) the proposal and analysis of new algorithms for unsupervised learning inspired by variational methods for evolution on metric spaces and in particular on the space of probability measures over discrete and semi-discrete structures. In this direction the main goal is to introduce a mathematical formalism for the design of new learning methodologies, and to use this formalism in order to build connections between seemingly unrelated statistical procedures like those inspired by mode-seeking techniques as the ones based on spectral methods. Some of the applications in mind go beyond unsupervised learning, and also include the systematic testing of deep neural network architectures. The second direction concerns the study of statistical properties of graph-based unsupervised learning algorithms in settings where graphs capturing the geometry of a data set are very sparse (below standard connectivity), or where data generating distributions are degenerate and violate standard geometric assumptions found in the literature. In this direction, the goal is to identify the limits of sparsity that allow for meaningful learning, as well as to develop quantitative statistical error analysis for solutions to non-convex optimization problems on graphs built on data sets, for graphs that are connected to a ground truth geometric model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The same mathematical methods apply to the study of other, seemingly unrelated, applied problems, including stability of floating bodies and modeling of the Josephson effect  (Nobel Prize in 1973), important in the design of quantum-mechanical circuits for quantum computers. In the second part, the investigator will study fundamental problems of ray optics and models of mechanical systems with elastic collision, such as the ideal gas.  Although ray optics provides only an approximation to a more precise wave optics, this approximation is accurate enough for many applications, including laser beam shaping, trapping rays of light and storing solar energy, control of light pollution, and invisibility. Modern technology makes it possible to manufacture materials with unusual reflecting and refracting properties and to create nearly ideal mirrors of complicated shape, thus realizing geometrical optical designs in glass, metal, and plastic. Most of the suggested problems admit both theoretical and computer experimental study, in many cases the latter being the first step toward the former.

Our everyday lives depend on robust and predictable performance of different technological networks around us (such as power grids and communication networks). Human physiology relies on coordinated activity of hundreds of cellular networks (for example, networks of neural cells in the brain, cells in the heart and pancreas, to name a few). The patterns of connections in real world networks can be complex and exhibit nontrivial statistical properties. Understanding how the structural organization of a network affects its dynamics is the principal challenge in the theory of interacting dynamical systems that sets it apart from the theories for classical spatially extended dynamical systems, such as partial differential equations or lattice dynamical systems. The Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to develop a systematic mathematical approach to the analysis of dynamical networks. Through the development of new mathematical techniques and analyzing representative mathematical models, the PI aims to elucidate the relation between the structure and dynamics in complex networks. The PI is committed to teaching and training students. A six-month long Research Co-op for two undergraduate students will be organized in the course of this research. The PI will continue to organize minisymposia on dynamical networks at conferences on differential equations and dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This research advances the theory for interacting dynamical systems through the development of new theoretical results and analyzing selected models. The PI and colleagues identify new dynamical phenomena and study them using the combination of tools from graph theory, probability, and analysis. The emphasis will be on the effects of random spatial organization and noise on dynamics of large networks. The following problems are addressed: the Large Deviation Principle for interacting dynamical systems on random graphs, metastability in the continuum Kuramoto model forced by noise, and synchronization and pattern formation in the Kuramoto model with inertia. The Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators plays a central role in the theory of synchronization with many important applications in science and technology. In particular, the analysis of synchronization and stability of clusters developed in this research elucidates the dynamics emerging in high-voltage power grids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research on n-cross fields has applications to the generation of high quality cubic meshes and to the modelling of crystalline lattice structures in advanced materials design. The project on thin filaments is important to the modeling of microscopic swimmers and microfluidic devices, where numerical methods for these problems typically break down as the filaments get very thin. Such methods can be applied to the modeling of nano-scale swimmers, with potential in biomedical applications. This project includes opportunities for training and human resource development and aims to integrate these research topics with educational components. The overarching goals are to increase the profile of the topics, to make progress on central issues in the field, and to train students at many levels.<br/><br/>The principal structures underlying the project are n-cross fields, which are locally defined orthonormal coordinate systems that are invariant with respect to the reordering and inversions. This project will study methods that connect notions from algebraic geometry, geometric measure theory and the calculus of variations to develop and analyze efficient methods for computing n-cross fields. Variational methods provide for the construction of smooth n-cross fields, outside of conjectured co-dimension two rectifiable sets.

Dispersive hydrodynamics is an emergent mathematical field of research focusing on dynamic and stochastic, multiscale wave phenomena described by nonlinear partial differential equations that physically encompass the complex interplay between long-scale, hydrodynamic, and short-scale, dispersive, effects.  Building upon at least six dedicated workshops and numerous conference minisymposia on the subject since 2012, this will be the first extended program on dispersive hydrodynamics.  It will attract at least 25 long-term, residential visitors at any given time and 40 or more participants in each of 5 week-long workshops.  The diverse, international roster of participants includes leading researchers in the applied mathematical sciences. This National Science Foundation award provides travel support for early career applied mathematicians from the United States to participate in the workshops and the long-term program. Traditionally underrepresented groups in applied mathematics will be encouraged to apply. This support enables sustained opportunities to interact with leading researchers from across the world. Such interactions and contacts are invaluable to beginning researchers, both to inspire research, and for professional development, thereby helping to cultivate the very best young researchers. These researchers will be the next generation of applied mathematicians who advance this and other applied mathematical fields of research. <br/> <br/>Dispersive hydrodynamics has emerged as a unified mathematical framework for the description of multiscale nonlinear wave phenomena in dispersive media, encompassing both dynamic and stochastic aspects of wave propagation. Theoretical and experimental developments have spawned new areas of applied mathematical research. The mathematical program weaves together research topics on integrable and nonintegrable dispersive PDEs, convex and nonconvex dispersive hydrodynamic systems, multidimensional waves, asymptotic analysis, numerical analysis, randomness and turbulence in nonlinear dispersive waves. Applications include fluid mechanics and go well beyond, to nonlinear optics, superfluids (Bose-Einstein condensates), condensed matter, and granular crystals.

They are responsible for the sound we hear, the light we see, and the data we receive on our personal devices. Understanding how to mathematically model these waves, how to control them, and how to extract valuable information from them is therefore an important question at the intersection of various fields. The underlying physics principles behind wave propagation are extremely complex, and mathematics has proven to be a crucial tool in their investigation. At the core of this project are the theoretical analysis and the simulation of wave phenomena, with an emphasis on three main problems: how to focus energy with a minimal experimental apparatus; how to infer physical properties of a complex medium using wave propagation; and how to model waves in novel quantum devices. This project integrates research with the training of the next generation of scientists in the field of applied mathematics.<br/><br/>The main theme of research of the project is wave phenomena, including both classical and quantum waves. There are three main components to the proposed research. The first one originates from the recent groundbreaking experiments on instantaneous time mirrors. The latter form a novel avenue for time reversal and the control of waves, and is an exciting new topic for mathematicians to explore. The second component concerns inverse problems based on stochastic correctors, which are considered physical systems where forward data are solutions to PDEs with small parameters and random coefficients. In these systems, the data are asymptotically modeled by random correctors to a leading term that is not accessible to measurements. The objectives are first to characterize these stochastic correctors, and second to develop inversion strategies based on these corrections to extract information on the system. A typical example is the ?sea ice problem?, which involves random fluctuations around a homogenized solution. The last component of this project concerns quantum systems. The first problem is to develop the mathematical foundations of quantum hydrodynamical models based on the entropy principle, and the second the derivation of efficient numerical schemes for periodic Dirac operators, with applications to the study of exotic phases of matter and the design of novel quantum devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first is 3D printing and other novel manufacturing technologies. The second is the development of active materials whose properties can be altered by electrical or magnetic fields and heat. It is now becoming possible to 3D print active materials like shape-memory alloys and liquid crystal elastomers. This paves the way for responsive structures whose shape can be controlled by external stimuli. Further, combining them with structural materials can endow them with functions that are of use for many applications including soft robotics, wearable and prosthetic devices, microfluidics, cleanup of hazardous chemicals, targeted drug delivery, and tissue engineering. However, there is no known way to systematically design such devices. This project will develop a methodology for the systematic design of responsive structures and meta-materials which are complex assemblies of distinct materials and voids, especially optimal design where one seeks the best function at the least cost. These optimal design problems lead to substantial mathematical problems. Conversely, a better mathematical understanding of these problems can lead to new design approaches. By providing robust methodologies for the design and synthesis of responsive structures and meta-materials, this research will have a significant technological impact. It will also provide for the training of two graduate students and several undergraduate researchers. It will generate new opportunities for engaging K-12 students in STEM, and for promoting STEM education amongst underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The investigators will study mathematical questions motivated by the vision of incorporating structural and responsive materials (materials whose response function depends on external stimuli) into integrated functional materials and structures which can change shape and can be combined with structural materials to endow them with function. Such materials include shape-memory alloys, photo-sensitive elastomers, or liquid crystal elastomers with controlled orientation. The design of such structures is challenging. In structural materials, topology optimization combined with additive manufacturing has proven to be an extremely powerful tool, and mathematical analysis played a very important role in making it so. Indeed, the most straightforward formulation is an ill-posed problem in the calculus variations, and this has been addressed using relaxation (for example, the homogenization method) and regularization (for example, perimeter penalization). Naive formulations of optimal design problems using responsive materials are still ill-posed and their relaxation and regularization are open. For example, while optimal design with structural materials typically leads to min-max problems, extension to responsive materials requires maximizing a linear combination of minima. Trajectory optimization, unilateral constraints (due to limits in response), and issues surrounding manufacturability are also of interest. The research will provide a robust mathematical foundation that can form the basis for methodologies for the design and synthesis of integrated functional materials and structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses in particular on systems that are unstable or singular and are expected to create or amplify correlations and oscillations. A key unifying question in the research is to identify the critical scale in the models to quantify how those correlations or oscillations may develop.

The flows within the channels can be used to separate particles within the samples, such as the cells in the blood, by their sizes or shapes, deliver them to testing areas regularly spaced chains, or to move them selectively from one fluid to another. Although the devices have found many applications in sample testing and handling, there is a lack of quantitatively accurate models for how particles move in the flows created within a device. Without models that can be solved fast enough to test possible device geometries, predictive modeling has been little used for prototyping or optimizing the design of devices. Indeed, there is even disagreement about the nature and number of forces that particles experience. In this project, the PI will develop approximation methods that enable fast solutions of the flow fields around devices. The goal of this work is to reveal the types of forces that particles such as cells, experience within inertial microfluidic devices, and to create and share robust simulation tools that can be used by device-building groups on laptop computers. The PI will integrate multiple educational and outreach elements, including mentoring of undergraduate researchers and future high school math teachers to do frontier level research.

The PI will develop and exploit asymptotic tools for structure of the Navier-Stokes equations that describe fluid flow and particle movements. The PI will also dissect the asymptotic structure of the equations, in the limits of small and order unity particle Reynolds numbers.

(3) Development of fast-running computational models of the classical Rayleigh-Taylor (RT), Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH), and Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) instabilities in the presence of combustion. These instabilities are highly unstable and very expensive to simulate using traditional computational tools. For RT, small perturbations of the material interface initially grow according to the linear theory, before the system enters the nonlinear regime, in which the light fluid bubbles into the heavy fluid, while the heavy fluid spikes into the light fluid. The velocity of the resulting flow is discontinuous at this interface, which initiates KH. This causes the interface to roll up into complex vortical structures and eventually leads to turbulent mixing. In the presence of combustion, a large and unstable mixing zone is created. Each of these instabilities arises in numerous important applications, including in astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion, and ocean mixing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particularly important class of FSI problems are those at small spatial scales. The biophysics of cell biological processes is a very important example of this. In such FSI problems, the fluid can be treated as a very viscous fluid (Stokes fluid). This project will study FSI problems in a Stokes fluid. The mathematical equations describing FSI problems are generally difficult to study mathematically, but the relative simplicity of the equations of Stokes fluids makes possible a detailed mathematical study of this class of FSI problems. The research program is divided into two parts. In the first, we study the dynamics of membranes in a Stokes fluid. Such models are often used to describe the dynamics of the cell membrane. In the second, we study the dynamics of filaments in Stokes flow. Such models are often used to describe the dynamics of flagella of microorganisms and sperm.

For these predictions to be actionable, they must also have quantifiable uncertainty, and be robust to model misspecification. This is particularly relevant in light of events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where models have to be constantly adapted to include new phenomena such as unreported and asymptomatic cases and constantly evolving social distancing rules and compliance. Other applications include large complex systems such as weather forecasting and social network dynamics where first-principles models are powerful but have difficulty capturing the full range of phenomena involved. The semiparametric framework will help address the growing problem of un-modeled phenomena by allowing existing models to be automatically merged with model-free methods that leverage data to learn a correction to the model in order to match the observed data. The new tools will allow application to a class of high dimensional problems with spatial structure, such as geosystems problems, social networks, and global disease dynamics. Beyond improving forecasting, the semiparametric approach will include accurate uncertainty quantification, which is critical in these application domains. The investigator will train a graduate student and undergraduate students who will be able to carry this research forward, as well as developing and disseminating this key expertise. These students will learn to apply both state-of-the-art and the newly developed methods which will prepare them for future work in applied and computational mathematics.<br/><br/>The investigator will develop semiparametric modeling techniques that optimally leverage the strengths of parametric (model based) and nonparametric (model-free or data-driven) methods. Specifically, the semiparametric framework allows the flexible nonparametric models to fill in the gaps and correct the low-dimensional model error in a parametric model. The framework employs an ensemble of states in the parametric model to represent the uncertainty in a forecast or state estimate, while a full probability distribution is estimated for the nonparametric model. At each filtering or forecasting step, the ensemble is updated by sampling individual corrections from the model error distribution estimated by the nonparametric model. These sampled corrections will automatically correct biases in the model and inflate the uncertainty when necessary in order to match reality. The evolution of the nonparametric model will typically need to be conditional to the high-dimensional state of the parametric model, which current methods to do not allow. In other words, information must flow in both directions: the nonparametric model corrects the parametric model, but is also informed by the current state of the parametric model. In order to overcome this crucial challenge, supervised dimensionality reduction techniques will be combined with a novel method of learning mappings between non-diffeomorphic spaces. This will allow a Bayesian update of the nonparametric state estimate based on the learned projection of the parametric state. The research includes a novel higher order unscented ensemble forecast that will form the basis for a higher order Kalman filter. These advances will make the best use of available computation resources, since the higher order ensemble forecasting and filtering methods can scale up from small to large ensembles as resources allow. The higher order methods will improve accuracy and uncertainty quantification by estimating higher order moments  of the state estimate and the forecast. For the ensemble forecast, a novel multivariate quadrature method will be applied that uses rank-1 tensor decompositions of the higher moments as quadrature nodes. For the Kalman update, higher order equations will be used based on a maximum entropy closure of the moment equations derived from the Kushner equation (which fully describes the true solution). The advances will effectively use data to learn a model-free correction to a parametric model, simultaneously alleviating model error and the curse-of-dimensionality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But to make these aims realities, data must be soundly analyzed to uncover what matters. While data analysis has been around for centuries, today's data is much bigger in amount and dimension and more complex, presenting notorious challenges to modern data analysis. Often real world data is noisy and conceals inherent hidden structures that can be concisely represented by graphs that use nodes for objects/events and edges for relations between nodes. Existing approaches rely on pre- and heuristically constructible graphs show their inability in handling nowadays complicated data. This project aims to change the status quo by developing novel mathematical models and efficient computational tools for scientists, engineers, and medical professionals who can use the models and tools to unearth the hidden structures to achieve scientific discoveries previously considered impossible. The principle investigators will integrate their research activities of this project with teaching and education, and will train undergraduate and graduate students in computational mathematics, data science, and interdisciplinary studies.<br/><br/>The proposed research will result in advanced models and efficient algorithms for graph-based machine learning.

The models have much wider applicability than existing graph-based learning methods because graph structure is now a variable that will be optimized over so as to yield an optimal hidden graph structure for a given data set, and the algorithms not only are capable of producing robust embeddings with simultaneously learned hidden graph structures but also will be made practical for big data through landmark and low-rank matrix approximation strategies. The proposed research will have potentially high impacts scientifically in areas where analyzing high-dimensional datasets plays critically important roles, such as data visualization, discovering structural patterns in computational biology, brain networks and other areas.

Its significance stems from the fact that the Navier-Stokes equations have been widely used in science and engineering to model 3D fluid flows, and a rigorous validation of the model in the regime of the intense fluid activity (e.g., the pockets of turbulence encountered by the airplanes), and in particular ruling out the singularity formation, is the key to more reliable modeling of turbulent flows. Since the inception of the Navier-Stokes regularity problem in the 1930s, there has been a 'gap' between what is needed to prevent the possible formation of a singularity and what could be rigorously obtained from the equations. The aim of the research to be accomplished under the award is to bridge this gap and arrive at 'criticality'; this will not completely rule out the formation of singularities, but will drastically restrict the possible scenarios at which it might occur. Given the omnipresence of the turbulent phenomena, both in nature and in the engineered world, the impact of the research will extend beyond the boundaries of the discipline. In the domain of mentoring junior scientists, the award will support a graduate research assistant.<br/><br/>The research to be carried out under the award builds on a very recent work by the PI and L. Xu demonstrating--for the first time--asymptotically critical nature of the Navier-Stokes regularity problem. The methodology is based on the study of a suitably defined scale of sparseness of the super-level sets of the positive and the negative parts of the components of the higher-order derivatives of the velocity field, and the sparseness is utilized via the harmonic measure majorization principle (the positive and the negative parts of the components are subharmonic since any smooth flow is automatically analytic in the spatial variables). The sparser the super-level sets are, the more efficient the harmonic measure majorization principle is in generating the 'self-improving' bounds on the sup-norm. Within this framework, it was demonstrated that the 'scaling gap' between the regularity class and the corresponding a priori bound shrinks to zero as the order of the derivative goes to infinity, a manifestation of the asymptotic criticality. The main goal of the research to be performed is to arrive at stronger and/or more classical manifestations of the criticality. There are two natural avenues to take, toward criticality with respect to the strength of the diffusion and toward criticality with respect to the strength of the nonlinearity. These are exactly the two main projects, the former will take place in the setting of the 3D,super-critical, hyper-dissipative Navier-Stokes equations, and the latter in the realm of the geometric depletion of the nonlinearity via the local coherence of the vorticity direction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A soliton is a special type of wave that shows a remarkable stability when traveling through various media. Examples include such well-known phenomena as tsunami waves and pulses in optical fibers. The first observation and scientific description of a soliton was given by Scott Russell in 1834. The equation describing what Russel had observed was derived in 1895 by Korteweg and de Vries but it was not until 1967 when this equation, now called Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), was solved in closed form by Gardner, Greene, Kruskal, and Miura. Their method is regarded as a major achievement of the 20th century science. It gave rise to soliton theory, applicable to broad classes of physically important evolution partial differential equations, ranging from hydrodynamics of water waves (rogue waves in the ocean) and nonlinear optics (propagation of information in optical fibers) to astrophysics, atmospheric sciences, and elementary particle theory. This project will develop novel approaches to extend the theory to the physically and practically important cases of slowly decaying waves, which are still beyond the reach of the current methods. The project will have a very large educational component. The investigator is committed to continuing his research experience for undergraduates program on nonlinear wave phenomena. This program is designed to identify and mentor young scholars in the field of applied mathematics. It is his intent to attract a diverse (gender, ethnicity, disability) group of talented undergraduates into the program to broaden the participation of underrepresented in the mathematical sciences groups.<br/><br/>Integrable systems have been primarily studied in the connection with propagation of waves initiated from rapidly decaying or periodic initial data. In the KdV context, the corresponding solutions have a relatively simple and well understood wave structure of running solitons accompanied by radiation of decaying waves, or periodic wave-trains and their modulations. However, any deviation from such data meets principal difficulties. The main thrust will be put on understanding of the effect of slower decay (or even no decay) at spatial plus infinity. Physical motivations include modeling rogue waves, nonlinear wave propagation in (pseudo) periodic media with slowly decaying amplitude, integrable turbulence, and propagation of coherent structures in noisy media. From the mathematical viewpoint, it is an uncharted territory. Slower decay at plus infinity causes serious complications at every step of the IST. The main effort will be put on understanding how to make the method of the Riemann-Hilbert problem, a modern powerful machinery of asymptotic analysis, work far outside of the realm of classical problems. To this end, developing direct/inverse scattering theory for long-range potentials will be required. The investigator expects to find new types of solutions with far-reaching practical applications, which include, but not limited to, the understanding of rogue waves, soliton propagation on different backgrounds, and the study of propagation of more general coherent structures in noisy media appearing in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma, astrophysics, and other areas where integrable systems naturally arise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plasmonic structures are commonly made of metals and dielectrics, and exhibit at optical frequencies surface electromagnetic waves at the metal-dielectric interfaces, called surface plasmons. Over the past decades there has been a great interest to guide and confine surface plasmons in nanophotonic devices, with applications to antennas, cloaking, and others. Surface plasmons are sub-wavelength, hyper-singular near corners, and consequently highly sensitive to the geometry. Commercial software commonly used by scientists and engineers is based on the finite element method, and poorly approximates the electromagnetic near-field in these exotic structures. There is a need for an adapted mathematical framework to capture the multiple scales, and for numerical approaches for computing the electromagnetic field in plasmonic structures to avoid inaccurate predictions. This project will develop a finite element based approach to address this problem that involves specific treatments near the interface the accurately capture the surface plasmons, and a functional framework to extract the highly oscillatory behaviors of the electromagnetic near-field.

In this project, the Principal Investigator will address core questions in integral geometry, on both theoretical and applied levels. For such problems where the complexity lies in the geometry of propagation, the representation of the unknown parameters, and sometimes the non-linear aspects of the problem, the feasibility of reconstruction from available data will be first assessed at the level of the continuous models. In cases where inversion is possible, theoretical inversions will be validated by proof-of-concept implementations which will address practical issues of noisy data, sampling/resolution, regularization and Uncertainty Quantification. This research project is integrated with opportunities for training, research experience and career development for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for a postdoctoral researcher. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the theoretical and applied analysis of integral geometric problems, where unknowns are modeled as functions, tensors, connections over bundles, or sections of these bundles. The measurements are linear or non-linear integral functionals of said unknowns. In addition to the usual injectivity, stability and inversion assessments, focus will be turned toward sharpening the mapping properties of integral geometric operators and obtaining range characterizations for certain non-linear operators. The proposed methods combine deep theoretical tools (microlocal analysis, harmonic analysis, Clifford analysis and partial differential equations on manifolds) with a concern to produce explicit routes toward the reconstruction of the unknowns, some of which already exist in non-explicit form. To complement this theoretical agenda, addressing practical issues such as noisy data, sampling and Uncertainty Quantification will require methods from theoretical statistics and signal processing. Numerical validations will be provided to implement the theoretical derivations and uncover the next challenges toward real-life applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the projects is concerned with the modeling of the motion of eukaryotic cells on a substrate. Cell motility is involved in key physiological processes such as wound healing and immunological response. One of the most remarkable characteristics of eukaryotic cells is their ability to reach and maintain an asymmetric shape in a seemingly spontaneous way, a phenomenon that leads to the sustained motion of the cell in a given direction (cell migration). While the biological processes involved are very complex, the principal investigator will develop and study some mathematical models (obtained as approximation of models proposed by biologists) that are both easier to analyze and faster to compute numerically. By identifying models that lead to cell migration, this work will help better understand what biological processes play a key role in cell motility. A different project is aimed at the study the fine properties of the solutions of optimal transportation problems. Optimal transportation problems are a class of mathematical problems that originated with the simple question of how to optimally allocate the production from a set of sources to a set of destinations in the cheapest (or most efficient) way. This field of mathematics has application in a variety of domains such as economics, data analysis, image processing etc. In addition to theoretical studies this research will contribute to the numerical computations of the solutions of these complex problems. Graduate students will be trained through active participation in the project. <br/><br/>The first project described above involves free-boundary problems of Hele-Shaw type in which the usual smoothing/stabilizing effect of mean-curvature is balanced by the destabilizing effect of an active potential. The investigator will study symmetry breaking bifurcation phenomena characterized by the existence of nontrivial traveling wave solutions for such problems. Related free-boundary problems, arising in the modeling of congested crowd motion and in fluid dynamic will also be studied. The focus of the proposal is on models/regimes in which the forward and backward motions of the moving boundary occur via different mechanisms and at different time scales. In the field of optimal mass transportation, the focus is on the properties of optimal plans associated to measures that are discrete approximation of absolutely continuous measures. Such a framework is of great importance in many applications and in particular for numerical computations. A regularity theory for the associated Kantorovich potential will be developed. The final project is concerned with boundary conditions for nonlocal equations (e.g. fractional Laplace equation), which are notoriously more delicate than their local counterparts. The main goal of this project is derivation of new nonlocal Neumann boundary conditions, which are the macroscopic counterparts of classical microscopic boundary conditions in the kinetic theory of gas dynamic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, in  fields such as microscopy, astronomy, and medical imaging, it is often challenging to discern cellular structures, far-away stars, or tumours from the available measurements. The issue also arises in electronic imaging, where shot noise constrains the minimum pixel size, and in other applications, including signal processing, spectroscopy, radar, and seismology. The goal of super-resolution is to meet this challenge, uncovering fine-scale structure from coarse-scale data. In this project the investigators will analyze super-resolution techniques, design new methodology based on the resulting insights, and apply the methodology to fluorescence microscopy, which has become an essential imaging tool in biology. The proposed integrated program of educational and research activities will impact workforce development by training students at the intersection of data science, signal processing, and machine learning. This will contribute to address the rising demand for data scientists and engineers in industry and academia.<br/><br/>Modern super-resolution techniques based on nonconvex optimization provide model flexibility, computational efficiency, and yield good empirical results. However, theoretical analysis showing under what conditions these techniques are guaranteed to work, or may fail, is lacking. In addition, recent works show that learning-based methods based on neural networks can be trained to perform super-resolution effectively and efficiently. Calibrating these models requires minimizing a highly nonconvex cost function. The proposed research activities will advance the theoretical underpinnings of nonconvex optimization for super-resolution and related problems such as line-spectra estimation and blind deconvolution. The project will focus on the super-resolution of point sources, which may represent fluorescent particles in microscopy, astral bodies in astronomy, spectral lines in signal processing, or neuron action potentials in neuroscience. The investigators will perform a mathematical analysis of the geometric landscapes that arise when using nonconvex cost functions to fit point sources, and also study the properties of learning-based approaches when deployed on point-source signal models.

The state of the art for the modeling, analysis, and computer simulation of all these systems is very sophisticated. Nonetheless, there are seemingly simple, physically-relevant effects that profoundly complicate the way in which the systems are analyzed mathematically and that make current methods insufficient. This project aims to advance the mathematical treatment of waves to incorporate two broad classes of such physical effects. The first of these is spatial, that is, the effects related to the fact that a system is not uniform throughout its extent. For example, such heterogeneity arises from including bottom topography in water wave models, lamination in elastica, or structural variability in engineered materials. The second are so-called singular effects. These include accounting for surface tension in fluids, incorporating multiple species of ions in plasma models, and introduction of defects in molecular chains. The project aims to (a) devise models for these effects, (b) develop mathematically rigorous, broadly applicable, and highly accurate quantitative descriptions, and (c) implement novel algorithms for the simulation of such systems. The project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>More technically, the goal is to understand how the above phenomena affect the existence, stability, and (especially) dynamics of coherent structures in nonlinear, hyperbolic and/or dispersive differential equations. Spatial heterogeneity ruins translation invariance, an essential ingredient for the existence of traveling waves. Singular effects are famously unpredictable. Nevertheless, incorporating these sorts of effects need not eliminate entirely the coherent structures. For instance, it may be that a traveling wave becomes a nanopteron, which is to say a traveling wave that is the superposition of a localized solitary core and a very small amplitude periodic wave. Nanopterons are already known to exist in the gravity-capillary wave problem and a variety of Hamiltonian lattice models. Another possibility is that a solitary wave propagates seemingly unchanged for an extremely long time but eventually deteriorates into dispersive waves. That is to say, the solitary wave transforms into a long-lived transient, or metastable, solution. This project?s principal aims are: identify systems that possess nanopteron solutions and establish their existence rigorously; advance the rigorous nanopteron theory to be more descriptive and to work in settings where the solitary core is large; devise and implement high-order symplectic integrators for Hamiltonian partial and lattice differential equations to simulate metastable solitary waves over very long time scales; prove rigorously the existence of metastable solitary waves; and identify new phenomenology related to spatially heterogeneous or singular perturbations of solitary waves through analysis and simulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Having an adequate mathematical language for their description is crucial for understanding such phenomena as formation of air turbulence in meteorology, as well as large- and small-scale structures in liquids and plasmas.  Despite much effort, many aspects of fluid dynamics are still poorly understood and a breakthrough in this field only seems possible if a variety of different mathematical tools is used. One of the most promising directions is a geometric approach to fluids. This approach is known to work well for fluids confined to a fixed domain. The goal of the project is to extend the geometric language to more general settings, with applications including formation of waves, ocean currents, insight into vortex instabilities, and the study of motion of underwater vehicles. The investigator will actively involve graduate students in this project.<br/><br/>Modern geometric fluid dynamics originated in the 1960s when V. Arnold proved that the Euler equation for an ideal fluid describes the geodesic flow of a right-invariant metric on the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the flow domain. This insight turned out to be indispensable for the study of Hamiltonian properties and conservation laws in hydrodynamics, fluid instabilities, topological properties of flows, as well as a powerful tool for obtaining sharper existence and uniqueness results for Euler-type equations. Furthermore, Arnold's group-theoretic description of incompressible fluids has also been shown to be applicable in many other fluid-related settings, including magnetohydrodynamics, compressible fluids, semi-geostrophic and the Korteweg-de Vries equations. However, the scope of applicability of Arnold's approach is limited to systems whose symmetries form a group. At the same time, there are many problems in fluid dynamics, such as free boundary problems, fluid-structure interactions, discontinuous fluid flows, as well as multiphase and stratified fluids, whose symmetries should instead be regarded as a groupoid. The aim of the project is to develop a paradigm of infinite-dimensional Lie groupoids in the context of various fluid-dynamical problems, as well as to apply this paradigm to approach a range of concrete questions that are of interest for applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We observe swirls in rivers, the ocean, and hurricanes. The main objective of this project is to understand how such vortices interact with each other; more specifically, what kind of geometric patterns they can form in nature. A simple example is how the triangle formed by the centers of three hurricanes changes its shape in time; it is a mathematical model for the three hurricanes, Irma, Jose, and Katia, that appeared near the Gulf of Mexico in the Fall 2017, shortly after the Hurricane Harvey. Such interacting vortices are known to appear in much smaller scales in certain materials as well, and are key to the understanding of superconductors, which have engineering applications including powerful electromagnets (used for maglev trains, fusion reactors, and magnetic resonance imaging). This project exploits mathematical ideas to better understand the dynamics of interacting vortices. The project will contribute to outreach events, and the PI and the graduate students will also mentor undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds participating in a mathematical modeling contest.<br/><br/>The project investigates interactions of multiple vortices in ordinary fluids, superfluids, and superconductors using modern geometric methods to study how the configuration of vortices evolves in time. While the shape dynamics of only a few vortices is well understood, the shape dynamics of a larger number of vortices has been a challenge. The new geometric insight sheds a new light on the shape dynamics of vortices by finding invariants that will help us understand the stability of possible configurations. The project develops techniques to analyze the shape dynamics of vortices by exploiting ideas from symmetry reduction in the geometric approach to mechanics. The technique applies not only to vortices in ordinary fluids but also to quantum vortices in superfluids and superconductors. The project also develops numerical methods to accurately predict stability/instability of configurations of many vortices. Vortex dynamics is a practical example of so-called non-separable Hamiltonian systems, to which many conventional explicit methods for Hamiltonian systems do not apply directly. The project aims to develop explicit numerical integrators for non-separable Hamiltonian systems with favorable geometric properties, such as exact/near conservation of invariants in vortex dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nonlinear dispersive waves are ubiquitous in nature, appearing in many fields ranging from water waves to optics, acoustics, condensed matter, cosmology and beyond. Nonlinear dispersive waves have been an area of intensive research interest in applied mathematics and physics. The integrable Nonlinear Schrdinger (NLS) equation is generally accepted as the universal model for waves propagating in nonlinear dispersive media. The main idea of this project is to model random nonlinear waves, which are frequently encountered in natural phenomena, with the so-called soliton or breather gases ? random ensembles of the well-known solutions of the equation. Ultimately, the project aims to enhance our ability to predict and, in some cases, to control random nonlinear waves.  This research employs ideas of pure and applied mathematics that are enhanced by the collaboration with experimental physicists. The project will also serve as a vehicle for training PhD students.<br/><br/>The main goals of this project can be divided in the two categories: (a) development of the rigorous spectral theory for the focusing NLS (fNLS) gases and construction of their semiclassical limit realizations; (b) statistical characterization of breather and soliton gases in terms of their spectral characteristics together with applications in random nonlinear wave problems. The work in part (a) requires rigorous derivation and analysis of integro-differential equations describing spectral characteristics of the gases. Calculation of important statistical characteristics (probability density function, power spectrum, kurtosis, etc.) of the fNLS gases in part (b) contains both analytical and numerical components. The obtained results are expected to lead to lab experiments in collaboration with European experimentalists. In general, the project will have an impact on a broad area of nonlinear wave theory, including integrable turbulence. In fiber optics, results of the project may help to examine, and ultimately to control the evolution of noise in nonlinear optical fibers.

Of special interest are materials instabilities when the material experiences sudden changes in response to the changes in environment. One type of instability is a phase transition in crystalline solids, where changing loading or temperature can make the original phase (structure of the material) unstable and give rise to a different crystalline phase that could have a different volume leading to the shape change of the original material sample. Such materials can be used in switches, cantilevers, or gauges in nano-scale devices. The transformed material is a mixture of phases, separated by phase boundaries. Buckling of slender structures under compression is another example of an instability. Buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells is of special interest for mathematical analysis, since the theoretically computed buckling load of a perfect circular cylindrical shell is more than 5 times higher than what is observed in experiments. This investigation will provide analytical tools for identifying both stable configurations and instabilities. It will advance our quantitative understanding of specific mechanisms through which small imperfections of shape and load can have a dramatic effect on buckling strength. Fundamental physical principles of causality and passivity are very often expressed mathematically in terms of special analytic dependence on parameters. The investigator will study properties of relevant classes of analytic functions from the point of view of recovering them from experimental measurements. Such questions emerge from a wide spectrum of disciplines from materials science to particle physics. They are relevant for remote sensing when one wants to measure material properties in inhospitable environments, from the Arctic to planets and moons in the Solar system. A related problem of nondestructive testing will benefit from harnessing mathematical advances in the study of composites to predicting structural features of heterogeneous media from boundary measurements. A junior scientist will be trained while contributing to the research described above.<br/><br/>Mathematics being developed to study stability of phase boundaries represents a contribution to Calculus of Variations, where a better understanding of quasiconvexity can have implications for mechanics of metastability and hysteresis in shape memory alloys or giant magnetostrictive materials. Such materials undergoing martensitic phase transitions are used in sensors and actuators, and in everyday devices, like dental braces. The investigation of buckling of cylindrical shells aims to create a mathematically rigorous theory of buckling of slender bodies. Of special interest is the rigorous justification of negligibility of departure from linear elasticity of deformations before the onset of buckling, especially in the presence of shape imperfections. Stieltjes functions is an important special class of analytic functions in terms of which one can describe the complex impedance of electrical circuits or complex electromagnetic permittivity of materials. They also arise in signal processing, antenna design and particle physics. The fundamental question that will be addressed by this research is the rigorous mathematical theory of their recovery from noisy measurements at either a discrete set of points or on a curve in the complex upper half plane. Provably optimal reconstruction algorithms producing certifiably valid data will be a specific target of this research. The theory of exact relations for composites will be used to identifying properties of the Dirichlet to Neumann map that are insensitive to the internal structure of the medium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to extract concrete information from such systems, suitable mathematical models must be designed so as to capture the most relevant cross-scale interactions and degrees of freedom. In this project the PI will investigate the efficiency of methods for exploring complex system models under two main perspectives. First, through techniques of statistical inference of physical quantities based on observational data. Several applications fit within this scope, for example determining the background fluid velocity field from measurements of the concentration of a diluted passive scalar, such as dye. A second application is the analysis of the long-time behavior of computable regularizations of certain hydrodynamics models. More specifically, geophysical models describing the motion of fluids over a rough surface and used to represent large-scale processes in the atmosphere and ocean. A rigorous analysis of such fundamental questions encompasses a wide range of mathematical tools. As such, the techniques built here may allow for the development of efficient numerical schemes in numerous applications, as well as the advancement of the associated mathematical theory. In addition, this project presents an educational component by including support for the mentoring of one graduate student, as well as undergraduate research co-op support for one undergraduate student.<br/><br/>A rigorous and complete description of complex systems requires an analysis at an infinite-dimensional level. In this project the PI will this infinite-dimensional approach to analyze the efficiency of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, as used in the Bayesian approach to inverse problems. Of particular importance are MCMC algorithms that are well-defined in infinite dimensions, a property that allows corresponding finite-dimensional approximations to beat the curse of dimensionality. This project will tackle several open questions in this field, such as the derivation of mixing rates for some infinite-dimensional MCMC methods and their corresponding finite-dimensional approximations. The techniques to be used here rely crucially on Foias-Prodi type estimates and the existence of a finite number of determining degrees of freedom for certain dissipative evolution equations. Furthermore, this project includes the study of the long-time behavior of certain hydrodynamic models, such as the weakly damped 2D Euler equations subject to a mild regularization. In particular, this will first be addressed through the concept of determining forms, structures encoding the long-time dynamics of the system based on knowledge on the trajectories of only a finite number of degrees of freedom. Later, the system will be analyzed under the action of a stochastic forcing term. Here, an interesting question consists in establishing the convergence of invariant measures as the regularization parameter vanishes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, interest in active noise has grown rapidly because of its fundamental importance in the interdisciplinary fields of active matter and stochastic thermodynamics. This project will develop a mathematical framework to model active noise in self-propelled particles and its connection to physical law. Active self-propelled particles that consume energy to drive persistent motion are a model building block of many complex dynamical systems. Investigating how active noise drives dynamics holds promise to revolutionize our understanding of non-equilibrium systems and the associated mathematical techniques, much like our mathematical understanding of thermal noise revolutionized thermodynamics and material science. More specifically, self-propelled particles are by definition out-of-equilibrium and thus experience non-thermal active fluctuations. They serve as an ideal model system to study the non-equilibrium fluctuations of particles. This project will develop the mathematical framework for underdamped self-propelled particles. It will establish the foundational steps for understanding active noise by: (1) Building a stochastic model of self-propelled particles with the full inertial dynamics; (2) Developing a true model of active noise that mimics physical systems; and (3) Connecting active noise to relations in physics via stochastic thermodynamics. The generalized Langevin approach will be used for modeling, and experiments will done on both micro- and macro-scale self-propelled particles in confining potentials. Active noise is present in a wide variety of systems, including information systems, stochastic synchronization, fluid turbulence, active matter, living organisms, etc. Thus, studying how active noise can reveal the underlying dynamics of a system has potential to impact many fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work will study how the macroscopic mechanical properties of a Maxwell lattice are determined by its microscopic structure. An improved understanding of the relationship between microstructure and macroscopic behavior is expected to facilitate the design of better artificial materials. The project's second thrust lies at the interface between mathematics and data science, and is thus aligned with one of NSF's ten Big Ideas (""Harnessing the Data Revolution""). This work will focus on a problem of sequential decision making, in which data that arrive incrementally must be assembled into a coherent whole despite inconsistencies; the specific focus will be a recently-introduced approach to low-rank matrix completion.  In both areas, the project will involve PhD students. The junior scientists involved in this research will gain experience and breadth in both mathematics and a key application area.<br/><br/>The project's first thrust will explore the nonlinear mechanics of two-dimensional ""Maxwell lattices."" These are, by definition, periodic lattice structures in which the average number of edges meeting a node is four; the well-known Kagome lattice is a favorite example. Maxwell lattices are interesting because they are, in most cases, elastically degenerate. A large literature has developed concerning their linearly elastic behavior; however the nonlinear mechanics of these structures is still poorly understood, even for deformations with little or no strain. The project's first thrust will use methods from nonlinear homogenization and the calculus of variations to explore the nonlinear mechanics of Maxwell lattices. The project's second thrust will explore a recently introduced approach to low-rank matrix completion. This approach relies on a two-person, zero-sum, sequential game analogous to the model of online machine learning known as ""prediction with expert advice.""

The first is 3D printing and other novel manufacturing technologies. The second is the development of active materials whose properties can be altered by electrical or magnetic fields and heat. It is now becoming possible to 3D print active materials like shape-memory alloys and liquid crystal elastomers. This paves the way for responsive structures whose shape can be controlled by external stimuli. Further, combining them with structural materials can endow them with functions that are of use for many applications including soft robotics, wearable and prosthetic devices, microfluidics, cleanup of hazardous chemicals, targeted drug delivery, and tissue engineering. However, there is no known way to systematically design such devices. This project will develop a methodology for the systematic design of responsive structures and meta-materials which are complex assemblies of distinct materials and voids, especially optimal design where one seeks the best function at the least cost. These optimal design problems lead to substantial mathematical problems. Conversely, a better mathematical understanding of these problems can lead to new design approaches. By providing robust methodologies for the design and synthesis of responsive structures and meta-materials, this research will have a significant technological impact. It will also provide for the training of two graduate students and several undergraduate researchers. It will generate new opportunities for engaging K-12 students in STEM, and for promoting STEM education amongst underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The investigators will study mathematical questions motivated by the vision of incorporating structural and responsive materials (materials whose response function depends on external stimuli) into integrated functional materials and structures which can change shape and can be combined with structural materials to endow them with function. Such materials include shape-memory alloys, photo-sensitive elastomers, or liquid crystal elastomers with controlled orientation. The design of such structures is challenging. In structural materials, topology optimization combined with additive manufacturing has proven to be an extremely powerful tool, and mathematical analysis played a very important role in making it so. Indeed, the most straightforward formulation is an ill-posed problem in the calculus variations, and this has been addressed using relaxation (for example, the homogenization method) and regularization (for example, perimeter penalization). Naive formulations of optimal design problems using responsive materials are still ill-posed and their relaxation and regularization are open. For example, while optimal design with structural materials typically leads to min-max problems, extension to responsive materials requires maximizing a linear combination of minima. Trajectory optimization, unilateral constraints (due to limits in response), and issues surrounding manufacturability are also of interest. The research will provide a robust mathematical foundation that can form the basis for methodologies for the design and synthesis of integrated functional materials and structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on modeling of such networked systems using mathematical and computer models and will address two areas of need. The first concerns how we determine the structure of networks in the first place. To make a model of, for instance, a disease outbreak, one must determine the pattern of contacts between people in order to understand spread. Experimental measurements of network structure, however, are known to have inaccuracies and can give misleading results. To circumvent the impossible task of making perfect measurements, this project will use a combination of state-of-the-art computational and mathematical techniques to formulate methods for making accurate estimates of network structure even when the underlying data are unreliable. The result will be new ways to make more trustworthy calculations of network quantities and precise indications of the margin of error that can be used to inform scientific judgment. The second focus of this project is the development of new computer algorithms for calculation of network quantities using the mathematical technique known as belief propagation. These algorithms will focus on calculations such as resilience of networks to failure or attack, outcomes of epidemiological processes, or large-scale structural features of networks. As an example, belief propagation methods permit calculation of the expected number of individuals who will be infected by a disease given the structure of a contact network and fundamental parameters of the disease itself.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new mathematical methods for the analysis of network data, for the self-consistent solution of processes taking place on networks, and for optimal estimation of network properties in the presence of measurement error. The first of two research themes will focus on message passing methods, a powerful class of self-consistent methods for solving for the structural and dynamical properties of networked systems. Though useful, these methods have long been handicapped by technical limitations that restrict their use to loop-free, or nearly loop-free, networks. Building on successful preliminary studies, this project will show how these limitations can be overcome and develop a new generation of message passing methods that work on realistic networks, including those with a high density of loops. A range of specific applications will be pursued and the methods developed will also serve as the foundation for new formal developments, such as new random graph models, theories of structural phase transitions in networks, and the computation of spectra for very large networks. A second theme will focus on rigorous methods for making estimates of network structure from rich but potentially unreliable data sources. Most empirical observations of network structure contain measurement error of one kind or another, but these errors are rarely considered, in part for lack of a comprehensive mathematical framework for treating them. This project will develop such a framework, based on formal models of the measurement process coupled with statistical and machine learning tools including Bayesian methods, expectation-maximization algorithms, and Monte Carlo techniques. The result will be a new set of tools that allow practitioners to make reliable estimates of networks and their properties from noisy data and to quantify the level of uncertainty in those estimates. In collaboration with domain experts in computer science, biology, and the social sciences, specific applications of these methods will be developed for systems such as the Internet, ecological networks, and social networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Apart from their aesthetic appeal, these wave phenomena also are fundamental to applications in various scientific fields, including geophysical fluid dynamics, ship hydrodynamics, oceanography, and meteorology.  This research project will develop a novel mathematical methodology for analyzing three-dimensional water-wave patterns.  In contrast to all previous analytical treatments, the new approach will not be restricted to waves of small steepness and aims to explain theoretically several striking features revealed by recent numerical simulations of water waves induced by currents over uneven ocean bottom topography. The project will also involve graduate students in the research.<br/><br/>The generation of steady three-dimensional (3D) water-wave patterns by moving surface and submerged sources is a fundamental topic of fluid dynamics with applications to geophysical fluid modeling, oceanography, and ship hydrodynamics.  The usual way of tackling these problems analytically is based on the linearized water-wave equations, assuming infinitesimally small disturbances.  Departing from such linear analysis, this project will devise an analytical (asymptotic) technique that will enable nonlinear treatment of steady 3D free-surface gravity wave patterns due to various types of wave sources.  Motivation comes from the recent discovery (by the PI's group) of a nonlinear mechanism that controls the amplitude of 2D forced gravity waves for a broad range of flow conditions, limiting severely the validity of linear analysis.  This mechanism depends on all orders of the disturbance amplitude (nonlinearity parameter) and can be captured by perturbation expansions that go beyond all orders in the nonlinearity parameter.  This project will develop such a beyond-all-orders (exponential asymptotics) technique suitable for 3D wave patterns.  This new methodology will be used to advance understanding of nonlinear effects in 3D forced gravity water waves in two distinct flow regimes: (i) waves on water of finite depth due to a stream over fully localized topography or due to a localized pressure patch moving on the free surface; and (ii) deep-water waves due to flow past a point source or doublet submerged at finite depth from the free surface or due to a pressure patch moving on the free surface.  These problems model (i) oceanic flows over seamounts and underwater ridges as well as ship wakes in shallow water; and (ii) ship wave patterns on deep water.  The asymptotic analysis will aim to explain theoretically several striking nonlinear features revealed by recent numerical simulations of these mathematical models and to shed light on novel nonlinear aspects that as yet have not been captured numerically.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The methods will entail event-triggered feedback control, whereby the systems use feedback about their states and their surroundings, help decide future optimizing courses of action, and where events like potential violations of constraints are used to determine when to change the controls. The project will seek finite-time control methods, which enable control objectives such as tracking and station keeping to be realized by prescribed finite-time deadlines. Using applied mathematics to control ecological robotic systems will promote scientific progress, by leading to more effective ways to understand the effects of pollutions, oil spills, or other environmental stresses in complex, dynamic, and unstructured marine environments. The work will be collaborative with two Ph.D. students whose research at the interface of engineering and mathematics will help prepare them for a wide variety of potential careers. The investigators will also deliver presentations on elementary aspects of the project to grade school students in Louisiana or New York. This outreach can help inspire a diverse, qualified cadre of students to consider pursuing careers in engineering or mathematics. The project's applied part will focus on algorithmic development and marine robots. Additionally, this research will have the potential for applications in other settings with event-triggered controls, safety or timing constraints, and uncertainties, such as renewable energy networks or intelligent transportation systems.<br/><br/>The project will help address significant challenges in control theory for nonlinear control systems with communication or state constraints or optimization requirements, using three strategies. The first will design event- or self-triggered feedback controls for systems with time deadlines, whose triggers are computed from output measurements, and which determine when to recompute the control to avoid undesirable operating modes, with the goal of ensuring finite time convergence. This will help overcome the obstacles to using standard feedback controls, which require the user to continuously or frequently recompute control values without optimizing cost criteria or meeting time deadlines, and which therefore are less suitable in engineering applications. This will build on the nonlead investigator's prior work in event-triggered nonlinear control theory that developed several constructive design tools for various classes of nonlinear systems. The second will develop robust forward invariance methods under event- or self-triggered controls, which help predict and quantify the degree of uncertainty that control systems can tolerate without violating tolerance and safety bounds. This will build on the lead investigator's prior work that computed bounds on allowable uncertainties in marine robotic curve tracking. The third involves finite time learning-based adaptive dynamic programming that approximates optimal policies, to help overcome the curse of dimensionality that arises in traditional dynamic programming. This will build on the nonlead investigator's prior work in adaptive dynamic programming that proposed computational algorithms to learn suboptimal controllers from input-state or input-output data. The work will include applications to, and experiments with, underwater marine robots, where event-triggering will cope with intermittent communication and constrained power resources.

These models provide efficient descriptions of the underlying dynamics by suppressing unimportant details of the fluid motion. This is achieved by imposing certain scaling regimes of the wave amplitudes, wavelengths, and fluid depths. This project is concerned with the development of methods critical in the understanding of long-time behavior of some major asymptotic models of the two-layer fluid problem. Such scenarios arise in internal ocean waves layered by water of different salinity, such as are important for medium-term climate modeling including the El Nino effect, as well as long-term climate prediction. Sub-surface internal waves can also interact with surface waves and produce phenomena like rogue waves that can damage or destroy ocean vessels or fixed structures. To study the underlying equations mathematically, special solution methods were proposed in the 1980s. These methods attempt to transform the complicated nonlinear dynamics in the original equations into well predictable linear dynamics. However, rigorous mathematical analysis of the feasibility of these methods is missing. By carrying out a combination of research and educational activities, the PI will develop the mathematical theory for these methods, and make connections to partner disciplines, while attracting prospective students into the related fields.<br/> <br/>In the current project, the PI will develop complete integrability theories for the Benjamin-Ono (BO) equation and the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation. They are both 1D asymptotic models for the two-layer fluid problem. BO and ILW are important nonlinear dispersive equations with Hamiltonian structures. Furthermore, formal action-angle diffeomorphisms known as the direct scattering transforms (DST) were conjectured to map the dynamics on phase space to angular translations on infinite dimensional tori. If the DST can be inverted (IST), one will have a powerful method to study long-time asymptotics of these equations. However, currently there is no large data IST theory for BO, nor is there even a small data DST theory for ILW. Like those for many other completely integrable equations, the IST theories for BO and ILW can be formulated as Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems. Nevertheless, the RH problems for BO and ILW involve certain nonlocal jump conditions. Lack of theory for nonlocal RH problems hinders the solution of BO and ILW. For BO, the PI will use a newly discovered relation between the scattering functions to reduce the RH problem to inverting a Fredholm operator of zero index. The PI will then attempt to use a new identity to show that this Fredholm operator has trivial kernel. For ILW, the PI will recast the DST problem as inverting a convolution type operator and prove certain uniform estimates on the convolution kernel. The PI will construct the IST theory for ILW by regularization and solution in certain weighted spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first model considered in this project is the Euler system of differential equations. As one of the most fundamental systems for fluid dynamics, the Euler system has been extensively used in physics and engineering and is among the oldest partial differential equations, first introduced in the 16th century. However, many fundamental theoretical issues pertaining to the Euler equations have remained unresolved. One of the most important open problems is how the solutions that develop strong shock waves behave over long time spans. This project aims at the fundamental understanding of this problem, following the related Principal Investigator's and collaborators? recent progress. Another mathematical model considered in this project is a wave model describing liquid crystals. The Principal Investigator (PI) and collaborators recently found a new type of cusp-like singular solutions. This opens a new direction in this field. This research project seeks to deepen understanding of the structure of solutions after the singularity formation. This project will include several research-related undergraduate and graduate student training projects. <br/><br/>In this project the PI aims to capture features of solutions that include singularities, such as shock wave and cusp singularities, for some nonlinear wave equations. This will answer a very important and fundamental question for these equations: How do solutions behave beyond the formation of a singularity?

The first goal of the project is to better understand the large-data solutions for the compressible Euler equations, which develop shock waves.  The PI will study the existence of solutions with large total variation, the generic properties of solutions, and the optimal lower bounds on the density.

This project will develop the machinery and techniques so they can be used for gravitational wave detection, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as applied to nuclear waste, brain/breast cancer detection, and oil detection.  Another aspect of the project is to study all these objects in relation to problems of quantum information and quantum computers. The history of Pad approximants goes back to Charles Hermite?s proof that Euler's number is transcendental. Henri Pad, a doctoral student of Hermite, systematically extended these techniques. A Pad approximant is a rational function with the degrees of numerator and denominator n and m, respectively, and the power series expansion about a specific point agreeing with the power series expansion of the given function up to the (n+m)-th term. One of many attractive features of Pad approximants is their fast convergence and the phenomenon of global convergence. There are some pitfalls in the behavior of Pad approximants and many interesting open problems, which will be studied in this project. The PI plans to train graduate students and disseminate results publicly through publications, arXiv preprints, and at conferences.<br/><br/>The first part of primary goals of this project includes developing the mathematical foundation for a denoising scheme based on Pad approximants, which was recently proposed by physicists Daniel Bessis and Luca Perotti. There are many noise filtering methods available, but most of the classical ones fail when the signal-to-noise ratio approaches 1. The Bessis-Perotti method has been shown to be computationally effective in several cases. The underlying mathematical problem consists in the analysis of behavior of poles of Pad approximants under rational perturbations. The PI proved some convergence results for Pad approximants of rational perturbations of Markov functions, which will be further extended and adapted to the denoising scheme. Orthogonal polynomials and Jacobi matrices are intimately related to Pad approximants, and are widely used tools in their own rights. The PI intends to explore and to use some recent asymptotic formulas for nonclassical orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle of Brian Simanek and the PI in relation to the noise filtering method. The second part of primary goals includes further investigations of the relation between quantum state transfers in 1D chains and in spin configurations on graphs, which was recently proposed by Gerald Dunne, Gamal Mograby, Sasha Teplyaev, and the PI.

A signature of many active materials is motility, which is the ability to move spontaneously via the consumption of energy from internal sources or from the environment.  This project concerns the development and analysis of mathematical models of a special class of active material: motile active gels in a non-equilibrium state (for example, the cytoskeleton of a living cell). The project focuses on free-boundary models, in which unknown functions solve equations in a domain that, due to the phenomenon of motility, is also unknown. The methodology under development will be applicable in applied mathematics and will be relevant to materials and life sciences as well as engineering. The graduate students participating in this project will receive highly multidisciplinary training, enabling them to work at the interface of mathematics, life, and physical sciences. The principal investigator will also teach and mentor undergraduate students with an emphasis on applications of mathematics to other disciplines. <br/><br/>Free boundary problems such as the Stefan, Hele-Shaw, and Muscat problems have received significant attention since they are challenging from a mathematical point of view and important for applications. The focus of this project is on rigorous analysis of recently developed free-boundary partial differential equation (PDE) models of active gels (gels in a non-equilibrium state). These models are governed by nonlinear PDEs, unlike classical free boundary problems and most recent tumor growth models.  The principal investigator will perform rigorous analysis of the existence and stability of stationary state, traveling wave, and rotating solutions by developing novel analytical tools for bifurcation analysis in the free boundary setting. The stability of these solutions is crucial for biophysical applications since it allows one to distinguish stable states from unstable ones that are rarely observed in experiments. The project will demonstrate that linearized stability analysis of these solutions is typically inconclusive, and new techniques for genuine nonlinear stability analysis will be developed based on construction of novel energy (Lyapunov type) functionals for free boundary problems with nonlinear PDEs.  Analytical and numerical results will be compared to experimental observations of single cells and cell aggregates. A long-term goal is to provide theoretical understanding of migration of cells that drives important biological processes, for example, wound healing and the invasion of cancerous tissues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These image construction problems generally involve large and complex systems. The PI will build on recent theoretical breakthroughs to construct reduced systems which allow for more straightforward and efficient mapping of the data to the unknown physical quantities.  The novel usage of the reduced models will for the first time allow for the generation of internal physical fields from exterior data only, providing a bridge to a broader range of modalities and experimental settings. Once the reduced model is generated from a small data set, the interior fields can be found for an arbitrarily large data set or for data given in other formats. The knowledge of interior fields greatly simplifies the imaging problems, and for certain applications such as medical ablation, it is the interior fields themselves that are of interest.   Several students will be trained in the course of this research, including two full time Phd students. Undergraduate students will work for six months full time on this research problem as their co-op training. The PI continues to have a clear commitment to diversity in mathematics and will make every effort to involve women and/or underrepresented minorities in the co-op experience.<br/><br/>The PI will generate new reconstruction methods and develop further theories which are crucial in medical imaging, remote sensing and nondestructive testing. The main goals are to (i) use reduced order models to generate interior solutions from boundary data, (ii) use these boundary data generated interior solutions to solve inverse problems for larger classes of data sets, (iii) derive, analyze and apply a new inverse Born series adapted to nonlinearity, and (iv) use boundary corrections and transmission eigenvalues to image periodic and nearly periodic microstructures. A new way of using reduced order models (ROMs) for inverse problems is introduced, that is, by embedding the ROM back into the continuous problem and generating interior fields from boundary data only. Highly accurate interior fields will be used to apply the ROM to large data sets to yield a completely new, fully nonlinear inversion method with low computational cost. Interior fields are of interest in their own right for applications such as medical ablation, and they provide a bridge between classical inverse problems and multi-physics hybrid methods. A crucial orthogonalization step in the procedure will be justified rigorously. New inverse scattering series will allow us to reconstruct nonlinear scatterers without the use of optimization or forward solvers except for that of the reference medium. We will analyze the series, show convergence estimates, and fully understand the series behavior. For microstructured media, asymptotics of the forward solution will enable us to capture fine scale features. Boundary corrections will be used to image the media along with transmission eigenvalues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Uncertainty in transmission rates and the outcomes of social distancing, ""shelter-at-home"" executive orders, and other interventions have created unprecedented challenges to the United States health care system. This project will address these issues directly using advanced mathematical modeling from dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and networks. The mathematical models, which are formulated with the specific features of COVID-19 in mind, will provide insights that are critical to people on the front lines who need to make recommendations for intervention strategies and human-behavior patterns to best mitigate the spread of this disease in a timely manner. The project will train a postdoctoral scholar, a PhD student, and two undergraduate students in the research needed to solve these complex problems. <br/><br/>The standard approach for epidemic modeling, at the community scale and larger, is compartmental models in which individuals are in one of a small number of states (for example, susceptible, infected, recovered, exposed, latent), with individuals moving between states. The COVID-19 epidemic can be modeled in this way, with resistance as part of the dynamics. The simplest examples of such models for large populations are coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the fraction of a population in each of the states. To model the stochasticity of infection and latency, models with self-exciting point processes can be fit to real-world data. This project compares the dynamical systems and stochastic models of relevance to COVID-19 transmission. The models also incorporate network structure for the transmission pathways. The project extends prior research on contagions on multilayer networks by incorporating multiple transmission methods and coupling between the spread of the contagion itself and human behavior patterns.

In many data analysis applications, the processed data enjoy a natural underlying structure. An important family of structures is known in mathematics as group structures. Intuitively, a group structure means that not only the observed points are valid data points, but also all data points generated by applying some operation to the observed points. Incorporating this structure into data analysis algorithms has the potential to significantly improve their speed and accuracy, which are fundamental challenges in today?s Big Data analysis. In particular, the developed methods have the potential to replace traditional approaches like data augmentation. Exploiting group structure in data analysis has been largely overlooked, especially in the context of graph-based methods, which are pivotal tools in data analysis due to their robustness to noise and outliers. This NSF-BSF joint project will study group-invariant graph-based methods, which embed the group structure of the data into the processing algorithms analytically. The theoretical merit of the project includes a rigorous analysis of group invariant methods, thus bridging mathematics, statistics, and computations. The impact of the project lies in its applicability to a wide range of applications in high dimensional data analysis. Software developed during the project will be shared publicly. The basic framework of the project and its applications will be made accessible to graduate and undergraduate students, and are suitable as student projects for students from various STEM backgrounds. The results will also provide fresh pedagogical materials for developing courses at the intersection of mathematics, computation and data science. Finally, this joint NSF-BSF project provides a unique opportunity for enhancing collaboration between U.S. and the Israeli research groups, and in particular, establishing connections between young mathematicians from the US and Israel at an early stage of their careers.<br/><br/>The goal of the joint research project is to develop a family of G-invariant graph Laplacian methods, namely, graph Laplacians that are constructed to incorporate group invariance analytically without any data augmentation. Using representation theory, harmonic analysis, numerical analysis, and statistics, the research will develop the mathematical framework for such methods, pursue the theoretical analysis of their performance, develop their associated practical computational algorithms, and demonstrate the resulting methods on several applications in image data analysis. The research agenda consists of four integrated activities: (1) Construct the G-invariant graph Laplacian for general compact groups; (2) Prove the convergence of G-invariant graph Laplacians to the manifold Laplace operator; (3) Derive efficient computational tools for expanding and processing functions using G-invariant graph Laplacians; (4) Apply G-invariant graph Laplacians for data de-noising. The implementation of these goals builds upon and significantly enhances the analytical and computational techniques of graph Laplacian methods that have been developed in the field of computational harmonic analysis for more than a decade. The contribution of the project lies in developing a new paradigm for high-dimensional manifold data learning, and fills the knowledge gap in the current understanding of graph-based methods.

Volatile liquids play fundamental roles in numerous settings spanning natural and biophysical systems to engineering and industrial processes such as printing and painting.  Models for evaporation and condensation are crucial for many applications where such slow processes can shift systems into different operating conditions, as in evaporation of the tear film on the human eye for people with dry-eye syndrome.  Whether the dynamics maintain the liquid as a uniform layer or drive break-up into many droplets can have major consequences. Volatile liquid films can be used in cooling systems for high-power electrical or mechanical equipment. Heat transfer through uniform fluid layers is known to be less efficient than transfer through comparable arrays of droplets. Hence, optimizing the performance of such systems involves reliably controlling the behavior of the fluid film.  While there have been extensive studies of evaporation leading to simple models for the drying of uniform liquid layers and shrinking of individual droplets in many contexts, there are gaps in applying the models uniformly to broader settings.  This work seeks to build a systematic understanding of the dynamics that can result from the interaction of evaporation competing with wetting effects for fluids on solid surfaces.  In addition to presenting results from this project in journals targeting broader audiences in fluid dynamics and engineering, the PI will use the project to incorporate new techniques into training in applied mathematics.  Parts of the project will be used in the PI's courses on mathematical modeling and fluid dynamics. The project will also serve as the focus for the PI's continuing track record in the training of graduate students and providing research experiences for undergraduates.<br/><br/>This research will use numerical simulations and analytical approaches from applied mathematics to develop a better understanding of the long-time dynamics of evaporating layers of viscous liquids.  A lubrication model with an evaporative flux will be used to describe the evolution of the height profile of thin films of viscous fluids. The governing equation is a fourth-order nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation describing wetting effects generating phase separation (sometimes called de-wetting instabilities) between droplets and thin layers while fluid mass is lost or gained due to phase change from the surrounding vapor phase. Recent results have shown that there is a critical range of parameters where the influence of substrate properties can dramatically change the course of the dynamics between the two long-time attracting behaviors: evaporation of droplets down to a minimal adsorbed film or condensation yielding growing thicker layers. Mathematical analyses for many aspects of the study of mass-conserving unstable thin film models have been well-developed using techniques from partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamics, and related models in materials science.  However, introducing evaporation into the problem fundamentally changes key properties of the solutions of the model and necessitates the development of new extensions of previous methods or other novel approaches.  The long-term goal of the project is to develop asymptotic models for the evolution of arrays of interacting volatile droplets. Obtaining this kind of coarsening model will involve new challenges as the quasi-steady framework underpinning the mass-conserving model no longer directly applies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Better techniques to estimate the probability of rare events and extremes are of obvious benefit to society, and will lead to better planning for floods, heatwaves, and other exigencies. Prediction from computer simulations or from real world data is an extremely challenging task. Brute force simulations by computer are often not feasible; the number of computer simulations it requires to obtain accurate estimates of the probability and form of rare events is too high for this to be a useful method in practice. In addition to this, we typically lack sufficient data to make confident predictions about rare events and extremes from climate records. Two strands of research will be developed. First, to develop a rigorous understanding of a technique from probability called importance sampling in simple mathematical models with the aim to have a firm foundation for their implementation in more realistic and complicated climate models. Importance sampling in a sense makes rare events less rare and allows reliable estimates of rare events in situations where brute force simulations are not feasible. Second,   a statistical technique called extreme value theory will be developed in order to allow better estimates of the probabilities of the duration of extremes, such as heatwaves, from climate models and data.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators will develop a technique from importance sampling called genealogical particle analysis to speed up sampling by making rare events more common. The steps enabling the speedup may be tracked and accounted for to obtain more accurate estimates of rare events with less computational effort. Extreme value theory for physical observables such as temperature, wind velocity and energy for climate models will be developed and tested on simple climate models and extended to determine the probability of the duration of extremes, such as heatwaves, from time series data. Clustering algorithms based on information theory will be developed to sort data from spatially distinct sites to amplify the data available to better predict, for example, heatwaves and cold spells.

Unstable states arise frequently in applied problems as system parameters are changed or new species are introduced into the problem. The subsequent dynamics are often dominated by the formation of moving interfaces called invasion fronts that propagate into the unstable state at fixed speed and select some secondary state in their wake. This proposal is built around expanding knowledge of these processes with a specific goal of elucidating mechanisms leading to the emergence of invasion fronts and then leveraging this knowledge to make predictions in actual systems of interest.  One portion of this work will develop new mathematical approaches to study the effect of localized forcing on the spreading speed of interfaces in partial differential equation (PDE) models. The second portion will develop predictions and general principles for the dynamics of instabilities spreading over complex networks.  <br/> <br/>Two complementary avenues of research are proposed.  One area of proposed work concerns stability of invasion fronts with a focus on understanding the role of external forcing in the selection of the inter-facial velocity and subsequent dynamics. Since invasion fronts propagate into unstable states, stability analysis requires perturbations of these fronts to be sufficiently localized. This proposal will study problems where the forcing function is also localized, but not sufficiently localized to fit into the stability framework of the homogeneous equation. Success in carrying out the projects described will lead to new mathematical approaches to the study of stability of traveling waves and will clarify and explain some novel phenomena that will be of interest to researchers working in applied problems.  A second area of proposed work concerns invasion fronts where space is taken to be a complex network with local dynamics occurring at each node with coupling between nodes via a graph Laplacian. The goal here is to leverage knowledge of front propagation in the PDE setting to make concrete predictions related to the spread of instabilities over networks.  Applications include the spread of global epidemics and that of invasive species in discrete environments. Successful completion of this work will provide researchers working in this area with new tools to estimate arrival times, provide a rigorous theoretical framework by which to understand these spreading phenomena and provide insight into the way features of complex networks influence arrival times of invasions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The simulation of such systems is only possible via some approximations, the so-called mean-field limits, since many-body systems can contain an enormous number of particles. The mathematical justification of mean-field limits, starting from the many-body systems they are supposed to describe, is therefore an issue of fundamental scientific importance. The investigator will address questions arising from the study of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), the state of matter of a diluted gas of bosons cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero.

Since prospecting by (almost) stationary fields (electromagnetic or gravitational) is severely ill-posed, he plans to find how many parameters of a source, a medium, or an obstacle can be identified in a stable way and what is the minimal amount of the data needed. When prospecting by stationary waves of higher frequencies, a goal is to achieve a better stability without convexity conditions on the locations of unknown objects and sensors and to use needed analytically a priori constraints as penalty/regularizing terms to design effective  numerical methods. A particular goal is to improve the electrical impedance tomography by 1) finding what is the best resolution at low frequencies and the optimal number and location of sensors to get this resolution and 2) determining how this resolution improves with higher frequency by using the complete Maxwell system and what are limitations  due to the  attenuation. Another research plan is to consider more complicated and realistic basket options and to design faster and more reliable methods for finding volatility from the market data.  To better understand and properly use stability one needs a substantial modification of available methods and new ideas. One of the challenges is to demonstrate the uniqueness and Lipschitz stability of an inclusion in gravimetry or in the electrical impedance tomography from a minimal boundary data. Another challenge is to show better stability for acoustic or electromagnetic sources without standard geometrical (convexity) assumptions.

Since the number of particles is usually very large one would like to understand qualitative and quantitative properties of such systems of particles through some macroscopic, averaged characteristics. In order to identify macroscopic behavior of multi-particle systems, it is helpful to study the asymptotic behavior when the number of particles approaches infinity, with the assumption that the limit will approximate properties observed in the systems with a large finite number of particles. An example of an important phenomenon that describes such macroscopic behavior of a large system of particles is the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is a state of the matter of a dilute Bose gas at very low temperatures when the gas moves as a single particle. Although the BEC was predicted in early days of quantum mechanics by Bose and Einstein, the first experimental realization came in 1995 (subsequently recognized by a Nobel Prize in physics in 2001). Mathematical models have been developed to understand such phenomena.  Those models connect large quantum systems of interacting particles and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) that are derived from such systems in the limit of the number of particles going to infinity. However there are still many challenging problems on both ends, that could benefit  from an interdisciplinary perspective, and the Principal Investigator will work on these. The PI will continue to explore diverse ways to disseminate the knowledge obtained from the proposed projects via designing and teaching new courses (e.g. the PI designed and taught multiple courses for graduate students at summer schools), training and mentoring graduate students and postdocs, and via organizing as well as attending seminars and research meetings.problems. <br/> <br/>With fundamental works on derivation of effective equations from quantum many body systems (e.g. nonlinear Schrodinger equation) and effective equations from classical many particle systems (e.g. Boltzmann equation) a new channel of communication between mathematical physics and nonlinear PDE communities has opened, contributing to advances in both areas. In particular, recently remarkable progress has been achieved in the rigorous derivation of nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equations from quantum systems of interacting bosons. Motivated by that progress, about a decade ago, the PI and her colleague Chen started studying connections between quantum many particle systems and NLS equation,  and consequently together with their collaborators (including 11 PhD students and 3 postdocs) they developed the program  of studying quantum many particle systems via ideas and techniques that originated in the context of 1 particle nonlinear PDE, namely the NLS.  In the current project, the PI and collaborators will significantly expand the span of the above program to include: derivation of qualitative aspects of nonlinear PDE, such as being Hamiltonian or integrable, and Analysis of classical systems of particles that lead to new kinetic equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contemporary practice of  computational optimization is, however, too often divorced from its classical mathematical roots. The scholarship and fast computational technology that has matured from decades of research on smooth optimization has had huge applied scientific impact.  It is well known that behind any superlinear acceleration always lurk Newtonian ideas.  By contrast, while an elegant and powerful theory of nonsmooth optimization has also matured, nonsmooth computational practice appears far more challenging.  Without explicit algebraic structure, practitioners resort to black-box algorithms, convenient but slow. Despite much research, effective Newtonian ideas have remained conspicuously absent. The PI bridges this disciplinary chasm, bringing to bear expertise in the requisite mathematics of ""nonsmooth"" phenomena beyond the reach of traditional calculus, while developing algorithms with dramatic potential impact. Cornell doctoral students engage widely in the project, on foundations and computing, publishing and presenting at conferences, and collaborating with the PI through seminars  and teaching.  Cornell's Operations Research program trains doctoral students (typically one third of whom are women) for both academia and industry, striving to support underrepresented minorities. The PI will disseminate this research through graduate texts, broad-audience surveys, diverse collaboration, and international lectures for audiences across science and engineering.<br/><br/>This structure dilemma in nonsmooth optimization is, however, a false dichotomy, and one that Newtonian ideas can transform.  The PI pursues a semi-structured middle ground, fertile for fast algorithms.  Even without explicit presentations, concrete objectives typically boast a rich inherent variational-analytic structure, well approximated by computationally-amenable nonsmooth models.  The project's attack is two-pronged:  ""partly smooth"" structure drives a Newtonian alternating-projection-inspired method for variational inequalities, while the availability of approximating models drives an innovative ""bundle Newton"" algorithm that shows early computational promise.  Fundamental to this project is the development of such methods into robust practical algorithms with sound theoretical foundations.  Immediate target applications include moderately-sized models, from robust control, for example.  However, such second-order ideas could also accelerate larger-scale first-order methods for signal processing, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics.  The PI leverages the exciting interplay between variational analysis and more classical mathematical domains:  semi-algebraic geometry, in particular, serves as an illuminating arena for ""concrete"" objectives, and matrix spectral analysis offers a rich computational testbed for nonsmooth ideas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A pattern typically refers to a regular, repeating geometric structure, and examples abound in many different scientific domains, such as striped convection rolls in fluids, spiral-seed arrangements on a sunflower, and differentiation in mammalian embryos in early stage gastrulation. In both natural and man-made settings, spatial growth processes have proven to be powerful tools for organizing and harnessing such pattern-forming mechanisms, while at the same time suppressing the formation of imperfections, commonly known as defects. This project seeks to rigorously understand the interaction of growth and patterns in mathematical models arising in various areas such as chemistry, material science, fluid dynamics, and biology, and used to study phenomena such as skeletal patterning in animals, quenching of eutectic metal alloys, evaporative chemical deposition, and defect suppression in elastic surface crystals. Such an understanding could also aid in the fabrication of novel and functional materials at macro-, micro, and nano-meter length scales, giving a cookbook for creating a desired structure. A facet of this project incorporates research experience opportunities for undergraduates.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop and implement new techniques in infinite-dimensional dynamical systems theory and functional analysis to rigorously study growth in prototypical partial differential equation models for pattern-formation. It will also explore and illuminate complex phenomena by developing novel numerical approaches to approximate and continue spatially patterned structures in bounded and unbounded domains. To characterize the effect of growth speed and boundary curvature on pattern formation, the project will first focus on quenching inhomogeneities, which allow patterns in a sub-domain and suppress them in the complement. In simple planar quenching, the project will study existence, wavenumber selection, and stability of pattern-forming fronts in multi-dimensional spatial domains. As standard spatial dynamics methods apply here in only limited settings, functional analytic approaches will be developed to deal with the presence of continuous spectrum in bifurcation, perturbation, or continuation schemes for such patterned solutions. With the goal of studying patterns in non-planar quenching geometries, this project seeks to extend the tools of spatial dynamical systems to domains with more than one unbounded spatial direction. The project will also investigate pattern selection and defect formation for other types of spatio-temporal heterogeneity of physical interest, such as slowly-varying parameter ramps, temporally slow but spatially homogeneous quenches, and spatially localized source terms.  In addition to considering existence, stability, and wavenumber selection of patterns, this project will also use modulational techniques to approximate the interactions and defects of selected patterns in terms of the dynamics of simpler, more tractable partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some basic laws governing turbulence were established by Andrei Kolmogorov in his now-famous series of theoretical works published in the 1940s (collectively known as K41 theory). Although highly influential, this theory is not complete: even though some predictions of K41 are remarkably accurate, some are not, pointing to problems in the assumptions underpinning K41. These defects (often referred to as ""intermittency"") are an active subject of study in the physics and engineering communities. Moreover, K41 theory was derived based on empirical observations regarding how turbulent fluids behave. It remains a grand challenge to substantiate any of the K41 predictions directly from the fundamental equations (the Navier-Stokes equations) governing how fluids evolve in time. The far-reaching goal of this project is to address these shortcomings by providing a mathematically rigorous theory that bridges the gap between the fundamental equations governing fluids and the most accurate of the K41 predictions. This will be done by importing and improving on recent advances in random dynamical systems theory. Providing such a mathematical bridge could also potentially shed light on less well-understood aspects of turbulence theory, such as intermittency. The PI will train graduate students specializing in dynamical systems in preparation for this cross-disciplinary research. <br/><br/>More precisely, the aim of this work is to develop mathematical tools with the long-term goal of obtaining a mathematical proof, directly from the Navier-Stokes equations, of the following two empirically observed properties of turbulent fluids: (a) sensitivity with respect to initial conditions (i.e., a positive Lyapunov exponent) and (b) weak anomalous dissipation (i.e., energy in the fluid is dissipated at a constant positive rate even as viscosity is taken to 0 with all other parameters of the fluid experiment held constant). Properties (a) and (b) are interrelated but not exactly the same: property (a) has to do with the separation of nearby trajectories in phase space, while (b) has to do with the so-called energy cascade, a nonlinear ""conveyor-belt""-type effect which transmits kinetic energy in the fluid from low to high Fourier modes until dissipation effects due to viscosity take over. However, progress on one could lead to a better understanding of the other, e.g., property (b) is likely related to the presence of a high-dimensional chaotic SRB attractor for the Navier-Stokes equations, which is only possible if property (a) is true. Towards goal (a), a major mathematical challenge is that it is typically intractably hard to prove that a given dynamical system is chaotic? this is true even for two-dimensional toy models such as the Chirikov-Taylor standard map, which features fundamental coexistence of ordered elliptic-type and chaotic behavior. On the other hand, advances by the PI and others have made considerable progress towards verifying chaotic behavior for systems subjected to stochastic driving, as is typically assumed in models relevant to turbulence. The work in this proposal will extend and enhance these theoretical tools with the ultimate aim of establishing property (a) for realistic fluids models such as the GOY and SABRA shell models as well as for the hyperviscous 3D Navier-Stokes equations in the limit as Reynolds number is taken to infinity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are many types of waves and flows in the ocean: surface gravity waves are the familiar waves that can be observed breaking rhythmically near the shore; internal waves are hidden beneath the surface and take the form of modulations between layers of different water density; ocean eddies are circular currents of water, and finally, turbulence includes myriad types of unsteady movements of water. These different flows span a wide range of length and time scales, ranging from centimeters to thousands of kilometers, and from a few seconds to several years. Crucially, all these flows interact with each other, creating a system of immense complexity whose study remains a major challenge. This project attempts to build a rigorous mathematical theory to characterize the interactions between internal waves and large scale, two-dimensional eddies. The motivation is recent data from physical oceanography, indicating that processes operating on small scales can significantly affect oceanic energy flows on the large scale. The project will contribute to the study of this phenomenon by analyzing how energy is transferred in the reverse direction, from large scale horizontal motions in eddies to small scale isotropic turbulence where the energy of the eddy is dissipated. Additionally, the project will provide research opportunities for postdoctoral scholars.<br/><br/>The interaction of waves and turbulence within a rotating stratified fluid is of crucial importance for the understanding of the ocean and atmosphere dynamics. The project will examine this interaction by employing the hydrostatic rotating Boussinesq equations. The project aims to utilize ideas from the wave turbulence theory on a novel system of partial differential equations that is equivalent to the hydrostatic rotating Boussinesq equations but has the advantage of explicitly separating wave motions from vorticity effects. This PDE system will be used to derive kinetic-like equations that describe the flow of spectral energy density between large scale vortices and internal waves.

Many critical biological phenomena involve fluid-cell interaction or fluid-like behaviors. For example, fertilization of marine animal eggs relies on the transportation of the ambient fluid stream and sardines form large fluid-like swarms to evade predators. The project's principal focus is to develop novel mathematical tools to analyze the various fluid-related or fluid-like effects in these biological phenomena. There are three main topics in this project. The first topic concerns the interaction between the fluid flow and biological phenomena, which is motivated by two experiments in marine animal fertilization and cell embryology. In the first experiment researchers observed optimal fluid speed to maximize the fertilization rate of abalone. The second experiment confirms that the cellular flow helps organ formation at the early stages of the embryos of Drosophila. Fluid mixing effect and fast-spreading effect play important roles in the analysis. These two effects introduce another 'fast diffusion time scale' into the biological system and significantly change the long-time behavior. The principal investigator (PI) plans to develop new mathematical tools that capture the interplay between these fluid phenomena and the biology involved.  The project will provide research training experience for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>A modified hypocoercivity functional, which was applied in the paper by J. Bedrossian and the PI, and detailed spectral analysis, are crucial to derive the 'fast diffusion time scale' in the nonlinear setting. Applying these tools to the biologically relevant models provides deeper understandings of the experiments. The second topic covers the single and multi-species hydrodynamic models of flocking behavior. In these models, the flock of agents converges to a limiting structural state through sharing information among individuals. However, if the agents only share information with their direct neighbors, the flock's limiting behavior is highly nontrivial. The PI plans to develop new tools and bring ideas from spectral graph theory and random graph theory to analyze it. The third topic concerns the growth/blow-up mechanism in fluid mechanics. The PI will study two non-local models related to the generation of small-scale blowup in the fluid motivated by the singular Hou-Luo scenario for the 3D-Euler equation.

A central question of interest is how much trust can be put in the predictions of a given model.  This is crucial when, as it often happens, there are significant uncertainties associated with the nature of the model itself. In this project, the investigators aim to develop a systematic mathematical framework based on the theory of information to address these issues. One focus of the research will be on prediction of the probability of rare (but potentially catastrophic) events. For example, if a given model predicts a catastrophic event to be a 100-year event, how do uncertainties in the model potentially change this prediction?  The investigators will build corresponding stress tests to assess the effects of uncertainties.  The research will also provide systematic tools to train new statistical learning models with data and provide performance guarantees. <br/><br/>This research will focus on the development of the probabilistic foundations of uncertainty quantification for complex systems and on related questions about statistical learning. The overarching goals are to provide computable performance guarantees when there is uncertainty in the model itself as well as to develop trustworthy and reliable inference algorithms. Many different metrics and information theoretic measurements are available to compare probability distributions (for example, the Kullback-Leibler divergence); a unifying theme of the project is to determine, in a principled manner, which method is most appropriate to a specific task. In this context, a task consists of extracting information from the model by evaluating certain quantities of interest, such as average values, variance, probability of some rare event, and so on. Using variational principles, new optimal information inequalities will be derived to address these issues. From a robustness perspective, this allows the design of finely tuned stress tests, that is, to build neighborhoods of models around a given baseline model and to compute worst-case scenarios, in the spirit of the stress tests used by financial institutions to protect against sudden changes under alternative scenarios. In the context of statistical learning, and especially approximate inference, central challenges are 1) to select the right divergence to minimize as means to learn probabilistic models, and 2) to provide performance guarantees for the learning process. The investigators will study these questions with emphasis on the case where the quantities of interest are rare (but potentially catastrophic) events. They will assess the impact of model uncertainty on these catastrophic events and on models with heavy tails. The project aims to provide mathematical foundations for performance guarantees in probabilistic algorithms used in a wide array of problems from materials science, to operations research, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The focus on reliable predictions of extreme and rare events makes the project timely and widely applicable. For example, the robust uncertainty quantification perspective provides worst-case solutions, stress tests, and bias control for safety-critical problems (such as rogue waves in the ocean or power grid failure). Furthermore, probabilistic performance guarantees for approximate inference can make existing black box inference algorithms more trustworthy and transparent in a mathematically systematic manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stochastic portfolio theory is a mathematical framework for analyzing portfolio behavior and equity market structure. It is descriptive as opposed to normative, consistent with observable characteristics of actual portfolios equity markets, and a theoretical tool useful for practical applications. In addition, it provides insights into questions of outperformance and arbitrage of market-structure stability, and of portfolio construction that results in controlled behavior over long-time horizons for purposes of institutional (for example, foundation, endowment, pension) investing. Stochastic control with partial observations arises in the sequential detection of change-points, in signal processing, in finance, in other contexts where learning about unknown parameters, and where dynamic optimization must take place simultaneously and in real time. Optimization problems that involve features of both control and stopping arise, for instance, in tracking models, where one has to stay as close as possible to a certain target by spending fuel, to declare when one has arrived sufficiently close, and then to decide whether to engage the target or not. It also arises in situations where one has to resolve the tension between exploration (learning about unobservable quantities) and exploitation (taking an actions that costs now, but yields benefits later). The third focus of this project, the study of entropic gradient flows, complements the second law of thermodynamics and pertains to phenomena where the entropy of the current configuration, relative to the steady-state, not only decreases as the system approaches equilibrium, but does so in the most efficient manner possible ? the state follows a path of steepest possible descent for the entropy, in terms of an appropriate distance on phase space. This has important implications for the training of neural networks, for gradient descent algorithms in stochastic optimization, and for optimal portfolio liquidation. The award will provide graduate students with the opportunity for research experiences. <br/><br/>The PI will develop a theory of portfolios that does not rely on the existence of equivalent martingale measures and allows the outperformance of one portfolio by another. This theory will be based on local martingale deflators, the optional decomposition theorem, and appropriate functional-analytic tools. It will exclude only very egregious forms of what is commonly called arbitrage, and help develop a simple, streamlined mathematical framework for finance with complete answers to the basic questions of hedging and portfolio optimization. This theory will cover markets with an arbitrary number of assets (such as bond markets, or those with splits and mergers), open markets (with a fixed, finite number of companies but of a composition varying with capitalization, such as S&P 500), portfolio constraints, model uncertainty, and market stability via models based on systems of diffusions interacting through their ranks. The PI will work on stochastic optimization problems that combine features of optimal control, stopping, and filtering of unobservable parameters or signals. Such problems are notoriously hard to solve explicitly and little theory exists for them. Finally, the project will explore the full range of applicability for a tool the PI developed recently, using time-reversal and optimal transport techniques: the trajectorial approach to the Otto calculus. The PI will study its relevance for diffusions of McKean-Vlasov type, the training of deep neural networks, and the steepest descent of the relative entropy along flows of Markov processes, including on discrete structures with the help of appropriately weighted Sobolev norms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elastica (elastic materials) are the solid materials which return to their original shape and size after forces applied to them are removed. If an elastic body is appropriately processed mechanically (e.g. rolled), thermally (cooled non-uniformly during heat treatment), chemically (""nitrided"" through surface absorption of nitrogen) or exposed to inhomogeneous growth, stresses and strains may develop in the body at equilibrium, leading to the material that has been prestrained (strained in advance). A characteristic which singles out the quality of prestraining in a body is that even in the absence of exterior forces the body assumes a shape that is radically different from the same body without strains. This phenomenon has been observed in different contexts: from growing leaves, through liquid crystals (used in various displays), to polymer gels; it is especially significant for materials formed as thin sheets.  With the advancement of wide manufacturing and use of the novel materials in the thin film shape (molecular thin films, nanotubes, perforated domains, engineered gels), it becomes especially important to gain a theoretical insight on how to relate the prestrain with the elastic energy stored in the body. Attaining such a theoretical insight is the overarching objective of this project. One of applications of this research is controlling the structural properties of the desired final product through fine-tuning its manufacturing conditions. This project includes opportunities for the research training of students at various educational levels and disseminating obtained results to research communities of mathematicians and engineers. <br/><br/>The project has theoretical as well as applied aspects, representing contributions to mathematical analysis, differential geometry, calculus of variations, materials science, and engineering design.

Further, the curvature constraints obtained in the process of dimensionally reducing the energy of a prestrained thin film and corresponding to different energy and regularity of deformations regimes, will be studied. This includes the rigidity and flexibility of Holder-continuous solutions to the quadratic Monge-Ampere system in arbitrary spatial dimensions.

They are expected to radiate energy away in the form of gravitational waves (as detected by LIGO) and settle to a stationary state. Most mathematical models used in the study of such evolution of black holes do not consider any matter or energy field present in the spacetime: more precisely, they only assume the presence of the gravitational field. This is called the case of the vacuum Einstein equation. Even though the vacuum Einstein equation already presents many difficulties from the mathematical point of view, they hardly represent a complete picture about the physics involved. In order to obtain a realistic model for astrophysical black holes, matter fields should be added to the Einstein equation to model the surrounding of the black holes. This research is aimed at the study of black hole stability both for the vacuum Einstein equation and for the coupled equations with electromagnetic radiation.<br/> <br/> <br/>The plan of this research is to create a rigorous and systematic approach to understand the interaction of gravitational radiation with other matter fields present in astrophysical objects. We plan to consider the interaction between gravitation and electromagnetic fields, governed by the Maxwell equations, and develop a rigorous and clear understanding of their interactions. Our approach is based on the Teukolsky formalism. The Einstein-Maxwell equation has many features in common with the vacuum Einstein equation, but also presents new substantial difficulties related to the coupling of the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions.  One of the difficulties is to identify gauge-invariant quantities which transport electromagnetic and gravitational radiation and derive the partial differential equations they satisfy. We then plan to be able to generalize the main ideas in dealing with those interactions to other matter systems, like Einstein-Vlasov, null dust or complex scalar, which are of fundamental importance in astrophysical systems. In general, in the case of the Einstein equation coupled with matter fields, we expect to obtain coupled hyperbolic PDEs with sources which interact one with another.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The event will take place at Peachtree Westin Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia, June 4-9, 2020. This series of biennial conferences has a 26-year history; it is organized under the American Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS). The conference has focus in the growing field of analysis and applied analysis with emphasis on dynamical systems, differential equations, and applications. The conference will foster international collaborations between researchers in these fields. It features a large number of presentations by graduate students and female mathematicians and scientists.<br/><br/>While modern mathematics now encompasses a vast range of topics, dynamical systems and differential equations have retained their central role because of the wide variety of applications ranging from the traditional areas of physics and engineering to the more recently developed and growing applications in biology, chemistry, ecology, physiology, economics and finance. Thus, the study of differential equations and dynamical systems has been a core component in our understanding of many natural phenomena. The program includes over 90 special sessions, that cover a variety of topics such as: data science, Navier-Stokes equations and fluid mechanics, topological and variational methods, mathematics of chemotaxis, biological systems analysis, progress on the n-body problem, and stochastic partial differential equations, among others.

Examples of these successes include the introduction of the JPEG standard for compression of photographic images, advances in phaseless reconstruction, and compressed sensing, e.g., the construction of single pixel cameras.  At the core of this progress is a better understanding of the redundancy inherent in many data generated in our daily lives.  Frame theory can be viewed as one of the appropriate paradigms to investigate and model redundancy.  The investigators use frame theory to study two classes of problems whose solutions could have significant applicability in quantum information theory.  Because some of the mathematical problems taken up in this project are related to engineering problems, their solutions could lead to advances in signal processing and technological infrastructure, as well as broaden the understanding and role of frames in applications.<br/><br/>The investigators study the Zauner conjecture in quantum information theory and the HRT (Heil-Ramanathan-Topiwala) conjecture in time-frequency analysis.  They observe that the Zauner conjecture is a special case of the HRT conjecture in the setting of rank-one finite-dimensional time-frequency matrices, and use that relationship initially for the transference of current technology for each conjecture.  The theory of frames plays a fundamental role in formulating and understanding the problems the investigators examine here.  The notion of the coherence of finite sets of vectors is an important quantitative measure necessary to make technical progress in solving these problems, especially as regards understanding the role of maximal incoherence that such sets may have.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order for a distributed system to be able to perform high-level tasks that may go beyond the capability of an individual agent, the system must first solve a ""clock synchronization"" problem to establish a shared notion of time. The study of clock synchronization (or coupled oscillators) has been an important subject of research in mathematics and various areas of science for decades, with fruitful applications in many areas including wildfire monitoring, electric power networks, robotic vehicle networks, large-scale information fusion, and wireless sensor networks. However, there has been a gap between our theoretical understanding of systems of coupled oscillators and practical requirements for clock synchronization algorithms in modern application contexts. This project will develop systematic approaches for bridging this gap based on combinatorial and probabilistic methods. The use of discrete oscillators will be a key thread in developing more robust and efficient clock synchronization algorithms, extending the current proof techniques for convergence guarantee, and providing a foundation for a data-driven approach to the clock synchronization problems.  This project will also include interdisciplinary collaboration and research opportunities for students at all levels <br/><br/>One of the key difficulties in analyzing the behavior of coupled oscillators lies in the cyclic hierarchy in the phase space. A widely used observation in the literature is that, if all initial phases are concentrated in an open half-circle, such a cyclic hierarchy disappears and we have robust synchronization results in various settings. Hence deriving global synchronization from arbitrary initial configurations not only warrants self-stabilization of the clock synchronization algorithm under arbitrary perturbation, but also addresses the theoretical limitation of such a half-circle condition. By extending techniques such as local concentration and adaptive pulse-coupling scheme due to the PI, the project aims at deriving global synchronization from an arbitrary initial configuration on undirected finite trees, for non-identical natural frequencies and non-zero propagation delay of signals with optimal bounds on convergence time. The convergence result will be extended to arbitrary graphs by combining with a spanning tree algorithm, and the composite algorithm will be implemented as a fast and resource-minimal clock synchronization algorithm for modern wireless sensor networks. This project will also include interdisciplinary collaboration and research opportunities for students at all levels. In particular, some of the projects involve generating a large database for the collective behavior of some models of discrete coupled oscillators on finite graphs, and applying machine learning techniques to extract key features of the pair of network topology and initial configuration that guarantee synchronization. The project will provide students with research experiences ranging from dynamical systems to computer science and machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
