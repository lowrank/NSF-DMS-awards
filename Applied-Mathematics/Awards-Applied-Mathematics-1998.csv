It is one of   very few nonlinear equations that: (i) is completely integrable and admits   ""soliton"" solutions;  (ii) involves two spatial dimensions plus time; and   (iii) arises naturally in  physics.  Specifically, the equation describes   approximately the motion of ocean waves in shallow water.  (Ocean waves   require two spatial dimensions because they occur on the water's   two-dimensional surface.)  For this application, the most interesting   solutions  are either exactly or approximately periodic, just as typical   ocean waves are approximately periodic.  Based on recent discoveries of the   mathematical structure of this equation, we can now solve this problem as   an initial-value problem for initial data that are either exactly or   approximately periodic in space.  The work to be carried out in this study   will exploit this structure to build an accurate model of waves in shallow   water.  The waves in the model will be as complicated as waves in the   ocean usually are: steady or unsteady, with either exact or approximate   periodicity in time or in space or both, with arbitrarily large amplitudes,   and with fully two-dimensional spatial patterns.  No other functioning   model of water waves includes all of these features simultaneously, so this   model should vastly improve our ability to predict waves in shallow water.      Nonlinear phenomena occur when a perturbation to a system triggers  a response that is not proportional to the perturbation.  Many of the   dramatic events in nature are nonlinear, including the ""big bang""  in   cosmology, sonic booms in aerodynamics, hurricanes and breaking ocean waves   in geophysics.  The mathematical models used to describe these phenomena   are intrinsically nonlinear, and typically we cannot solve them in any   general sense.   The set  of models that admit ""solitons"" and are   ""completely integrable"" are exceptions to this rule: usually these models   can be solved in complete detail, and they have provided great insight into   the nature of nonlinear wave phenomena.  The work to be carried out in this   study will exploit recently a discovered mathematical structure of one of these   completely integrable models to build an accurate and realistic model of   ocean waves in shallow water.  Practical implications of more accurate   predictions of shallow water waves include better control of beach erosion,   fewer problems with shoreline pollution from dispersal of man-made waste,   and better design of offshore structures like oil platforms."

Recent results by Alabau and <br/>Komornik have shown that such a system is uniformly stable if the domain <br/>is a sphere.  If the system is isotropic, the PI has obtained uniform stability <br/>for more general domains.  Thus, the goal is to obtain the best of both:  <br/>Uniform stability of an anisotropic system on a more general domain. <br/>Techniques involved in the proof include sharp traces regularity estimates, <br/>obtained through the use of microlocal analysis.  Of particular interest is <br/>the need for unique continuation for the anisotropic system.  Secondly, <br/>exact controllability results even under the assumption that the system is <br/>isotropic are problematic. While a few results exist, in most cases the <br/>proofs are not accessible beyond a specialized audience or the geometric <br/>restrictions are extremely stringent.  An approach based on the use of <br/>Carleman type estimates, which allow higher order coupling terms to be <br/>considered, is considered for both Dirichlet or Neumann boundary <br/>conditions.  Finally, further applications of sharp trace regularity results <br/>are seen in the case of cylindrical shells.  A particular question of interest <br/>is whether the stability properties are robust with respect to the thickness <br/>of the shell.<br/><br/>Exact controllability, i.e., the ability to drive a system to a desired state, is <br/>an important question arising in engineering. Random or uncontrolled <br/>vibrations which may occur can lead to serious consequences.  From <br/>witnesses to the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge to a businessman <br/>bothered by distortion on his cellular phone, almost everyone has <br/>experienced the effects of a lack of control.  If a system is uniformly <br/>stable, any undesired vibrations can be damped out through an appropriate <br/>choice of input, e.g., through a direct force or torque along the boundary <br/>of the object.  Investigations in this project focus on the theoretical aspects <br/>of control when an elastic body is assumed to be composed of more than <br/>one material or is nonuniform.<br/>"

It is a model of  a simple lake, a laboratory version of the commercial  bio-reactor, and the starting point for models of waste water  treatment and models of the mammalian intestine.  Microorganisms  compete for an input nutrient in an exploitative manner.  The  equations governing the model take the form  of systems of  nonlinear ordinary or partial differential equations.  In this  project, the investigator adds new features to the basic model in  order to make it more realistic.  This complicates the equations  and hence the mathematical analysis.  Specifically, the effects of  wall growth, diffusion, transport, inhibitors (natural and  external), and plasmid dynamics on the outcome of the competition  are to be studied.  The goal of the mathematical analysis is to  identify the global asymptotic behavior of the solutions to these  equations in terms of the system parameters (measurable or  operational parameters).       Inhibitors occur naturally (for example, anti-competitor  toxins) or as pollutants.  Growth of microorganisms on the wall  (or other surface) can impede the efficiency of a biochemical  reactor or contaminate any flow process.  The asymptotic analysis  of such problems can lead to a better understanding of natural  phenomena or of reactor technology.  Knowledge of this behavior  allows one to predict the outcome of a fixed (i.e., natural)  environment or to control the outcome in the case of an  artificial (commercial) environment.

Ronnie Sircar    In financial mathematics, a methodology (due to Black and Scholes)  exists for pricing and hedging against the risk of derivative  securities (eg. options) on stocks when the volatility of the stock is  constant. However, it is widely believed that volatility has a random  component and must be described by a suitable stochastic model. This  project aims to produce a statistical description of stock volatility  dynamics using historical price data, and to combine it with an  asymptotic analysis of the partial differential equation for  derivative prices to infer the market's view of probable future stock  movements, and in particular, whether this view has become more  pessimistic since the 1987 crash. The analysis will exploit the  discrepancy in time-scales of fluctuation between the Brownian motion  driving the stock price process and the volatility stochastic process.    The spectacular growth in the size of the derivatives market over the  last twenty years (currently it has a turnover of trillions of dollars  in the US) plus recent infamous (and equally spectacular) risk  (mis)management disasters such as the Barings and Orange County  fiascos, have created an urgent need for good mathematical and  computational models to quantify the respective risks and rewards of  such investments. This project aims to build on the Nobel Prize  winning methodology of Black, Scholes and Merton, to take into account  the fluctuating nature of market volatility.

In particular, research is proposed in the following areas: integrable   Hamiltonian systems in finite- and infinite-dimensions, the stabilization   and control of nonlinear mechanical systems, the analysis and control of   nonholonomic systems with constraints, the optimal control of systems   with constraints, and the dynamics and control of infinite-dimensional   systems and systems with complex dynamics. The proposer will analyze   two basic classes of integrable systems -- the Toda lattice in finite- and   infinite-dimensions, and the generalized rigid body equations. The   proposer's view of these systems is inspired by work in applied analysis --   optimization and control problems. The proposer will also investigate the   dynamics of nonholonomic systems. Such systems, which are mechanical   systems subject to nonintegrable constraints such as rolling, are not   Hamiltonian in general but nonetheless conserve energy. This leads to   very rich behavior including the possibility of asymptotic stability. With   his collaborators the proposer has been developing an energetic approach   to the control of nonlinear mechanical systems which leaves the system in   classical Lagrangian form despite the presence of feedback. This enables   the classical theory of stability, which is normally applied to autonomous   systems, to be applied to classes of controlled systems. Several other   problem in the control and dynamics of finite- and infinite-dimensional   systems are discussed, such as the analysis of the structure and stability of   interconnected systems including linked finite- and infinite-dimensional   systems.    In broad terms the proposer will study the behavior and control of various   mechanical systems that are important in physics and engineering.   Engineering applications include aerospace systems and robotics.  He will   study certain model systems that can be solved explicitly. Such systems   are important for the light they shed on the behavior of more complicated   systems which can only be simulated on a computer. He will also consider   the optimization of the behavior of various mechanical control systems.   This optimization is important not only for obtaining desirable system   behavior but for reducing cost. He will study various methods for   controlling the motion of such systems as robots and satellites. In the   modeling of satellites he will consider the importance of flexible   appendages such as antennae in the stability of their motion. He will also   analyze the motion of systems in fluids -- for example the motion of   underwater vehicles. In general the hope is to obtain a better   understanding of the dynamics and control of a large class of engineering   and physical systems."

Coupled oscillator models may <br/>result from coupling individual laser devices or from a modal <br/>decomposition of a multimode laser. For the models under consideration, <br/>the amplitude of the oscillations is an important dynamical variable; this is <br/>in contrast to limit-cycle oscillators where the amplitude is often slave to <br/>the phase, hence reducing the dimension of the dynamical system. Thus, <br/>even if the system maintains a desired phase-locked state, amplitude <br/>instabilities can limit the usefulness of the device in certain parameter <br/>regimes. Also of importance is that the use of lasers as a component of a <br/>communications system requires actively modulating the laser output. <br/>Dissipation is typically very weak, so excitation can lead to long <br/>undesirable transients or to sustained chaos. Thus, the effect of excitations <br/>ranging from periodic to impulsive must be well understood. Finally, the <br/>laser models are highly singular due to time scales ranging from <br/>milliseconds to nanoseconds; this provides both analytical and numerical <br/>challenges in their study. The investigator will apply such tools as <br/>asymptotic analysis, local and global bifurcation theory, and numerical <br/>simulation and data analysis techniques to investigate modulation effects, <br/>amplitude and phase control, and localization dynamics in coupled solid-<br/>state lasers and multimode fiber lasers.<br/><br/>Coupled lasers are being used in applications such as space <br/>communications, optical interconnects, fiber-optic communications, and <br/>optical beam steering. Some important design goals of coupled laser <br/>systems are to obtain higher output intensity of the system or achieve <br/>beam steering. The problems investigated in this proposal will further the <br/>understanding of these often unstable systems and lead to the achievement <br/>of control of the desired laser output. Furthermore, wide-ranging system <br/>configurations and many different coupling mechanisms (ranging from <br/>nearest neighbor, to non-local, to global) allow this work to aid not only <br/>laser technology, but also the study of coupled oscillators appearing in <br/>other applications.<br/>"

The long-  time behavior of such perturbed systems, even if the perturbations are purely deterministic,   should be described by a stochastic process on a graph related to the Hamilton function. A   class of asymptotic problems for PDEs, such as the small viscosity asymptotics for the   Navier-Stokes equations in the plane or small diffusion asymptotics for reaction - diffusion   in  an incompressible fluid, are closely related to random perturbations of the Hamiltonian   systems. The probabilistic approach is useful in analyzing these problems.   Long time behavior of dynamical systems perturbed by a stochastic noise is studied   in this project. This type of problem arises in many applications, for example, the long time   behavior of cosmic objects or the motion of a fluid with a small viscosity. The   perturbations, even if they are small, become essential for the long-time behavior of the   system. The asymptotic approach, which the investigator is developing in the project, is   the most promising for analyzing this type of problem."

The structures of interest are induced by internal  characteristics like (chronological or class) age, size, location  or/and by spatial or temporal heterogeneity.  For infectious  diseases that lead to permanent immunity, a model is developed  that allows arbitrary distributions for the lengths of the  various disease stages.  A time scale method is presented that  makes it possible to express the stability of the endemic  equilibrium in terms of the first three cumulants of the  durations of the disease stages.  Further, effects are  investigated that temporarily varying vaccination strategies  (including vaccines with only transient effects) have on seasonal  diseases (influenza).  Optimal treatment strategies are studied  for diseases with resistant strains in populations with core  groups (AIDS, tuberculosis).  As an important tool the  investigator extends the persistence theory for non-autonomous  dynamical systems.  In population ecology, strategies are  considered by which populations cope with spatial or temporal  heterogeneities of their habitats.  In particular, migration  strategies in structured metapopulations and adaptive strategies  like metamorphosis and cannibalism for populations in ephemeral  habitats are investigated that maximize the reproductive ratio.       In order to interpret, forecast, manage and control the  dynamics of microbial, plant, animal and human populations it is  necessary to understand the interaction between population  development and population and habitat structure (as given by age  or body size or by spatial and temporal heterogeneity).  The  investigator develops mathematical concepts and tools to  formulate and analyze appropriate models for this  interdependence.  Particular poi nts of interest are how population  and habitat structure affect stability, resilience, persistence  and extinction of populations.  In the area of infectious  diseases, mathematical models provide a suitable arena to study  various mechanisms that cause seasonal outbreaks (measles,  influenza) and to determine adaptive vaccination strategies that  deal with them in an effective way.  Further, in face of evasive  or resistant microbial strains (AIDS, tuberculosis), it is  possible to compare different disease treatment schedules for  populations with core groups.  As an important issue in  conservation biology, habitat fragmentation leads to the  formation of a patchy environment where local populations often  go extinct and are recolonized by individuals immigrating from  other local populations.  Structured metapopulation models  present a framework to identify the circumstances under which  gradual habitat deterioration leads to a sudden collapse of the  total population and, in turn, to determine critical thresholds  that must be met in order to successfully reintroduce populations  that have become extinct."

They use invariant manifold, bifurcation, and singular  perturbation theories to prove that under certain natural  conditions there is a continuous, noninvertible change of  variables that converts every member of the family into a  canonical model.  They derive canonical models for weakly  connected networks of excitable, oscillatory and bursting  neurons, arising in studies of the thalamus, hippocampus and  neocortex.       Exact equations are rarely known to describe biological  systems.  As a result, various people can use various models for  the same biological system, but obtain contradictory results.  A  reasonable way to resolve this is to study ALL possible models of  the same biological system at once.  The investigators develop and  use state-of-the-art methodologies in system science to show that  if a biological system is near a critical regime, then all its  models are related to a simpler one, called a canonical model.  An  advantage of this approach is that the plausibility of the  canonical model rests only on the plausibility of the critical  regime, but not on the choice of equations describing details of  the biological system.  This approach enables them to derive  simple but exact models for such complex brain structures as the  thalamus, hippocampus and neocortex operating near a critical  regime, such as the onset of rhythmic activity.  These models are  used to study attention, memorization and navigation in behaving  animals.

They use the  cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum as the model system  because it exemplifies both the free-ranging movement of  individual cells and the collective motion of aggregates, and  because it is widely used as a model experimental system for the  study of cell movement.  There is a large body of experimental  data on this system, and several labs have agreed to share their  new data as it becomes available.  Three complementary  subprojects are pursued in parallel.  The first is to investigate  an individual cell-based model that incorporates internal  structure and active force generation and allows the  investigators to evaluate various theoretical proposals for  individual cell movement.  The second involves the formulation of  a higher-level, cell-based model used for analyzing the  collective motion of many cells, and the third employs a  continuum approach in which the cellular system is modeled as a  viscoelastic fluid with contributions to the stress tensor from  both the intracellular stress and the viscoelastic interactions  between cells.  Current information on the movement is used in  the formulation of the models, and the ongoing interaction with  experimental groups provides feedback on the validity of the  models and enables the investigators to suggest experiments to  test the models.  However, what is learned on cell and tissue  movement not only is applicable to Dictyostelium discoideum, but  also can be used in several other contexts, including embryonic  development, wound healing, and the immune system.       Cell and tissue movement plays a vital role throughout the  lifespan of many organisms.  Bacteria and other single-cell  organisms find food and avoid repellents by swimming in favorable  directions,  and cells such as macrophages in the human immune  system must detect sites of infection and move toward them in  order to ingest bacteria and cellular debris.  At the tissue  level, the coordinated movement of aggregates of cells plays a  critical part in such diverse processes as early embryonic  development and wound healing.  Thus it is important to develop a  better understanding of cell movement and its control, both in  the low-density regime where cells move individually, and at  tissue-level densities where cells interact strongly and move  collectively.  Mathematical modeling can play an important role in  understanding these processes by testing hypotheses that are  difficult to test experimentally with current technology.  A  better understanding of how cells and tissues move will lead, for  example, to a better understanding of the formation and control  of bacterial biofilms, which are deleterious in contexts such as  medical transplants, but valuable in contexts such as pollution  control and drug production."

It will focus   on the error estimation of the values of engineering interest as error in the   solution, the gradients (stresses) in the entire domain as well as   subdomains, the values of the functionals, etc.  The upper and lower a-  posteriori bounds will be addressed.

It will focus on the reliable and accurate   a-posteriori error estimations and adaptive procedures in the Finite   Element Method, which are essential for confidence in the computed data.    In this way, various accidents could be avoided.  Although the finite   element method is a major tool in engineering computations, various   important problems are practically unsolvable by the standard approach.    Hence a new generalized flexible finite element method will be designed   with the goal to increase the effectivity of the method when solving   unusually difficult problems. The problem of the composite material with   the focus on the fiber scale is one of these types of problems when   millions of fibers are present with only statistical character in regard to   knowledge of their position.  Here new approaches which are very tight to   the experimental studies are needed and will be addressed."

Mathematically, these systems represent dynamical <br/>systems with many degrees of freedom. The PI will focus on waves in <br/>two-dimensional systems with axial anisotropy. The immediate motivation <br/>is given by recent experiments by G. Ahlers et al. on electroconvection in <br/>nematic liquid crystals, where three interesting regimes have been <br/>observed: 1) extended waves exhibiting spatio-temporally chaotic <br/>dynamics, 2) waves localized into narrow, long patches (`worms'), and 3) <br/>temporally irregular, spatially localized bursting of the wave amplitude. <br/>These phenomena are found immediately above onset at small amplitudes <br/>of the waves. They therefore afford an excellent opportunity to develop <br/>and test mathematical ideas that will be relevant quite generally in weakly <br/>nonlinear theories of dissipative structures. Furthermore, due to the <br/>anisotropy this two-dimensional system can be described systematically <br/>by Ginzburg-Landau-type equations. No recourse to phenomenological <br/>equations of the Swift-Hohenberg-type is needed. The main part of the <br/>project is devoted to the worms. They cannot be described by the <br/>Ginzburg-Landau equations derived by straightforward asymptotic <br/>analysis. The analysis has to be extended to include certain additional <br/>modes that are strictly speaking not on the center manifold but become <br/>relevant already very close to threshold. The main questions to be <br/>addressed are: the localization mechanism of the worms and suitable one-<br/>dimensional reductions (standing- and traveling-wave pulses), the stability <br/>of long worms, and the nucleation of worms from small noise. The project <br/>will demonstrate how in cases like the one described here the qualitative <br/>and quantitative relevance of the weakly nonlinear theory can be <br/>drastically increased by including a single additional mode. This aspect <br/>carries over to a wide range of other systems. On a more specific level, the <br/>advection of a slow mode will be important in other wave systems as well. <br/>At the same time, for the electroconvection system detailed qualitative and <br/>quantitative comparisons with ongoing experiments will be achieved <br/>through close cooperation with the experimentalists.<br/><br/>In wide range of systems spatial structures appear spontaneously. These <br/>patterns can be time-independent or may have the form of traveling or <br/>standing waves. Just a few examples are animal coat markings, waves on <br/>the surface of vibrated fluids, cloud streets, waves in chemical reactions <br/>and in nerve conduction. If the properties of a system are the same over its <br/>whole extent one would usually expect that the patterns also cover the <br/>whole system. However, in quite a number of cases a spontaneous <br/>localization of the pattern in patches or even single wave crests has been <br/>observed. In repeated runs of the same experiment the patches occur in <br/>randomly varying locations. This indicates that their localization is not due <br/>to special properties of the system at that location. Such localized waves <br/>have been observed, e.g., in vibrated granular material, fluid convection in <br/>mixtures, and in nematic liquid crystals. The funded research will <br/>contribute to the understanding of the causes that lead to localization <br/>focussing on the `worms' observed in liquid crystals. It will elucidate the <br/>mechanism in detail and investigate the chaotic bursting of such structures <br/>and how they are generated (nucleated) from weak noise that is due to the <br/>thermal motion in the fluid. Using advanced mathematical methods, the <br/>research will bring out the central features that are relevant more generally <br/>in other systems as well.<br/>"

The proposers have  established striking progress in these areas, and propose here to develop  systematically an effective theoretical and computational methodology for their  study.  The central intellectual challenge in the study of layers and fronts  involves the complex interactions of physical processes with disparate length  scales.  The length scales of key microscopic processes within a layer are  typically orders of magnitude smaller than those of the ambient fluid in which  the layer is embedded, yet they may have a profound effect on the macroscopic  structure of the fluid flow.  For this reason, direct numerical simulation  requires special algorithms to resolve the important layer microstructure  accurately with reasonable computational resources.  The theoretical challenge  is two-fold, as the problem requires scale-up techniques to understand the  effects of the microscopic processes at the macroscopic level, and then methods  to express the nonlinear coupling of distinct physical processes operating on  comparable length scales.  While the study of layers and fronts is at least a  two-scale problem, the interest here is in practical applications, which  usually involve multiple length scales within a layer.  This project will  provide (a) the theoretical and algorithmic basis for a new class of production  codes for the simulation of complex fluid flow and solid deformation; (b) the  theoretical basis for understanding turbulent multiphase flow and fluid mixing;  (c) validation of turbulence and mixing models, through exploration of  parameter regimes in highly resolved simulations that are in step with physical  experiment; and (d) a new mathematical theory for the interaction of nonlinear  hyperbolic waves, including an understanding of phenomena which can in some  cases prevent or overcome the poor perform ance of simulation codes.    When the surface of contact between two distinct materials is unstable, small  random disturbances on the surface will develop into interpenetrating  structures, such as fingers, jets, droplets, and bubbles.  These structures are  complex and chaotic, and together they comprise a ""mixing layer.""  Mixing  layers are of fundamental importance in natural phenomena such as supernova  explosions, and in technological applications such as inertial confinement  fusion (ICF), where they are known to be a major limiting factor in the  performance of ICF capsules.  Typically a mixing layer is embedded in a  large-scale fluid or solid flow, and in this case the precise resolution of a  mixing layer by computer simulation is impractical (if not impossible) if the  computer code is to be used to make quantitative predictions on a regular  basis.  For this reason, a scientific theory is required to capture the  unresolvable microstructure of mixing layers in a macroscopic framework which  is amenable to computer simulation.  The goal of this project is to develop  such a theory and to demonstrate its validity by comparison with computer  simulation and physical experiment.  This work will require new ideas, as  described in this proposal, and will contribute to the fundamental knowledge  base of science, of significance to a broad range of scientific phenomena."

The various issues will  be addressed using an interdisciplinary approach involving analysis,  computation and experiment.  The latter two parts will also involve  input from industrial and geotechnical experts.  Details of each  subproject follow.  Subproject 1, fluctuations in sheared granular  materials: Recent work has shown that fluctuations of forces and to  some extent velocities can be very large for moderate scale systems.  The experimental part of this project will provide additional  quantitative characterizations of these fluctuations for modest scale  slowly sheared systems.  In addition, new experiments will be  constructed of a Couette type that will probe force fluctuations on  larger length and time scales.  These experiments will be integrated  into ongoing work to model force fluctuations by lattice type models,  and computations using novel hybrid molecular dynamics  and finite  element codes. Subproject 2, flow in industrial silos: In collaboration  with engineers at the firm Jenike and Johanson, Inc. the co-PI's of this  project will analyze flows in a spatial region that corresponds to the  shape of a typical hopper.  This analysis will be based both on Coulomb  materials and on  critical state soil mechanics (CSSM).  Some of the aspects  under study will  include an investigation  of the relationship between  CSSM and  Coulomb  models, shock and rarefaction wave solutions, boundary  value problems for  hopper flow, and stability of such solutions.  An  important application  is the design of flow corrective devices.  Subproject 3, liquefaction of soils: This phenomenon corresponds to the  abrupt  loss of load-bearing capacity of a loose, water-saturated soil,  possibly leading to a massive landslide. Real world s oil  failure/liquefaction will be investigated in collaboration with  G. Gudehus and his associates.    This project will combine experiments, mathematical analysis, computer  simulation and industrial/geotechnical expertise to better understand  the flow of granular materials.  The area of study is of considerable  importance to technical processes involving all types of granular  materials, including but by no means limited to chemical process  industries, and to the handling of coal, ores, food grains, and  pharmaceuticals.  Many aspects of the above processes are not fully  understood, leading in some cases to enormous financial losses. Also  under consideration are geotechnical issues such as the stability of  embankments,  as well as the stability of soils under earthquake conditions.  The project will involve the application of existing theories for granular  materials to such fundamental  problems as flows in hoppers and stability  of soils in landfills.  New models will be developed in order to take into  account some important aspects  of granular flows such as fluctuations of  forces. Recent experiments in this lab have shown that fluctuations,  which are not accounted for in existing models,  can be very strong and  may well be necessary to provide safe and reliable design criteria for  industrial devices involving granular flows. The models will be tightly  linked to the experimental data, on the one hand, and, on the other hand,  will be the basis of computer solutions for relevant technical problems."

The PI has shown recently that there is a class of <br/>systems for which no feedback can be found such that the closed-loop <br/>system is exponentially stable.

It is proposed to continue <br/>this investigation to obtain a clear understanding of the systems that can be <br/>asymptotically stabilized. The second objective of the proposed work <br/>deals with the approximation of infinite dimensional systems using <br/>balanced realizations.

Using the connection between the approximation problems in atomic spaces and the filtering paradigm in signal and image processing, he develops and implements fast filtering algorithms for various fundamental processing operators, such as noise reduction, rotation, translation, and general affine transformations.

Many new scanning systems measure several quantities at each point or position within an image rather than a single quantity.  These lists of numbers may represent important physical quantities, such as velocities or displacements, or the amount of light absorbed, reflected, or emitted at different wavelengths at a particular location.  The theory being developed here provides a rational means to represent, process, analyze and compress this data -- a problem which no theory currently treats.  In addition, this work is intended to ameliorate many problems inherent in the measurement of these new types of data sets.  In particular, imaging data are usually corrupted by noise, are discrete rather than continuous, and are spatially averaged.  Finally, because these new imaging modalities can generate vast amounts of data, the algorithms that the investigator implements for representing, processing, analyzing, and compressing the data must be fast and efficient, as well."

The proposal is motivated by recent results on a<br/>remarkable mathematical structure underlying a fundamental problem in<br/>the study of two-dimensional Stokes flow.  Crowdy and Tanveer have<br/>devised a new global theoretical approach to the problem of 2D Stokes<br/>flow which resulted in the identification of an infinity of conserved<br/>quantities associated with a large class of exact solutions for a<br/>simply-connected fluid region, and the discovery of the first-known<br/>exact solutions for doubly-connected fluid regions.  These significant<br/>mathematical results will be developed in various directions.  Of<br/>primary interest is the important and highly non-trivial question of<br/>generalization to three-dimensional Stokes flow.  Preliminary numerical<br/>studies by Nie and Tanveer have shown that axisymmetric (3D) Stokes<br/>bubble exhibits very similar qualitative behavior to its<br/>two-dimensional analogue (e.g. formation of near-cusps and topological<br/>changes).  The results on two-dimensional Stokes flow will be<br/>generalized in various directions.  Exact solutions in regions of<br/>connectivity greater than two is of great interest.  Moreover,<br/>additional physical factors will be studied including electrostatic<br/>(electric fields) and thermo-capillary effects.<br/><br/><br/>The mathematical problems to be studied are of great physical interest<br/>and application. The solutions serve as useful models in the physical<br/>process of viscous sintering. Sintering is a term broadly referring to<br/>the consolidation of an assemblage of particles in which the mass<br/>transport is driven by surface tension and there exists a huge<br/>literature on the subject spanning many disciplines from materials<br/>science to environmental engineering.  Understanding such sintering<br/>processes is very important, for example, in fiber-optic and<br/>opto-electronic technologies.  The study of the boundary evolution of<br/>small blobs of viscous fluid in the presence of an electric field is<br/>crucial for the understanding of ink-jet printing technologies. The<br/>project also has potential biotechnological relevance -- cells<br/>structures and membranes are often modelled as (charged) blobs of very<br/>viscous fluid kept together by surface tension forces on the boundary.<br/>This project will provide an understanding of the mathematics<br/>underlying these important physical models.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Yet, how the representation underlying these powerful visual abilities is organized and acquired is still largely unknown.  The investigator and his colleagues tackle the problem of how the visual cortex learns to represent and recognize novel objects and object classes through a combination of computational, physiological and psychophysical approaches.  The physiological experiments on alert monkeys rely on multielectrode recordings for which the investigators develop a tool kit of appropriate data mining techniques, based in part on their own work on learning and classification algorithms.  In particular, the investigators undertake a multi-disciplinary research project consisting of four interacting components:  i)  Computational modeling of inferotemporal (IT) cortical neurons, extending their previous work on representations of single objects in IT; ii) cortical physiology using multiple electrodes in awake, behaving monkeys trained on between- and within-class classification tasks on novel classes of stimuli; iii) new data mining techniques for processing multiple electrode data, including classification and learning techniques; iv)  visual psychophysics including fMRI studies in humans and monkeys, allowing to relate the findings from monkey physiology to object learning in the human brain.<br/><br/>Understanding learning in the human brain means understanding the very core of intelligence.  Not only is this one of the remaining fundamental challenges in science but it is also one area where even small steps forward will have significant implications for understanding neurological diseases and disorders, and also for the future of computing and machine intelligence.  However, despite enormous progress in the last decade or two, science does not yet know what various areas of the cortex do and how.  Because understanding the brain, the most complex system we know, is a huge endeavor, the present project focuses on understanding a part of cortex, involved in a key and very difficult task in everybody's daily life -- even if subjectively very easy: learning to categorize and recognize visual objects such as faces or cars.  Understanding how brain cells come to represent objects will be a major breakthrough for neuroscience and also for eventually designing machines capable of achieving human-like performance.  More importantly, any significant progress in the specific problem of object recognition will have a major impact on the goals of the KDI program, because it will open the door to understanding broader issues of learning and intelligence in brains and machines.<br/><br/>"

The investigation is composed of three parts:  modeling, analysis, and numerical computation.  Models of particle-fluid motion must determine which physical mechanisms are dominant and which may be neglected without detrimental effect.  In particular, traditional models of these flows treat the particle phase as a fluid-like material with a viscosity that depends on the particle volume fraction.    A significant component of this research program is to study the effects of modeling the particle phase as a frictional material.  Analysis will be primarily directed toward a study of the stability of distinguished solutions to the model equations.  Numerical simulations will provide an understanding of nonlinearity in the equations, especially the effect of the particle phase model.  These complementary methods of investigation will be guided by recent experiments that highlight the need for a new approach to the question of particle-fluid interaction.    The combined flow of particles and fluid has many industrial applications, such as particle coating and drying, particle flow in pressurized vessels and cat-crackers, transport by lubrication, and heat transfer.  New xerographic and metallurgic technology necessitate very fine powders.  In these latter applications, however, as particle size decreases, transport and handling become more difficult, and the effects of interstitial gas become more important.  Without better characterization of particle-fluid flows, products that exploit new technologies may not come on-line as quickly, nor with sufficient reliability.  In this regard, it is useful to note a study by the Rand Corporation showing that, because of an inability to accurately predict powder behavior, solids-producing manufacturing plants performed on average at 63% of design capacity, compared to 84% for liquids-producing plants .  This project will study new mathematical models for the behavior of very fine powders.  The results of this project will be compared with concurrent experimental work by industrial researchers."

The various issues will  be addressed using an interdisciplinary approach involving analysis,  computation and experiment.  The latter two parts will also involve  input from industrial and geotechnical experts.  Details of each  subproject follow.  Subproject 1, fluctuations in sheared granular  materials: Recent work has shown that fluctuations of forces and to  some extent velocities can be very large for moderate scale systems.  The experimental part of this project will provide additional  quantitative characterizations of these fluctuations for modest scale  slowly sheared systems.  In addition, new experiments will be  constructed of a Couette type that will probe force fluctuations on  larger length and time scales.  These experiments will be integrated  into ongoing work to model force fluctuations by lattice type models,  and computations using novel hybrid molecular dynamics  and finite  element codes. Subproject 2, flow in industrial silos: In collaboration  with engineers at the firm Jenike and Johanson, Inc. the co-PI's of this  project will analyze flows in a spatial region that corresponds to the  shape of a typical hopper.  This analysis will be based both on Coulomb  materials and on  critical state soil mechanics (CSSM).  Some of the aspects  under study will  include an investigation  of the relationship between  CSSM and  Coulomb  models, shock and rarefaction wave solutions, boundary  value problems for  hopper flow, and stability of such solutions.  An  important application  is the design of flow corrective devices.  Subproject 3, liquefaction of soils: This phenomenon corresponds to the  abrupt  loss of load-bearing capacity of a loose, water-saturated soil,  possibly leading to a massive landslide. Real world s oil  failure/liquefaction will be investigated in collaboration with  G. Gudehus and his associates.    This project will combine experiments, mathematical analysis, computer  simulation and industrial/geotechnical expertise to better understand  the flow of granular materials.  The area of study is of considerable  importance to technical processes involving all types of granular  materials, including but by no means limited to chemical process  industries, and to the handling of coal, ores, food grains, and  pharmaceuticals.  Many aspects of the above processes are not fully  understood, leading in some cases to enormous financial losses. Also  under consideration are geotechnical issues such as the stability of  embankments,  as well as the stability of soils under earthquake conditions.  The project will involve the application of existing theories for granular  materials to such fundamental  problems as flows in hoppers and stability  of soils in landfills.  New models will be developed in order to take into  account some important aspects  of granular flows such as fluctuations of  forces. Recent experiments in this lab have shown that fluctuations,  which are not accounted for in existing models,  can be very strong and  may well be necessary to provide safe and reliable design criteria for  industrial devices involving granular flows. The models will be tightly  linked to the experimental data, on the one hand, and, on the other hand,  will be the basis of computer solutions for relevant technical problems."

One area of research is the study of high Weissenberg number asymptotics of viscoelastic flows. This concerns the limit when elastic effects are strong. In this case, the mathematical solutions of the equations often show singular features such as singularities at corners and boundary layers at walls and separating streamlines. Failure to resolve these singularities continues to be one of the major impediments towards successful numerical simulation of viscoelastic flows. The proposed research will explore the application of asymptotic methods in this field to clarify the analytical nature of the solution. A second area of the proposed research concerns flow instabilities. Specific problems to be studied are the process of fiber spinning, and the related problems of film casting and film blowing. One aspect of these flows which has received only scant attention in theoretical studies is the liquid to solid transition and the associated dynamics of the freezing point. The proposed research will study this problem with the objective of elucidating stability boundaries and qualitative dynamics as well as basic mathematical issues such as the well-posedness of the free boundary value problem and the relation between stability and spectral properties. Another topic of the proposal is the investigation of the nature of the spectrum which arises in studying the linearized stability of viscoelastic shear flows. Finally, the proposal addresses a question in control of linear elastic solids by imbedded actuators, namely the question which configurations of the boundary can be achieved with certain types of controls. This work is joint with David Russell.               The proposed research in fluid dynamics has significant implications for materials science. In the processing of polymeric liquids, e.g. the manufacture of plastics, the flow of the liquid during processing conditions often has a major impact on the quality and properties of the product. The understanding and simulation of these flows is therefore of importance. The proposal addresses mathematical singularities in the high elasticity limit which pose a major challenge to numerical simulations and need to be resolved at a fundamental level if further progress is to be made. Another aspect of the proposal is the study of flow instabilities. Such instabilities can arise in processing operations where they often lead to unacceptable products. Finally, the proposal addresses new mathematical questions which arises in the study of ""smart"" materials."

In addition, the<br/>performance of macroscopic devices  is challenged by new requirements<br/>on the levels of environmental chemical pollution (NO_x) and sound<br/>pollution.  The improvement in the design of these devices will be based<br/>on a better understanding of the underlying mixing processes.

The latter include general compact sets, but often they are convex bodies, polytopes, star-shaped bodies, or finite sets. One advantage of this setting is that it becomes more probable that inverse problems have a unique solution.  Generally, the a priori knowledge that the unknown object is of uniform density can be exploited to retrieve more information than would otherwise be possible. This can lead to algorithms that are more effective when few measurements are available, and less sensitive to measurement errors or noise. Within mathematics, geometric tomography has links to functional analysis, convex geometry, Minkowski geometry, and combinatorics. The project will focus on several topics in this area and continue the development of geometric tomography begun in two previous NSF proposals. New directions include reconstruction of objects from measurements of volumes of projections onto planes or concurrent sections by planes, stability questions related to sections, and the systematic development of discrete tomography (involving inverse problems concerning finite sets). Examples of proposed techniques are the use of recently discovered Fourier transform formulas and of special bodies defined by $p$th means of metric quantities. Also included is a program designed to stimulate undergraduate research.    CAT scanners are machines that save lives daily. They take X-rays in a number of different directions, and synthesize the information to create an image of a two-dimensional section of part of the body. The mathematics behind this process is called computerized tomography. It is very successful, but not perfect; the reconstructed image is only approximate, and to get a better picture with the same procedure one has to take more X-rays, causing greater expense and likelihood of side effects. In geometric tomography, only homogeneous objects ar e allowed-the density of the object is the same everywhere inside it. An example from medicine would be a bone or a kidney. One can use this information to find better reconstruction procedures. The scope of geometric tomography is actually much wider. Any measurement involving sections of a homogeneous object by lines or planes or its shadows on lines or planes can be considered. Because of this, it has many links to other areas, both in mathematics (there is a large overlap with convex geometry, the geometry of shapes without holes or dents) and outside. For example, a new technique in electron microscopy allows measurement of the number of atoms in a crystal lying on certain lines. The material scientist wants to reconstruct the crystal from this information. The object in this case-the crystal-is mathematically represented by a finite set of points.  This project continues the development of several aspects of the mathematics of geometric tomography."

There is a large body of experimental results on what<br/>is and is not required to generate the glandular structures, but<br/>there is as yet no single theory which ties together all that is<br/>known about branching morphogenesis.  The two main existing<br/>theories hypothesize that the origin and direction of branching<br/>activity rest solely in, respectively, (1) the epithelium, and<br/>(2) the mesenchyme.  This study proposes a new hypothesis, that<br/>activity in (3) both tissues is essential.  This study will<br/>develop a mathematical model of the forces and deformations<br/>involved in branching morphogenesis, using a multiphase for<br/>mulation to track changes in the density of cells, extracellular<br/>matrix components, and interstitial fluid.  The model will be<br/>analyzed, using asymptotics, perturbations, bifurcation analysis,<br/>parameter estimation, and numerical simulation.  The first task<br/>will be to evaluate the agreement of the model with experimental<br/>facts, and the second will be to help answer some long-standing<br/>questions, specifically the relative mechanical roles of the<br/>epithelium and the mesenchyme.  Specific predictions will be<br/>made, that others may test them experimentally.  The primary goal<br/>of this project is to distinguish between the three major<br/>theories of branching morphogenesis mentioned above.  It is very<br/>likely that the insights gained from this modeling study of<br/>branching morphogenesis will lead to a better under standing in<br/>general of the physical forces in confluent (epithelial) and<br/>sparse (mesenchymal) tissues, both in homeostasis and in<br/>development, with applications and insights in other contexts<br/>such as somitogenesis, tooth and hair formation, angiogenesis,<br/>healing, and tumor growth.  The study will also lead to an<br/>improved understanding of the multiphase models of biological<br/>tissues which have been developed in other contexts, through<br/>extending these passive models to tissues which are actively<br/>growing and remodeling.<br/>     The formation of branched tubular structures occurs<br/>throughout an organism, in many different tissues, and is<br/>essential to the very existence of large organisms which need to<br/>transport fluids more than a short distance.  Branching<br/>morphogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in animal development,<br/>generating the form of such organs as the lung, mammary gland,<br/>salivary gland, and kidney.  Although nearly every technique of<br/>cellular and developmental biology has been applied to it, and<br/>much has been learned from these experiments, there is still<br/>uncertainty as to the mechanism of branching.  The overwhelming<br/>majority of experiments on branching have concentrated on<br/>biochemical aspects, following the dominant paradigm in<br/>biological research of the last few decades.  Yet the essence of<br/>morphogenesis is that tissues grow and move and change shape, and<br/>this requires physical forces to emerge from the molecular<br/>biology.  Hence the next logical step in morphogenesis research<br/>is study of the biomechanical aspects, which are what create and<br/>modify form.  A mathematical model will be developed of the<br/>mechanical forces and resulting material deformations of the<br/>tissues involved in morphogenesis.  Analysis of the model will<br/>(1) allow a comparison of the biomechanical aspects of the<br/>currently competing theories of branching morphogenesis, (2) lead<br/>to greater understanding of the relatively new modeling<br/>methodology itself, which is useful in many other biological<br/>applications, and (3) suggest new interpretations and experiments<br/>towards the goal of understanding one of the most important<br/>phenomena in developmental biology.<br/><br/>"

Technical description of the project.      In this project we study  problems in nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential   equations and interacting particle systems, with  common underlying theme the presence and interrelation of multiple scales. We  address the following topics: (a) interacting particle systems with multiple scales, giving rise to discrete velocity models at a mesocopic level, and to hyperbolic conservation laws or nonlinear diffusions, at a macroscopic one, (b) existence and stability of periodic and solitary waves for hyperbolic conservation laws in the presence of relaxation mechanisms, (c) relaxation models and related numerical  schemes for front propagation problems, and (d) Monte-Carlo methods and random effects in the macroscopic limit of Ising models to geometric evolutions.  In addition to the analytical aspects of the project, one of the  objectives in (c) is the development of new  computational tools, through  relaxation models, for interface tracking applications; furthermore in (d), numerical experiments based on stochastic Ising models are employed, in an attempt to understand  from a microscopic point of view the effect of random perturbations on  interfacial evolutions.      B.Non-technical description of the project.    Phenomena involving multiple, interacting scales are widespread in areas as diverse as material science, chemical engineering, biology, atmospheric and environmental sciences,   communication networks and economics.  A typical example is the derivation of macroscopic properties of a material, for instance conductivity, from  its microscopic-molecular   or even atomic-structure. The challenges these problems present to scientists and engineers are formidable at many  levels: in experiments, modelling, mathematical analysis of models, construction of effective algorithms, simulation and verification of the models. The inherent  mathematical complexity of multiscale problems and our limited  understanding of their  nature so far, require a  methodical and detailed analysis both of the actual problems, as well as of   (carefully) simplified ones, that  illustrate in a clearer way a particular aspect of the phenomenon under study. The proposed research addresses mainly the mathematical analysis of some paradigms in multiscale processes and  touches upon the development of new computational tools, suggested by the mathematical theory. The motivation of the work   stems from phase transitions problems in material science, chemical engineering applications such as adsorption processes and  water waves and gas dynamics."

However,  unlike with an ordinary differential equation (ODE), the equations do  not directly provide all the derivatives of the state variables.     A  nonnegative integer called the  index is one measure of how far a DAE  is from an ODE which is index zero.  The higher the index the greater the  difficulty in working with the system.   Many  physical problems are  most naturally initially modeled as a DAE particularly those that are  analyzed and simulated using computer generated mathematical models.  Because of the importance of DAEs in applications a variety of numerical  techniques have been developed in recent years to simulate and analyze  DAEs.  These techniques, while very useful, are limited to systems with  special structure and low index (no more than three and often limited to  one or two)    This project is to investigate the analysis, simulation, and application of  high dimensional, higher index DAEs of unknown and nonstandard structure.  Two applications, of considerable independent interest, will be considered  to serve as both application of, and guide for, the theoretical,  analytic,  and numerical work.  The first application is the optimization of the path  of a trim tool.  A trim tool is a machine used for cutting a part from a  piece of metal.  Improved performance of trim tools is of great importance  for manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.  The second application is  the simulation of densely packed high frequency circuits for which current  industrial simulation packages are inadequate.  The robust solution of these  types of problems requires additional fundamental theoretical results and  algorithms for high index high dimensional DAEs.  This project will develop  theory and computational algorithms for high index high dimensional  DAEs and apply them to the two applications.  For both of these  applications  the high fidelity models needed are mixed systems of partial  differential equations, DAEs, and  constraints.  Their  solution will  require  examining the interplay between type of  model, type of approximation process,  and resulting types of DAEs."

Computed tomography is an imaging technique which  reconstructs a density function from a large number of its line integrals. Ordinary tomography is not local: reconstruction at a point requires integrals over lines far from that point. For a number of applications it is highly desirable if only integrals over lines intersecting some  region of interest need to be used (""region-of-interest tomography""). A special case is local tomography where the region of interest may be arbitrarily small. Local tomographic reconstructions recover some but not all properties of the original density function. Sampling theorems provide exact interpolation formulas for bandlimited functions and play a fundamental role in signal processing. In tomography sampling theorems are used to identify efficient data collection schemes allowing for maximum resolution in the reconstructed image, as well as for error analysis of reconstruction algorithms. If, as is the case in tomography and other applications, sampling theorems are applied to non-bandlimited functions, interpolation is no longer exact and a so-called aliasing error occurs. The usefulness of sampling theorems for such functions depends on the availability of good estimates for this error. <br/><br/>The  goals of this project are development and  numerical analysis of high-resolution reconstruction algorithms and development of a software package for region-of-interest tomography including local tomography; investigation of optimal sampling in three-dimensional local tomography; derivation of new error estimates for the aliasing error; and exploration of a generalization of the sampling concept in the framework of locally compact abelian groups which provides a unified view of  diverse applications such as non-equidistant sampling, numerical integration, multisensor deconvolution, and filter banks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The goal is to use selected   level sets of mode shapes of vibrating systems as data for the inverse   problem. With these level sets as data, formulas will be established.  The   formulas will then be used to determine physical properties of the system,   such as density or stiffness.  The results will be based on perturbation   results for the natural frequencies and the mode shapes.  The difficulty in   establishing these results arises from the fact that a small divisor problem   and a sequence of Eikonal equations must be solved simultaneously.  A   consequence of the resultant mathematical structure will be that the   perturbed quantities can be strongly different from the unperturbed   quantities.  McLaughlin's graduate student will concentrate on developing   formulas to use the data and on numerical implementation of those   formulas.    The goal with this work is to consider membrane like materials, such as a   thin slice of biological tissue.  Excite this membrane with an oscillating   force and suppose the frequency of oscillation is a natural frequency, that   is, a frequency where the membrane gives a large response. Illuminating   the vibrating surface with two lasers we see a dark and light line pattern.    Each line is a level set of the vibrating surface.  Now assume that the   membrane is nonhomogeneous; it could be more stiff or less stiff in some   places.   In the biological example, increased stiffness can indicate the   presence of rapidly dividing cells.  In a mechanical example, decreased   stiffness can indicate deterioration of the material.  The goal is to   determine the stiffness variations without altering the membrane, that is, to   find a nondestructive test for the stiffness variations.  Our data is the dark   and light line pattern. The problem is difficult be cause the stiffness   variations can have (but not always) a very large perturbative effect on the   pattern.  The mathematics will establish when the perturbation is large,   when it is not, and what formulas will yield the stiffness variations from   this particular data set."

The first  is to develop and study new variants of the nonlinear Schroedinger  equation (NLS) that are more faithful to superfluid helium. In real  helium, even in the low temperature range, normal fluid is present  which is coupled to the superfluid and which, through its viscosity,  provides a high wavenumber energy sink. So the existing models need to  be modified to include the mutual friction with the normal fluid. To  evaluate the energy loss of interactions with the normal fluid one  needs the kinetic coefficients in the Landau two-fluid model.  Calculations of these coefficients are usually performed with a  simplistic dispersion relation, i.e., the relation between the  frequency of sound waves and their wavenumber. For example, the  dispersion relation is supposed anomalous and with no roton minimum. We  shall study models in which the interaction potential is nonlocal and  which imply the correct dispersion curve.  The second objective is to  analyze such dissipative NLS models from the point of view of dynamical  systems. We shall study and classify attractors, bifurcation sequences,  and routes to chaos. The third objective is to make use of the results  to elucidate superfluid turbulence in the low temperature regime where  the density of the normal fluid component is smaller than the density  of the superfluid component and where one may expect turbulence in the  superfluid largely to determine turbulence in the normal fluid.    Our investigations will provide targets for experimental work in the  low temperature range. Such experiments are currently in the planning  stage by the Donnelly group at the University of Oregon.  There may be  important implications well beyond the field of liquid helium research:  similar ideas may apply to the newly discovered, high temperature  super conductors, to systems of magnetic spins, to the melting  transition of crystals, and to some cryogenic engineering applications.  Superfluid Helium is used as a coolant in superconducting magnets and  infrared detectors, and superfluid turbulence affects the transfer of  heat in such devices. An understanding of superfluid turbulence may  make it possible to design more efficient methods of refrigeration for  superconducting devices.  Turbulence in ordinary fluids is one of the  most formidably difficult subjects in physics and engineering.  Superfluid turbulence is similar but in some respects simpler for  theoretical study, and it is believed that some of the models we shall  develop will throw light onto turbulent behaviors in ordinary fluids."

One motivation for  this work is to improve the numerical methods used in the Miami  Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM), but this work also has  broader application.  MICOM is an operational ocean model that is  currently being tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory and  elsewhere for use in coupled, ocean-atmosphere models of the  global climate system.  This model presently uses a three-level  timestepping scheme that, in practice, requires a restriction on  the time step that is more severe than would be expected from  standard theory.  In addition, the model is affected by a  computational mode consisting of nonphysical grid-scale  oscillations, which are particularly stimulated by the behavior  of MICOM's representation of the oceanic mixed layer.  As an  alternative, the present project investigates methods involving  two time levels.  Such methods have the potential of allowing a  substantially longer time step, require less storage, and do not  admit a computational mode.  These methods are analyzed and  implemented in conjunction with a barotropic-baroclinic time  splitting, which is used to split the fast and slow motions into  separate subsystems that are solved by different techniques.       One application of computer models of ocean circulation is  to aid in the study of the earth's climate system.  For example,  a major point of interest in climate modeling is the poleward  transport of heat.  If the atmosphere and ocean were held  stationary, the tropical regions would be hotter than they  actually are, and the polar regions would be colder.  However,  the movement of the atmosphere and ocean serves to moderate these  extremes.  Roughly half of the poleward transport of heat is due  to the atmosphere, and half is due to the ocean.  In the ocean,  substantial transport is due to bulk movement by currents such as  the Gulf Stream; another transport  mechanism is the mixing caused  by eddies that are shed from ocean currents due to hydrodynamic  instability.  A proper modeling of these phenomena requires high  spatial resolution and computations over long time intervals, and  climate-scale simulations of ocean circulation pose great  computational challenges that strain the capabilities of the most  powerful computers.  The aim of the present project is to improve  the efficiency and reliability of the algorithms that are used in  such computations.  A full-scale climate model would require both  a model of the atmosphere and a model of the ocean, and these  components must communicate in a way that simulates the  interaction of the real atmosphere and ocean.  The present  project focuses on an existing ocean model that is being prepared  at several sites for large-scale, coupled ocean-atmosphere  simulations."

It is impossible to solve the equations which describe <br/>such waves exactly, and while a number of model equations which <br/>describe such traveling waves exist, the mathematical justification of such <br/>models is lacking.  One of the goals of the research in this proposal is to <br/>give a rigorous derivation of the approximate equations that govern wave <br/>motion of fluid surfaces. This will both help to clarify which of the various <br/>physical models gives the best description of the actual waves, and should <br/>also shed light on how better models can be developed.<br/>"

These models exhibit a rich structure of  oscillatory behavior.  The dynamics of even a single cell can be  quite complicated; it may, for example, fire either periodic  spikes or bursts of action potentials that are followed by a  silent phase of near quiescent behavior.  Examples of population  rhythms include synchronous behavior, in which every cell in the  network fires at the same time, and clustering, in which the  entire population of cells breaks up into groups; cells within a  single group fire synchronously and different groups are  desynchronized from each other.  Activity may propagate through  the network in a wave-like manner.  A network's population rhythm  results from interactions between three separate components: the  intrinsic properties of neurons, the synaptic properties of  coupling between neurons, and the architecture of coupling.  Each  of these components may include numerous parameters and multiple  time scales.  The mathematical techniques that are developed by  the investigator can help determine the role each of these  components plays in shaping the emergent network behavior.  This  may lead to a classification of the possible rhythms that can  emerge from a given network and help determine how complicated a  model must be in order to display some observed dynamics.       The types of rhythms that the investigator studies arise  throughout the central nervous system.  Consider, for example,  thalamic networks: these have been implicated in the generation  of sleep rhythms, certain forms of epilepsy, and Parkinson  tremor.  The investigator studies how the same set of neurons can  exhibit the very different rhythms that take place during  different stages of sleep and what changes must occur in the  networks during the transition from one stage of sleep to  another.  Recent experiments have demons trated that neurons in  the basal ganglia exhibit quite different population rhythms in  normal and parkinsonian animals.  The investigator develops and  analyzes biophysical models for these networks in order to  determine factors responsible for the generation of these  rhythms."

Research will continue on the iterative  solution of OSC equations arising in second and fourth order   elliptic boundary value problems. Promising new methods have been  formulated for rather general second order linear elliptic problems, and  in a study of the OSC solution of nonlinear elliptic problems   the use of these methods will be addressed. The investigation of iterative  methods and nonlinear problems is expected to play an important role in the  development of OSC for nonlinear biharmonic and Stokes problems.   Work will  continue on Schrodinger problems in two space variables, in  particular, problems arising in plate vibration problems and nonlinear   problems. Algorithms developed for biharmonic problems will be used in  certain time-stepping procedures in cases where alternating direction  implicit methods cannot be formulated. A study of collocation methods   for solving partial integro-differential equations, including  problems with nonlocal boundary conditions, will also be undertaken.   Throughout this project, rigorous theoretical analysis will be combined with the  design and numerical testing of algorithms.    Many problems in science and engineering are modelled by partial  differential equations which fall into several distinct categories with  quite different characteristics. In this project, several types of  equations are considered, for example, biharmonic problems  which arise in  fluid dynamics and plate bending and are of particular interest in the  aviation industry, and Schrodinger equations  which model problems in quantum mechanics, underwater acoustics, plasma  physics, vibration problems and seismology. Some problems, such as  biharmonic problems, are steady state, that is, independent of time,   and investigations of these often provide insight into the handling of  time-dependent problems, like Schrodinger equations. Basic  models are  usually linear and techniques developed for their solution guide the  treatment of more realistic - nonlinear - situations.  Time dependent  problems which take into account the history of a process, as in   viscoeleasticity, result in partial integro-differential equations.   Because of the complexity of the partial differential equation models,  one must resort to computational techniques for their solution.  In this project, numerical methods called orthogonal  spline collocation methods will be developed for several classes of linear  and nonlinear, steady state and time-dependent problems of the form just  described.  These methods have several advantages over existing  techniques, including the ease with which they can be implemented on high  performance multiprocessor computers and the accuracy of the  approximations produced. The successful completion of this project will  provide efficient algorithms built on a strong theoretical foundation for  the solution of problems of much practical importance."

This includes a continuation <br/>of the authors' recent work on developing a mathematical theory of <br/>shock-waves that applies to the Einstein equations - the equations <br/>that describe the time evolution of spacetime curvature, the gravitational <br/>field according to general relativity.  Shock waves are relevent here <br/>because the compressible Euler equations appear as a subsystem of the <br/>Einstein equations, and emerge exactly in the limit of low velocities <br/>and weak gravitational fields.  The work includes the construction of a <br/>new cosmological model in which the expansion of the universe, <br/>(as measured by the Hubble constant), is modeled as the effect of a great <br/>explosion that generates a shock wave at the leading edge, something <br/>like a nuclear explosion into a static background, except on an enormous scale, <br/>instead of by the standard cosmological model in which it is assumed <br/>that the entire universe is expanding at a rate measured by the Hubble law.   <br/>If successful, the results will provide the first and simplest model for <br/>cosmology under the assumption that the Hubble constant measures only a <br/>localized expansion, and consistent with the energy density and background <br/>radiation levels observed in the universe today. This research also has an <br/>interesting philosophical implication in that, if there were a shock wave present <br/>from the Big Bang, then, in contrast to the standard model of cosmology, <br/>there would be an associated loss of information that would make it <br/>impossible to reconstruct the details of the initial event from <br/>present data.  In addition, a covariant version of Glimm's Method will be developed <br/>in an attempt to provide the first general existence theory of shock wave <br/>interactions for the Einstein equations.  This is a step toward developing <br/>principles that can be applied to the numerical simulation of shock waves <br/>in general relativity.  These studies will also have implications for <br/>classical fluids because the Einstein equations provide a unique setting in <br/>which natural geometrical constructs put a handle on the <br/>fluid dynamics.  This work dovetails with ongoing research <br/>into how the large time behavior of shock wave solutions is related to the <br/>geometry of the Lie Algebra that gives the scattering picture for<br/>shock wave interactions. Thus this research connects the theory of  <br/>shock waves and geometry on several levels. <br/><br/>Einstein's equations of general relativity describe the large scale development<br/>of the universe.  Although they were first proposed more than eighty years ago,<br/>they still pose formidable mathematical challenges.  This research will continue  <br/>earlier work in which exact shock wave solutions of these equations were found.<br/>A mathematical theory will be developed that leads to alternatives of the standard<br/>""Big Bang"" theory and that allows a general theoretical treatment of shock waves <br/>within the general theory of relativity.  Since these equations contain the <br/>classical fluid dynamics equations as a special case, the research will also lead <br/>to new insights for these more familiar problems. <br/> <br/>"

Four areas for research are<br/>specified. The first is related to the fact that in certain random <br/>matrix ensembles the measure describing the eigenvalue distribution <br/>is the Gibbs measure for charges interacting via a potential at inverse <br/>temperature beta equal to one, two or four (corresponding to orthogonal, <br/>unitary and symplectic ensembles, respectively). The limiting spacing <br/>distributions for these ensembles are now quite well understood but <br/>the methods are applicable to these values of beta only. The question <br/>for general beta, while quite difficult, is mathematically interesting <br/>and quite important in statistical physics. A new approach looks <br/>promising and we intend to pursue it.  The second area of research<br/>is the question of universality of the limiting distribution of the <br/>largest eigenvalue in matrix ensembles.  This would be analogous to <br/>the universality of the Gaussian distribution for sums of independent <br/>random variables, the famous Central Limit Theorem.  Thirdly, we propose <br/>to study the order statistics of the spacings between eigenvalues (which <br/>is different from the spacing distributions between consecutive <br/>eigenvalues mentioned above).  For example, what is the probability<br/>distribution for the largest or smallest spacing?  There are known <br/>results for independent random variables but none yet for for random matrices,<br/>whose eigenvalues are far from independent.  Finally, we expect to complete earlier<br/>work on the asymptotics of solutions to the periodic Toda equations by <br/>determining the asymptotics on the so-called critical curves, where the <br/>asymptotics will take a very different form.  The theory of Wiener-Hopf operators<br/>and operator determinants should play a decisive role in this investigation. <br/>No doubt the pursuit of these four questions will lead to others.<br/><br/><br/>In the 1950s Eugene Wigner, in his now classic study of highly excited <br/>states of large nuclei of atoms, introduced a mathematical model<br/>to describe the spacing between these states. <br/>This model goes under the name of random matrix theory.<br/>Since Wigner's work in nuclear physics, it has been shown that the <br/>mathematics of random matrix theory has far-reaching applications to <br/>condensed matter physics, atomic physics and the new area of quantum chaos. <br/>In mathematics itself, random matrix theory has begun to appear in such <br/>diverse areas as number theory, combinatorics and numerical analysis. <br/>It is natural to ask why there is such wide applicability of random <br/>matrix theory.  In probability theory the bell-shaped curve is widely <br/>applicable because of a theorem which says roughly that when one <br/>adds quantities which are random and independent,  the sum follows <br/>the bell shaped curve regardless of the distribution of the random<br/>objects being added. The distribution functions of random matrix theory <br/>appear to have a similar universality for a class of problems where <br/>there is a high degree of dependence in the underlying processes. <br/>In the present project the mathematics of random matrix theory will be <br/>further developed with an eye kept on possible applications. <br/>In earlier work a general mathematical framework was developed that <br/>related the distribution functions of random matrix theory with <br/>solutions to certain equations which are said to be integrable. <br/>This mathematical theory gives exact formulas for distribution functions <br/>in random matrix theory and provides efficient numerical methods for <br/>their computation.  Computing these distribution functions will allow one<br/>to compare them with experimental data.<br/>"
