For the models of                linear materials interest will focus upon dynamic crack growth in               viscoelastic materials and interfacial fractures in both elastic                and viscoelastic materials.  For the models of nonlinear                        materials interest will focus upon the development and                          implementation of finite element methods for the numerical                      simulation of growing cracks in viscoelastic materials.                              Crack propagation phenomena appear in a variety of                         technologically important areas.  For example, due to the                       increased use of polymers and polymer-based composites there is a               genuine need for understanding the nature of fracture processes                 in viscoelastic materials.  In this project the principal                       investigators will apply analytical and numerical methods to                    study the propagation of cracks in mathematical models of elastic               and viscoelastic materials."

The title of the conference, Asymptotics Beyond                 All Orders, refers to a small but significant class of problems                 in which conventional asymptotic methods provide no information                 at any order of the expansion.  Problems of this nature are                     unusual, but not impossible:  examples are known in                             hydrodynamics, plasma physics, crystal growth, and quantum                      mechanics.  Several of these problems in widely different fields                have been solved recently, using several apparently different                   methods.  What the different methods of solution have in common                 is still largely unexplored.

A large amount of computer power is brought to bear upon              the systems of partial differential equations that describe                     combustion and explosion phenomena, but very often a great deal of              insight can be obtained from a mathematical analysis of the                     governing equations.  For example, in this project the principal                investigators will attempt to predict where and when an explosion               will occur in a confined space by means of a judicious use of                   a'priori estimates and bounding functions."

The main thrust of the research                will be to develop new methods for finding asymptotically correct               approximate solutions of the equations as the large parameter                   approaches infinity.

One of the goals is to use a complement of                pure mathematical theory, perturbation theory, and numerical                    experiments to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of                these systems.  A second goal is to apply these tools and                       concepts to study specific systems that arise in nonlinear                      optics.  A third goal is to use nearly integrable systems as a                  model for formulating questions of a statistical nature about the               physics of nonlinear interactions and nonlinear mode selection                  mechanisms.  The theme here is to focus on solutions, first the                 exact integrable solutions and then their behavior under                        perturbations.  The integrable theory yields explicit solutions                 and the full set of parameters for each N-mode solution,                        stability within the integrable system, and the nearby solutions                that result from unstable solutions.  Then numerical experiments                on the perturbed systems test whether nearly-integrable dynamics                can be approximated by modulated N-mode integrable solutions.  If               so, the corresponding perturbed equations are derived.  These                   tools are brought to bear on specific applied projects.                              Integrable systems of partial differential equations often                 have solutions whose properties can be exactly established.  This               is quite unlike the usual case for nonlinear partial differential               equations.  What is important here is that often the properties                 remain when the system is perturbed.  Thus one can tell a great                 deal about otherwise intractable problems.  Such problems arise                 in nonlinear optics (for example, in the design of long-distance                communication networks using fiber optics and the design of                     optical cavities for very fast switches),  in the motion of waves               in nonlinear acoustic media, and in flows around thin wings."

In this project the                        principal investigators will look for new solutions of the Yang-                Baxter equation that describe quasicrystals and quasiperiodic                   lattices.  This work touches upon other topics on the border                    between mathematics and physics such as quantum groups and knot                 theory, monopoles and string theory, phase transitions in                       condensed matter and biomembranes in biophysics."

The first area of study deals with the                              Reissner-Mindlin plate model, which determines the transverse                   displacement of the midplane and the rotation of the fibers                     normal to the midplane of a plate as the solution of a coupled                  system of partial differential equations with appropriate                       boundary conditions.  Unlike the biharmonic plate model, this                   model has a boundary layer, which is studied by developing and                  rigorously justifying an asymptotic expansion of the solution in                terms of powers of the plate thickness.  The investigator expects               to show how the strength of the boundary layer depends on                       particular physical boundary conditions used in the model and                   that for certain boundary conditions no boundary layer exists                   near a flat portion of the boundary.  Using these results, he                   will develop finite element approximation schemes that give                     higher rates of convergence in the interior of the domain and for               which the overall convergence rate may be enhanced by mesh                      refinement techniques geared to the exact nature of the boundary                layer. He also intends to study higher order models, derived from               pure displacement or mixed variational principles.  He will                     investigate analytical properties (such as boundary layer                       effects) by means of asymptotic expansions and develop                          approximation schemes that do not suffer from ""locking,"" a common               problem for the Reissner-Mindlin model that causes deterioration                in accuracy for thin plates.  Because all these models are                      approximations to the full three-dimensional model, an important                aspect of this research is to compare the predictions the various               models make about properties of the three-dimensional solution.                 Finally, the project involves the derivation of local error                     estimates for a finite element method for the approximation of                  linear hyperbolic and convection-diffusion equations.  The intent               is to show that the domain of dependence properties of the                      approximation scheme closely imitate those of the exact solution.               %%%      Plate models are two-dimensional mathematical models                   that greatly simplify the study of thin three-dimensional elastic               bodies.  They are commonly used by engineers to predict                         displacements and stresses of objects when various forces are                   applied.  The project aims to use a rigorous mathematical                       analysis to better understand the predictions of the models, to                 develop improved computational algorithms for numerically                       approximating the partial differential equations that comprise                  the model, and to compare the predictions the plate models make                 about properties of the three-dimensional object.  In particular,               a rigorous study is made of the boundary layer phenomena                        predicted by each model.  (The boundary layer is a region near                  the boundary of the object in which various physical quantities                 undergo rapid changes.)  Finally, the derivation of ""local"" error               estimates for a finite element method to approximate linear                     hyperbolic and convection-diffusion equations, which are used as                mathematical models in a variety of applications, will rigorously               show that certain important qualitative properties of the exact                 solution are closely imitated by the approximate solution                       computed by the finite element method.  This gives confidence to                the users of the method that the numerical results reliably                     predict the behavior of the physical quantities being modeled."

The growing alliance of nonlinear theory and analysis with                 scientific computation, since the early 1980's, has led to                      significant advances in our understanding of modern materials                   like shape-memory alloys, ferroelectrics, and highly                            magnetostrictive alloys.

The mathematical model for                 this network was derived using only the most basic assumptions;                 namely, that a neural network is a collection of interacting                    elements, each one affected positively or negatively by some                    subset of the others, and such that the system as a whole is                    capable of adapting its behavior over time.  The resulting                      mathematical model is an autonomous system of ordinary                          differential equations, and can therefore be analyzed by known                  analytic and numerical techniques.  For appropriate values of the               parameters it can be shown that an N-cell network will have N                   stable attractors.  One of the major goals of this project is                   the determination of the attractive basins of these attractors                  and a description of their dependence on the various system                     parameters. This information will then be used to determine the                 properties of a neural network having these N-cell networks as                  components.                                                                          Neural networks are currently being applied to certain                     kinds of problems that have not yielded to traditional techniques               of artificial intelligence, for example speech recognition and                  computer vision.  As yet, there is no general agreement on                      which neural network architectures work best.  It is possible                   that hybrid systems, consisting of interconnected components                    with different architectures, may be one solution.  It is in this               spirit that the network proposed here is being studied.  It has                 some useful properties not possessed by other networks; for                     example, it automatically identifies the component of an input                  vector that is most distinct from all of the others, whether it                 is smaller or larger.  As one of the few models in which the                    weights vary continuously in time as a function of the activity                 levels, it has in these weights a built-in short-term memory                    capability.  A careful comparison of this model with other neural               networks in current use needs to be made, to determine whether it               has properties that make it significantly better in particular                  applications."

Such systems have                 solutions of shock-wave type that serve as mechanisms for the                   propoagation of waves, even in parts of the domain where the                    system is no longer hyperbolic.  These types of problems occur in               the transonic flow of gases and in the flow of multi-phase fluids               through porous media.  In particular, the principal investigator                will study the stability of shock waves in systems of equations                 that undergo changes from hyperbolic to elliptic type using                     regularization and perturbation methods.                                             The behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) under unusual                   conditions such as in the upper atmosphere or in the earth is                   governed by a complicated system of partial differential                        equations that can under go what is called a ""change of type"".

The wave passes through regions that are                in liquid, solid or composite states.

Using numerical and computational methods, this                   project will investigate accommodation phenomena in                             spatially-unrestricted axons and myelinated nerve segments.  A                  primary goal is to establish the interrelationship between                      passive loading (both conductive and capacitive) and                            accommodation in nerve cells and how it affects signaling.  The                 project requires computational and analytic bifurcation studies                 of reaction-diffusion equations with slowly varying boundary and                interface conditions.  Another objective is to classify and                     explore how different kinds of random fluctuations influence                    accommodation in nerve models.  Stochastic perturbation methods                 for exit time estimates and numerical simulations will be                       employed.                                                                            In neuroscience, threshold and accommodation experiments at                the cellular level are performed by slowly depolarizing an                      excitable membrane by ramping or stepping up an applied current.                Such experiments to investigate accommodation phenomena in                      spatially-unrestricted axons and myelinated nerve segments are                  important for understanding why and how conduction failures occur               in partially demyelinated nerve; debilitating diseases such as                  Multiple Sclerosis can induce lesions that partially demyelinate                the myelin sheath.  In addition, many of the tools developed in                 this project are useful for studying dynamic bifurcation                        phenomena, which occur in many other areas of science and                       engineering."

These fall in                three parts: (1) finite-dimensional systems of ordinary                         differential equations, (2) delay differential equations, and (3)               diffusive systems with time delays.  The principal themes of the                research are the fundamental problems of finding various criteria               for the uniform persistence of these considered systems, the                    global stability of steady states, and the existence of periodic                solutions and spatial patterns.  In particular, the investigator                will study some mathematical models of populations dispersing                   among patches in heterogeneous environments, where various kind                 of interactions will be considered. For systems with more than                  two populations, one of the main objectives is to find concrete                 conditions under which all populations will coexist in the long                 term.  For two-species interaction models, global stability of                  steady states, existence of periodic solutions or spatial                       patterns will be main concerns.      Time delays and space                      variations constitute integral components of most ecological,                   biological, physiological, chemical, physical, economic and                     atmospheric processes.  The planet as a habitat of mankind and                  other species has become too small to support an extravagant                    exploitation of its resources.  The damages are inevitable and                  usually occur with time delays in heterogeneous environments; no                experiments are possible to fully simulate these effects.  In                   order to better understand and control such processes, it is thus               necessary and important to study them mathematically.                           Unfortunately, current mathematical techniques are far from                     adequate to handle these numerous real problems.  The proposed                  research will lead to an improved understanding of the dynamical                interplay of the effects of time delays and diffusions.  In                     particular, the final results can be useful to a wide spectrum of               people like ecologists, engineers, system scientists and others                 who plan for a better management of the planet and life."

Microscopic-scale                   models of aggregation, which involve interactions among the                     blood's fluid dynamics and the mechanics and chemistry of the                   platelets, are appropriate for studying aggregation in the small                vessels of the microcirculation.  The project will explore                      changes in the models to attain more realistic aggregate                        growth rates, and improvements in the associated numerical                      methods to extend simulations to three dimensions and to                        substantially longer time periods.

This additional information will increase                insight into the physical and chemical controls on the                          aggregation process.  These studies will also lay the foundations               for further development of models of aggregation and for their                  application to clinically interesting questions such as how flow                and vessel geometry interact to influence aggregation within                    natural vessels, such as the coronary arteries, or prosthetic                   devices, such as vascular grafts or artificial hearts."

More specifically, it is concerned with deriving algebraic                      invariants that describe invariant sets, determining how they can               change through bifurcations, and determining which geometric                    topological structures are imposed on the invariant sets by the                 algebraic invariants.                                                                The guiding philosophy behind these methods comes from the                 fact that many differential equations that arise as models of                   biological, chemical, or physical systems share the following                   three characteristics:  (1) they are derived from idealized                     descriptions of complicated phenomena, (2) they are parameterized               systems and exact values of the parameters are not known,                       (3) they are nonlinear.  Thus, from the point of view of                        applications, describing the global and robust structure of the                 solutions to these differential equations is of great importance.               At the same time, it is well known that nonlinear systems undergo               tremendously complicated bifurcations (e.g., the appearance                     of chaotic dynamics).  Therefore, any general theory must rely on               tools that are indifferent to the fine structure of the invariant               sets, e.g. the Conley index theory."

In this project the principal investigator              will apply techniques from the theory of wavelets to study the                  properties of solution sets of functional equations whose graphs                are fractals.  Her approach will combine analytical and numerical               methods, and she will be collaborating with the leading people in               this work that blends analysis with geometry."

Explicit                        threshold criteria, the asymptotic behavior of the solutions, and               the general forms of the nonlinear force of infection terms have                been obtained in certain cases, and these results will be used as               the basis for a systematic development of methods for estimating                the pertinent model parameters using available data on specific                 diseases.  A second area of biomathematical research that will be               pursued involves the study of the triggering of DNA synthesis in                eucaryotic cells through the use of compartmental                               reaction-diffusion models.  These models lead to                                coupled semi-linear parabolic equations with time delays that are               due to transcription and translation delays and the movement of                 biochemicals in the cell.  The main methods of analysis here                    involve the development and use of local and global bifurcation                 results for such reaction-diffusion equations.

This research is concerned with two mathematical problems                  with biological applications.  The first part of this research                  will develop and  study mathematical models that help predict the               course of infections and which form the basis for making                        decisions on how to best use available resources in order to                    control the spread of diseases.  The age structure of the                       affected population is very important in determining the course                 and effects of most diseases.  Models will be developed and                     studied that account for the age distribution of the population                 and that lead to methods for predicting the course of the disease               and the effects of proposed control strategies.  The results will               be applied to the study of optimal control strategies for                       specific diseases.   The second part of this research will seek                 to shed light on the mechanism that triggers animal cells to                    start replicating their genetic material and reproducing.  This                 is a fundamental question that has implications in the                          understanding of growth and development of embryos as well as in                disorders such as cancer that result from abnormal cell                         proliferation.

In addition to the usual equations of fluid                      dynamics  the principal investigator will study systems of                      equations in magneto-hydrodynamics, the kinetic theory of gases,                and the theory of shallow water waves.                                               Dissipative forces like friction can be small in certain                   problems in fluid dynamics, but their effect cannot be neglected.               For example, the viscosity (internal friction) of a gas is very                 small and yet it affects the large-scale behavior of objects that               move through the gas.  The principal investigator will study how                such small dissipative mechanisms can influence the formation and               propagation of shock waves in gases.  A shock wave is something                 like a sonic boom, and it is an important feature of flows at                   high speeds."

Computational tests will be conducted for numerical                 methods, known as vortex methods, for time-dependent, inviscid,                 incompressible fluid flow.  The test problems used are vortex                   rings with swirl; they can be computed reliably by other                        researchers using variational methods.  The results may serve as                a guide in the application of vortex methods and may suggest                    possible improvements in the methods.  An analysis of the errors                in related methods for fluid interfaces will be initiated, in the               hope of better understanding their design.  In such cases a                     moving interface is tracked, along with information determining                 its velocity.  A convergence proof will be attempted along the                  lines of earlier analysis for vortex methods.  Work on the                      construction of exact solutions for the equations of                            three-dimensional water waves, representing interacting                         long waves, of the type modeled by the Korteweg-de Vries                        equation, will be continued.  Near-resonances with waves in the                 usual scaling have led to delicate analysis.  Finally, the                      relationship between the equations describing large-scale                       atmospheric and oceanic motions and their singular limiting form,               the quasi-geostrophic equations, will be investigated.  The                     nature of this approximation is closely related to the generation               of unwanted small scales in time or space in the solutions of                   the full system.                                                                     In many situations where the nature of fluid flow is                       of practical importance, such as the flow past an object or                     combustion, quantitative prediction is difficult because of                     the large number of variables involved.  The development of                     reliable methods for numerical simulation of realistic flows                    offers the hope that a greater number of test cases could be                    studied with less effort than through experiments alone.                        Vortex methods are a special class of methods which have                        particular advantages in important but difficult cases.                         An interface occurs where one kind of fluid motion meets                        another.  Analysis and numerical simulation can predict                         whether or not desired configurations can be maintained.                        The proposed work might suggest improvements in the numerical                   methods used for these special problems.  Nonlinear waves                       of the type described in the third topic have been found                        to be remarkably stable in water and in other physical                          settings; they are completely different from the waves                          occurring in linear theory.  Little is known about                              their fully nonlinear interaction.  The last topic is                           a mathematical investigation of the fundamental and                             long-standing question of how the equations for large-scale                     circulating flow in the atmosphere or oceans can be                             reduced to a simpler system.  One cannot hope to solve                          the full system accurately, and much effort has been                            devoted to finding ways to predict the main features                            by calculating a smaller number of variables."

It is proposed to see if a random particle-in-cell                    method can be implemented that takes into account the fact that                 plasma particles (ions and electrons) undergo Brownian motion due               to collisions with the medium or background particles.  The                     research efforts will be mainly devoted to the convergence                      analysis and numerical implementation of these methods.

Their                  research will be addressed to improving convergence rates for                   simulation methods, introducing time discretization of                          particle-in-cell methods, and analyzing more efficient                          algorithms.                                                                          For problems of controlled fusion and laser fusion, the                    physics of laser-matter interactions is still not well                          understood.  Consequently, scientists are turning more and more                 to microscopic models based on kinetic equations to better                      understand these phenomena.  For modeling the evolution of                      rarefied plasmas for those times less than the binary                           collision times, the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations is used                 for the relevant kinetic model, when the magnetic fields vary                   slowly.  Particle simulation methods consist of replacing the                   plasma by a large set of charged superparticles that obey the                   usual laws of classical and modern physics, and then computing                  the interactions of these superparticles.  A thorough                           understanding of the accuracy properties of these methods will                  enable the scientist to use different approximate parameters                    efficiently in a numerical simulation (e.g., the minimum number                 of particles to obtain a given accuracy).                                            The Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck system of kinetic equations               incorporates collisional effects of a plasma with the background                material (e.g., a plasma system in a thermal bath or ""reservoir"")               by regarding the motion of a particle as Brownian motion caused                 by collisions with the background.  This model is analogous to                  the classical description of the irregular or Brownian motion                   exhibited by a particle of colloidal size immersed in a fluid.                  In stellar dynamics also, the effect of encounters between stars                under gravitational forces influences their motion in the manner                of Brownian motion.  The random particle method for                             Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck models is proposed in order to                     better understand the effects of collisions by incorporating the                Brownian motion in the numerical schemes."

In the                  autonomous case the bifurcation of limit cycles from centers and                from one parameter families of periodic solutions is considered                 while in the autonomous case bifurcation of subharmonic solutions               is studied.  A major goal is to develop an analysis that goes                   beyond the usual first order methods by being able to treat the                 response to a nonlinear perturbation to all orders.  This will                  allow for a complete understanding of the bifurcation diagram of                the multiparameter system by detecting periodic solutions which                 are invisible to first order methods and by mixing a priori                     information on the minimum order to which the perturbation                      analysis must be carried so as to exhaust the possibility of                    finding additional perturbed periodic solutions.  The methods                   employed include geometric analysis of nonlinear dynamics,                      perturbation theory, ""Andronov-Melnikov"" theory, and algebraic                  geometric ideal theory.  There is also an important computational               component especially integration of differential equations,                     computer graphics and computer algebra.                                              Applications of the theory are found wherever physical                     systems are modeled by nonlinear ordinary differential equations                depending on parameters and, in particular, when determining the                possible response of a nonlinear system to external stimuli.  A                 typical application is illustrated in the project by the analysis               of a wind oscillation problem."

There are three                  main areas of effort. The first is the application of                           classification and quantification techniques in knot theory to                  the analysis of enzyme-DNA three-dimensional structure and enzyme               mechanism. Mathematical models, such as the tangle model, will be               developed and perfected, the aim being to produce a mathematical                tool of use to the experimental molecular biologist. The                        mathematics used here is recent work in the theory of                           3-manifolds, and the biological input is experimental results                   obtained from the topological approach to enzymology. The second                area is the study of the topological entanglement of random                     chains in 3-space.  Random chain entanglement statistics are                    related to the conformational entropy of a polymer system in                    dilute solution.  Asymptotic entanglement (as the length goes to                infinity) is reasonably well understood; the fundamental problem                of scientific interest is the description and computation of                    entanglement at finite lengths.  Both rigorous mathematics and                  simulation techniques will be employed.   The third area is the                 topological description of spiral wave patterns in excitable                    media.     The methods of differential topology and obstruction                 theory will be used to provide necessary and sufficient                         conditions for the existence and time evolution of patterns on                  bounded orientable 3-manifolds.                                                      A central problem in molecular biology is to deal with                     long-chain DNA molecules. The way they fold, replicate, and                     recombine is intimately bound up with their functions. The                      behavior of long-chain polymers in solution is a more general                   form of the same questions. Important applications arise in                     genetic engineering, the design of drugs, and the development of                long-chain polymers for industrial and technological uses.  Knot                theory is a part of topology that studies exactly these kinds of                questions: how structures fold and recombine and replicate."

The turbulent                 flows arise as solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.  The                   permanent regime for a turbulent flow is related to an attractor                in the phase space of the flow.  The attractor in turn is                       approximable by an approximate inertial manifold.

Turbulence is a fundamental phenomenon in fluid flows.  Such               flows arise in describing the behavior of planes, boats, pumps,                 and engines.

In particular, he                 will use the techniques of mathematical analysis to investigate                 the existence of smooth solutions for all time and their                        asymptotic behavior for large times, the formation of                           singularities such as shock and rarefaction waves from initially                smooth data, and the existence of weak (i.e., nondifferentiable)                solutions.

Many materials of importance in science and technology                     exhibit an elastic response that is modulated by the presence of                dissipative forces like viscosity and heat.  The most striking                  manifestation of this modulation is the actual breakdown of the                 material in a finite time due to the formation of shock waves.                  Thus it is very important to understand the interplay between                   dissipation and the formation of shocks.

Sampling theory for regular                        Mikusinski operators as well as wavelet sampling of ill-                        posed problems will be initiated.

This                     involves (i) approximation analysis for the nonlinear case, (ii)                efficient solution techniques (multigrid approaches) for the                    resulting linear systems, (iii) exploitation of the link with the               Riccati transformation.                                                              Most realistic physical phenomena are modelled by                          complicated nonlinear systems of differential equations.                        Exact solution of these systems is hopeless, and numerical                      simulation is a necessity.  This work aims at producing reliable,               and rigorously justified, algorithms to solve some of these                     systems.  The intent is to produce software tools for the                       working scientist.  In particular, work on the Riccati equation                 will be of value to people working in Games' Theory, Optimal                    Control and connected Engineering fields.  The work on so-called                stiff differential equations is useful in solving  systems                      having different time-scales, such as in chemical kinetics and                  aerodynamics applications.  Finally, the work on approximation of               invariant manifolds is useful in understanding the long-term                    behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems.  This has applications                 in many areas of applied science."

These                   include both the development of improved methods as well as                     applications drawn from fluid dynamics, dynamical systems,                      reaction-diffusion systems and combustion.  Problems in                         methodology to be considered include the construction of accurate               and stable boundary conditions at artificial boundaries for                     computations in unbounded domains, emphasizing error estimation                 and the equations of fluid dynamics, and bifurcation theory                     for points in the essential spectrum, with applications to                      the existence theory of traveling waves in cylindrical domains.                 The study of these problems makes use of the asymptotic analysis                of long range wave propagation, the stability theory                            of initial-boundary value problems, multiple scales expansions                  and extensive numerical experimentation. Applications of these                  methods include the simulation of unsteady compressible flows in                exterior and wall-bounded domains, the construction and stability               analysis of waves modeling the propagation of curved flame fronts               for both thermo-diffusive models and models that include                        hydrodynamic effects, and a numerical investigation of the                      existence of neutrally stable helical waves in pipe flow, as                    predicted by critical layer theory.                                                  Wave motion in fluids and other media is a fundamental                     feature of a variety of disciplines in the sciences                             and engineering, ranging from meteorology to aeronautics to                     oil exploration.  Despite the diversity of the physics, the                     science of waves possesses an underlying mathematical unity, and                has been the subject of intense and fruitful research.                          Modern computing technology has provided a new tool for studying                these phenomena, allowing a deeper investigation of nonlinear                   and multidimensional dynamics.  The research centers on the                     development and application of new computational and analytic                   techniques.  It emphasizes the complementary use of computer                    simulations with other forms of analysis.  The particular                       problems chosen for study arise in fluid dynamics and combustion,               but the universal importance of wave propagation makes the work                 applicable in many other settings."

The motion of molecules is                 particularly difficult because such problems involve so many                    objects and the nature of the forces is so complicated.

In particular, he will investigate                  the Ginzburg-Landau equation from the theory of hydrodynamic                    stability theory and the Zakharov system of equations from the                  theory of weak plasma turbulence.  In addition, the principal                   investigator will consider these two sets of equations in their                 nonlinear Schroedinger limits.

Much of the natural phenomena of everyday life involves what               mathematicians and physicists call ""stability and bifurcation""                  phenomena.  That is, a system will continue more or less in a                   stable mode of operation until it is perturbed sufficiently to                  the point where a new type of behavior arises out of the old one.               When this happens one says that a ""bifurcation"" has occurred and                one is then interested in the ""stability"" of the new solution.                  That is, how long will the new mode of behavior exist and how                   large of a perturbation will it take to kick the system into a                  new mode of behavior?  In this project the principal investigator               will examine such problems as they arise in the modelling of                    plasmas and turbulence by using analytical and numerical methods."

Toeplitz, Hankel, and Toeplitz-plus-Hankel                    matrices are examples of efficiently structured matrices, as are                matrices of a given displacement rank, as defined by T.

The analysis of liquid-crystal                problems involves interdisciplinary work with the Glenn H. Brown                Liquid Crystal Institute (LCI) at Kent State University; it is                  primarily concerned with analyzing and numerically simulating the               equilibrium configurations of liquid crystal molecules in small                 confinements, as arise in polymer-dispersed liquid crystals                     (PDLC's), with special attention to defect structures and the                   influence of geometry, boundary conditions, and external applied                fields.  These solution fields are modeled, using a continuum                   mathematical model, as minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes free                  energy functional, which derives from the Landau theory of phase                transitions.  These problems, with their large number of degrees                of freedom (a tensor order parameter) and spatial dimensions                    (three), lead to challenging large-scale scientific computing                   problems requiring robust and efficient techniques of finite                    element discretization, large-sparse optimization, and numerical                bifurcation in the presence of symmetry breaking.  The work in                  the area of singular perturbations is concerned with the further                development, refinement, and extension of a general uniform                     stability theory for linear and nonlinear differential equations                of arbitrary order.      The main significance and importance of                these projects derives from the interdisciplinary aspect of the                 work on liquid crystals.  The investigator will perform numerical               simulations on current problems of interest to the theoretical                  and experimental physicists in the LCI.  He will bring to bear                  state-of-the-art techniques from modern numerical analysis and                  scientific computing to complement physical theory and                          experiment.  Investigators in the LCI are at their limits, using                sophisticated NMR techniques, to probe the structure of liquid                  crystals in the very small (submicron) size containments in                     certain display technologies currently under development.  It is                hoped that numerical simulations will play an important role                    here."

If the domain enjoys any symmetry, the computational                effort involved in numerically solving these systems can be                     significantly reduced via the effective use of techniques based                 upon group representation theory which have recently been given                 by the investigators.  This algebraic approach yields a                         decomposition of the original large problem into a number of                    smaller subproblems, each corresponding to an irreducible                       representation of the symmetry group of the domain.  The size of                each reduced problem is that of the large problem divided by a                  factor equal to the order of the group divided by the dimension                 of the representation.  Previous work on exploiting symmetry has                involved reducing partial differential equations to subdomains                  and adapting boundary conditions over the symmetry axes.  Such                  techniques do not apply to boundary integral methods.  It is                    proposed in this project to develop flexible codes which                        systematically implement reductions for a variety of symmetry                   structures.  Constructions of symmetry-respecting                               discretizations and theoretical investigations relating to                      sparseness and parallel implementations will be carried out.                         Many problems in science and engineering have as their                     natural domain a surface or body which is symmetric in some way.                For example, circles, circular disks, spheres, intervals,                       squares, and cubes, of any dimension, all have obvious symmetry.                In addition to the symmetry of the domain of the problem,                       often the equations themselves reflect a symmetry in the physics                of the problem.  For example, the differential equations                        governing heat flow are symmetric, in the sense that heat will                  flow in all directions without any preferences in the absence of                any outside stimulus.  When both the equations and the domain of                the problem enjoy some symmetry, algebraic techniques may be used               to reduce the computational effort involved in numerically                      solving the given problem on the given domain.  This project will               focus on making the necessary theoretical investigations and                    developing algorithms for exploiting symmetry in the field                      of numerical analysis."

This research aims at understanding these effects by                     exploring the geometry of the phase flow using previously                       developed analytic insights and estimates.  In another direction,               the investigator extends the theory of adiabatic invariance to                  slowly varying ergodic systems by using combinatorial and                       geometric ideas.                                                                     When two simple oscillators such as an electric circuit or a               biological cell, each behaving in a simple periodic fashion, are                coupled, the resulting system can acquire totally new features                  such as chaotic behavior, bifurcations, etc., of which there                    seems to have been no hint in the individual components.  The aim               of this research is to describe and to explain phenomena of this                sort in differential equations that model coupled biological,                   electric, or mechanical systems.  In a different direction, the                 phenomenon of adiabatic invariance is of fundamental importance                 in the theory of dynamical systems; it arises when a system                     undergoes a slow change over a long period of time.  Somewhat                   unexpectedly, a system may develop a ""memory"": some quantities,                 called the adiabatic invariants, change little over the course of               the system's evolution.  (The simplest example is a pendulum on a               string whose length is, say, halved slowly; in this case the                    ratio of the energy to the frequency changes very little; this                  ratio is an adiabatic invariant).  Adiabatic invariants arise in                the study of elecromagnetically confined plasmas, in particle                   accelerators, in planetary motion and in many other cases.                      Although the subject is about 80 years old, there is no                         satisfactory analysis of this phenomenon for an important class                 of chaotic systems.  This is a serious gap in the subject                       considering the fact that adiabatic invariance is a basic aspect                of Hamiltonian dynamical systems.  It is proposed to develop a                  rigorous theory of the phenomenon of adiabatic invariance for                   chaotic systems.  Such a theory would be of fundamental                         significance for applications of dynamical systems                              as well. As an example, it would be a small but important                       building block in the long-open problem of providing a rigorous                 foundation for the theory of ideal gases -- modeling a gas by a                 system of many colliding hard spheres in a vessel of changing                   size and shape."

A                   physically observable wave must be stable to perturbations in its               profile.  The work under this grant will be aimed at the                        development of techniques for discriminating betwen stable and                  unstable waves.  In diffusive problems, there is envisioned a                   theory in which the structure of the wave determines any                        instabilities.  The analysis of such systems necessarily involves               a reduction to a simpler system, such as through a singular                     perturbation.  A new geometric approach to singular perturbations               is being developed with Kopell which is designed to solve                       stability problems in such equations as those of Hodgkin-Huxley                 for nerve impulse propagation.  Other stability problems to be                  attacked involve the subtle effects ocurring in fluid and optical               problems.  Exponential decay to waves does not happen in these                  cases and new techniques need to be developed.  The theory of                   transversality in dynamical systems will also be developed and                  aplied to problems in spin-orbit resonance and uniqueness in                    elliptic problems.                                                                   The complexity of physical systems that can be analyzed is                 confined by the mathematical techniques available.  Systems with                some simple character, such as those which are linear or an                     equation with a single unknown function, yield to well-developed                methods of analysis that are now part of the engineer's toolbox.                However, more complicated systems remain a challenge to the best                applied mathematicians and many important phenomena are missed by               the simplification to systems that can be easily analyzed.                      Future advances in science may well be driven by the mathematical               development of techniques for the analysis of such complicated                  systems.  One aspect of such a system that demands a mathematical               solution is the question of the stability of basic structures,                  under the perturbing influences suplied by the outside world.                   The work in this grant will be largely devoted to the development               of techniques for assessing the stability of such structures.  It               is hoped that at some point in the future these techniques will                 be in the engineer's toolbox."

The Pacinian corpuscle is an                encapsulated nerve ending in the skin and other tissues.  In a                  previous study a capsule model for the transmission of strain to                the receptor membrane was developed.  The aims of the proposed                  research are to:  (i) extend the capsule model to make it more                  anatomically realistic; (ii) develop a receptor membrane model                  involving a transduction current model of a strain-sensitive                    conductance, which accounts for the known cytoplasmic extensions,               and which is coupled to the capsule model through a strain                      variable;  (iii) initiate development of a model for the skin                   with receptors;  (iv) examine solution behavior analytically of                 the generalized cable model developed for the receptor's                        membrane.

A                        particular family of statistical tests that can detect specific                 instances of gene conversion as well as cryptic patterns of gene                conversion will be studied.  One aim will be to develop                         parametric models that would allow gene conversion and point                    mutation rates to be jointly estimated from DNA sequence data.  A               second major goal will be to apply these techniques to study gene               conversion in the Alu family of repeated sequences, which has                   about 500,000 repeats in the human genome and constitutes about 5               per cent of total human DNA.  The subfamily structure and                       relationships of the Alu repeats will also be studied, both for                 their own sake and for the extent to which family heterogeneity                 may affect statistical tests for gene conversion.                                    The spontaneous mutation of genetic material is a major                    contributor both to evolution and to genetic disease.  In many                  particular cases this mutation, rather than being purely random,                has been shown to be the result of a conversion or copying                      process from nearby similar genetic material. The first part of                 the proposal will develop tests for detecting a cryptic pattern                 of gene conversion that may appear purely random, and to estimate               the relative importance of the two mutational processes at a                    particular genetic loci.  A significant pattern of gene                         conversion may imply a similar nearby genetic locus.  Alu                       sequences are not only interesting for what they can tell about                 the evolution and structure of genetic material, they also have                 been used as tags of pieces of human DNA that have been cloned                  into bacterial plasmids or yeast chromosomes.  If nearby Alu                    sequences show a pattern of gene conversion under certain                       circumstances, this can help to piece together these clones in                  the construction of the human genomic map."

The topics of investigation                     include absorbing boundary conditions for dispersive waves, open                boundary conditions for the shallow water equations in a rotating               reference frame, and absorbing boundary conditions for the                      velocity-stress formulation of the elastic wave equation.  This                 work is motivated by the fact that many physical problems are                   defined on spatial domains that either are unbounded or are so                  large that it is not feasible to compute numerical solutions over               the entire region.  In such situations, it is necessary to                      truncate the domain.  One then encounters the problem of                        finding boundary conditions to impose at the artificial                         computational boundary.                                                              The development of such boundary conditions is the subject                 of this research.  This work is expected to have applications to                computer modeling of several kinds of physical phenomena,                       including large scale motions of the atmosphere and oceans,                     seismic waves within the earth, and waves on the surface of                     water.  For example, suppose that an oceanographer wants to model               the circulation in an ocean.  One possibility is to compute the                 relevant physical quantities on an array of grid points                         distributed over the entire ocean.  If the circulation is needed                for the entire ocean, this is what must be done.  On the other                  hand, if the circulation is needed only on a relatively small                   portion, such as the continental shelf, then the above procedure                is far too costly.  Instead, one would prefer to compute the                    circulation only on the region of real interest. In such a                      computation, the region is bounded partly or entirely by a                      boundary that is ""open"" instead of physical.  Telling the                       solution what to do at such a boundary is rather tricky, and an                 incorrect choice of boundary conditions can seriously corrupt the               solution that is computed. The goal of the present research is to               develop effective open boundary conditions for the physical                     situations mentioned above.  Open boundary conditions for seismic               waves would be useful to geophysicists who use seismic methods to               search for geologic structures that could contain petroleum, and                open boundary conditions for water waves would be useful to                     engineers who study the effects of wave actions on coastal and                  offshore structures."

Emphasis will be on using                 analytic solutions, bounds or approximations to understand                      numerical results and vice-versa.  Detailed comparisons of the                  mathematical results with current published experiments will be                 made.  The main project is to use continuous time Markov chains                 for modeling ionizing radiation damage to mammalian cells.  The                 specific generators used will be modifications of those                         introduced in recent papers (Albright 1989; Tobias et al. 1989;                 Curtis 1989; Sachs et al. 1990; Hlatky et al. 1990; Hahnfeldt et                al. 1991).  The following biological endpoints will be                          considered:  (A) the yield of DNA double strand breaks and other                chromosome damage during irradiation; (B) the yield and variance                of chromosome aberrations evolving from DNA double strand breaks                via enzymatic cellular repair and misrepair processes during                    and after irradiation; (C) the fraction of cells clonogenically                 viable after irradiation.  In (B) and (C) the main mathematical                 technique will be to use the embedded discrete time Markov chain                to work out the long time asymptotic behavior in a form suitable                for numerical evaluation and comparison to experiments,                         especially experiments on human lymphocytes.  (A) mainly involves               use of perturbation theory and of Perron-Frobenius theory for                   the eigenvalues of the generator.  Many older models applicable                 to one of these endpoints can be regarded as deterministic                      approximations to the Markov models and the domain of validity of               such approximations will be systematically studied.  A secondary                project will be to use the full, time-dependent                                 reaction-diffusion equations with realistic reaction terms for                  analyzing spheroid tumor models.                                                     Mathematical modeling of ionizing radiation damage to DNA is               particularly important in relating experimental results for                     moderate radiation doses to results at the very low doses and                   dose rates which are most relevant in public health concerns.                   Unlike most older models, the models to be used here                            systematically take into account fluctuations in dose and                       response from cell to cell.  The results will contribute to a                   basic understanding of how chromosome aberrations such as                       dicentrics develop following ionizing radiation.  Such                          understanding in turn should improve methods of biological                      dosimetry, of risk assessment for exposures to radioactivity, and               of radiotherapy."

The method combines finite                       difference approximations to solve the field equations with                     Lagrangian fluid markers to track the positions of the solid                    particles in the fluid.  The suspended material is replaced with                an appropriate force-density term in the equations of fluid                     motion.  This method is capable of handling a large number of                   particles since there is no need to specify boundary conditions                 on the surface of each particle and since one set of                            equations obtains in the whole flow field.

A feature of this work is to implement certain                        coordinate changes that will greatly extend the applicability of                the algorithms.  In most applications, the dynamical systems                    depend on one or more parameters; then the determination of                     suitable coordinates will be combined with the idea of path                     following.  As long as the manifolds deform smoothly when system                parameters change, the proposed methods will permit following the               manifolds computationally.  A longer-term goal is to study                      bifurcations of invariant manifolds numerically, in particular                  the breakdown of tori.  It is expected that the region of                       breakdown will be characterized numerically by several turning                  points of the discrete solution branch, and that the number of                  turning points increases as the meshsize is refined.  The                       proposed research will point the way towards the development of                 efficient algorithms for the computations of invariant manifolds,               and will provide a valuable tool for the study of dynamical                     systems.                                                                             Nonlinear dynamical systems play an important role in many                 areas of the applied sciences and of engineering and technology.                For example, they are used to model flows around airplanes and                  submarines, vibrations of engines, currents in electrical                       networks, and blood flow in the heart.  All these systems                       depend on parameters, which can partially be controlled or                      monitored.  A practical problem of main importance is to predict                the critical values of parameters, for which qualitative changes                of the dynamical systems occur.  These changes are called                       bifurcations.  For example, a long-outstanding problem is                       to predict the transition from laminar to turbulent flow.                       Similarly, a vibrating structure can bifurcate from quasiperiodic               to chaotic motion; the latter is unpredictable and might lead to                the breakdown of the structure.  The behavior of a dynamical                    system is often characterized by its properties on an                           invariant manifold.  This project will develop numerical software               to compute invariant manifolds and to follow them computationally               as system parameters change. Important cases are given by                       invariant tori, which correspond to quasiperiodic (predictable)                 motion;  breakdown of the tori corresponds to the transition                    to chaotic (unpredictable) motion.  With algorithms developed in                this work, one will be able to compute values for bifurcation                   parameters, i.e., one can predict parameter values for which                    major qualitative changes of the dynamical system will occur.                   The algorithms will be tested on systems of coupled                             oscillators and vibrating mechanical structures, but they will                  apply to other areas of the applied sciences where dynamical                    systems are used for modelling."

A combination of analytical and numerical techniques will be                    employed to follow the motion of a highly convoluted interface                  for late times when traditional numerical methods have difficulty               because of resolution problems.  The method relies on actually                  following the motion of singularities in the unphysical domain                  that on their approach to the physical domain correspond to                     interfacial features such as spikes.  By subtracting such                       singularities from a basis representation in the physical domain,               it is proposed to calculate a continually distorting                            Rayleigh-Taylor interface numerically.                                               Interest in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability stems                          from its disruptive presence in inertial confinement devices                    where attempt is made to confine a hot plasma through                           a magnetic field and achieve controlled nuclear fusion for                      energy needs.  Because an accelerating field and a gravitational                field are equivalent, the radial acceleration of a plasma as it                 turns around makes it susceptible to this instability.  It is                   clear that for plasma confinement to succeed, one should be able                to control this instability.  A first step is to understand the                 detailed nature of a Rayleigh-Taylor flow.  The method of attack                is novel and is an attempt to overcome the shortcomings of some                 other traditional numerical methods."
