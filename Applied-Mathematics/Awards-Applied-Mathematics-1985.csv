There is currently great interest in control of large flexible                  structures because of the number of such structures requiring active            control for acceptable performance.  These include flexible arms of             robots, large communication and intelligence satellites, orbiting               platforms and power stations, and manned space stations.  They are              typically highly flexible, consisting of a large number of beam-like            elements coupled together end-to-end in the form of a chain, with               components mathematically modeled by large systems of ordinary and              partial differential equations.  The main purpose of the proposed               workshop is to determine what the basic problems are in the control of          flexible structures, what the current state of affairs in the                   application of pde techniques to these problems is, where this area of          research is heading, and where should it be going."

This work            will clarify a number of issues associated with active control of large         aerospace structures such as space antennas and platforms and wings of          high performance aircraft.  Since the aerospace structures under                consideration are spatially distributed, they are inherently infinite           dimensional.  As such, their proper modeling and analysis requires              partial differential equation techniques.  This research seeks to               develop control strategies by direct studies of various appropriate             infinite dimensional models.  It is a broadbased program, ranging from          theoretical studies of distributed and delayed controllers to practical         construction of numerical algorithms for feedback stabilization of              vibration, flutter, and rigidity."

Combinatorial         optimization addresses the same problem with an additional complication         brought about by the inclusion of indivisible activities, i.e., by              variables that must assume integer values.  In purely combinatorial             problems, all variables must be integer.  Since its inception shortly           after World War II, mathematical programming ideas have been                    successfully utilized to formulate and to solve many complex planning           problems, with applications covering the entire range from the                  quantitative social sciences to engineering science.  The increased             ability to numerically solve mathematical programming problems has              brought about a greater demand to incorporate indivisible activities            into the planning models.  This research aims to extend the                     computational frontiers of combinatorial problem-solving as well as to          achieve a better mathematical understanding of combinatorial                    optimization problems."

This is a problem of great                practical importance since virtually all realistic control systems              contain randomness which precludes exact knowledge of system dynamics.          One approach to linear problems of this kind is to introduce an                 associated quadratic cost functional and to seek an admissible control          which minimizes this functional.  Since any control with finite cost is         necessarily stabilizing, this would provide an optimal stabilizing              control which, in addition, can be shown to be given by a certain               feedback law.  When the system parameters are known exactly, an optimal         control can be obtained by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)            partial differential equation of dynamic programming.  However, the             present problem is not amenable to dynamic programming because of its           'partially observed' nature.  Certain of these problems will be reduced         to 'completely observed' problems to which dynamic programming can be           applied.  Some questions about the information rate for certain                 nonlinear systems will be studied."

A specific            focus of the work will be the construction and testing of new types of          algorithms based on present and contemplated parallel processor                 architectures.  Parameter estimation problems are abundant in the               biological, physical, and engineering sciences.  They arise because it          is often difficult or impossible to directly measure certain                    'parameters' which are relevant to a particular investigation.  These           parameters must therefore be estimated from observations which can be           made together with an assumed form of modeling equations containing the         unknown parameters.  Examples are estimation of porosity or density of          substrata in the earth's crust, estimation of dispersal rates in insect         migration, and estimation of damping coefficients in large flexible             space structures."
