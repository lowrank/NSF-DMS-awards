Examples from fluids include localized convection, vortices and drops.  These diverse systems have two things in common: (i) they are dissipative systems driven by spatially uniform forcing, and (ii) there is range of forcing within which the application of different finite amplitude perturbations can lead to distinct localized states.  The investigator seeks to extend existing theory in new directions, focusing on problems arising in materials science such as the nucleation and growth of crystals from a supercooled liquid, and the ordered and disordered structures that may result.  These include structures with short-range order but no long-range order called quasicrystals.  The type of structure that forms in turn determines the strength and other properties of the resulting material and this depends strongly on the speed of the crystallization process.  The aim of the project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind the different types of growth that take place at different temperatures of the liquid both in this and in related systems.  Two postdoctoral students are engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/><br/>In this project the investigator and his colleagues study the properties of spatially localized structures in two and three dimensions.  Both conserved and nonconserved systems are considered with a focus on phase field and dynamical density functional theory models of soft matter crystallization from a supercooled melt.  Depending on the speed of this process, the resulting material may be crystalline, amorphous, or a quasicrystal.  Localized structures of each type may serve as critical nuclei for the nucleation of the crystal and are therefore of particular interest.  The project focuses on the properties of these structures, and the properties of the fronts that separate them from the melt.  Both steady and propagating fronts are considered and the processes that determine the propagation speed are studied in detail.  These include pinning of fronts to the microstructure behind them  and the interaction with the conserved mass mode.  The project also includes a parallel study of traveling pulses in nonconserved systems and a detailed study of different types of defects where pinning to microstructure is important.  The techniques used by the investigator include bifurcation theory, coupled with numerical branch-following and direct numerical simulations of realistic systems.  Two postdoctoral students are engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamics Days is an annual conference on nonlinear dynamics and its applications.  It has established itself as a premier conference for promoting new collaborations in applied math and nonlinear science; it has been hosted at rotating sites in the US for nearly 40 years (since 1982).  Due to the broad applicability of nonlinear dynamics, the conference is highly interdisciplinary, including areas such as physics, engineering, mathematics, biology, and computer science.  This year, the focus of the conference will be on six themes: neuroscience, complex fluids, data-driven & machine learning methods, nonlinear materials, complex networks, and human/biological systems. The main goals of the conference are to gather leading researchers with young investigators and students to promote cross fertilization and dissemination of ideas, and to engage students. The conference webpage is http://ddays2019.northwestern.edu/. <br/> <br/>The conference will have 16 invited speakers and a similar number of contributed talks, as well as short ""flash"" presentations and poster sessions.  No parallel sessions will take place; all attendees are expected to attend all talks in order to promote discussion across application fields.  Support provided by the NSF will be used primarily to offer scholarships to allow participation of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars.  Participants from underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to attend the conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within this mathematical framework, the investigators will attempt to determine if the gas flow and cavity wall displacement can be favorably altered or ""controlled"" by means of the deliberate placement of forces which act on the cavity wall. The accomplishment of this program objective could lend insight into understanding and controlling the gas flows which are associated with high-speed aircraft and natural gas pipelines. Furthermore, a mathematical model which has recently been derived to describe a structure-fluid interaction in which an elastic body is wholly immersed within a given fluid will be studied. This new mathematical model differs from previous structure-fluid models, in that numerical simulations of solutions to the new model suggest that the associated structural displacements, as well as the fluid flow field, elicit a much more quiescent behavior than previously thought. The investigators intend to mathematically verify this observed ""stability"" for such structure-fluid dynamics. A successful conclusion to this work could potentially enhance the understanding of cellular dynamics: such structure-fluid interaction models have been invoked to describe a nuclear body, within a cell, as it interacts with the surrounding viscous cytoplasm. Moreover, a mathematical model which describes acoustic wave flow within a structural chamber, with one of the chamber walls being flexible, will be studied. In particular, it is intended to determine if the acoustic waves in this structural model will die out as time evolves. Such a conclusion of wave stability in this mathematical setting would have implications in real-world control engineering: With a view of promoting a quiescent acoustic field within the interior of an aircraft cabin, the stability results of the project could conceivably be taken into account in aircraft fuselage design. In the course of fulfilling the project objectives, graduate students, including first generation university students and women, will receive training in the necessary qualitative analysis and numerical computation. <br/><br/>The gas flow-cavity model described above consists of the 3D compressible Stokes or Navier-Stokes flow equations coupled to an elastic plate equation which describes the displacements of the flexible portion of the cavity wall. This PDE system is subjected to cavity boundary control terms. The investigators will determine the optimal regularity of solutions to such controlled (gas) flow-structure PDE models under the influence of boundary control terms of prescribed smoothness. Subsequently, they intend to solve the associated null controllability problem with respect to the appropriate space of boundary control functions. Moreover, in the aforementioned structure-fluid interaction, the structure is composed of a ""thick"" and ""thin"" layer: the thick layer is described by a 3D wave equation, while the the thin layer is described by a 2D wave equation and constitutes the boundary interface between the thick wave equation and the 3D fluid component equation. The investigators intend to establish that classical solutions of this 3D wave-2D wave-3D heat PDE system manifest at least a polynomial rate of decay, which would be in line with what has been observed numerically. In addition, the rational decay problem for the structural acoustic interaction, in which an acoustic wave equation within a bounded domain interacts with a dissipative elastic equation across a boundary interface, will be considered. Moreover, an algorithm which will confirm that the polynomial rates obtained are optimal will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of surfaces are planes, spheres, ellipses, etc. Applications include X-ray computer tomography (CT), ultrasound imaging, thermo-acoustic and photo-acoustic tomography, Compton camera imaging, and many others. Frequently, reconstruction is achieved by applying a linear inversion formula. It is of fundamental importance to know how the resolution of the reconstruction depends on data sampling. Despite the significance of this problem, not much is known about the resolution of tomographic reconstruction from discrete data. For general transforms, results are scarce and mostly semi-qualitative. The objective of this project is to develop and rigorously justify a novel approach to resolution analysis of a general class of transforms. The approach is based on the analysis of how accurately the singularities of the function are reconstructed. The project will provide a flexible theoretical framework for computing the resolution of a wide range of algorithms that reconstruct from discrete data. It will lead to a deeper insight into how tomographic algorithms reconstruct singularities of an object, analysis of artifacts, detectability of small objects, and open the opportunity for virtually unlimited further exploration. The project provides opportunities and support for the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project encompasses the following general aims: (i) analysis of resolution in the setting of the Generalized Radon Transform (GRT); (ii) applications of the theory to address practical needs of imaging; and (iii) numerical verification of the obtained formulas. The reconstruction problem is formulated in terms of the GRT, which integrates over a fairly general family of surfaces. The investigator plans to obtain explicitly the edge response of the reconstruction as the data sampling rate increases. This setting is general and covers a wide range of integral transforms. The idea of the approach is to combine the tools of microlocal analysis and computational mathematics. This approach  will be applied to several more narrowly defined problems, including analysis of resolution of common reconstruction algorithms. The results obtained will be tested on numerical experiments. This will typically involve implementing a reconstruction algorithm and comparing actual and predicted resolutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nonlocal equations are used to describe a wide variety of physical and biological phenomena. Nonlocality means that a small perturbation in one location can affect the entire system. The project will enhance the tool-box available to mathematicians and widen the class of models that can be studied rigorously. There are three interconnected topics. The first is tumor growth models. The aim is to establish connections between models that describe the tumor at a cellular level and those that characterize the tumor as a region with a law governing the movement of its boundary. The second topic is evolutionary ecology. Rigorous analysis of the relevant PDEs will be used to study the dynamics of populations in which individuals can migrate as well as undergo mutation between generations. The third topic concerns numerical methods for certain PDEs. The mathematical ideas involved will also be used to develop algorithms for getting many autonomous robots to perform a cooperative task (examples include robotic pollinating bees or automated surveillance). The three topics making up the project have the potential to impact several areas of broader interest to society - namely, medicine, ecology, and technological development. The project will promote scientific progress by increasing our understanding of mathematics and by strengthening the connections between it and other disciplines. In addition, the principal investigator will teach and mentor students, as well as conduct outreach to the broader community.<br/><br/>The project will shed light on multiple classes of PDEs. Degenerate diffusion equations and free boundary problems underlie the work on tumor growth models. The aim is to study these equations and establish rigorous connections between them. The goal of the work on evolutionary ecology is to understand propagation phenomena in nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations. An important tool is the link between these PDEs and Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The third topic concerns novel numerical methods for second order PDEs and involves understanding the structure of the PDEs and their regularizations. The aim is to prove convergence of the numerical methods, as well as to use these tools to develop algorithms in robotic control. An important theme connecting the three topics is nonlocality. Nonlocal PDEs often lack a comparison principle, which is a key tool in the study of classical PDEs. Moreover, some equations to be studied are conjectured to be unstable with respect to initial condition. Being able to overcome this, and even studying the causes and effects of instability, will be a significant development, and may lead to progress on other problems. In addition, this work will involve understanding and developing new notions of weak solution. In many real-world systems, it is natural to expect degeneracy or non-differentiability to form; so, for PDEs to be useful in these contexts, a novel sufficiently robust notion of solution is needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The questions of what velocity fields effectively enhance or prevent transport and mixing, or steer quantities (such as mass concentration or density distribution) to a desired distribution, have attracted increasing attention. This project aims to use modern techniques from optimal control theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, and nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization to address these questions. The project will foster interdisciplinary collaboration and education efforts among different research groups and will also help train advanced undergraduate and graduate students across fields including mathematics, mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering to conduct collaborative research in optimal transport and mixing, flow control, and computational methods.  <br/> <br/>The objective of this research is to establish an innovative and rigorous mathematical framework for achieving optimal transport and mixing via active control of fluid flows. The project focuses on (1) optimizing transport and mixing via control of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with internal (distributed) and boundary control designs employed for different physical applications; (2) investigating the transport behavior of non-dissipative scalars, both passive and active, governed by the transport equations and addressing active transport through buoyancy-driven flows, modeled by the 2D Boussinesq approximation; and (3) applying non-smooth regularization to improve the sparsity of the controls. Investigation of the existence of an optimal control, differentiability of the coupled nonlinear system, and derivation of optimality conditions promises to launch new directions in nonlinear control, nonconvex optimization, and nonsmooth analysis of semi-dissipative systems. It will also contribute to the development of effective computational methods. The optimal control synthesis developed in this project will enable the study of similar phenomena arising in other complex flows, such as mass transfer in electrically conducting fluids, heat exchange in compressible flows, and double diffusion in oceanography, that are of great interest to a broad range of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of the available displays operate close to physical limits, and the constant demand for faster and more efficient devices has made the search for new materials the focus of the industry. Bent-core liquid crystals differ from the standard materials used in flat panels and portable displays in that the special shape of their molecules allows for ferroelectric behavior and intrinsic bistability at a lower manufacturing cost. That is, they have potential for superior operational speed, resolution, and efficiency at a competitive production cost as well as a wider spectrum of commercial applications which include spatial light modulators (SLMs), optical memories, optical computers and high-resolution microdisplays. To date, a clear description of the configurations (mesophases) of the devices based on bent-core materials has not been established, and many technical difficulties need to be overcome. This project is concerned with the numerical and theoretical modelling of these application-intensive materials and will fill an existing gap between theory and experiments. Its outcome will contribute to the validation and extension of the available models and will add to the understanding of the nature of phase transitions, and of electrical and optical properties, ultimately contributing to the manufacturing of superior liquid crystals-based devices. The graduate students involved will be trained in the interdisciplinary areas of applied mathematics, computational mathematics, and materials science. The main research objective will be in the analysis of electro/magneto optic effects, which will involve the study of materials' defects and their interactions; the refinement of existing models for ferroelectric liquid crystals with layered structures; and the study of a newly discovered phase, where the bent molecules arrange themselves in an heliconical structure, winding about a helical axis with nanoscale pitches. <br/><br/>The investigators will examine the response to applied fields exhibited by a liquid crystal based on the materials' anisotropic optical properties.

The effects of boundary conditions on the morphology of bulk and confined samples in Smectic A phases will also be considered. The studies will be based on generalized unit vectors and smectic order parameter energy models. The investigators will use and advance a diverse collection of mathematical tools for nonlinear problems, including variational methods, asymptotic analysis, and bifurcation and regularity theories for nonlinear partial differential equations. An essential component of the project will be to select, refine, and propose models that contains the relevant physical features of the examined phenomena. Numerical simulations of gradient flows and comparison with available experiments will play an important role in the research approach.

It is driven by applications in gas dynamics and plasma physics as well by mathematical interests in analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. Kinetic equations are used to describe evolution of interacting particles, such as gas molecules, ions and electrons in a plasma. The most famous kinetic equation is the Boltzmann equation: formulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872, this equation describes motion of a large class of gases. Later, in 1936 Lev Landau derived from the Boltzmann equation a new mathematical model for motion of plasma. This latter equation was named the Landau equation. Despite the fact that many mathematicians and physicists have been working on these equations, many important questions are still unanswered due to their mathematical complexity. The proposed research will fundamentally contribute to this field by bridging the gap between mathematical analysis and physics and enable further mathematical understanding of physical phenomena. The work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen inter-institutional ties. The research program will be integrated with educational and outreach activities designed to (i) broaden the students' understanding of different research areas, (ii) provide the students with a modern skill set that is essential for different career paths, and (iii) promote existing connections between local institutions in the DC Metro area and help establish new avenues for collaboration and training of high quality scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The proposed research will advance the knowledge in global properties of solutions to collisional kinetic mathematical models, improving our understanding of non-linear dynamics, entropy, equilibrium, and regularizing effects.

A typical aeroelastic energy harvesting scheme involves immersing a thin, elastic structure in a fluid (water or air) flow. Under certain conditions, the presence of the flow brings about a structural self-excited vibration, known as flutter, resulting in periodic oscillations. It has been recently shown that, via affixed piezo-electric materials, electrical energy can be harvested from these structural oscillations. This sort of energy holds promise as an alternative energy source, but also brings about mathematical modeling and experimental implementation challenges. Slender cantilever plates in an axial flow are particularly prone to the flutter instability, even at low flow speeds. To effectively and efficiently harvest energy from this system, one must understand the qualitative features of the resulting limit cycle oscillation. This is done by formulating appropriate partial differential equation models, analyzing their mathematical properties, simulating dynamics through scientific computation, and comparing these results against experimental data. This project will provide opportunities and support for the training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/> <br/>From a technical point of view, the analysis described above requires understanding large cantilever deflections driven by a flow. The models studied must capture the de-stabilizing effects of the flow as coupled to nonlinear cantilever dynamics. Unlike traditional large deflection elasticity (based on the structure's ability to stretch), a cantilever's inextensibility gives rise to the primary nonlinear effects of interest: nonlocal inertia and nonlinear stiffness.

We address the variational study of relevant observed phenomena in nanowires and in the epitaxial deposition of a thin film onto a substrate.  We study phase nucleation in Lithium-Ion batteries, which are central to advances in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage; phase nucleation is important in understanding charge-discharge dynamics (poor cycle life) and other material limitations of these batteries.  In what concerns the mathematics of imaging, we pursue the analytical investigation of image processing, restoration, and registration, which are fundamental to the advance of computer vision, medical imaging, film restoration, and scanning probe microscopy.

Scale separation occurs ubiquitously in nature and is tied to a variety of phenomena; important examples from mathematical ecology and biology include the formation of vegetation patterns in water-limited ecosystems, the propagation of impulses along nerve fibers, and periodic bursting rhythms in neurons.  Mathematically, these systems are frequently modeled by dynamical systems in the form of singularly perturbed ordinary, partial, or lattice differential equations.  This project contributes to the theory of singular perturbations through the development of broadly applicable techniques to study these phenomena, their robustness under variation in model parameters, and their stability to perturbation.  Part of the project includes research experience opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The specific research goals are organized into three parts inspired by the different application areas.  The common thread through these applications is that they are conceptually described by singularly perturbed differential equations where a delicate interplay occurs between local singular bifurcation phenomena and the global behavior of solutions.  The first part concerns the formation and resilience of vegetation stripe patterns on sloped terrain in semiarid regions.  This process is modeled by reaction-diffusion-advection equations, and the focus is on existence and stability analysis of patterns in the limit when the advection dominates.  The second part is concerned with periodic traveling waves in lattice differential equations that model impulse propagation in myelinated nerve fibers, of which the spatially discrete FitzHugh-Nagumo equation is a prototypical example.  This necessitates the extension of techniques used in the study of ordinary differential equations where loss of normal hyperbolicity occurs to the infinite dimensional setting of lattice differential equations.  The third part is concerned with spike-adding transitions between bursting solutions in models of neuroendocrine cells.  The construction of these transitions involves accounting for both hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic dynamics and linking local and global behavior of solutions, providing a framework in which complex bifurcations can be understood in other systems.  The project goals require extensions to existing theoretical methods in the areas of geometric singular perturbation theory, geometric desingularization, and homoclinic/heteroclinic bifurcation theory.

The research will address in a coherent way how to model risk in such systems and how to control them within the risk-averse paradigm. This will be accomplished by developing dynamic risk-assessment procedures, called risk filters, and by employing adaptive robust control techniques. The outcome of the project will directly advance and promote the progress of science and engineering, with potential applications in applied areas such as medical sciences, engineering, economics, finance, inventory management and insurance. Special attention will be given to popularizing the proposed research and its impact in these applied fields. In particular, this will be achieved through advising of graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, presentations at popular, international and local forums, and dissemination of the results via scientific journal and book publications.<br/><br/>The classical theory and practice of Markov decision processes have proven to provide a powerful and successful toolkit for generating optimal or sub-optimal decision strategies in situations where the decision maker has access to adequately known (accurate) model of the underlying Markovian dynamical system, and acts so to optimize the expected cumulative cost or reward arising from the decision maker's actions. However, on the one hand, in many decision-making processes the decision maker needs to account for the trade-off between the cumulative award and cumulative risk of the decision. Risk-averse decision criteria underlying this research project and the theory of risk filters are ideally suited for such purposes. On the other hand, it is a typical situation in decision making processes that the model of the underlying Markovian dynamical system is not known exactly. Frequently, such model is a semi-adequate formalization of the underlying Markovian system, in the sense that the structural dynamical features of the system are modeled adequately, but precise knowledge of relevant model parameters is missing. In such cases, we say that the decision maker faces model uncertainty. Part of the proposed research will be devoted to develop methodologies that address this issue through adaptive robust stochastic control framework. Thus, the proposed research addresses in a coherent and novel way two important aspects of decision making in Markov systems: risk-averse decision criteria and model uncertainty. The theory of risk filters will be combined with the adaptive robust control methodology that will lead to novel dynamic programming equations, for which new numerical methods will be established.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such fluid structure interaction (FSI) problems include the flying of birds, the swimming of fish, and blood flow through the heart and blood vessels.  A particularly important class of FSI problems are those at small spatial scales. The biophysics of cell biological processes is a very important example of this. In such FSI problems, the fluid can be treated as a very viscous fluid (Stokes fluid). This project will study FSI problems in a Stokes fluid. The mathematical equations describing FSI problems are generally difficult to study mathematically, but the relative simplicity of the equations of Stokes fluids makes possible a detailed mathematical study of this class of FSI problems. The research program is divided into two parts. In the first, we study the dynamics of membranes in a Stokes fluid. Such models are often used to describe the dynamics of the cell membrane. In the second, we study the dynamics of filaments in Stokes flow. Such models are often used to describe the dynamics of flagella of microorganisms and sperm. A detailed mathematical study of such FSI problems will lead to a better understanding of FSI problems in general and also to the development of efficient computational algorithms in the simulation of such problems.

Yet, some of these algorithms are poorly understood -- they can fail catastrophically, but rarely do. In other words, the worst-case behavior is poor, but the average-case behavior is good. This research will advance the understanding of this phenomenon by employing techniques from the ever-expanding field of random matrix theory (RMT). In turn, this research gives rise to new questions within RMT. A substantial feature of this project is the extensive educational component that integrates research and education. This integration is achieved via a three-pronged approach including a summer workshop on random matrices, high school engagement, and undergraduate/graduate student mentoring.<br/><br/>Two natural ways to employ RMT within numerical linear algebra also coincide with the two most common themes in numerical linear algebra: Algorithm analysis and algorithm development. For example, remarkably detailed estimates from RMT such as rigidity and edge universality have found concrete applications within numerical linear algebra giving average-case performance for the classical power method. Randomized algorithms have found great utility in the big-data age. This research will employ both of these themes with applications to data science, psychology and beyond.

If a small perturbation, or fluctuation, in the system would drive it away from that state, then the state is unlikely to persist over long times and hence unlikely to be observed.  Such a state is unstable.  Conversely, a stable state is one that would persist even in the presence of small perturbations, thus rendering it physically observable.  Mathematical models are often used to help predict the evolution of real-world systems.  This project is focused on the development of mathematical methods for analyzing the stability of solutions of such models.  Detecting whether or not a given state in a mathematical model is stable is a key step in predicting its observability, and hence in predicting real-world behavior.  In this project, stability in models described by partial differential equations is analyzed using tools from topology, geometry, and analysis, with a focus on systems having more than one spatial dimension.  Because many of the existing mathematical tools are valid in only one spatial dimension, while many physical systems, such as those mentioned above, have two or more spatial dimensions, this focus is of particular importance.  Graduate students participate in the research of the project.<br/><br/><br/>Understanding the long-time behavior of solutions is important when using partial differential equations to model physical systems.  A key aspect of this is identifying certain solutions or coherent structures of the model and determining if they are stable.  This means that small perturbations of them remain small as time increases, thus rendering them physically observable.  In one space dimension, spatial dynamics has allowed many problems related to nonlinear waves, and in particular their stability, to be cast in a dynamical systems framework by viewing the spatial variable as a time-like evolution variable.  In higher dimensions, the notion of spatial dynamics is not well-defined, because in general there is no distinguished spatial variable to view as the time-like variable.  Recently, multi-dimensional stability problems have been recast using a family of shrinking domains and by relating the Morse index of the linearized operator to a Maslov index connected with this family.  This indicates both that the Maslov index could be a powerful tool for determining the spectral stability of multi-dimensional nonlinear waves and that a generalization of spatial dynamics to the multi-dimensional setting could be developed through the one-dimensional variable that indexes the domain.  This project is focused on developing both of these possibilities.

Although conceptually different, these phenomena will be modeled by very similar mathematical models that fit into the framework of reaction-advection-diffusion (RAD) systems. RAD systems are the focus of this research; their use will help to gain insight into complex social and ecological systems where there is a need to understand macroscopic patterns.

These models are characterized by their effective description of continuous as well as discontinuous fields within a single mathematical framework by using integral equations instead of differential equations. The models have been successfully applied to better describe jump stochastic processes, anomalous diffusion, and spontaneous formation and propagation of cracks in solids, to name a few applications. However, the models have also presented the scientific community with new mathematical challenges. This research is devoted to exploring some analytical issues while at the same time laying the necessary mathematical foundation for future studies of nonlocal and peridynamic models. Issues to be addressed include demonstratiing well posedness of linearized nonlocal models of practical interest, establishing a rigorous connection with well-studied strain-gradient models,  proving regularity properties of solutions of nonlocal equations as a function of the data, and implementing variational techniques to study some aspects of nonlocal nonlinear problems. The approaches involve various tools that lead to extensions of classical mathematical concepts and techniques to the nonlocal setting, including perturbation methods, calculus of variations, and nonlinear functional analysis. Furthermore, the basic mathematical infrastructure that will be worked out is likely to impact the development of effective and reliable finite element methods and other numerical schemes to solve complex engineering problems that involve nonlocality. The research will make nonlocal and peridynamics-based modeling and simulation more mathematically consistent, quantitative, and predictive in practical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award addresses three projects in the stochastic and computational analysis of ""large-scale"" dynamical systems, in the sense that they are set in spaces of very high dimensions or involve the interactions of a large number of participating agents in the system. The first project will focus on the development of efficient numerical schemes for partial differential equations (PDEs) with a large number of spatial dimensions. These schemes could have a significant impact on computation-oriented financial instruments, such as model-based trading algorithms involving very-large portfolios. The second project and third projects study the structures of large financial systems that are interacting in a centralized (mean-field) and non-centralized (network) manner, respectively. The results will provide tools for the measurement and management of systemic risk, particularly default contagion for large scale interbank lending markets, both for individual investors and for regulators. The award will also result in the involvement and training of graduate students and dissemination through journal publications and conferences. <br/><br/>The first project will develop efficient Monte-Carlo methods  for high-dimensional PDEs and path-dependent PDEs (PPDEs). These schemes are expected to be efficient when the dimension of the equations is allowed to be in the hundreds or higher, hence essentially breaking the notorious ""curse of dimensionality"" that has been baffling the numerical analysts and computer scientists for decades. The second project explore various theoretical issues as well as several practical problems in stochastic game/control theory and quantitative finance under the general framework of master equations and their variations. This project will utilize several recently developed technical tools, including the time consistency principle and the dynamic utility approach. The third project on dynamic systemic risk investigates a complex network in which the contagion effect among banks are described in a time-consistent, and non-centralized manner. By considering the state space of probability measures, the dynamical movements of networks can be described by measure-valued SDEs, while the systemic risk is characterized by certain master equations. All projects in the proposed research have direct or indirect connections to applied fields, especially to stochastic finance/actuarial sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many such equations, for example the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for waves in shallow water, have the exciting feature that many of their solutions can be given exactly by an explicit formula. This allows one to develop a precise understanding of the underlying physical processes. However, the range of conditions for which exact solutions are currently known is restrictive, inhibiting the use of such solutions in real-world applications. This project aims to find larger families of exact solutions to soliton equations, and use these solutions to develop statistical theories of the corresponding physical systems. <br/>  <br/>The main goal of the project is to construct and study new families of solutions of soliton equations such as KdV, Nonlinear Schrdinger, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili. These solutions are obtained as limits of multisoliton solutions, and are bounded and non-decreasing at infinity. They are described by a Riemann-Hilbert problem and can be efficiently computed numerically. The first goal is a rigorous mathematical description of these new solutions. The PIs will investigate to what extent these solutions solve the initial value problem for KdV and related systems. They will study spectral properties of the associated linear operators and construct non-periodic one-dimensional ideal conductors. Finally, the PIs will develop a statistical theory of integrable turbulence for KdV and other soliton equations."

There is a variety of gas-dynamic phenomena that can be described mathematically by hyperbolic-parabolic balance laws. The swirl of complicated gas flows surrounding a space vehicle reentering the Earth's atmosphere is probably one of the most spectacular examples for which these balance laws serve as a (simplified) mathematical description. The second application motivating this research is chemotaxis, the movement of micro-organisms in response to a chemical stimulus. The mechanism of chemotaxis is ubiquitous in biology and medicine, from migration of bacteria or leukocytes to cancer metastasis. Arising from the physical world, the parabolic-hyperbolic systems do not fit exactly into the traditional classification in the theory of partial different equations, and the solutions' behavior is governed by both hyperbolicity and parabolicity, plus a chemical reaction. Integrated into the research activities of the project there is an educational component. It includes curriculum development of hand-on modeling of real-world problems by partial differential equations, one-on-one research mentorship to undergraduate students, and direct participation of research by Ph.D. students. The project encourages the participation of students at all levels, especially students from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>The project has two principal mathematical objectives. The first objective is to study the stability of equilibrium solutions. This is to understand how an initial perturbation, such as inaccuracy in measurement, propagates into the solution. The project team is particularly interested in the wave pattern formed by perturbation at long time. The research unifies the theories on hyperbolic balance laws and hyperbolic-parabolic conservation laws in this regard. It has direct application to gas flows in translational and vibrational non-equilibrium. The second objective is to study another model system, Keller-Segel-Fisher/KPP system, beyond the application of the above general theory. It is a chemotaxis model that has logarithmic sensitivity and logistic growth. Here the logarithmic sensitivity is to account for Fechner's law: Subjective sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. An important practical problem is what happens if the chemical signal is near void at one end of the domain. This is equivalent to the logarithmic function is near its singular point. In the project, we carry out an in-depth investigation into such a situation. The goals are existence of solution global in time, large time behavior, and possibly large data solutions or strong wave solutions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Applied Mathematics Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A significant step was taken when P.-L. Lions introduced a new partial differential equation known as the Master Equation, which conceptually synthesizes all potential approaches to the field. Unfortunately, this is an extraordinarily difficult equation. In this project, the investigators will develop new mathematical techniques to study the Master Equation. Therefore, the work is a contribution to the conceptual core of mean field theory, the master equation, focusing on two important applications: energy markets and stochastic control with partial information. The broader significance of this work is that it will produce new insights into economics, finance, machine learning, and other fields. Students at both graduate and undergraduate levels will be trained in a large variety of issues and concepts, with opportunities for research and applications. <br/><br/>The first problem of the project requires extended mean field control, where the extension lies in the fact that not only the probability distribution of the state, but also the probability distribution of the control enters in the model, and/or in the cost functional to be minimized. It is a new branch of the general theory, which the investigators will develop and apply to energy markets and related problems. The second problem regards nonlocal dependence, which the investigators will apply to the well-established domain of stochastic control with partial information, providing new insights from a mean field point of view. The mathematical techniques involved will include Hamilton-Jacobi equations on infinite dimensional spaces, backward stochastic partial differential equations, and forward-backward systems of nonlocal equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tufts professor Allan Cormack provided the mathematical foundations of X-ray computed tomography, winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1979 for this work. This international conference will honor his achievements and expand on his legacy by gathering top international researchers in mathematics, engineering, science, and medicine to communicate current research challenges and to inspire new lines of inquiry. Image reconstruction plays a crucial role in many aspects of human life such as healthcare, national security, non-destructive testing, and geophysical exploration - all of which will be represented at this conference. Image reconstruction involves the determination of features of an object based on some measured or observed data from the exterior of the object. The measurements are acquired using data from X-rays, pressure waves, sound waves, electric current, etc. The recovery of the object from this data is known as an inverse problem, which is solved using either analytic reconstruction formulas or iterative methods. The conference is structured to provide cross-fertilization between fields and to provide opportunities for senior and junior researchers to interact. This will be promoted at several levels: between subject areas; between prominent and younger researchers; and with a very strong emphasis on discussions between graduate students and established researchers. Graduate students and those new to the field will be encouraged to participate in a poster session in which they will present their research. Diverse groups of faculty and students will be recruited through broad advertising. Results are planned to be disseminated in a special issue of one of the premier journals in the field of inverse problems and, when possible, talks will be posted on the conference website https://math.tufts.edu/faculty/equinto/Cormack2019/.<br/><br/>A large portion of the conference will involve the following topics: X-ray, optical, photo-acoustic, multi-energy, Compton, and multi-spectral tomography. The conference will also include dynamic tomography and limited data problems. Conference themes include the mathematics and algorithms behind tomographic reconstruction, including machine learning, data diversity, sparse sampling, regularization, dictionary learning, and related approaches. Along with this, lectures will be given on the theoretical underpinnings of tomography including integral geometry and microlocal reconstruction. Finally, the conference will deal with applications including those in medical, security, and industrial domains. These topics are highly interrelated and the conference will serve as an avenue for researchers to share their insights and results among the different specializations. Researchers from pure, applied, and computational mathematics and computer science, as well as from science, industry, and medicine will participate in the conference. This will facilitate new collaborations among participants from the different areas to target opportunities for synergy across disciplines to catalyze new research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, we are exploring a novel mechanism we have discovered through which particles suspended within such layered systems are seen to attract each other and self-assemble, forming large disc like clusters.  The mechanism for this attraction involves fluid flows which the particles themselves create from being in a layered fluid.  Such clusters occur ubiquitously in lakes and oceans, where they can provide food sources for a variety of organisms, or result in concentrations of polluting particles. The origins of these clusters may well lie within this new aggregate formation mechanism under exploration within this award. Graduate students will be involved in the project. <br/><br/>Specifically, the award will undertake a combined theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigation of a newly discovered hydrodynamic interaction between particles in a stratified ambient environment. Recent experimental work by the PIs at the UNC Joint Fluids Lab have demonstrated that passive particles suspended in a density-stratified environment interact through self-induced flows which can result in approaching  one and another over time until coming into contact. Collections of many particles tend to aggregate and self-assemble into large-scale 2D structures due to this newly identified attraction mechanism. The project aims to characterize this newly-identified interaction effect in nature for the first time, through novel asymptotic methods, numerical simulations, and careful experimentation.  The research will explore the complex interplay between diffusion, advection, and geometry (through physical boundary conditions) in inducing new collective phenomena. This requires developing novel computational, asymptotic, and experimental methods for extracting quantitative predictions from the parent Navier-Stokes equations coupled through the viscous stress tensor to particles suspended in stratified environments. The new asymptotic methods developed as part of this proposal will also prove useful for a wider range of problems in fluid dynamics and potential theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Laser pulses exceeding tens of gigawatts power can be used in many applications including remote sensing through Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), lightning and weather control and free-space optics communication. Current research on free space optical communications (FSO), both classical and quantum, is intended to facilitate exchange of information within a network of satellites, between the Earth and satellites and between the Earth and drones. This and other aspects to be studied, such as diffraction control, are in line with topics within Quantum Leap, one of the NSF's 10 Big Ideas. In searching for optimal performance, it is critical to seek better understanding of a range of spatial and temporal effects that take place while light interacts with molecules in the atmosphere. For this, proper mathematical and numerical modeling assist experimentalists to for example consider novel modes of propagation (optical filaments versus vortex filaments) and the possible coexistence of multi- color (multi-frequency) filaments. Research performed under this award will have a strong synergy with experimental groups, enriching the interdisciplinary nature of the project and enhancing the learning experience of applied mathematics graduate students to be trained in a multifaceted approach.<br/><br/>Under the general theme of light matter interactions, the PI and students will investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of light propagation in nonlinear media. The research addresses well defined questions related to the characterization of highly nonlinear optical modes of different types  (filament modes, vortex modes and combinations) in three different media: air (Kerr media), carrying two frequencies (typically ultraviolet and infrared), nonlinear crystals (quadratic media) where little is known on the theory of filament formation at phase mismatch  and on the formation of filaments in discrete/continuum nonlinear media with fractional diffraction and quadratic dispersion. The first two topics represent significant extensions of ongoing research in filament science, based either on recent experimental observations or potential new experiments on which the PI has been and will be directly involved.

Traditionally, the field has been dominated by the use of models based on deterministic ordinary or partial differential equations. Two major advances are changing this approach. The first one is the advent of big data and the different mathematical tools that allow for the deduction of models not based on physical principles but deduced from observations. The second is the recognition of the role played by uncertainty and the impact it has on mathematical modeling, leading to the need for stochastic analysis tools. Our forward-looking meeting combines a workshop and a conference.

To achieve this objective, we propose to establish the Data-Intensive Research And Computing (DIRAC) Research Training Group (RTG). The DIRAC RTG leverages strengths of the UC Merced Applied Mathematics faculty to provide undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers a training experience that prepares them for careers in academia, industry, and government. A key challenge is that computational and data-enabled sciences involve inextricable ties between mathematics, science, technology, and engineering. UC Merced Applied Mathematics is well positioned to address this challenge because of its three main approaches to science that will be at the core of this RTG: (1) modeling of physical and biological systems, (2) scientific computing, and (3) data analysis. To provide its trainees a collaborative training experience in computational and data-enabled sciences, the DIRAC RTG will foster Small Mentoring and Research Training (SMaRT) teams, which are vertically integrated, community-based mentoring structures, each centered on one of four research themes: (I) energy and the environment, (II) sensing and imaging, (III) mathematical biology, and (IV) numerical analysis. These SMaRT teams will provide support to individuals, guide their training, and produce a well-trained, nimble workforce that can contribute to the fast-paced modern computational research. Additionally, the DIRAC RTG is committed to serving the underrepresented and first-generation students that UC Merced Applied Mathematics actively recruits into its undergraduate and graduate programs. Built into each SMaRT Team are active measures for recruiting inclusive teams of trainees, providing continuous mentorship and support to retain these trainees, and developing the professional skills of trainees needed to succeed upon completion of this training program.<br/><br/>Computational and data sciences are new paradigms for scientific inquiry and discovery that incorporate mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge. Since computational and data-enabled sciences are relatively new, their natural and effective integration into existing training programs in mathematics remains to be perfected.  This RTG project brings together the entire Applied Mathematics faculty of UC Merced with the common goal of developing a modernized and comprehensive training program for undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral associates that integrates these subjects in a natural and effective way and prepares the trainees for successful careers in academia, government, and industry in a broad range of fields. The proposed RTG project has three major components: (1) a balanced curriculum tightly integrated with research which is modernized to reflect the current needs in computational and data-enabled sciences; (2) a vertically integrated mentoring program that engages undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral associates, and faculty participants; and (3)  the development of extensive, dynamic, and supportive communities focused on education, research, and professional development. The thematic research areas considered focus on timely and important issues and are divided into (I) energy and the environment, (II) sensing and imaging, (III) mathematical biology, and (IV) numerical analysis. This training program focuses on enhancing each trainee's skills and experience in the process of research (as opposed to just the products of research) and provides practical teaching training, communication skills, and professional development. The activities in this RTG are crucial to making systematic improvements to the existing training program at UC Merced, which can then serve as a model for other programs. These institutional changes will profoundly transform mathematics programs and have long-lasting impact on training the future generations of computational and data-enabled scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At small scales, say micro and nano scales, surface tension and bending effects dominate bulk effects, thereby making the actuation and control of small devices a reality.  This leads to scientifically interesting and technologically useful configurations and dynamic behavior.  Examples abound in biomedical sciences (drug delivery vesicles, cell encapsulation devices, and sensors) and engineering (photovoltaic devices, optics, energy storage, micromotors, microgrippers, microvalves, and adaptive deformable mirrors).  However, microfabrication is time-consuming, expensive, and often erratic, which makes the development of predictive computational tools of paramount importance in engineering and science.  This project deals with modeling, analysis, and computation of geometric problems of interest in materials science, biophysics, plasma physics, and robotics.  It enhances modeling and prediction capabilities and helps educate students and postdocs in exciting, mathematically and computationally challenging, and practically relevant areas of contemporary research.<br/><br/>Capturing the essential behavior of nonlinear phenomena with the simplest and crudest models is fundamental in science and engineering.  This allows for understanding of basic mechanisms, the design and implementation of efficient numerical methods for simulation and control of devices, and the analysis of both models and algorithms.  These crucial aspects of modern research are incorporated into the following four intertwined projects: geometric PDEs with constraints (bilayer actuators and prestrained films, shape optimization for plasma confinement, and fully nonlinear PDEs); actuation of complex fluids (liquid crystals actuated by electric fields and temperature, and ferrofluids actuated by magnetic fields); nonlocal models (efficient solvers for linear and nonlinear fractional diffusion and stochastic control); a posteriori error analysis and adaptivity (high-order methods, fractional PDEs, and free boundary problems).  Numerical treatment of nonlinear geometric PDEs is a formidable scientific challenge due to the dynamic deformation of geometries, the presence of strong nonlinearities, and the development of self-penetrating structures and topological changes.  Efficient algorithms should optimize and balance the computational effort and thus capture small scales without over-resolving others, thereby leading to accurate interface description.  This project develops structure-preserving finite element methods (FEMs) with a posteriori error control (adaptive FEMs) and multilevel solvers, which allow for the resolution of problems with very disparate space-time scales with relatively modest computational resources.  The roles of geometry, nonlinearity, nonlocality, and adaptive approximation permeate the research, from basic questions in numerical analysis of nonlinear PDEs to applications in strategic areas of national interest.

While many analytical tools currently exist for studying water waves of small amplitude, this project focuses on developing new machinery to construct large-amplitude waves and to investigate their ability to persist under small perturbations. Another objective of this project is to understand how energy evolves in response to the interaction between a fluid and a solid. Results from this project will advance the mathematical theory of water waves and contribute to understanding of other mathematical models in fluid mechanics and other related branches of applied science and engineering. This research also involves training and collaboration with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>This project will develop a rigorous study of some nonlinear partial differential equations arising from water waves and other fluid models, extending some of the analytic techniques to related contexts, and integrating the research to the education of undergraduate and graduate students. Specifically, the proposed research addresses three separate directions regarding the existence and qualitative properties of the solutions to the water wave problem as well as other physically significant systems: (1) using a novel global bifurcation theoretic machinery to construct large-amplitude front-type  solutions  and  solitary  wave solutions to a two-phase fluid system in a channel, and extend this global theory to handle traveling waves that evolve according to more general symmetry groups; (2) proving the spectral stability of solitary waves to some long-wave water wave  model  which  are  indefinite energy saddles; (3) establishing  exact  energy equality for a fluid-interaction model and deriving sufficient conditions for the weak inviscid limit of Navier-Stokes solutions in domains with boundary.

A pressing challenge for the world scientific community, and the topic of this award, is to better understand the dynamical role of water and its influence on atmospheric energetics. A better understanding would help shape future social and economic policy decisions. In particular, more accurate prediction of extreme rainfall events has the potential to save human lives, as well as to better mitigate hundreds of billions of dollars in disaster losses. In addition to advancing scientific and mathematical understanding, the proposed activities also support the training of junior researchers with interdisciplinary expertise. To position these new researchers for future success, mentoring will be provided by the PIs to develop the knowledge, skills and experience necessary for integrating mathematics with the atmospheric sciences. For example, modern weather prediction relies on incorporation of physical insight and observational data into numerical algorithms to solve the mathematical description of atmospheric dynamics in terms of equations. Furthermore, beyond weather predictions themselves are the users of weather predictions, such as government agencies, the insurance industry and other businesses.  To assess the risks associated with weather events and their impacts, technical skills are needed in both mathematics and atmospheric sciences.<br/><br/>Phase changes of water are a key part of the hydrological cycle. Of particular importance for weather is the phase change from water vapor to liquid water within clouds, and the subsequent formation of precipitation. The heat released from these phase changes can drive atmospheric circulations, and, conversely, atmospheric circulations shape the formation of cloud patterns and precipitation. This coupling between water and atmospheric fluid dynamics is nonlinear and remains a challenge to understand. The award activities aim to improve our fundamental understanding--both mathematical and physical--of moist atmospheric dynamics with phase changes, with attention to high precipitation events. To meet this aim, a hierarchy of partial differential equations will be studied in order to elucidate foundation aspects of such flows, such as: the influence of waves on large-scale balanced flows; the transfer of energy between kinetic, potential and latent energies; and the propagation of sharp interfaces between unsaturated and saturated flow regions. The methods to be used include asymptotical analysis of wave dynamics in the presence of phase changes, construction of discontinuous analytical solutions, observational data analysis based on energy principles and balance relations, and numerical modeling. Extreme rainfall events in the mid-latitudes are always associated with large poleward fluxes of moisture originating from the tropics, such as the structures called 'atmospheric rivers.' The phenomena of atmospheric rivers and their associated jet streaks are one of the central observations proposed for application studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's topics arise in model selection techniques (used in applications such as the identification of social networks and the selection of covariates that best inform health outcomes), in imaging applications, and in the dynamics, tracking, and control of waste streams and of vehicles.  Commonly in applications the objective function (the function to be optimized) may be nonsmooth, nonconvex, or high-dimensional; each of these features presents major challenges for classical optimization methods.  A key aspect of the project is the use of nonsmooth techniques that allow for the introduction or discovery of special properties in the desired solution, such as sparsity, stability, and robustness.  The work falls into four main areas.  The first concerns study of the BFGS method and matrix secant methods for nonsmooth convex optimization (why BFGS works as well as it does is unclear), and the design of algorithms that automatically discover a so-called UV-decomposition of the objective function.  Here the U is the smooth part and the V is the nonsmooth part.  Such decompositions are essential for rapid solution identification as they allow one to follow a smooth valley (U) with steep sides (V) toward the optimal solution.  The second examines the rate at which a solution is obtained as well as its accuracy, depending on functional and parameter inputs.  The third examines the determination of optimal stability and control of linear dynamical systems occurring, for example, in orbital dynamics or drug metabolism.  The goal here is to help recognize optimal solutions.  Indeed, in many cases methods for identifying optimality remain unknown.  The final task concerns the development of novel smoothing methodologies for optimization problems over matrix spaces, such as those occurring in social network discovery.  These problems are typically very high-dimensional, and nonsmoothness of the objective function is the key to discovering hidden structures within the data.  Here the goal is to develop smooth approximations whose solution can be rapidly computed and whose proximity to the true solution is precisely controlled.  Graduate students participate in the research.<br/><br/>More technically, the areas of study are (i) BFGS and matrix secant methods for nonsmooth convex optimization, (ii) local and global convergence theory for convex-composite optimization, (iii) variational analysis of spectral functions for non-symmetric matrices, and (iv) the generalized matrix fractional function and smoothing on matrix spaces.  The study of BFGS methods focuses on the relationship between the iterates and smooth, convex, uniform approximations.  The study of convex composite problems analyses the behavior of algorithms using Robinson's method of generalized equation.  The study of nonsymmetric matrices focuses on extending variational techniques to the difficult nonderogatory case.  The final area considers the embedding of a wide range of matrix optimization problems in a smooth setting by the use of infimal projection with the generalized matrix fractional function introduced by the investigator and collaborators.

Its focus is on the development of new mathematical models and efficient numerical methods to study the morphology and control of drops, cells, and vesicles by electric fields in electrolytic fluids and by flow fields with surfactant. Electrokinetic techniques are among the most common methods for manipulating soft particles and ionic fluids in micro-scale and biological applications and can induce, for example, shape changes in cells and vesicles, from which membrane properties can be inferred. They can also induce membrane channel and pore formation for advanced cell treatment and therapy. Surfactants are used to enhance or control a wide range of complex fluid flows that occur in industries ranging from oil extraction to agriculture, food, and pharmaceutical processing. They are also important in microfluidic applications. Impacts of the proposed research include the development of new mathematical models and numerical methods that will be of benefit to scientists and engineers studying electrokinetic and surfactant phenomena in biology and engineering. An additional impact of this project is the education and involvement of graduate students. The interdisciplinary training they receive will be valuable preparation for a range of careers in mathematics and science.<br/><br/>During the deformation of a fluid-fluid interface with surfactant, surfactant exchange between the interface and bulk occur in a thin layer adjacent to the interface, and the layer's dynamics control interfacial surface tension and shape. During the interfacial flow of an ionic fluid that is driven by an electric field, a thin screening cloud of ions develops at the interface to form an electrochemical double layer or 'Debye layer'. The electric field induces motion in the ion cloud, the interface, and the surrounding fluid. The influence of surfactants on interface and flow dynamics and the occurrence of 'induced-charge electrokinetic flow' in an ionic fluid are both important phenomena in a wide range of applications. This project addresses a difficulty in the numerical computation of such flows in the practically important limit of thin surfactant exchange layers and thin electrical double layers, by developing fast and accurate 'hybrid' or multiscale numerical methods that incorporate an asymptotic analysis of the layer dynamics into a boundary integral or similar formulation of the interfacial free boundary problem. Central themes of the current project are the development of a hybrid method for electrokinetic flow about a deformable membrane and the investigation of fast and accurate numerical methods for studying the influence of surfactant and ionic surfactant on interfacial flow. The algorithm for electrokinetic flow will incorporate an analysis of the high-wavenumber or small-scale component of the elastic and electrostatic stresses on a membrane into a nonstiff method that is capable of handling the multiple time and space scales inherent in the problem. The method will be used to study canonical problems in the deformation of drops, vesicles, and cells, and to explore the interaction between membrane and ionic fluid properties. In the context of surfactant-laden flows, the hybrid numerical method will be developed to accurately handle multiply connected domains with close interaction of interfaces, such as occurs with multiple drops, and the presence of surfactant in the interior fluid, both of which are associated with substantial numerical challenges. This project also involves the development of fast or accelerated algorithms, including for drops in 3D flow with soluble surfactant, as well a fundamental analysis of the stability and convergence of the boundary integral methods that are a cornerstone of this work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop mathematical models that explain how parts of the tear film function, and the principal investigators will work closely with leading optometrists to achieve this goal.  One main thrust of the project will use mathematical models as a way to identify the conditions when the tear film fails, which is often called tear breakup. Computer-generated answers to models that simulate tear breakup can be used to determine local quantities in that cannot be measured experimentally; these quantities are crucial to understanding the mechanisms behind tear breakup and the causes for some instances of dry eye.  The other main thrust will use two-layer fluid models to understand the function of the layer much better than is currently known.  The lipid layer floats atop an aqueous layer; the lipid layer is a more complex fluid than water, and the aqueous layer can be assumed to act like water.  New, more complex models for the floating lipid layer will be developed: the lipid layer will be treated as a so-called liquid crystal.  We will solve models for the two layers together and compare them to experimental results.  We expect to explain some lipid layer patterns seen experimentally on the eye, and we will solve new mathematical problems to obtain these explanations.  Both thrusts of the project will advance our understanding of the tear film and dry eye, as well as advance applied mathematics. The award will provide graduate student training through research.<br/><br/>The PIs will investigate the dynamics of thin fluid film models that may be applied to the tear film on the human eye.  The two-layer film there has an oily lipid layer floating atop an aqueous layer. There is growing evidence that the floating lipid layer is a liquid crystal in many instances.  However, there are essentially no models derived or solved for such two-layer films.  In the first main thrust of the project, we propose to develop fundamental models for nematic and smectic A liquid crystals floating on water.  In the second main thrust of the project, we also develop parameter identification methods for tear film models through a sequence of problems that will ultimately lead to identifying physical processes responsible for observed physiological tear breakup in the tear film.  The project will draw upon the thin liquid film and liquid crystal literature, solve new models for these films, and prove the effectiveness of parameter identification methods on noisy data generated computationally.  The project will also involve optometrists to test the theories on observed data.   The PIs will combine modeling, analytical and computational approaches, together with experimental data from our collaborators, to advance understanding of two-layer films composed of liquid crystals floating on Newtonian fluids (water). Deriving these complex models and solving them on stationary and moving domains are substantial mathematical challenges.  For example, the PIs are unaware of any extensional flow thin film models for smectic A liquid crystals; we will derive and solve models for both free and floating extensional layers.  Applying parameter identification approaches to determine parameters on noisy test data for a hierarchy of film models will enable identification of parameters in these complex fluid systems.  Beyond significant results in dynamics of complex fluids, the results of the project will enable ocular surface researchers to better understand thin film dynamics and the function of the tear film.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a development will increase our ability to control practical systems. Due to physical and technological limitations, available ways of perturbing a mechanical system are often constrained. For example, it is difficult to individually force single atoms in order to control a molecular system. On the other hand, partial intervention is often easier; for instance, an oscillatory electromagnetic field can interact with charged atoms and induce perturbations to the system, which are however in restricted forms. When the available perturbations are restricted, they may be inadequate to induce immediate favorable changes to the system. However, the key idea is that, if introduced at a smaller scale, perturbations can accumulate and contribute in less restrictive ways to the original scale. Based on this idea, the project develops a framework for designing the perturbation so that its accumulated effect can alter the system's macroscopic behavior in a desired fashion. Numerical computations and the development of computational tools will also be seamlessly integrated with the theoretical analysis. To illustrate the innovation of the proposed research, note that traditional control theory is still important, albeit insufficient, because the control is introduced at a microscopic level, yet one needs and only needs to control the system's macroscopic behavior. Brute-force computational search for the optimal control will also be practically infeasible due to the wide breadth of scales presented in the system. The research is to use theoretical analysis (based on tools from fields such as dynamical systems and multiscale methods) to either directly design or accelerate the computational search of control strategies. The study will also be complemented by investigations in multiple interdisciplinary applications, such as DNA deactivation, remote control of locomotion, temporal metamaterials, and recovery of material defects. Research will be integrated with education across multiple institutions and over the spectrum of academic levels. Specifics are planned for broadening women and underrepresented groups' participation and disseminating knowledge beyond PI's immediate institute or discipline.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project identifies (mostly-)oscillatory perturbations for accomplishing various control tasks, such as to steer a system from a macroscopic state to another, or to track a desired dynamic behavior at the macroscopic level for all time. The main methodology is to design microscopic perturbations that resonantly interact with the system, so that nontrivial effects cascade to the macroscopic scale. The PI has already obtained several preliminary results on this idea, and the proposed theory will be a generalization. The strategy of investigation is to first quantify how small-scale perturbations effectively accumulate at large-scale using dynamical systems tools, asymptotic/multiscale methods, and numerical computations, followed by the patching together of the local understandings for the global objective of control design. An example of core tasks is to identify and then track slowly-varying resonant frequencies in nonlinear systems. Integrable, nearly-integrable, and stochastic systems will be considered, so that an ambitious goal of controlling complicated dynamics can be gradually approached.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, some essential questions, such as the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions, are still not answered. Therefore, a notion of weak solutions, whose existence is known, has been extensively used by mathematicians. The PI will demonstrate a limitation of this notion by constructing weak solutions with various unphysical properties. On the other hand, the developed technique will allow the PI to study physical solutions that are expected to describe turbulence. Turbulence, often referred to as the last unsolved problem in classical physics, is a fundamental and ubiquitous hydrodynamical and aerodynamical phenomenon occurring in nature, in engineering, and in environmental applications. This research will involve graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>Kolmogorov's theory of turbulence is based on the assumption that eddies are densely packed at each length scale, which has been invalidated in numerous experiments and numerical simulations. It turns out that the eddies are packed somewhat loosely, a phenomenon called intermittency. In this project the PI will study how the intermittency can be defined mathematically and measured experimentally; how the intermittency affects regularity properties of weak solutions to the 3D NSE and their ability to satisfy the energy equality; how one can derive rigorous bounds on intermittency and justify scaling turbulence laws for solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE).

Most of the available displays operate close to physical limits, and the constant demand for faster and more efficient devices has made the search for new materials the focus of the industry. Bent-core liquid crystals differ from the standard materials used in flat panels and portable displays in that the special shape of their molecules allows for ferroelectric behavior and intrinsic bistability at a lower manufacturing cost. That is, they have potential for superior operational speed, resolution, and efficiency at a competitive production cost as well as a wider spectrum of commercial applications which include spatial light modulators (SLMs), optical memories, optical computers and high-resolution microdisplays.

Many physical and biological systems fall into this category, with oscillating chemical reactions being prototypical.  In this case, one has for instance a solution that oscillates between two colors when it is well mixed, but when diffusion occurs interesting patterns, such as target and spiral waves, form.  Such patterns arise in many other systems in biology, chemistry, and materials sciences, with applications in medicine and technology.  Most of what is known about pattern formation in oscillatory media assumes that elements communicate locally via a diffusion process, as in an oscillating chemical reaction.  But recent experiments and analysis show that nonlocal coupling can give rise to previously unknown states.  For example, chemical reactions with a nonlocal diffusion process can exhibit structures characterized by regions of synchrony mixed with regions of complete incoherence.  These structures, called chimera states, also have been found in other systems with local, nonlocal, and global coupling.  Although their existence and stability have been established in the case of arrays of phase oscillators, not much is known about the relationship between the form of coupling and the resulting pattern.  The aim of this project is to construct a general mathematical framework that relates properties of the coupling to the emergence and control of these and other novel patterns.  Undergraduate students participate in the research of the project.<br/><br/>This project focuses on oscillating chemical reactions with an effective nonlocal diffusion process, which can be the result of one of the variables evolving at a faster rate.  To address the emergence of new patterns due to nonlocal coupling, the existence of spiral chimeras and localized target patterns is investigated and conditions that give rise to these states are studied.  To address control of patterns, the effects of nonlocal feedback on a spiral's core are also explored.  To achieve these objectives, the investigator develops a mathematical theory for convolution operators that relates the shape of their Fourier symbol to properties of the coupling, such as coupling strength and radius.  Because patterns bifurcate from a known steady state when a parameter is varied, the existence of patterns is approached from the point of view of perturbation theory.

These systems arise in a wide variety of contexts in the physical, biological, and social sciences as well as engineering, and this project focuses on the mathematical study of such long-time behavior in a variety of models with a specific focus on those arising in plasma physics, turbulent combustion, and population dynamics.  Two major fundamental challenges in the models considered are the existence of multiple temporal and spatial scales and nonlocal interactions.  The former requires developing an understanding of how small-scale oscillations ""average out"" over long time scales; for instance, in flame propagation, a ""small"" random drift produces fluctuations of the front whose statistics are given by limiting stochastic equation.  The latter requires determining the impact of complex long-range interactions.  A typical example considered in this project is the influence of chemotaxis (which is the phenomenon in which each individual bacterium ""senses"" other bacteria and moves towards the population center) on bacterial invasions.  In both cases, the aim is to determine which features of the systems are predictable and under what conditions such predictions hold.  Various educational activities, including the training of young researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate level, are planned.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop technical tools that allow to better characterize the effects of stochastic fluctuations of the environment and nonlocal interactions between individuals affects the long-time behavior of solutions to several reaction-diffusion, Hamilton-Jacobi, and kinetic equations.  The project breaks down into two major portions.  The first encompasses front propagation problems in which a moving interface separating two states emerges.  The shape and dynamics of this interface are strongly related to the fluctuations of the media and to internal interactions.  The second is the regularity and boundedness of kinetic models coming from plasma physics.  New estimates of solutions to these equations continue to emerge via the application of ideas from the parabolic theory.  The goal is to combine these ideas with a precise understanding of nonlocal effects in order to weaken current restrictions on the well-posedness theory and develop physically reasonable conditions under which blow-up is prevented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Swift advances in the field of spintronics - an emergent discipline that aims to take advantage of the intrinsic spin of electron in addition to its electric charge for computing and data storage - present new challenges for mathematical modeling, analysis and simulations of these materials, which need to keep pace with the progress in material design. The aim of this project is to provide efficient theoretical treatments of the next generation of magnetic materials within the general micromagnetic modeling framework down to nanoscale. Its focus on magnetic skyrmions and other coherent structures is strongly motivated by the ongoing development of new spintronic hardware for neuromorphic computing inspired by biological neural networks and particularly suited for deep learning.  The nonlinear, nonlocal and multiscale nature of the problems make it into a formidable problem of the 21st century applied mathematics. Nevertheless, both the need to develop new mathematical and computational tools to tackle the genuine complexity of these systems and their potential to revolutionize computer technologies make these fundamental challenges very exciting. <br/><br/>The investigator undertakes a combination of modeling, analytical, asymptotic and computational studies of layered ferromagnetic materials of current interest to spintronic applications. Due to the increased dominance of interfacial effects at nanoscale, the three-dimensional micromagnetic modeling framework must incorporate new types of boundary terms. This new physics often results in surprising effects near the material boundaries and gives rise to novel types of edge magnetization structures such as edge-curling walls, edge vortices and chiral bobbers. The investigator plans to formulate micromagnetic models of ferromagnetic films that exhibit interfacial magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, derive the reduced two-dimensional models appropriate for thin films and develop efficient computational tools to simulate current and stochastically driven systems. Next, within the obtained class of the reduced models, the investigator plans to undertake a study of several types of coherent structures supported by these materials, such as magnetic skyrmions in extended and patterned ultrathin films, spin textures in nanowires, and various edge structures. The questions of existence and asymptotic properties of these coherent structures give rise to challenging problems of energy-driven pattern formation and calculus of variations. A key component of the project is the involvement of a new generation of applied mathematicians into this highly interdisciplinary area of research. As part of this process, the investigator develops courses in applied sciences and takes part in interdisciplinary training of mathematics and engineering graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs. It is hoped that the project will also help foster better interactions between applied mathematicians and experimentalists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since drilling or cutting is often expensive or unfeasible in these situations, these objects are probed by non-invasive methods such as sound waves generated on the boundary of the object. The expectation is that the interior composition of the object will influence the incoming waves and the response wave, also measured only on the boundary of the object, provides a mathematical window into the interior of the object. The principal investigator (PI) will study the mathematics behind this imaging technique. Further, the PI will train graduate students and postdocs in this type of mathematics through mini-courses, seminars, personal conversations and workshops. Some of these students and postdocs will use these skills to solve practical problems for companies exploring for oil, building imaging devices, or involved in remote sensing.<br/><br/>Problems like those described above, but with over-determined data, where the unknown function depends on fewer variables than the data, have received a lot of attention. The PI focuses on the less studied formally determined problems where the unknown function depends on the same number of variables as the data. Such problems, in two or more space dimensions, are harder but very useful in situations where data acquisition is difficult, and their investigation is one of the important challenges in the field. This project will study the following problems in three space dimensions: the fixed angle scattering problem, the backscattering problem, the point source problem, and the incoming spherical wave problem. Recently, using an adaptation of the Bukhgeim-Klibanov method, the PI and his collaborators proved stability for the fixed angle scattering problem for coefficients which are even in one of the variables and proved uniqueness for the problem of recovering a coefficient given data from the point source problem as well as the incoming spherical wave problem.

For example, how do the thousands of heart cells that form the heart's natural pacemaker network manage to fire an electrical pulse simultaneously?  How does a flock of birds or school of fish organize so as to fly or swim together?  What causes a population of fireflies to flash in unison?  How can we prevent a single component failure in a large power grid from cascading through the entire network?  The investigators' particular interest is in networks of oscillators, in which the individual components cycle periodically in time.  Oscillator networks can exhibit a variety of collective behaviors, ranging in simplicity from complete synchronization, when all the oscillators behave in unison, to more complex patterns such as chimera states, where part of the network is synchronized while the rest exhibits asynchronous behavior.  The investigators develop mathematical tools, using geometry, group theory, and dimensional reduction, to greatly simplify the analysis of oscillator networks and their stability.  The virtue of this approach is that the behavior of a large network with many variables can be precisely described using only a small number of equations.  They use these methods to design and analyze networks with applications to reservoir computing and machine learning, an important and developing area of modern data analysis.  An important ramification of this work is to forge interdisciplinary collaborations between the more applied study of oscillator dynamics and the pure mathematical study of low-dimensional geometry.  Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/>The central theme of this project is the application of geometric and group-theoretic techniques to the study of networks of Kuramoto and more general types of oscillators.  The application of geometric techniques makes possible the explicit description of the dynamics on group orbits.  Building on on their earlier work using this methodology, the investigators take up four topics.  The first classifies higher degree order parameter functions that have a geometric (gradient) structure similar to the classic Kuramoto model with first degree order parameter.  Topic 2 uses geometric techniques to understand the dynamics of multi-population models, particularly to clarify the dynamics of chimera states, which are states with some but not all of the populations completely synchronized.

DENs are metric graphs with differential equations defined on the edges coupled by matching conditions at the vertices. DENs play a fundamental role in many problems of science and engineering. On the atomistic scale, physicists work with quantum dots and quantum waveguides. On the nanoscale, chemical engineers are interested in mechanical properties of nanorods. On the mesoscale, fiber networks modeled by strings and beams are crucial for tissue engineering, whereas on the macroscale grid structures involving pipes, plates and shells appear in civil and mechanical engineering. Control and inverse theories of DENs constitute an important part of the rapidly developing area of analysis on graphs. Being tremendously important for applications, these theories have not been, however, sufficiently developed. Control, observation and identification problems were studied almost exclusively for trees, i.e. graphs without cycles, although general DENs, which may contain cycles, are more important for applications. The project provides excellent training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In this project, the principal investigator (PI) and his collaborators will develop a unified approach to control, observation, and identification of general DENs. This approach is based on the Boundary Control (BC) method in inverse theory, which uses deep connections between observability and identifiability of dynamical systems. The main results of the project will be: (a) uniqueness and stability conditions for solving inverse problems for DENs and effective algorithms for identifying the systems' parameters; and (b) controllability and observability conditions of the dynamical systems described by DENs and the methods for constructing the corresponding control and observation. The central idea is a proper choice of observations in the form of directional derivatives of the solutions to PDEs on graphs at some boundary and internal vertices to guarantee observability and identifiability of the corresponding systems. For general DENs, we will specify the sets of vertices where sensors and/or actuators should be situated. Another component of our approach is a new effective leaf-peeling (LP) method for solving inverse problems for differential equations on trees that has been recently developed  by the PI and his collaborators. In the current project we plan to extend this method to general graphs with cycles. Based on the BC and LP methods, numerical algorithms for solving inverse and control problems for general DENs will be developed and extensive numerical experiments will be performed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is achieved by fabricating novel media in which energy, which propagates as waves, interacts with engineered microfeatures. A current example of a novel, naturally occurring, medium of intense interest is graphene a one-atom thick mono-layer of carbon atoms, arranged in-plane in a honeycomb structure, extending to the macro-scale. Graphene is the most conductive substance known at room temperature (electronically and thermally).

PI Weinstein will study a range of problems in fundamental and applied mathematics related to the existence, stability and transport properties of waves in such novel media, with honeycomb structures as a paradigm for 2D materials, as well as questions concerning the dynamics of waves in nonlinear systems.

Additionally, these new techniques can accelerate the process of drug discovery and development by minimizing the cost of imaging of molecules.

Often these convert toxic compounds into harmless byproducts.  One such example is the cleanup of gasoline that has leaked into a groundwater aquifer.  Unfortunately, current mathematical models and computational methods that assume the reactants are well mixed fail to accurately predict the duration or rate of these reactions, primarily due to the poor mixing of associated reactants.  Recent studies show that mixing-limited reactions play a dominant role in most Earth-bound systems across a wide range of scales, including reactions in atmospheric plumes, granular and fractured aquifers, sedimentary (e.g., petroleum-generating and carbon-dioxide-sequestering) basins, hydrothermal areas, and ore bodies.  Imperfect mixing and modified dynamics also occur at the nanometer to micron scale in space and picosecond to microsecond scale in time, revealing the ubiquity of mixing-limited reaction, from molecular to global scales.  Hence imperfect mixing poses a significant theoretical and practical problem because most current models of reactive transport in hydrological systems are based on empirical adjustments to classical laws, which are built upon the flawed well-mixed assumption.  In order to make reliable predictions in such systems, improved methods are critical for scientists and engineers, and ultimately decision makers, stakeholders, and policy developers working in fields such as environmental contamination and remediation.  This project develops new computational methods to simulate chemical transport and reaction dynamics, with applications to a variety of fields, including climate-change related atmospheric reactions as well as ecological and micro-biochemical systems.  Graduate students participate in the research.<br/><br/>The investigators recently developed new computational models that demonstrate the need for new methods to simulate reactions in imperfectly-mixed chemical systems.  These stochastic Lagrangian methods directly track particle positions and calculate reactions based on the probability that particles are co-located.  The methods correspond to perturbation expansions of the classical diffusion-reaction equation and also match several benchmark experiments.  In this project, new algorithms are developed that account for random particle migration time and the statistical structure of initial conditions to properly simulate subgrid fluctuations.  Preliminary studies show that the methods work well for bimolecular reactions in simple systems, but it remains to be proven that such techniques can be extended to more complicated reactions, geometries, and flow fields.  Additionally, the investigators build upon a continuum approach to simulate reactions and track the growth of concentration perturbations.  Finally, they construct and extend Lagrangian numerical methods that are known to be accurate and efficient, to benchmark theoretical results and facilitate large-scale reactive simulations.  The approaches are unified through detailed mathematical analyses and applications to well-studied laboratory and field experiments.

The first one deals with so-called twist maps -- a basic building block in studying almost every kind of moving or stationary physical system where friction is negligible.  As an illustrating example, a twist map can arise from the equation governing the distribution of electrons in models of crystal lattices.  Prior work by the investigator suggests an unexpected mathematical effect; interpreted for the case of a crystal lattice, this general mathematical result amounts to an unexpectedly low electric resistance.  The mechanism of this effect is not understood, and the investigator works to develop a mathematical theory explaining it.  The second part of the project deals in particular with the recently discovered ""ponderomotive magnetism.""  Recall that any change in an electric field gives rise to a magnetic field, as has been known since Faraday.  Surprisingly, a superficially similar effect takes place in mechanics (without electric fields present), as was discovered only recently by the investigator and collaborators.  For example, particles in the gravitational field of a spinning (non-spherical) asteroid behave as if they were charged and in the presence of a magnetic field -- with neither charge nor the field actually present.  This is a mysterious and fundamental mathematical phenomenon.  A goal of this project is to develop a geometrical explanation of this effect using tools of differential geometry.  The third part of the project explores the recently discovered connection between Hill's equation (ubiquitous in innumerable problems in physics and engineering) on the one hand, and the ""tire track"" problem on the other.  The main value of this topic lies in unifying and simplifying two seemingly distinct areas of mathematics, resulting in richer understanding of both, and perhaps in new discoveries.<br/><br/>The project involves three directions unified by use of geometry and analysis with physical motivation.  The first direction involves area-preserving twist maps of the cylinder; such maps arise in many settings, e.g. the Frenkel-Kontorova (F-K) model of a crystal lattice.  The investigator studies whether the robustness of periodic orbits with respect to certain perturbations (e.g., addition of a tilt to the periodic potential in the F-K example) increases with the number of harmonics in the map.  Two entirely different (and slightly simpler) objects are known to show an analogous effect: circle mappings and Mathieu-type Hill's equations.  If successful, the project would add a new class of systems to the latter two classes.  The second direction of research includes the goal to explain geometrically the recently discovered ""ponderomotive magnetism,"" in which rapid time-periodic oscillation of a conservative force field gives rise to a Faraday-like effect discovered by the investigator and collaborators through a normal-form computation: particles in such a field behave as if they possessed electric charge in the presence of a magnetic field, though neither an electric charge nor a magnetic field is present.  One of the goals is to explain the geometry underlying this effect.  The third direction explores questions raised by the connection between Hill's equation (arising in many areas of mathematics and applications) on the one hand and the geometrical ""tire track"" problem on the other.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key aspect of the project is the use of rigorous mathematical analysis, combined with simulations whenever feasible, to obtain quantitative results that can be used in a predictive fashion, with potential direct societal impacts. For instance, one part of the project addresses how data from global positioning systems (GPS) can be used, through a mathematical algorithm, to locate buried faults which would be otherwise inaccessible, and to estimate the relative slip of the rock layers along the fault, a predictor of earthquakes.

The project consists of three separate, but connected, parts: I. Incompressible Fluid Mechanics: I.a. Optimal mixing with diffusion; I.b. Boundary layer analysis in singular domains; II. Elasticity: direct and inverse problems for models of dislocations in geophysics. The unifying aspects of the project are the presence of singularities due to discontinuities and incompatibilities in the parameters for the underlying model equations and to irregular geometries, and the focus on rigorous, quantitative estimates, such as optimal bounds in mixing and quantitative stability estimates in inverse problems. The project contributes to the development of mathematical approaches to challenging open problems by combining known techniques in a novel way, such as in mixing problems, where geometric analysis, partial differential equations, and optimal control are employed, and in advancing our basic understanding of important physical processes, such as anomalous diffusion in turbulent mixing and modeling of interseismic build-up along faults and microseismicity, which may impact other fields, in particular geophysics and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How did it arise that humans often seek fair outcomes, when natural selection is inherently unfair?  Evolutionary game theory, a mathematical framework to capture the dynamics of decisions, provides some answers.  The theory finds applications in economics, military strategy, and biology.  This project develops a more extensive theory of distributed social learning and emergent group dynamics, combining aspects of evolutionary game theory with statistical mechanics and machine learning to explain the emergence of cooperation, fairness, and other social dynamics that do not fit well into traditional approaches.  The mathematical framework developed can be applied to problems in evolutionary psychology and artificial intelligence.  In particular, some results may help to inform policy makers on the origins of differing behaviors in different societies.  Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/>This project develops a coherent theory of distributed social learning and emergent group phenomena in complex systems, merging aspects of evolutionary game theory with statistical mechanics and machine learning.  Using public goods games and ultimatum style games as a foundation, the investigators study the evolutionary dynamics of finite populations whose encounters are described in game-theoretic terms using simple parameterized rules and random interactions.  An aspect of these evolutionary systems is convergence to non-Nash fixed points, including a sensitive dependence on initial conditions and sample paths realized.  Basins of attraction for these fixed points are characterized using techniques from topological data analysis.  Using insights from statistical mechanics, the distributions of potential population fixed points are derived and related to the information content in the dynamical system; here the speed of spatial interactions plays a role analogous to that of temperature in a gas of interacting particles.  Possible equilibrium states in these dynamical systems are categorized, along with the corresponding equilibrium point distributions.  Quantifying information transfer among interacting or moving agents is an additional goal of the project.  So also is determining the impact of commoditized information, whether beneficial or harmful, on equilibrium distributions and convergence.

A less studied path asks what makes an asset pricing model good, and where do such good models come from?  Equilibrium theory studies the formation of asset pricing models at a fundamental level where an economy's total supply meets its total demand. This award will study two overarching equilibrium projects set in incomplete settings, where not all risk can be captured by trading.  The projects use mathematical tools that are now within reach to describe equilibrium-based ""good"" models involving (i) the formation of interest rates, and (ii) the formation of stock prices in the presence of proportional transaction costs.  Both interest rates and transaction costs are highly relevant to financial markets but currently poorly understood in incomplete equilibrium settings. The award will involve collaborations and the involvement and training of graduate students. <br/><br/>This award will study two related problems involving equilibrium of stochastic systems in mathematical finance.  The first goal is to prove the existence of a finite-agent Radner equilibrium in incomplete market models with stochastic interest rates and proportional transaction costs.  After obtaining existence, the investigator will analyze the effects of incompleteness on the endogenously determined asset prices.  Mathematically, the analysis draws from systems of fully coupled quadratic backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE), which are doubly reflective in the case of transaction costs.  Existence results for such BSDE systems are nonconstructive, which complicates the analysis of incompleteness effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These projects will further our understanding of so-called incomplete markets (i.e., the markets which have a limited capability to offset risks) and the sensitivity of such markets to different types of perturbations and trading restrictions. The topics will lead to new developments in stochastic control, convex and stochastic analysis, to novel interdisciplinary research, and results applicable in the financial industry.

An appropriate form of parametrization for the perturbations and the corresponding value functions will allow for analysis involving only partial convexity (in one variable) of the underlying value function. Both dynamic and static formulations of the underlying stochastic control problem will be considered. The second topic is the pricing and hedging of financial instruments when additional trading constraints are imposed. This topic is connected to an investigation of the optimal investment problem with labor income, where extra trading constraints make the problem hard to analyze, and special forms of parametrization of the labor income and the value function are needed.

Without external control, they evolve into almost crystalline states showing stripes or spots aligned in somewhat regular fashions.  Examples range from the self-organizational processes in early developmental states of the embryo to phase separation dynamics in manufacturing processes such as dip-coating.  In order to control those processes and possibly harvest the self-organizational capabilities for the manufacturing of micro-structured materials, one needs to understand how the patterning is influenced by parameters and system geometry.  The investigator focuses on a particularly relevant situation in which patterns arise through a directional quenching process where the patterned region expands in space, either in an externally controlled fashion, or in a self-organized growth process.  It turns out that the result of patterning is very rigid, across many physical and biological contexts, in the sense that the final pattern is robust against imperfections and reproducible from many different initial states of the experiment.  The final pattern does however depend sensitively on growth rates and quenching geometry.  The investigator and his collaborators develop analytic and numerical tools that enable systematic prediction and control of resulting patterns, with the ultimate goal of designing processes that result in a desired, pre-specified pattern.  Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/>The investigator and his collaborators analyze prototypical systems such as the Swift-Hohenberg or the Cahn-Hilliard equation in situations where the pattern-forming region expands in time at a prescribed rate.  In the simplest case, these systems develop striped patterns with a fixed wavelength and orientation relative to the direction of growth.  Numerical tools developed for this scenario allow for a systematic exploration of the relation between parameters and resulting orientations and wavelengths.  Analytic tools can guide the numerics by exhibiting universal mechanisms such as pinning and detachment of structures.  Analysis also complements numerical studies in limiting regimes where computational cost is prohibitively high.  Both analysis and numerics focus on the study of coherent structures, which are the simplest pattern-forming dynamic states of the system.  They are typically stationary or time-periodic in a frame moving with the quenching interface, and asymptotic to a selected pattern in the pattern-forming region.  The first part of the project focuses on the formation of stripes, or lamellar crystals, in simple model problems, where the growth process roughly selects an orientation angle of stripes relative to the boundary.  The second part broadens the scope by including more realistic models, different growth laws, and different preferred crystalline states.

Such fluid structure interaction (FSI) problems include the flying of birds, the swimming of fish, and blood flow through the heart and blood vessels.  A particularly important class of FSI problems are those at small spatial scales. The biophysics of cell biological processes is a very important example of this. In such FSI problems, the fluid can be treated as a very viscous fluid (Stokes fluid). This project will study FSI problems in a Stokes fluid. The mathematical equations describing FSI problems are generally difficult to study mathematically, but the relative simplicity of the equations of Stokes fluids makes possible a detailed mathematical study of this class of FSI problems. The research program is divided into two parts. In the first, we study the dynamics of membranes in a Stokes fluid. Such models are often used to describe the dynamics of the cell membrane. In the second, we study the dynamics of filaments in Stokes flow. Such models are often used to describe the dynamics of flagella of microorganisms and sperm. A detailed mathematical study of such FSI problems will lead to a better understanding of FSI problems in general and also to the development of efficient computational algorithms in the simulation of such problems. This award will also provide support for the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the research.<br/><br/>Fluid structure interaction (FSI) problems in which an elastic structure interacts with the surrounding fluid abound in science and engineering and are studied intensively by computational methods by many authors. Despite their importance, the governing partial differential equations and the numerical methods for such problems are not well-understood from an analytical standpoint. In this research, we focus on a set of canonical FSI problems in which the elastic structures interact with a fluid obeying the Stokes equations. The project consists of two parts. In the first, we will study the problem of co-dimension one elastic interfaces immersed in Stokes flow. Building upon previous work by Mori and collaborators on the well-posedness of the 1D elastic structure/2D Stokes flow problem (Peskin problem), we shall extend the well-posedness theory to more general and related problems including the problem of a 2D elastic surface in 3D Stokes flow. We shall also develop a convergence theory for boundary integral methods for such problems and initiate a study to extend these results to the convergence analysis of fluid-grid based methods. The second part concerns slender body theory, which deals with the dynamics of thin filaments in 3D Stokes flow. We have recently succeeded in providing the first mathematical justification of slender body approximation, which we shall leverage to further our analysis and develop new computational methods for slender body computation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to the dissemination of the research to the scientific community, results will be presented to students through graduate courses, mentoring of students, and university-internal research and student seminars.

A major challenge that manifests in the simulation of scattering processes involving metamaterials is that they are of pronounced two-scale character, meaning that relevant optical processes act on very different length scales. This is complicated by the fact that realistic experimental geometries contain 1D discontinuities at boundaries of the 2D material sheets. Such discontinuities cause edge effects that are challenging to simulate due to their dominant and singular behavior. The project centers around the development and analysis of novel computational approaches for the simulation of scattering processes in complex optical devices, that are able to cope with the two-scale character and the occurrence of edge effects: (1) a parallel and adaptive finite element method for 3D device simulations will be developed and implemented that combines goal-oriented local mesh refinement and domain decomposition for MPI parallelization and preconditioning; (2) a heterogeneous multiscale method will be developed and analyzed that incorporates model-adaptive strategies for an efficient sampling of effective metamaterial parameters; (3) special emphasis will be given in both research directions to connect the algorithmic and numerical development to interdisciplinary applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will address in a coherent way how to model risk in such systems and how to control them within the risk-averse paradigm. This will be accomplished by developing dynamic risk-assessment procedures, called risk filters, and by employing adaptive robust control techniques. The outcome of the project will directly advance and promote the progress of science and engineering, with potential applications in applied areas such as medical sciences, engineering, economics, finance, inventory management and insurance. Special attention will be given to popularizing the proposed research and its impact in these applied fields. In particular, this will be achieved through advising of graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, presentations at popular, international and local forums, and dissemination of the results via scientific journal and book publications.<br/><br/>The classical theory and practice of Markov decision processes have proven to provide a powerful and successful toolkit for generating optimal or sub-optimal decision strategies in situations where the decision maker has access to adequately known (accurate) model of the underlying Markovian dynamical system, and acts so to optimize the expected cumulative cost or reward arising from the decision maker's actions. However, on the one hand, in many decision-making processes the decision maker needs to account for the trade-off between the cumulative award and cumulative risk of the decision. Risk-averse decision criteria underlying this research project and the theory of risk filters are ideally suited for such purposes. On the other hand, it is a typical situation in decision making processes that the model of the underlying Markovian dynamical system is not known exactly. Frequently, such model is a semi-adequate formalization of the underlying Markovian system, in the sense that the structural dynamical features of the system are modeled adequately, but precise knowledge of relevant model parameters is missing. In such cases, we say that the decision maker faces model uncertainty. Part of the proposed research will be devoted to develop methodologies that address this issue through adaptive robust stochastic control framework. Thus, the proposed research addresses in a coherent and novel way two important aspects of decision making in Markov systems: risk-averse decision criteria and model uncertainty. The theory of risk filters will be combined with the adaptive robust control methodology that will lead to novel dynamic programming equations, for which new numerical methods will be established.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These benefits occur through interactions of each individual with the flows produced by others and may take the form of energy savings or speed enhancement. Also to be explored are more subtle aspects of flow interactions such as maintaining or holding together a group, preventing collisions, establishing natural formations or patterns of individuals, and communication through motions that spread across the group. The research work will combine mathematical descriptions of the motions of individuals and the surrounding fluid (water or air), laboratory experiments on ""robotic flocks"" of motorized swimmers or flyers, and the analysis of video footage of birds flying in formations. The different approaches will allow for a complete understanding of the fluid-dynamical interactions in a group as well as insights into how animals exploit or modify such mechanisms. The work thus stands to clarify the role of flows in animal groups and in so doing also suggest how such effects can be exploited in applications such as flow energy harvesting and efficient propulsion. Additionally, education and outreach programs will train high school students, university undergraduate and graduate students in STEM research and especially the important role of mathematics in the natural and engineering sciences.<br/><br/>Specifically, physical experiments on mechanical swimmers, flow-locomotor interaction models and simulations, and crowd-sourced biological data will be combined interactively and applied towards understanding formation swimming and flying.

Experiments and simulations will inform models based on vortex-body interactions, and comparison against biological measurements will inform behavioral models in the context of formation flight of birds. Many-body systems of in-line arrays will then be studied, with all methods used to understand principles, for example through analogies to conventional states of matter, in which aspects such as group cohesion, crystallization or other patterning, dynamical instabilities, and information transfer will be explored. Biologically-relevant issues including self-organization and collective advantages will also be studied, and structural and dynamical metrics will be established and tested.

In several engineering applications the phase of a signal is lost during processing. In the first part of the project the principal investigator (PI) will resolve several problems concerning phase retrieval. Phase retrieval has applications to x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, astronomical imaging, optics, x-ray tomography, and more, such as in aligning the mirrors of the new James Webb Space Telescope. Combined with Fusion Frame Theory, phase retrieval helps to design sensor networks for detecting chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. The PI will also study fundamental problems in biangular tight frames. Biangular tight frames (BTF) have a myriad of applications including quantum state tomography, quantum cryptography, communication theory, spherical designs, and strongly regular graphs. This research will address some of the oldest problems in this area, such as the 150 year old Hadamard Conjecture, which are holding up the applications. This part of the project has applications to digital radio protocols designed to work in difficult (low signal-to-noise ratio plus multipath propagation) conditions on shortwave bands, balanced repeated replication, coded aperture spectrometry, feedback delay networks, Plackett-Burman design of experiments, among others. This project has a significant student training component, as several of the PI's Ph.D. students and one undergraduate student are all directly involved in the research. <br/><br/>In the first part of this project the PI will study phase retrieval. A family of unit vectors does phase retrieval if every vector in the space is uniquely determined (up to a universal phase) by the modulus of its inner product with each of the unit vectors. The main goal here is to construct families of vectors doing phase retrieval and to find out the least number of vectors needed to do phase retrieval in each dimension. The answer is known for two- and three-dimensional real and complex spaces and the approach is to solve the problem in all dimensions by induction with respect to the dimension. The second part of this project deals with biangular tight frames, which are families of unit vectors with the property that the modulus of the inner product of any two distinct vectors takes one of two values. The goal is to construct infinite families of such sets. The PI has developed a new tool for this construction. There are many known equiangular tight frames (ETF) and the new tool will turn these ETFs into BTFs. The last part of the project aims to produce a solution to the celebrated Hadamard Conjecture using a new approach for this problem developed by the PI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The neural network architecture that is present in many of these methods has some universal approximation properties that allow users to apply software tools with minimal preprocessing of data or tailoring of algorithms to the specifications of the problem.  However, in most instances where ML works well, mathematical analysis does not yet offer a satisfactory answer to the fundamental question: Why is a machine learning method so effective for solving this problem?  The aim of this project is to investigate how ML methods can be applied to solving non-Markov dynamic programs (DPs), and to answer this fundamental question for some specific problems in this area.  Graduate students participate in the research of the project.<br/><br/><br/>The investigator analyzes a new method for solving non-Markov DPs, wherein a policy-approximation function is obtained by training a system of neural networks.  The main idea is similar to recently-developed methods for solving high-dimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), wherein the so-called Deep BSDE Solver learns a function of a high-dimensional input to approximate the optimal control for a Markovian DP.  The aims of this project differ from those of other work because the focus is non-Markov DPs and the hurdles that come from path dependence.  Issues that are explored in depth include the level of accuracy needed in the training set generated by a Monte Carlo particle method, and the role that implicit regularization plays in the TensorFlow algorithms.  The project also considers more conventional theoretical concepts that may provide proof of this method's general effectiveness, such as the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation for continuous functions and the types of sigmoidal functions used in neural networks.  The results contribute to an improved theoretical understanding of the mathematics behind Deep BSDE when applied to DPs with nonlinear filtering, and help answer important questions regarding the method?s effectiveness.

The project is interdisciplinary by design - the problems cut across the fields of materials science and fluid dynamics - and is motivated by both practical and futuristic engineering applications. In materials science, for instance, there is the potential for new biologically-inspired and growth-based design mechanisms for building highly flexible but controlled solid membranes. Regarding fluid dynamics, besides the potential for the design of new and extremely efficient heat exchangers, the investigation is motivated by the broader scientific challenge of deriving the scaling laws of naturally occurring transport in turbulent fluids. As experience shows, these questions are very difficult to solve on a computer by applying conventional numerical techniques. There are oftentimes many nearly optimal answers, and each can be rather complex. Rigorous mathematical analysis presents the possibility of knowing that certain patterns are truly optimal overall: such information cannot be gleaned using other non-rigorous approaches. Thus, the project is an important contribution to the larger scientific community interested in understanding why or how such complex patterns achieve global optimality.  <br/>  <br/>This project consists of two main parts: (a) The first class of problems concerns the mechanics of thin elastic sheets, such as naturally occurring ones like leaves and flowers, but also man-made versions which can be orders of magnitude thinner than a standard sheet of paper. The thinner an elastic sheet becomes the more easily it can be deformed, in particular through bending forces, but extracting from such intuitive physical principles the mathematical mechanisms behind the vast array of wrinkling, folding, and crumpling patterns found in experiments is a clear and difficult challenge. The investigator seeks to derive through rigorous mathematical analysis the effective, coarse-grained models governing optimal elastic patterns in the vanishing thickness limit. A key task is to obtain the scaling law of the minimum energy in any natural parameters, and then to ask which patterns can possibly attain such energy scaling laws. (b) The second class of problems regards the design of incompressible fluid flows for achieving optimal heat transfer. While hot objects submerged in fluid media do cool on their own, it is natural to ask whether the efficiency of heat transfer can be significantly enhanced by intelligent stirring of the surrounding fluid. Oftentimes, any stirring protocol achieves some enhancement of heat transfer, but determining which strategies attain maximal heat transfer overall is an intriguing and open question. In the advection-dominated limit, which can be reached by increasing the amount of power available with which to stir, such optimal strategies exhibit patterns remarkably similar to those from problems of ""energy-driven pattern formation"" in mathematical materials science. The investigator is developing a precise and general link between these apparently related classes of problems, and is exploring its ramifications for the study of the scaling laws of naturally occurring turbulent transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physicists use them to model ocean currents, weather patterns and turbulent flows behind a commercial jet or ship. Mathematicians and physicists believe that an explanation for and the prediction of both the breeze and the turbulence can be found through an understanding of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations. Although most physicists and engineers believe that the smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations will not break down without external forcing, currently there is no theoretical guarantee that this is indeed the case. Our recent study indicates that the Euler equations, a special case of the Navier-Stokes equations with zero viscosity, could develop a catastrophic behavior if one starts with a highly symmetric but perfectly smooth flow. Such a scenario corresponds to a perfect storm in which all things that could potentially go wrong indeed go wrong. Potentially singular behavior of the Navier-Stokes equations could post tremendous damage to our environment, affect the safety of our planes and ships, and our ability to do accurate weather forecasting. This award will investigate under what conditions the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations may develop singular behavior. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop effective analytical and computational tools that would enhance our ability to model and predict various complex phenomena in nature so that we can have more confidence in the safety of commercial jets and ships, and weather forecasting. Additional impact of this project will be the involvement of graduate students. The interdisciplinary training they receive in this project will be important for their future careers in mathematics and science.<br/><br/>The award seeks to understand whether the incompressible 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations could develop a finite-time singularity from a smooth initial condition with finite energy. A unique aspect of the research is the integration of highly resolved numerical simulations and rigorous mathematical analysis.  Our strategy is to reformulate the problem of proving finite time self-similar singularity into the problem of establishing the nonlinear stability of an approximate self-similar profile using the dynamic rescaling equation. We first construct a highly accurate self-similar profile using a high order numerical method. We then use the energy method with carefully chosen singular weight functions and take into account cancellation among various nonlinear terms to extract the inviscid damping effect from the linearized operator around the approximate self-similar profile. Our stability result enables us to prove that the dynamic rescaling solution converges to the steady state self-similar solution exponentially fast in time.  Moreover, by introducing a cut-off to the self-similar profile, we obtain a smooth initial condition with finite energy that develops a self-similar blowup in finite time. The novel approach of investigating finite-time singularity formation by studying the stability of spatial profiles in the potential singular solutions also forms the basis of a novel analytical framework for other nonlinear nonlocal systems of partial differential equations and has the potential to be applied to study a larger class of nonlinear dynamic problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

TPBVPs are problems where one is given some information about the initial state of the system and about the terminal state with the goal of determining the remaining conditions on the initial state such that the given terminal state conditions are met. For example, one may have some data on the initial state (position and velocity) of a space vehicle or asteroid, and would like to know what the other components of that initial data need to be such that a specific desirable, or possibly highly undesirable, terminal state will occur. Fundamental solutions are extremely valuable; given such a solution, one does not need to re-solve the problem each time the initial or terminal data changes. Hence, one can generate large sets of solutions for varying possible data very rapidly. Applications in astrodynamics include gravity-assist trajectories for interplanetary missions and analysis of potential asteroid/comet impacts from partial data. This general approach will be extended to obtain extremely rapid solution methods for the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics. The Schrodinger equation is a partial differential equation (PDE). Classical methods for obtaining solutions of PDEs are subject to the famous ""curse of dimensionality"". Specifically, the dimension of the space over which the PDE must be solved grows by three with the addition of each particle to the problem, while such an increase of three in dimension typically results in a growth in computational time by a factor on the order of over 100,000. The ""curse-of-dimensionality-free"" (CODF) methods developed by the PI and collaborators have massively reduced the computational load for certain classes of high-dimensional problems. Previously, this approach was only useful for first-order PDEs. Using this breakthrough, the PI will construct an extremely rapid CODF method applicable to the (second-order) Schrodinger PDE. This will allow researchers to study nonlinear effects in quantum systems that were previously beyond the reach of our tools. The graduate students supported by this award will be actively involved in research related to various aspects of this project under the guidance of the PI. <br/><br/>New theory and tools in the areas of dynamics, control theory, analysis and stochastic processes will be developed. Although the PI and collaborators previously demonstrated that the least-action approach can be used to generate fundamental solutions to TPBVPs in conservative systems, that was appropriate only for short duration. The extension to arbitrary-duration TPBVPs requires an extension of control theory to cover stationarity problems (i.e., staticization). This is an entirely new direction for the field. Dynamic programming and Hamilton-Jacobi theory will be extended to cover cases where one seeks a stationary point of the payoff. Generating fundamental solutions requires a certain commutativity of staticization operators, which is highly nontrivial. The fundamental solutions may be stored as finite-dimensional sets of coefficients; the particular solutions for specific problem data are obtained from the fundamental solutions through idempotent convolution against functions encoding the boundary data. Also, generalizing tools from control of diffusion processes, the PI will obtain an extension of the application of staticization to complex-valued, stochastic problems, yielding a staticization-based representation valid for certain second-order Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs. In particular, representations for solutions of Schrodinger initial value problems will be obtained via staticization of complex-valued action functionals over controlled complex-valued diffusion processes. This will also yield a fundamental solution and a curse-of-dimensionality-free method for such problems. Extension of existence and uniqueness results for solutions of new classes of degenerate stochastic differential equations will be obtained as a necessary subtask.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program includes three workshops and sets of masterclasses (expository lectures given by leaders in the field), and will give junior scientists, at a critical career stage, a chance to participate in a workshop and masterclass in their research area. The workshops are ""The complex analysis toolbox: new techniques and perspectives"", from September 9 to 13, 2019; ""Complex analysis in mathematical physics and applications"", from October 28 to November 1, 2019; and ""Computational complex analysis"", from December 9 to 13, 2019. Complex variable and analytic function theory play an elemental role in a diverse array of applications and areas of mathematics. The classical work carried out over decades in traditional fields is now providing the foundations and inspiration for new and rapid growth in many exciting new directions. The INI program will advance the field by bringing together key researchers working at the frontiers of these new developments and will help steer future endeavors by identifying the most important scientific challenges arising from the new techniques, methodologies and insights.

Occasionally, the decision maker can even face an opposing player, informed or not, leading to a so-called zero-sum game. Modeling and analysis of games is very difficult, in large part because of the potential strategic behavior of the two players. This project studies the theory behind a collection of topics in  stochastic control (one decision maker) or games (two opposing players). Some of the models are directly motivated by finance, but the general theory could be applied to  other situations. The first topic aims to  provide a better explanation of how an investor should adjust their investing strategies (proportion in each asset) in the presence of small transaction costs, compared  to not facing such costs. The second topic is a general treatment of stochastic games, with the aim to explain the difference between having an intelligent opponent (another person, acting strategically) and an uninformed one, like nature choosing a worst-case scenario for the decision maker. The third topic is of more technical nature, advancing the mathematical theory behind a peculiar kind of fees that investor can face, namely performance fees.<br/><br/>The present project aims to study three topics in stochastic control and games. The first is a study of multi-dimensional singular control problems, with the main application to approximation of optimal investment strategies with small proportional transaction costs. The goal is to deeper understand the structure of feedback optimal strategies as solutions to reflected stochastic differential equations. The second topic will  study the difference in both modeling and analysis between genuine  zero-sum games and stochastic control under  model uncertainty. While, analytically, these two situations appear to be described by the same Isaacs equation, if the Isaacs condition does not hold, allowing the player to use randomized strategies may lead to different models (and values). Finally, the PI will study the duality theory for investing with performance fees.

This happens in many settings of great practical importance, involving devices for communications, optics, remote sensing, and geophysical exploration.  To understand these interactions between waves and the complex structures of the media through which they move, which often involve multiple scatterers as well as multiple layers with different material properties, requires resolving the complicated reflections and transmissions that waves undergo in such environments.  This in turn requires large-scale numerical simulations.  The investigator develops and analyzes high-performance, efficient, accurate, and rapidly convergent algorithms for this class of problems.  His recent work with colleagues resulted in the development of an efficient computational strategy that incorporates windowed Green's functions within the boundary integral equation approach for the simulation of interaction of waves with infinitely extending interfaces.  This computational framework enables simulation of transmission and reflection of waves by periodic media at high frequencies.  This project builds on these methods to enable high-fidelity simulations of waves propagating in engineering structures such as thin film solar cells and metasurfaces.  Graduate students participate in the research.<br/><br/>The investigator develops a family of algorithms that focus mainly on optimized Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) methods, incorporate carefully designed quasi-optimal transmission operators, and are amenable to simple yet effective preconditioning strategies.  Combining the merits of direct and iterative solvers, this class of methods has emerged as a leading contender for solution of high-frequency wave propagation in complex media.  The computational methodology underlying this work is based on boundary integral solvers that, whenever applicable, can produce solutions to partial differential equations with high-order accuracy and no numerical dispersion.  The project leverages recent advances introduced by the investigator and collaborators in the boundary integral equation treatment of infinitely extending media (including periodic media) and dielectric composite media, combined with the modularity and parallelism inherent to DD methods, to enable simulations of realistic engineering structures such as complex photonic or electronic devices.  The work affects a variety of areas of societal interest, including communication, remote sensing, seismology, and optics.  A major part of the project with wide applications is the development of fast, highly accurate solvers for periodic metamaterials, and use of the resulting numerical tools in detailed investigation and design of photonic structures and metamaterials.

A typical aeroelastic energy harvesting scheme involves immersing a thin, elastic structure in a fluid (water or air) flow. Under certain conditions, the presence of the flow brings about a structural self-excited vibration, known as flutter, resulting in periodic oscillations. It has been recently shown that, via affixed piezo-electric materials, electrical energy can be harvested from these structural oscillations. This sort of energy holds promise as an alternative energy source, but also brings about mathematical modeling and experimental implementation challenges. Slender cantilever plates in an axial flow are particularly prone to the flutter instability, even at low flow speeds. To effectively and efficiently harvest energy from this system, one must understand the qualitative features of the resulting limit cycle oscillation. This is done by formulating appropriate partial differential equation models, analyzing their mathematical properties, simulating dynamics through scientific computation, and comparing these results against experimental data. This project will provide opportunities and support for the training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/> <br/>From a technical point of view, the analysis described above requires understanding large cantilever deflections driven by a flow. The models studied must capture the de-stabilizing effects of the flow as coupled to nonlinear cantilever dynamics. Unlike traditional large deflection elasticity (based on the structure's ability to stretch), a cantilever's inextensibility gives rise to the primary nonlinear effects of interest: nonlocal inertia and nonlinear stiffness. This project derives and analyzes PDE models for the post-flutter behavior of cantilevered structures in an axial flow of fluid. Specifically, it: (i) improves cantilever modeling and makes predictions that will lead to better energy harvesting devices; (ii) develops a rigorous theory of PDE solutions for a novel elasticity model; (iii) addresses a gap in the mathematical literature concerning unstable nonlinear cantilevers; (iv) refines spectral and finite element computational methods for nonlinear cantilevers; (v) creates a synergy of modeling, theory, computation, and wind-tunnel experimentation; and (vi) provides a clearly formulated, challenging mathematical problem with a direct and realizable connection to engineering applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, sound waves propagate through compressible fluids, water waves propagate on the surface of an ocean, and large-scale atmospheric waves affect the earth's weather and climate. At sufficiently low intensities, waves are modeled by linear systems of equations, which are relatively well-understood; but at higher intensities, the equations become nonlinear. Nonlinearity introduces fundamental mathematical difficulties and leads to new physical phenomena, such as the shock waves generated by supersonic aircraft, the solitons (particle-like waves) that propagate on shallow water, and nonlinear wave interactions that generate additional waves. The aim of this project is to study the dynamics of waves in fluids and uncover new nonlinear phenomena in the context of specific physical applications.

It focuses on the asymptotic analysis of nonlinear, nondispersive and dispersive waves, including waves that propagate on boundaries, free surfaces, or interfaces. A unifying framework is provided by Hamiltonian dynamics, which is an essential structure for the waves considered in the proposed research. Physical applications include waves on vorticity discontinuities in incompressible fluids, temperature fronts in surface quasi-geostrophic flows, current-vortex sheets in plasmas, shock wave reflection, and the resonant interaction of sound and entropy waves.

Yet, our ability to predict this failure is limited by both modeling, which is somewhat ad hoc, and the mathematics available to formulate and analyze models, as well as to justify numerical methods. These issues are most severe in dynamic problems, such as impacts, when loading changes quickly. The main goal of this project is the development of new mathematical methods for dynamic fracture evolution. In particular, the principal investigator (PI) will extend methods for regular crack paths to more realistic paths, with kinking and branching. A second goal is to address fundamental mathematical issues that are necessary for further progress in completely general settings. Finally, the PI will study phase-field approximations of fracture, which have become very popular tools in the engineering community but remain poorly understood.<br/><br/>The ability to accurately predict failure depends on the quality of the underlying mathematical models of defects as well as on understanding fundamental properties of solutions. When crack paths are regular, mathematical methods are available to study these evolutions. However, when they are not, the only methods so far involve considering the paths to be limits of more regular paths. The main technical issue here is that strong convergence of the corresponding elastodynamics is necessary for energy balance, as well as for other properties of solutions, but this convergence remains open in many situations. Another fundamental issue is uniqueness of elastodynamic solutions for a given crack path. The investigator will show uniqueness in certain settings, and explore general consequences, such as bounds on crack speed. The final goal of the project is to analyze phase-field models for fracture.

In every instance, the issue of model error is important.  In general, it is not possible for practical reasons (such as limited amounts of data, or the need to maintain computational feasibility) to work with a perfectly accurate model.  Hence it is important to identify those aspects of the model that are uncertain, quantify their impact on predictions, and perhaps even account for this uncertainty while using the model, for example as an engineering tool.  The models of interest in this project are probabilistic.  In this setting we acknowledge that the system is random, and the model error is due to an imperfect understanding of the parameters that describe the probability distribution.  To assess how mathematical predictions based on the model change as the model itself changes, one needs metrics to compare the outcome based on different distributions (e.g., the distribution that is used for ""design,"" and an ideal but not available ""true"" distribution).  The topic of this research is the development of the theory and application of such metrics.  In contrast to prior work, here we focus on situations where the quantities of interest are tied to rare events, such as a catastrophic system failure.  Graduate students participate in the research of the project.<br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the use of divergences and metrics on probability measures to study model uncertainty, and optimization and control in the presence of model uncertainty.  The probability measures are typically on high-dimensional or complicated spaces, and typically on a path space to model stochastic dynamics.  An important aspect of the work is to establish useful qualitative properties, such as scaling limits and chain rule-type formulas.  In contrast to prior work, the focus here is on situations where (a) one wishes to consider differing models that are not absolutely continuous, and (b) performance measures and quantities of interest are largely determined by rare events and tail properties.  The main mathematical tools used are convex duality or variational formulas that relate the divergences to exponential integrals.  To implement the theory, one needs to evaluate such exponential integrals, which for example may take the form of a moment-generating function with respect to the stationary distribution of some Markov process.

It soon became clear that it was necessary to understand statistical mechanics, i.e., how the mechanical motion and interactions of the extremely large number of atoms and molecules determine macroscopic thermodynamic parameters of the gas, such as the pressure or temperature. Since then, the ideas and methods initially set forth to understand the heat to work transformation have been extended to fluid motion, electrical conduction, chemical reactions and many more settings. In the last 30 years, they have been applied to a diverse variety of system formed by a large number of interacting elementary constituents like neural network, animal populations, large human networks and economic systems. These successes notwithstanding, the deep conceptual and mathematical foundations of statistical mechanics are incomplete, especially so for the non-equilibrium case. This project is aimed to improve understanding of these foundations.<br/><br/>Mark Kac introduced a very simplified model to study convergence to equilibrium and emergence of effective macroscopic equations (the Boltzmann equation) in a dilute gas of colliding hard spheres. Thanks to the simplicity of this model one can compute exactly the spectral gap of the evolution and prove uniform convergence of the one-particle distribution to the solution of the Boltzmann-Kac equation. This comes at the price of losing all spatial structure and thus the ability to investigate crucial phenomena such as local equilibrium and approach to non-equilibrium steady states. This project will extend the Kac model by reintroducing a space structure and connecting it with heat and particle reservoirs in such a way as to obtain a model that is closer to a real gas but still is rigorously treatable. By improving the mathematical techniques developed to study complex dynamics of large systems, like scaling limits, hyperbolic dynamics, and functional inequalities, the Principal Investigator will extend the results known for the Kac system to this richer and more realistic model. Although most of the work will be of analytic nature, numerical simulation will be used as a guide toward more rigorous understanding. The final goal is to have a model where one can rigorously describe the transition from microscopic collision dynamics to a mesoscopic Boltzmann type equation and finally to a macroscopic thermodynamic/hydrodynamic fluid evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The range of these phenomena includes such diverse examples as complex and compressible fluids (combustion, aerospace engineering, and meteorology), nonlocal reaction-diffusion processes (nuclear physics, population biology, and genetics), and kinetic theory (plasma physics, swarm dynamics, and astrophysics). This project focuses on novel approaches to determining two fundamental characteristics of solutions to equations modeling large numbers of strongly interacting particles: their regularity and asymptotic behavior. The regularity of such problems establishes that the models are well-behaved, which often means the equations remain numerically tractable in computer simulations. The asymptotic theory seeks to find simplified limiting behavior for equations, in which many complex interactions average out and have a residual effect that governs the behavior of the system. Information about the limiting behavior is instrumental for applications such as medical imaging or materials science. For many important phenomena that demonstrate complex, nonlinear behavior, the application of known methods for analysis and control is greatly limited and not always possible. The aim of this project is to investigate three new techniques that partly overcome the difficulties caused by nonlinearity. The project will also provide training and research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The principal investigator will use techniques of nonlinear analysis, viscosity theory, and probability to establish bounds and asymptotic dynamics for the three major parts of the project. The first part focuses on exploring thermally enhanced dissipation for hydrodynamic equations where the viscosity grows with local temperature. From kinetic considerations and empirical observations, the kinematic viscosity of a compressible fluid flow increases with the local temperature and the local temperature is produced by friction. The intuition is that, in such models, regions of high turbulence self-regularize by producing hot spots which boost the viscosity exactly where it is needed to prevent the development of singularities. Prior work has identified this effect in two model problems (along with corresponding bounds). One of the main goals of the project is to push these types of estimates to physical models of compressible thermal fluids such as the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, the equations of magneto-hydrodynamics, and the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Fourier system for electrokinetic complex fluids. Enhanced thermal dissipation is a truly novel source of regularization compared to other known energy-based methods and lends itself naturally to dynamic weighted Sobolev estimates and entropy methods. The second part focuses on developing methods to extract asymptotic behavior from strongly nonlocal heterogeneous reaction-diffusion equations. There is a growing interest in extracting simpler macroscopic dynamics (often taking the form of geometric equations) from certain scaling limits of more complicated models. The nonlocal operators in these models present unique challenges in determining their residual impact on the (sometimes discontinuous) homogenized equation. The investigator plans to implement the techniques of viscosity theory to pursue homogenization phenomena for nonlocal periodic Fisher-KPP and bistable (Allen-Cahn) equations. The third part focuses on the regularity theory for kinetic equations (i.e., Landau and Boltzmann). Most regularity results for these equations rely on the assumption of having the lower bound on the density (as this often yields a minimum dissipation in the velocity variables). The investigator will explore the emergence of such lower bounds through probabilistic techniques, writing the kinetic equation as an approximate Fokker-Planck equation for a certain stochastic process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting asymmetric transport (with larger transport in one direction than the other one) has the potential to transform our communication capabilities in electronic and photonic structures at the nanometer scale as well as allowing us to understand large-scale eastward moving modes along the equator at the planetary scale. Similar mathematical models will be used in the second objective of this project, which aims to improve our understanding of novel high-contrast high-resolution medical imaging modalities such as photo-acoustic tomography or elastography. A major component of the project includes the training of graduate students and mentoring of postdoctoral researchers to work on the aforementioned tasks and the development of graduate courses in these areas of mathematics. <br/><br/>More specifically, the topological protection will be modeled by partial differential operators and their mapping, using non-commutative geometry tools, to Fredholm operators with non-trivial index (topology). Large classes of random coefficients added to the differential model are then shown not to modify the topology, as a topological obstruction to the otherwise expected Anderson localization. Physical observables of the form of currents will then be assigned to the topological invariants to provide a concrete physical expression of the asymmetric transport. A major objective of the project is to consider the field of Floquet topological insulators, where the non-trivial topology is obtained by high frequency periodic time-dependent fluctuations of the material's properties. The above descriptions involve the analysis of a forward map: from heterogeneous coefficients in differential models to solutions of the models. The second objective of this project is to analyze the inverse problem, aiming to reconstruct such coefficients from information about the solutions. The principal investigator and his collaborators plan to do so for several hybrid inverse problems, and in particular those modeled by kinetic Fokker-Planck equations, which describe wave propagation in turbid media with highly peaked forward scattering and find applications in laser light through turbulent atmospheres as well as near-infra-red light through biological tissues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, we are exploring a novel mechanism we have discovered through which particles suspended within such layered systems are seen to attract each other and self-assemble, forming large disc like clusters.  The mechanism for this attraction involves fluid flows which the particles themselves create from being in a layered fluid.  Such clusters occur ubiquitously in lakes and oceans, where they can provide food sources for a variety of organisms, or result in concentrations of polluting particles. The origins of these clusters may well lie within this new aggregate formation mechanism under exploration within this award. Graduate students will be involved in the project. <br/><br/>Specifically, the award will undertake a combined theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigation of a newly discovered hydrodynamic interaction between particles in a stratified ambient environment. Recent experimental work by the PIs at the UNC Joint Fluids Lab have demonstrated that passive particles suspended in a density-stratified environment interact through self-induced flows which can result in approaching  one and another over time until coming into contact. Collections of many particles tend to aggregate and self-assemble into large-scale 2D structures due to this newly identified attraction mechanism. The project aims to characterize this newly-identified interaction effect in nature for the first time, through novel asymptotic methods, numerical simulations, and careful experimentation.  The research will explore the complex interplay between diffusion, advection, and geometry (through physical boundary conditions) in inducing new collective phenomena. This requires developing novel computational, asymptotic, and experimental methods for extracting quantitative predictions from the parent Navier-Stokes equations coupled through the viscous stress tensor to particles suspended in stratified environments.

Problems such as medical imaging in the form of MRI or CT, hyperspectral satellite imaging, radar imaging, and remote sensing can involve large dimensional data where classically designed methods become impractical. The challenges of high dimensional data require techniques such as compressed sensing, which is able to extract the nonlinear low-dimensional structure of the signal. The investigator aims to further advance the scope of compressed sensing with an emphasis on signals that are sparsely represented by a collection of atoms, or a frame. This award will support the development of mathematical techniques for this problem as well as its applications on imaging while providing theoretical guarantees.

The meeting is organized jointly by the Departments of Mathematics at the University of Missouri-Columbia, the University of Kansas in Lawrence, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The conference will showcase recent advances and facilitate exchange of ideas in partial differential equations and dynamics of complex systems. Many basic first principles in nature take the form of conservation (or balance) laws for quantities that vary in space and time, and these laws lead naturally to partial differential equations (PDE). PDE are therefore encountered in nearly all areas of science; they describe wave motion, diffusion, deformation, mixing, pattern formation, and many other phenomena. Specific applications of current interest include climate modeling, water waves, electrodynamics phenomena in complex media, and neuroscience. While participants are clustered in the Midwestern and Southern states near Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska, many researchers working at institutions elsewhere in the US will be included. Early career mathematicians will be given an opportunity to present their work to gain recognition and invaluable feedback. For the first time this year, KUMUNU will also feature a mini-course consisting of a series of three lectures to be given by Bjorn Sandstede (Brown).  The conference website is http://faculty.missouri.edu/~walshsa/kumunu2019/<br/><br/>Many of the complex nonlinear problems governed by PDE can be reframed as dynamical systems posed on infinite-dimensional spaces. This strategy has proved to be effective, and it certainly shows tremendous promise as a means to attack a host of open problems in nonlinear science. To realize this promise, a strong and continuing collaboration between the PDE and dynamics communities is essential. The goals of the KUMUNU Conference are to support and facilitate this collaboration. The major themes of this year's meeting are as follows: applications of dynamical system techniques to fluid mechanics and water waves; dynamics of dispersive PDE; and spatio-temporal structures. Each of these topics has generated a great deal of recent activity. The KUMUNU Conference will help to advance these efforts, particularly at regional institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solving the associated signal processing problems requires an understanding of the underlying structure of data and finding its efficient representations. Frames proved to be a powerful tool in signal processing, providing redundant representations of signals that are useful for many applications. In return, signal processing problems motivate the study of frame properties. The primary objective of the project is to study connections between frame theory, with focus on time-frequency analysis, and signal processing problems, such as the phase retrieval problem, where a signal is reconstructed from intensity measurements with respect to a frame. More precisely, the investigator aims to study geometric properties of Gabor frames and their role in analysis of the phase retrieval problem with time-frequency structured measurements. Gabor frames naturally arise in such applications as speech recognition, so obtaining results on phase retrieval problem with time-frequency structured measurements would lead to advances in speech recognition technology and provable guarantees for existing ad hoc methods. In many signal processing applications, including social, transport, and epidemiology networks, data is naturally associated with the vertices of a weighted graph that represents the relations between data units. Processing of such data requires the development of different signal processing tools that would take the underlying graph structure into account. Another aim of the project is to extend classical discrete signal processing tools and concepts to signals defined on graphs. This would allow to solve classical signal processing problems in this generalized setting and advance in such important applications as weather and traffic prediction and brain imaging.<br/><br/>The project is centered around three main objectives that are closely connected to each other, each addressing an important problem in the areas of random matrix theory, Gabor analysis, and signal processing. The first research direction is devoted to the study of geometric properties of frames. While properties of random Gaussian frames with independent vectors are sufficiently well-studied, very little is known about structured frames that are relevant for signal processing applications. This motivates the study of structured application relevant frames, such as Gabor frames. The investigator will focus on such properties of Gabor frames as optimal frame bounds and frame order statistics, with the ultimate goal of showing that Gabor frames have properties that are essentially optimal for applications. The study of the optimal frame bounds would allow to establish robustness of the signal reconstruction from its frame coefficients, justifying the use of the frame representation of a signal in practical applications. In the case of Gabor frames, the frame bounds depend not only on the cardinality of the frame set, but also on its structure. In the second research direction, the investigator aims to use studied properties of frames to analyze the phase retrieval problem. Even though there are many results on phase retrieval obtained for Gaussian measurements, the case of structured frames remains wide open. The main reason for this is that geometric properties of such frames are not yet fully understood. Getting new insights into the properties of Gabor frames would lead to a substantial progress in the development of the phase retrieval problem. In particular, obtaining uniform bounds on frame order statistics would imply invertibility and stability of the phase retrieval problem with Gabor frames. The third research direction of the project focuses on various aspects of time-frequency analysis for graph-based signals. The two main goals are to describe graphs for which Gabor frames have properties similar to the classical case, and to study properties of graph Gabor frames, depending on the underlying graph structure. To achieve the latter goal, the investigator aims to use random graph theory. The generalization of such cornerstone concepts as uncertainty principle and restricted isometry property would allow to develop Gabor analysis toolbox for graph-based signals and approach classical signal processing problems in this more general setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

GSMMC is a mentored, problem-solving workshop, at which small teams of Ph.D. students from across the U.S. are guided through successful mathematical modeling of real-world problems presented by faculty or experienced postdoctoral mentors. Under careful mentoring, student participants build their modeling, teamwork and presentation skills during the week: via the teamwork on modeling and simulating the problems; through the final team presentations made at the end of the week; and in writing the final reports that are produced. Training activities also include numerical simulations and the preparation of a final report outlining their discoveries.  These skills are put to use and consolidated the following week at MPI, where industrial participants present immediate modeling challenges facing their industries, on which academic participants (faculty, postdocs, and the Ph.D. students from GSMMC) work. Significant progress on the industrial problems is usually made, and Ph.D. student participants take the lead in presenting the findings to the participants from industry in final presentations at the week's end. In addition to building their skillsets and resumes, student participants are exposed to valuable networking interactions with a range of industrial participants.<br/><br/>The GSMMC-MPI program is designed to integrate interdisciplinary research and education for graduate students.

These systems arise in a wide variety of contexts in the physical, biological, and social sciences as well as engineering, and this project focuses on the mathematical study of such long-time behavior in a variety of models with a specific focus on those arising in plasma physics, turbulent combustion, and population dynamics.  Two major fundamental challenges in the models considered are the existence of multiple temporal and spatial scales and nonlocal interactions.  The former requires developing an understanding of how small-scale oscillations ""average out"" over long time scales; for instance, in flame propagation, a ""small"" random drift produces fluctuations of the front whose statistics are given by limiting stochastic equation.  The latter requires determining the impact of complex long-range interactions.  A typical example considered in this project is the influence of chemotaxis (which is the phenomenon in which each individual bacterium ""senses"" other bacteria and moves towards the population center) on bacterial invasions.  In both cases, the aim is to determine which features of the systems are predictable and under what conditions such predictions hold.  Various educational activities, including the training of young researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate level, are planned.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop technical tools that allow to better characterize the effects of stochastic fluctuations of the environment and nonlocal interactions between individuals affects the long-time behavior of solutions to several reaction-diffusion, Hamilton-Jacobi, and kinetic equations.  The project breaks down into two major portions.  The first encompasses front propagation problems in which a moving interface separating two states emerges.  The shape and dynamics of this interface are strongly related to the fluctuations of the media and to internal interactions.  The second is the regularity and boundedness of kinetic models coming from plasma physics.  New estimates of solutions to these equations continue to emerge via the application of ideas from the parabolic theory.  The goal is to combine these ideas with a precise understanding of nonlocal effects in order to weaken current restrictions on the well-posedness theory and develop physically reasonable conditions under which blow-up is prevented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They relate to a transport of some substance, for example a pollutant or particulate material, by a flow, be it a fluid or gas flow or an intra-cellular flow.  Mathematically, a certain scalar or vector field (e.g. density, vorticity, temperature) is carried by some velocity field.  These phenomena can be described by partial differential equations (PDE), which often involve both nonlocal (dependence on the history of the flow or on the not necessarily close-by events) and nonlinear terms. Examples include the 2D Boussinesq equation that models large scale atmospheric and oceanic flows, and the diffusion-aggregation equation that models collective animal behavior. Due to the nonlocal and nonlinear nature of these equations, it is often unknown whether solutions exist globally in time or develop a finite-time singularity. Even in the cases where solutions are known to be global, their long-time behavior remains unclear for many equations. This project aims to develop novel analytical tools for a range of transport equations arising in fluid dynamics and biology, focusing on singularity, asymptotic, and mixing properties of the solutions.

PACT is a promising biomedical imaging technique, which has been developed rapidly in the past decade, with applications explored in vascular biology, oncology, neurology, dermatology, gastroenterology, and cardiology.  PACT can circumvent the limitations of many existing approaches and provide detailed three-dimensional anatomical, functional, and molecular information that can facilitate a wide range of biomedical studies.  This research project will dramatically improve image quality in PACT, which will accelerate the widespread adoption of this emerging imaging modality.  The project goals will be accomplished through a collaboration that involves complementary high-level expertise in the mathematical and biomedical imaging sciences.<br/><br/>The project aims at addressing several challenging problems in biomedical imaging in terms of modeling and inversion from both computational and experimental perspectives.  (1) Advanced ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) reconstruction methods will be developed for determination of acoustic heterogeneities.  (2) New photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) reconstruction methods will be developed to compensate for acoustic heterogeneities.  (3) Novel methods for joint PACT/USCT image reconstruction will be developed to reconstruct the absorbed optical energy density and speed of sound distributions simultaneously.  (4) Innovative PACT reconstruction methods in heterogeneous viscoelastic media will be developed for transcranial brain imaging.  (5) The value of the developed image reconstruction methods will be demonstrated for in-vivo imaging of small animals.  The resulting methods will open new venues for applying these algorithms to wave-related biomedical imaging problems."

Starting its first conference at Virginia Tech in 1981, the SEARCDE is held annually by various institutions in the Southeast region of the United States. The conference provides a unique platform for all researchers in the field of differential equations and applications and related fields to share their research experiences, to disseminate recent results, and to establish collaborations. The SEARCDE aims to promote research and education in all aspects of differential equations and applications and related fields. Many research experts, beginning researchers, and graduate students will be brought together to give talks, to exchange recent research and new ideas, to discuss open problems in the area of differential equations and applications and related fields. Beginning researchers and graduate students will be able to learn from plenary and invited speakers, interact with experts, and meet with colleagues to discuss working problems. Women, minority, and underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to participate in the SEARCDE.<br/> <br/>The primary focus of the conference is to create a friendly atmosphere for participants to share their findings and recent progress, explore new techniques and discuss open problems. The thirty-ninth SEARCDE will focus on three major areas:  linear and nonlinear analysis of differential equations, mathematical fluid mechanics and mathematical biology, and numerical and computational methods of partial differential equations. There will be five internationally renowned experts giving three one-hour plenary talks and two thirty-minute invited talks on these topics. Several researchers will give twenty-minute contributed talks divided into six parallel sessions.  Junior researchers and graduate students whose research interests are closely related to these topics will benefit greatly from this conference.

The Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium is a regional weekend meeting held annually, hosted in turn by Rice University, the University of Texas at Austin, and occasionally other institutions in the region. It is intended for the participation of around 60 people, including 25 non-local graduate students. The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states, who may not otherwise have an opportunity to discuss mathematics together throughout the year. Structurally the symposium consists of 7 main lectures given by nationally recognized leaders in the field, and contributed sessions (including a poster session) for advanced graduate students and participating researchers from regional universities, to present their work. This will provide graduate students with an opportunity to obtain feedback from senior faculty from other departments. The networking activities made possible by the Symposium will prove to be a valuable experience for young researchers. The Symposium encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The Symposium is a forum for regional specialists in mathematical physics and related areas of analysis to become familiar with the latest problems and present their own results; in addition it introduces young mathematicians to the current state of the subject.<br/><br/>This year's Symposium will focus on the areas where ergodic theory and dynamical systems, partial differential equations, and probability theory intersect and interact. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts, registration information, and an archive of the past Symposia can be found on the website of the meeting:<br/><br/>https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/tc/TeXAMP/TeXAMP-2019/TeXAMP-2019.html<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

GSMMC is a mentored, problem-solving workshop, at which small teams of Ph.D. students from across the U.S. are guided through successful mathematical modeling of real-world problems presented by faculty or experienced postdoctoral mentors. Under careful mentoring, student participants build their modeling, teamwork and presentation skills during the week: via the teamwork on modeling and simulating the problems; through the final team presentations made at the end of the week; and in writing the final reports that are produced. Training activities also include numerical simulations and the preparation of a final report outlining their discoveries.  These skills are put to use and consolidated the following week at MPI, where industrial participants present immediate modeling challenges facing their industries, on which academic participants (faculty, postdocs, and the Ph.D. students from GSMMC) work. Significant progress on the industrial problems is usually made, and Ph.D. student participants take the lead in presenting the findings to the participants from industry in final presentations at the week's end. In addition to building their skillsets and resumes, student participants are exposed to valuable networking interactions with a range of industrial participants.<br/><br/>The GSMMC-MPI program is designed to integrate interdisciplinary research and education for graduate students. The GSMMC is focused on graduate student education and training: its chief intellectual merit lies in the development and analysis, by students, of the mathematical models for the problems presented. Problems are highly interdisciplinary, presenting students with a novel intellectual challenge. With the preparatory training provided by the GSMMC, students are ready for the more open-ended, research-level environment of MPI. The questions posed at MPI challenge participants to design new ways of modeling and analyzing industrial mathematics problems in emerging areas of technology. Mathematical modeling, analytical techniques, numerical simulations, and data analysis must all be used effectively. The collaborative approach to problem solving, which involves mathematicians ranging from graduate students to experienced faculty, is central to the structure of MPI and provides significant additional training to graduate students, while promoting effective scientific communication.
