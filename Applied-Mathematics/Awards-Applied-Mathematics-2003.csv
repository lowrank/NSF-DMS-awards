New solutions of multi-dimensional equations and related linear scattering problems will be investigated. A prototypical system is the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation, which is a two-space one-time dimensional  extension of the Korteweg-deVries equation. Associated with  the linearization of the KP equation is the nonstationary Schrodinger equation which itself is a prominent equation in mathematics and physics. Important recent discoveries by the PI include finding new  real, localized, multi-lump solutions to the KP equation and new classes of eigenfuctions to the nonstationary Schrodinger equation. These solutions are related to a positive integer, referred to as the charge, which is a type of winding number or index. The characterization of these solutions in terms of the charge and other indices will continue. New classes of KP solutions will be sought. Reductions of the four dimensional self-dual Yang Mills (SDYM) system, which is viewed as a ""master"" integrable system, leads to the study of novel nonlinear ordinary differential equations whose solutions possess unusual features. Special cases are the classical Darboux-Halphen system and Chazy equation, in general position. The solutions of these systems are related to modular/automorphic functions; and in the case of Chazy, it is related to the well known Ramanujan functions. Research involving new reductions of SDYM will continue. The investigation of differential-difference nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations has shown that new vector extensions of a previously derived  scalar difference NLS equation has soltion solutions and is integrable by the inverse scattering transform. The scalar and vector difference NLS systems reduce in the continuous limit to the physically important NLS equations. New solutions and properties of this vector difference NLS equation will be studied. Recent experimental and theoretical studies of water waves has shown that modulation of periodic waves exhibit nonrepeatible, chaotic dynamics whereas localized soltion soltuions do not possess these properties. This work was motivated by earlier research by the PI on computational chaos. Current research indicates that this phenomena also occurs in nonlinear optics and appears to be universal in character. This infinite dimensional and possibly universal chaotic dynamics will be studied in detail.<br/><br/>The dynamics of wave systems with large amplitude is often referred to as nonlinear wave motion. Unlike small amplitude phenomena where substantial and wide ranging theory is available, the mathematical investigation of nonlinear wave motion is still at an early stage of  development. Nonlinear wave equations, such as the ones described in  this proposal, are centrally important in many physical applications. Two examples are water waves and nonlinear optics,  including fiber optic communications.  Extremely stable, localized nonlinear waves called solitons, is a subject which is closely related to the research investigations in this project. The study of nonlinear optics has focused in recent years on the study of localized large amplitude pulses such as solitons. Such pulses, are used in a variety of ways such as the shaping and controlling of light beams. In fiber optic communications, understanding the properties of large amplitude optical pulses are important for the next generation of communication systems.  The mathematical discoveries made in the field of nonlinear fiber optic waves only a few years years ago are now at the cusp of commercial application. It is expected that publication of all new results will be published in prominent  journals.<br/><br/>"

The asymptotic behavior of the Boussinesq approximation of Rayleigh-Benard convection in the regime of large Prandtl number or small Ekman number.  For the large Prandtl number regime, the goal is to derive effective dynamics uniformly valid in time and investigate the validity of such approximation in terms of orbital convergence and convergence in the statistical sense.  Another goal here is to investigate asymptotic behavior at large time and large Rayleigh number of the simplified infinite Prandtl number model.  For the small Ekman number case, the objective is to derive the leading order of the rate of heat transport in the vertical direction.  2. The long time asymptotic behavior of two-dimensional flows under the bombardment of small-scale vortices.  Here the goal is to explain the numerically observed phenomena of emergence of large-scale coherent structures when the flow is forced by random small-scale vortices.  The project will be carried out through a combination of asymptotic expansion, rigorous analysis, and numerical computation.<br/><br/>Thermal convection, that is, heat driven fluid motion, is one of the most widespread and most important type of fluid motions in the universe.  Convection is a major feature of the dynamics of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the interiors of stars and planets.  It is also important in many industrial processes.  Nevertheless, the understanding of convection is fundamentally incomplete due to the extreme complexity of the problem.  Various simplifications are called for in order to make progress.  Here we consider situations that are of great importance in geophysical applications, and we derive and study simplified dynamics of heat convection.  The emergence of large-scale structures, such as the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, is a ubiquitous feature of geophysical fluid problems.  Understanding the mechanism of the emergence and persistence of such structures is one of the most intriguing issues in geophysical fluid dynamics.  Here we plan to study the emergence of large-scale structure in a randomly driven environment.  The expected successful completion of this project will enhance our understanding of these prototype fluid problems and provide insights into more complex fluid problems that we encounter in industrial manufacturing processes, as well as in the meteorology/climate models that are intimately related to the study of global environment change.  The ideas that we develop here will be useful in studying other physical problems as well.<br/>"

In the school of such optimization models, the class of Optimal Controls occupies an essential position since it stems from applications in a variety of fields.  This class is distinguished by the presence of ""hard"" constraints such as the control and the state constraints.  The generalized problem of Bolza, introduced by R.T. Rockafellar, includes under its wing the class of optimal controls.  There, constraints are built into the objective function (or Lagrangian) through ""nonsmooth penalty"" terms.  It is observed that better smoothness behavior is displayed by this model's Hamiltonian.  The aim of the first part of the research is to complete the study of the generalized Bolza problem from the point of view of its Hamiltonian.  The plan is to build a comprehensive second-order optimality theory and a stability analysis when the state constraints are present.  The second goal of this research is to launch the study of optimal control problems over ""time scales,"" that is, when the underlying time belongs to a compact set, not necessarily a connected interval.  In particular, the aim is to develop necessary and sufficient criteria for optimality.  Substantial modification of the latest techniques in continuous- and discrete-time optimal controls and in nonsmooth analysis will be instrumental in achieving the goals of this research.<br/><br/>In recent years, systems in which the running time could be continuous or discrete have taken the front row due to their appearance in a wide range of applications.

This type of model is directly related to ""hybrid systems,"" which occur in population dynamics, automotive electronics, automated systems, air traffic management systems, integrated system design, and multi-media.  In these disciplines, one encounters applications that are formulated mathematically as continuous-time optimal control problems with constraints on the input and/or output, or as optimal control problems over time scales.  For the former, important questions remain unanswered regarding finding accurate criteria to identify optimal candidates.  On the other hand, since the latter is a completely new direction of research, very few results are known and several open questions need to be answered.  The aim of this research is to develop criteria that serve in identifying optimal candidates for each of these classes of problems.<br/>"

Momentum conservation laws in nonholonomic mechanics are subtle as the classical Noether theorem does not in general apply. This leads to rich dynamics which the investigators study.  The role of integrability and discrete symmetries in nonholonomic systems is also analyzed.  The investigators study various extensions of the energy-momentum method to both stability, stabilization and control of physical systems.  In the nonholonomic setting integrability of the momentum equation is utilized, while in general use is made of the method of controlled Lagrangians.<br/><br/>The dynamics of systems with velocity constraints (such as rolling and sliding constraints)  has numerous applications in industry; robotics and the dynamics of wheeled vehicles are examples. In applications, stabilization of steady-state motions (such as the straightforward motion of a car at a constant speed) is often desired.  The investigators use various tools from the geometric theory of dynamics and control for studying such motions and, more importantly, for programming desired motions in the presence of control forces.  The study is ultimately aimed at the design of energy-efficient controllers based on the natural mechanical features of the systems under investigation.  The dynamics of single-wheeled vehicles is of special interest because of their exceptional, maneuverability.  More complex systems are studied as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The PI also plans to study perturbative quantum invariants (due to Vassiliev and Kontsevich) and the related problem of deformation theory of tensor categories.  In the area of quantum information theory, the PI plans to study analogues of foundational results in probability theory such as the central limit theorem, as well as possible applications of representation<br/>theory and quantum groups.<br/><br/>One of the foundations of modern mathematics and physics is non-commutative algebra, which is the study of abstract formulas in which multiplication does not commute (although addition still does).

Quantum computation is at once an important theoretical elaboration of quantum mechanics and a possible future technology.  Topology is the study of knots, links, and abstract geometric spaces.  It is closely related to symmetry and it has applications to many other areas of mathematics, as well as to questions in physics and economics and even to the study of DNA.<br/>"

As in physics,<br/>the primary challenges include the identification of scales at<br/>which asynchronous individual-level activities form patterns,<br/>mechanisms behind pattern formation, and appropriate methods of<br/>data collection.  During the last few decades, enormous progress<br/>has been made in ecology through the integration of mathematics,<br/>statistics, and laboratory experiments.  The hypothesis that<br/>fluctuations in animal abundance are explainable largely by<br/>simple rules has been rigorously and successfully tested in<br/>controlled laboratory studies.  Robust qualitative and<br/>quantitative prediction has become possible for several<br/>laboratory systems, but this success has not been duplicated in<br/>the field.  The investigators wish to extend this success to the<br/>field.  The existence of a predictive mathematical model for a<br/>field system, and a successful test of nonlinear dynamics theory<br/>in the field, would constitute a major advance in ecology.  In<br/>preliminary work the investigators used the techniques of<br/>dynamical systems theory to explain and predict the dynamics of<br/>patch occupancy by seabirds at three temporal scales.  Based on<br/>this success, they now 1) develop an accurate mathematical<br/>predictive model of the spatial distribution dynamics of seabirds<br/>in a heterogeneous system of habitat patches, 2) rigorously test<br/>nonlinear dynamics theory in the field, and 3) reduce the schism<br/>between mathematics and biology by developing a paradigm of tight<br/>interdisciplinary vertical integration.  Integration of activities<br/>is three-tiered, including interdisciplinary research,<br/>substantial undergraduate participation, and development of a<br/>quantitative literacy program for undergraduates.  Collaboration<br/>of undergraduates in a research team with the investigators is<br/>expected to lead to publication and presentations by the<br/>students.  Courses in both mathematics and biology train students<br/>in basic mathematical techniques applicable to biology.<br/>     The ability to predict how many plants or animals will<br/>occupy a certain habitat at a given time could help solve many<br/>pressing world problems related to the spread of disease, food<br/>production, biological control, environmental protection, species<br/>conservation, interference between national defense activities<br/>and wildlife, and human population growth.  Mathematical equations<br/>have been used to accurately predict numbers of organisms in the<br/>laboratory, but such successes have not been extended to<br/>populations outside the laboratory.  In preliminary work, the<br/>researchers devised a mathematical equation that accurately<br/>predicts fluctuations in the number of seabirds occupying a<br/>specific habitat on Protection Island National Wildlife Refuge,<br/>Washington.  Given the day of the year, the height of the tide,<br/>and the solar elevation for some specific time in the future, the<br/>equation predicts the number of seabirds that will occupy the<br/>habitat at that time.  The ability of the equation to predict<br/>several months into the future was tested and validated.  The<br/>researchers expand this technique to predict fluctuations within<br/>an entire network of connected habitats.  The birds are not<br/>disturbed in any way; they are counted through a scope from a<br/>33-m-high observation point on a bluff more than 100 m west of<br/>the seabird colony.  The research involves 1) collaboration<br/>between mathematicians and biologists, 2) extensive research<br/>participation by undergraduate students, and 3) development of a<br/>biomathematics literacy program for both mathematics and biology<br/>undergraduate students.<br/>"

Co-continuous blends consist of distinct continuous phases that form under appropriate conditions of flow and mass compositions near the phase-inversion point.

This study is aimed at the development of criteria for detection, conditions for production, and to a better understanding of the stability of co-continuous blends.  The Newtonian flow regime is investigated and the effect of a third component, i.e. surfactants, is studied.

In parallel, experiments are targeted to provide insight and validation of the mathematical models, simulations and theory.<br/><br/>A joint theoretical, computational and experimental study of co-continuous polymer blends is performed.  Co-continuous polymer blends consist of distinct sponge-like phases where one of the phases plays the role of the sponge and the other its complement.  Such blends offer an important route to materials with unique combinations of properties not available in<br/>single polymers or in blends with traditional dispersed (non continuous) droplet morphology.  These unique properties impact strongly applications in the areas of materials and manufacturing, and biotechnology.  For example, mechanical properties such as impact strength and tensile strength can exceed those of either blend component.  Another application of co-continuous polymer blends is products for mass transfer control. In particular, a water-permeable phase containing a desiccant can be used to remove moisture from moisture sensitive products such as food or pharmaceuticals while the other phase provides mechanical strength.  The key to performance in these products is the control of pore size and volume.  This fundamental study brings together state-of-the-art mathematical and numerical analysis, modeling and large-scale scientific computation with an innovative experimental program.  The experiments are targeted to provide insight and validation of the mathematical models, simulations and theory. This research is aimed to provide guidelines for controlling pore size and volume of the blends and thus to optimize the blend properties.  It is expected to lead to significant improvements in the industrial fabrication processes of co-continuous blends and in the properties of the final products.<br/>"

A large genome can consist<br/>of billions of bases.  Chemical techniques allow scientists to<br/>read only a few hundred bases at a time.  The whole genome shotgun<br/>(WGS) assembly technique creates a draft of the sequence of a<br/>whole genome by selecting such short fragments at random from the<br/>genome, determining the sequence of the fragments, and then<br/>computationally re-assembling millions of these fragments.  Two<br/>fragments are said to ""overlap"" if it is plausible that they come<br/>from the same part of the genome, based on a comparison of their<br/>sequences.  The goal of this project is to focus efforts on<br/>producing an extremely robust set of overlaps, using a<br/>combination of sophisticated error-correction techniques, as well<br/>as ""localizing"" fragments to validate overlaps by ensuring that<br/>both fragments come from the same vicinity of the genome.<br/>Several issues complicate the determination of which pairs of<br/>fragments overlap.  First, most genomes contain many ""repeat<br/>regions,"" i.e., two or more almost identical copies of long<br/>stretches of sequence.  Thus, two fragments that do not actually<br/>overlap may look like they do.  Second, the random sampling<br/>technique results in many base errors --- bases can be mis-read<br/>or missed entirely.  These errors, combined with the fact that<br/>repeat regions usually differ slightly, make it very difficult to<br/>distinguish a spurious overlap from a true overlap in which one<br/>or both fragments contain read errors.  Thus, if extreme care is<br/>not taken, it is easy to use a spurious overlap and thereby<br/>mistakenly connect distant parts of the genome.  Preliminary<br/>results in collaboration with Celera Genomics, the Baylor College<br/>of Medicine, and The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) have<br/>demonstrated that the investigator's current techniques can<br/>already produce more sequence at higher quality.  The goal is<br/>improve these techniques and make them widely available.<br/>     The determination and interpretation of genetic information<br/>is one of the great challenges of the twenty-first century.  The<br/>genome, i.e., all the DNA in a cell, is the molecular basis of<br/>diversity and the cornerstone of genetic information.  Draft<br/>genomes have been obtained for human, mouse, and some insects,<br/>fish, plants, and bacteria.  This is a start, but a full<br/>understanding of biological processes cannot be had by studying<br/>the genomes of only a handful of species.  The federal government<br/>is spending about 100 million dollars per year generating<br/>sequence data.  Millions of small pieces of a genome are sampled<br/>from the genome.  The second stage is called ""assembly,"" when<br/>these pieces are re-assembled on a computer like a giant jigsaw<br/>puzzle.  The puzzle is complicated by two facts: first, many of<br/>the puzzle pieces have small errors that make them mis-fit<br/>against pieces that they SHOULD fit with; and second, many pieces<br/>that should NOT go together actually fit together quite well.<br/>This makes it extremely difficult to correctly assemble a genome.<br/>There are two ways to decrease the ambiguities: first, one could<br/>generate more pieces.  However, each new piece costs about $2,<br/>and one would need to generate millions of new pieces to have a<br/>significant effect on assembly quality.  The investigators use a<br/>second route.  They attempt to squeeze as much information out of<br/>the existing pieces as possible.  The latter route is<br/>substantially cheaper, and there is still much room for<br/>improvement here over existing techniques.  The investigators are<br/>using sophisticated mathematics to help discern with extreme<br/>precision those pairs of pieces that do, and those that do not,<br/>fit together.  Preliminary results of the investigators -- in<br/>collaboration with several large sequencing centers -- have<br/>demonstrated that using their techniques to ""pre-process"" the<br/>pieces can produce more of the genome, with fewer errors.  This<br/>project aims at extending these ideas further and making them<br/>freely accessible to all investigators.

These cells display a<br/>wide range of complex dynamics that are best understood with the<br/>aid of mathematical modeling and analysis.  The investigator has<br/>recently developed a new mathematical model for beta-cells that<br/>postulates an intracellular calcium subspace compartment located<br/>between the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell membrane.  This<br/>model is based on recent data from a collaborating lab, and is<br/>being further developed as new experiments are performed.  One<br/>direction of development involves the investigation of complex<br/>electrical bursting patterns that are often observed in<br/>pancreatic islets and isolated beta-cells.  The investigator<br/>determines, through mathematical modeling, whether these complex<br/>rhythms are due to oscillations in glycolysis -- that is, whether<br/>the coexistence of a membrane-driven bursting oscillator and an<br/>endogenous glycolytic oscillator is consistent with the published<br/>data, and with data from collaborating labs.  One key question<br/>that is addressed is whether these oscillators involving<br/>glycolytic rhythms can be synchronized by electrical coupling.<br/>This is a necessary condition since beta-cells are electrically<br/>coupled in islets.  Finally, the effects of stochasticity through<br/>channel noise are investigated in both single-cell and islet<br/>models.  Channel noise is evident in the electrical patterns of<br/>single beta-cells, and suppression of this noise through<br/>elecrical coupling may play a key role in the more regular and<br/>slower bursting patterns observed in islets.<br/>     The study of pancreatic islets, composed of beta-cells, is<br/>important for a number of reasons.  From a clinical viewpoint,<br/>they are key players in normal glucose homeostasis.  Because<br/>beta-cells are the only cells in the body that make and secrete<br/>insulin, their malfunction leads to type II or late-onset<br/>diabetes, the most prevalent form of the disease.  To understand<br/>what makes the cells malfunction, one must first understand their<br/>normal functioning, which is the primary aim of this work.  From a<br/>biological viewpoint, beta-cells are of great interest as the<br/>focal point of a number of biochemical and cellular processes.<br/>They are similar in many ways to neurons, but have more complex<br/>biochemical regulatory mechanisms.  Thus, information gained from<br/>the study of beta-cells largely transfers over to neurons, as<br/>well as other secretory cells.  Finally, from a mathematical<br/>viewpoint, beta-cells display rich dynamics that can only truly<br/>be understood with the aid of mathematics.  Modeling and anlysis<br/>of beta-cells has led to new mathematics, most of which can and<br/>is being applied to the study of other bursting nerve and<br/>endocrine cells.

Cell systems are<br/>used as models in a variety of applications such as neuronal<br/>networks, speciation, arrays of Josephson junctions, and gene<br/>dynamics.  In this Focused Research Group (FRG) project, the<br/>investigators develop a mathematical theory for coupled cell<br/>systems and with colleagues explore implications of that theory<br/>in applications.  The network architecture is a graph that shows<br/>the couplings between cells and which cells and couplings are<br/>identical.  Symmetries in the network architecture have been used<br/>previously to explore certain properties of solutions to cell<br/>systems, such as synchrony or traveling waves.  Symmetry, however,<br/>applies directly only to the most regular of networks.  For a<br/>larger class of coupled cell networks, local symmetries defined<br/>on part of the network can replace symmetries as a predictor of<br/>interesting and important dynamics.  These local symmetries form<br/>a groupoid and it is this groupoid structure that is used to<br/>analyze properties of solutions and transitions between solutions<br/>in coupled cell systems.  The investigators and students develop<br/>a theory of robust synchrony and investigate synchrony-breaking<br/>bifurcations in coupled cell systems (for example, network<br/>architecture often forces Takens-Bogdanov singularities to occur<br/>in codimension one at such bifurcations).  They also investigate<br/>the consequences for coupled cell systems of particular features<br/>of the internal equations of single cells, such as symmetries and<br/>fast/slow variables.<br/>     Symmetry and symmetry-breaking have been used widely by<br/>scientists and mathematicians to investigate a variety of<br/>physically and biologically interesting topics, including<br/>important types of fluid flows, crystal lattices, the existence<br/>of elementary particles, and the characteristic markings of the<br/>skins of tigers and leopards.  The crucial feature of this<br/>approach is that it is model-independent in the sense that in<br/>appropriate situations symmetry permits the development of a menu<br/>of possible outcomes and the physics or chemistry or biology<br/>chooses from this menu.  Indeed, the theory of coupled cell<br/>systems with symmetry has been applied succesfully to the<br/>analysis of different gaits in animals, pattern formation in the<br/>visual cortex, and speciation.  Relaxing the requirement that the<br/>network under consideration has symmetries extends the<br/>applicability of this approach to a wider range of problems, in<br/>particular to models of gene networks, as well as other network<br/>models from neuroscience.  In these applications it is rare that<br/>the exact model equations are known.

Carleman estimates are weighted energy estimates that are crucial tools in control theory and inverse problems.  In particular, Carleman estimates are indispensable in the study of ill-posed Cauchy problems.  Such problems are well understood for scalar partial differential equations.  However, systems of partial differential equations are much harder to treat because of multiple characteristics.  This project develops estimates for classical systems of partial differential equations arising in mathematical physics, including Maxwell's equations and the system of elasticity with variable non-smooth coefficients.<br/><br/>In order to avoid unwanted behavior of a physical system, such as large vibrations or formation of cracks, an accurate prediction of the evolution of the system is desirable.  This involves nondestructive measurements, for example on the boundary of the system.  This project is concerned with a better understanding of how much information is needed in order to predict the behavior of a physical system accurately.  Advances in many areas of engineering and material science have produced realistic mathematical models that involve systems of partial differential equations, which are the subject of this mathematical investigation.<br/>"

They describe the basic physical principles such as conservation of mass, momentum and energy, and as such arise in many applied sciences such as biomedicine (e.g., study of blood flow) and aerospace engineering (e.g., study of stability of supersonic flow around a wing of a space shuttle).  The main goals of this proposal are to understand the structure of solutions of conservation laws that model<br/>   (1) blood flow through compliant arteries, and<br/>   (2) supersonic and transonic flow problems in more than one space <br/>dimension.<br/><br/>(1) The proposer's research on one-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws modeling blood flow in compliant arteries stems from the study of blood flow through the abdominal aorta after endovascular repair of abdominal aneurysm using inserted prostheses called ``stents''. The proposer has begun an investigation of the dynamics of the abdominal aorta and of the stents, subject to the pressure induced by the pulsatile blood flow. The plan is to work on two problems which are essential in understanding fluid-structure interaction between blood flow and vessel wall: (a) mathematically rigorous derivation of the new, improved one-dimensional models that would account for both the longitudinal and the radial displacements of the vessel wall and and of the stent, and (b) mathematical analysis of the reduced models<br/>which have discontinuous coefficients to account for the fact that the aorta and the prostheses have different elastic properties.<br/>(2) The research on supersonic and transonic flow problems in more than one space dimension has been motivated by the fact that in spite of the importance of the applications, the theory for transonic flow problems in more than one space dimension is still underdeveloped. This is primarily due to the fact that <br/>new singularities appear in the solutions which cannot be analyzed by one- dimensional techniques. The main objective in this proposal is to study singularities and global structure of self-similar solutions in <br/>two-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws by using and by developing the techniques for free-boundary problems that describe transonic shocks, and by using and developing the analysis of mixed (hyperbolic-elliptic) systems arising in the subsonic part of the flow.<br/><br/>Much of this proposal has been motivated by the work on vascular prostheses (stents) initiated by the proposer through a multi-disciplinary collaboration with cardiologist Dr. Z. Krajcer (Texas Heart Institute), molecular biologist Dr. Doreen Rosenstrauch (Texas Heart Institute) and material scientist Dr. K. Ravi-Chandar (UT-Austin). The main goal is to advance knowledge of this<br/>fundamental area of mathematics while at the same time guide research in applications related to biomedical research and to transonic flow. The results of this research will be important not only in the development of new mathematical theories, but also in the design of reliable numerical schemes for high-performance computing of blood flow in human arteries and in the optimal design of vascular prostheses for certain cardiovascular interventions.<br/><br/>"

His objectives are <br/>to gain both better understanding and simplifications of complexity, which <br/>include complexity reduction for the protein folding problem, effect of <br/>solutes on the enhancement of strength of alloys, and mechanism of singularity <br/>formation in air, water, and liquid crystals. The methods include hard, soft, <br/>and asymptotic analysis, numerical computation, and techniques of mathematical <br/>modeling. The mathematical issues proposed to study are all fundamental for <br/>the understanding of the respective subject areas. For instance, the search <br/>for a measurement of distance between three points in the protein folding <br/>problem is to reduce drastically the huge number of local minima of the energy <br/>potential and thus bring the complexity to a comprehensible level. The issues <br/>proposed in the phase-field model of alloys is to provide the quantitative as <br/>well as qualitative foundation for manipulating the effect of solutes in <br/>strengthening the alloys.

Scientists and engineers have used mathematical <br/>equations, called partial differential equations, to model motions or <br/>evolution. The turbulent nature and/or defects in the materials and the <br/>complexity of life show up in the form of singularities and instabilities <br/>in the solutions of the equations or in the complexity of the equations <br/>themselves. In the protein folding problem, the equations themselves need <br/>to be mathematically simplified for a computer to do real time numerical <br/>simulation. In all the other cases, where the equations are quite simple, <br/>it is these singularities and instabilities that often spoil accurate <br/>numerical computations of the solutions. Yuxi Zheng plans to use the state <br/>of the art analytical tools to study the structures of the singular solutions. <br/>In the case of a compressible gas such as air, for example, Yuxi Zheng plans <br/>to isolate typical singularities (hurricanes, tornadoes, shocks, etc.) <br/>and investigate their individual structures.

Due to technical and computational difficulties, it is impossible in most cases to find the optimal trajectories for a given criterion.  In addition, often the situation is complicated by the existence of more than one quantity to be minimized. <br/><br/>This research project investigates a new approach to such minimization problems with two costs to be minimized.  We do not try to find an optimal synthesis for a given cost.  Instead, we start with the set of all extremals for one cost, say time, as guaranteed by the maximal principle.  Then, using higher order necessary conditions coming from the maximum principle, coupled with differential geometric techniques, we reduce the set of candidate extremals to optimality for this cost to some significantly smaller set of extremals.  We then minimize the other cost, say energy, over this smaller set of candidate time minimizers.  We focus our method to apply to the very important class of controlled mechanical systems.  The Lie algebra generated by the vector fields describing such systems possesses commutativity properties that make our computations possible.<br/><br/>The major application of our theory is the control of robotic underwater vehicles, which is an area of intense current interest among oceanographers, geophysicists, et al.  The strategy described above is based on promising results previously obtained on controlling the motion of such a vehicle.  The methods under development will be incorporated into a working vessel through collaboration with the University of Hawaii College of Engineering Autonomous Systems Laboratory.  The results of the project will provide enhanced research tools to scientists in a wide variety of disciplines.<br/><br/>Robotic underwater vehicles are intended to be versatile and reliable tools designed, for instance, to intelligently and independently detect and monitor oceanographic phenomena, to collect samples, or to work on minesweeping where human intervention would be too risky.  Unmanned underwater vehicles can be sent on long duration missions, can take measurements over large distances and variations in depth, and are not dependent on human skill for realization of mission goals.  This research project develops mathematical control theory for direct application to improvement of robotic underwater vehicle capabilities.<br/>"

Scanned probe oxidation is a lithographic technique for producing nanoscale patterns on a substrate.  These patterns have been employed successfully as an etch mask for wet and dry processes, and as chemical and biological templates.  The increased demand for such high quality nanodevices requires better understanding of the growth processes involved in their fabrication.   Although data on nanodeposition techniques have been collected over the past decade, investigators are only beginning to develop a qualitative picture of these processes, and are far from a complete quantitative understanding.  The proposed research addresses both of these timely needs.  Because of the varied and coupled physical phenomena involved (electromagnetic, chemical, thermal, etc.), the development of mathematical models for nanodeposition requires a team of individuals with complementary areas of expertise, and must proceed hand-in-hand with experimental validations. Such a team, consisting of interdisciplinary applied mathematicians, scientists and engineers is already active at The University of Akron and working in the area of nanomechanics and nanostructures.  This team proposes to develop models for scanned probe oxidation that will, 1) explain experimental observations that are not well understood, and 2) suggest the range of parameters that is optimal for nanoscale growth.  The team intends to develop appropriate solution and analysis procedures for these complex models, and test the validity of the models through comparison with experiments.  The models will focus attention on the need to develop efficient solution strategies to solve complicated systems in the presence of noise.  Further, the models developed in this work will lead to a significant number of problems in analysis.  Questions on well-posedness, the use of similarity solutions, and bounds on solutions for the class of problems represented by the models will arise from the proposed efforts.<br/><br/>This project proposes to develop mathematical models for the electrochemical nanocell that forms during scanned probe oxidation.  Scanned probe oxidation is a critical technology for writing nanometer-size oxide patterns on the surface of a substrate.  These oxide patterns can be used to prototype nanoscale masks, templates and devices.  The proposed combination of modeling and experimental efforts will help to address the fundamental unanswered questions concerning the physics and chemistry of nanoscale structure formation and properties.  In particular this project will provide the understanding necessary to control the height and width of oxide lines to produce precise nanoscale patterns.  In addition to its impact on scientific research, this project will enhance graduate and undergraduate studies in the disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering.  Students participating in the program will, 1) be exposed tointerdisciplinary research involving sophisticated mathematical modeling and experiments, and 2) be trained to work within a multi-disciplinary environment.  The educational training at both the graduate and undergraduate level will have a long-term impact on the mathematical sciences, providing students with exposure to a unique interdisciplinary environment and inspiring them to pursue careers in this cutting-edge area of national interest.<br/><br/>"

To accommodate systems in the real world, shifts in regimes need to be taken into consideration. Take for instance, the situation in a stock market, the market parameters depend on the market mode that jumps between the ""bullish"" and ""bearish"" states. In these states, the corresponding market parameters are quite different resulting in markedly different behavior. In addition, the stock market also exhibits multi-time-scale structure. Such models and time-scale separations also appear in communication networks, production planning and other applications.

Faraday waves, excited on the free surface of a fluid, form in a wide variety of patterns depending on the fluid properties and the form of the periodic forcing function. The investigator's research program focuses on a bifurcation analysis of three- and four-wave interactions when a periodic sequence of delta-function impulses is applied to the fluid container. This idealized forcing function admits unprecedented analytic progress to be made in the linear and weakly nonlinear regimes that apply at or near onset of instability.  This project probes how the periodic forcing function may be designed to favor particular patterns. In the second research project spatio-temporal feedback is used to probe the nonlinear pattern formation process, as well as to actively control it. The control of spatio-temporal patterns by local time-delayed and spatially-transformed feedback will be investigated through linear stability analysis, equivariant bifurcation theory, and numerical simulation. In the third project, models of inner ear hair cells, responsible for translating sound-induced motion into electrical signals, are analysed.  The initial focus is on amphibian hair cells, for which two separate mechanisms that contribute to the cells' frequency selectivity have been identified - one due to active mechanical motions of the hair bundle and the other captured by an electrochemical model of ion channels in the hair cell body.  In each model proximity to a Hopf bifurcation contributes to the amplification properties of the hair cells.  The investigator's research project uses dynamical systems methods to derive a reliable reduced model, from existing detailed physiological models of the two Hopf bifurcation mechanisms, with attention to the effects of this two-stage amplification on gain and frequency selectivity.  This project lays the foundation for further investigation of the effects of coupling the hair cell bundles.<br/><br/>Many spatially extended nonlinear systems, including hydrodynamic and laser systems, exhibit spatio-temporal chaotic behavior when subjected to external forcing.  The investigator's research program will lead to a deeper understanding of how to eliminate irregular behavior in favor of spatio-temporally regular patterns.  This is done through appropriate design of the temporal forcing function in the case of hydrodynamic waves, or through spatio-temporal feedback in the case of nonlinear optical and chemical systems. Careful comparison between theoretical results and results of experimental investigations will be made, providing valuable feedback to this research effort.  The investigator's analysis of biophysical models of inner ear hair cells contributes to a greater understanding of how the nonlinearities in two proposed mechanisms of frequency selectivity and amplification might work together to achieve greater gain.  The training of applied mathematics graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary research activities is an integral part of the research effort.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

There is potential application for coated nanofibers, and the nanotubes that result after dissolution of the nanofiber cores, in the areas of filtration, composites, biomedicine, and electronics.  The ever increasing demand for these high quality nanomaterials applications drives the need for models that describe the coating process as well as models that describe the material and electromagnetic properties of manufactured nanofibers and nanotubes.  The coating of nanofibers by physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods is a process that is only partially understood.  While data on nanodeposition techniques have been collected for over a decade, a comprehensive quantitative model of the coating process has not yet been developed.  The proposed research addresses this timely need by outlining a plan to develop truly multiscale models and simulations of coating growth at the continuum length scale while proceeding hand-in-hand with experimental validation.  The PVD method allows for control over the experimental conditions so that comparisons between the experimental results and the<br/>model predictions will be straightforward.  The plan to link asymptotic analysis, numerical simulation, quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics constitutes a major step in the study of nanoscale phenomena.  The models and simulations will connect global continuum models in a PVD plasma reactor, local nanoscale models around a coated fiber, and quantummechanical and molecular dynamics models at the atomistic scale.  These models will provide inputs to a macroscopic scale model of the coating growth so that the morphology of the coating can be tracked via a level set method.  The overall goals of the multiscale modeling, simulation, and experimental efforts are to provide an understanding of how PVD process parameters affect the coating growth, to identify an optimal range of parameters for controlling the growth, to explain experimental observations of coating growth that are not well understood, and to determine the effective electromagnetic properties of the completed product.<br/><br/>This project proposes to develop multiscale mathematical models and algorithms for simulating the growth of a coating on a nanofiber.  The coating of nanofibers with specific materials is a relatively new process for producing coated nanofibers and nanotubes (that result after removing the nanofiber cores).  These nanostructures have many potential applications in filtration, composites, biomedicine, and electronics.  The proposed combination of modeling and experimental efforts will help to address the fundamental unanswered questions concerning the physics and chemistry of nanofiber coating and the properties of the coating.  In particular, this project will provide the understanding necessary to control the coating thickness and uniformity to produce nanotubes with desired dimensional features.  In addition to its impact on scientific research, this project will enhance the training of graduate students in nanoscale modeling.   This is essential for the development of a strong industrial base in nanotechnology.  This research project will allow The University of Akron to develop the expertise necessary to augment existing programs to include a specialization in nanotechnology modeling, at the graduate and the undergraduate level.  Further, it is anticipated that the enhanced understanding of nanoscale manufacturing processes gained during this research effort will allow manufacturers to improve existing products and to develop new products.<br/>"

This program at the Fields Institute intends to focus on ""current problemsin elliptic and parabolic PDE"", principally in areas that are motivated by applied mathematics, mathematical physics and/or differential geometry. The theory of elliptic and parabolic PDE arises in numerous problems in the physical sciences, including the structure of superconducting materials, phase transitions in continuous media, the microstructure of new materials for novel applications, and the modeling of pattern formation in a large variety of physical systems.

These techniques, which yield systems of nonlinear amplitude equations of considerable mathematical interest, will be applied to a wide variety of cases of practical importance including extensible and shearable rods, tubes conveying fluids, and growing filamentary organisms. The studies of wave propagation in filaments under various conditions will be investigated by a variety of analytical stability techniques, and the investigations of singularity formation will draw on adaptations of techniques used to study wave propagation in inhomogeneous media. The modeling of elastic growth pertinent to biological processes will be developed according to continuum mechanical principles and applied to both filamentary and three dimensional structures.<br/><br/><br/>Filamentary structures are ubiquitous in both the natural and  physical worlds at scales ranging from the microscopic to the macroscopic. In nature we see the sinuous motion of vines and plant tendrils; under the optical microscope we can see filamentary bacteria; and through electron microscopy we can see the structure of DNA strands. If the original motivations for developing a rational continuum mechanics of filamentary structures was provided by the mechanical world of cables, springs and struts, contemporary research has often been motivated by the biological context. These problems, including the fundamental natural phenomenon of growth, raise new challenges to the classical formulations. While the static theory of elastic structures has a long and distinguished history, the theory of dynamical effects still presents many important challenges, both theoretically and computationally. Work of the principal investigators over the past few years has shown that the governing equations of elastic filaments, can be reduced to more tractable nonlinear evolution equations capable of describing many dynamical bifurcations including the fundamental twist-to-writhe conversion. If this earlier work concentrated on  simplest cases, the extension of this theory to a whole host of important cases of practical importance has yet to be developed. In addition to the effects of  structural asymmetry, and  inhomogeneity, the effects of internal fluid flow that arise in pipes and hoses, and the incorporation of growth effects required for biological modeling, will  be addressed in work supported by this award. Once achieved, these formulations will provide the necessary mathematical tools to study conformation changes, instability, and wave propagation in filamentary structures as varied as whips, hoses and bacterial filaments. The principal investigators will apply these studies to the analysis of filamentary and other elastic structures in a variety of mechanical and biological settings such as the  spontaneous change in handedness exhibited by climbing plants and other filamentary organisms, twist wave propagation in bacterial filaments, and morphological changes in aerially growing bacterial microorganisms and fungi. In all these examples, natural growth is a fundamental component in the morphological dynamics, and a variety of investigations will be carried out to improve our understanding of how this fundamental natural effect can be incorporated into self-consistent mathematical models. These will range from the inclusion of growth terms in the constitutive equations for rods, to the development of continuum mechanical models of growing three dimensional elastic structures such as those arising in the description of bulk growth in biological tissues.<br/>"

The main classes of problems addressed are those for which the associated dynamic programming equation takes the form of a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation (HJB PDE). The semigroups associated with such problems are time-indexed operators which are max-plus linear. The max-plus linearity may be exploited to develop numerical methods for HJB PDEs, which might be described as (max-plus) spectral methods. These form a completely new class of numerical methods for HJB PDEs. The project will also consider approaches where one can construct complex operators in the semiconvex dual space from operators for simpler problems such as linear-quadratic problems. This allows one to avoid the curse-of-dimensionality in the most computationally intensive portion of the computations in max-plus based methods for problems whose operators may be approximated by such constructions in the dual-space.<br/><br/>Control Theory is useful for any system where one desires to estimate the true state of the system and/or to control its future behavior. The methods of control theory apply to a tremendous variety of real-world systems such as aircraft dynamics, spacecraft dynamics, portfolio optimization, option pricing, and collections of robotic vehicles. Although the control of systems whose behavior is close to linear has been quite successful, there are many problems where the system behavior may be highly nonlinear, and the number of such problems is on the rise. The solution of nonlinear control problems is quite difficult, and not computationally tractable for systems whose states are described by more than just two or three scalar variables. The solution of such problems is most often obtained by the solution of an associated partial differential equation. The most common approach has been to adopt finite element methods (often used to solve problems such as fluid flow) in order to solve such partial differential equations, and consequently, the control problems. However, the computational requirements grow exponentially fast as a function of the number of scalar state variables.<br/><br/>This is commonly referred to as the curse-of-dimensionality. Due to this exponential growth in computational cost, we cannot hope that faster computers will lead to solution of reasonably large problems in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we must explore alternative approaches to the solution of such problems. In this project, we apply a new class of methods to such nonlinear control problems. These methods exploit the fact that these nonlinear problems are linear over a different set of algebraic operations known as the max-plus algebra. By employing this max-plus linearity, one can obtain new numerical methods that appear to provide computational savings. Although one cannot hope to completely remove the curse-of-dimensionality, these methods should attenuate its effects.<br/>"

The physics of such evolutions involves an intricate interplay between the surface energy, the bulk elastic energy, and the deposition. In particular, it is well known from experiment and numerical studies of model equations that the presence of bulk driving forces has dramatic consequences on the coarsening dynamics of faceted crystal growth; e.g., accelerated coarsening, and significant change in surface morphology.  We propose a theoretical study of a class of bulk-driven faceting crystal growth models aimed at elucidating this transition. Our equations arise from continuum models based on strongly anisotropic surface energies which yield faceted structures.  The dominant mass transport mechanisms considered include either attachment kinetics (evaporation/condensation) or surface diffusion.  The resulting equations have the form of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation supplemented by a Cahn-Hilliard-like operator.  Of particular note is a new model equation, which incorporates bulk elastic energy into the surface diffusion-controlled evolution of a faceted, epitaxially strained thin film.  The PI studies the coarsening dynamics of these model equations for both one- and two-dimensional surface morphologies.  The coarsening exponents asociated with the growth of the characteristic length(s) of the faceted surface are sought.  Also, the specific surface morphologies which emerge are analyzed.  The approach is based on a novel sharp interface theory which has recently been developed by the PI for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Aviles-Giga equation.  It is based on a matched asymptotic analysis that takes advantage of the interfacial structure which emerges during faceted evolution; extended facets meet at narrow rounded edges.  The resulting theory yields an intrinsic (sharp-interface) characterization of the evolution of the associated edge network.<br/><br/>Ordered arrays of quantum dots are envisioned as the basis for the next generation of supercomputer chips, each dot serving as a ""bit.""  An understanding of the dynamic evolution of such quantum dot arrays is critical for such an ambition to be realized.  However, the theory of such dynamics is in its infancy; e.g., during molecular beam epitaxy or liquid-phase growth.  The scope of research envisioned in the proposal contributes to our understanding and mastery of this technologically important problem.  The PI is also undertaking the research training of a graduate and an undergraduate student as part of this proposal, thereby enhancing the mathematical research and education infrastructure. <br/><br/>"

Multi-frequency forcing affords substantially greater control of the system and may give access to dynamical labyrinthine patterns and may allow the annihilation of spiral waves; by allowing to tune the interaction between spatially periodic modes it may stabilize and select spatial structures exhibiting multiple length scales such as superlattices or quasipatterns. In contrast to the well-studied Faraday waves in vertically vibrated fluids, the oscillators may loose their phase-locking relative to the forcing, which may add temporal complexity to the superlattices and quasipatterns. Multi-frequency forcing of oscillatory media can be implemented in the light-sensitive chemical reactions currently investigated experimentally. 2) The importance of networks comprised of discrete elements and exhibiting complex topology has been increasingly appreciated. Most attention has been given to their geometrical properties. The second project will elucidate how the dynamics of a network of locally coupled discrete excitable elements is impacted by the addition of random long-range connections, which transform the network into a small-world network. The research is inspired by studies of cortical brain tissue in which neural networks with local and non-local connectivity exhibit persistent activity without external input. Can the long-range connections induce the persistent activity in the absence of external input? How does it depend on the network topology? How robust is the bistability between the active and the quiescent state with respect to noise? <br/><br/>The mathematical theory of dynamical systems provides powerful tools to understand and predict the dynamical behavior of systems in many areas of science and engineering. The work of the PI and his collaborators will focus on two distinct classes of systems that are comprised of a large number of interacting dynamical elements. 1) Spontaneous oscillations occur in many spatially extended natural systems, e.g. chemical systems. They can lead to the propagation of waves that have important biological functions. For instance, cAMP-waves provide the signaling between Dictyostelium cells when they aggregate to form a multi-cellular organism, and calcium waves provide communication inside a wide variety of cells. It is important to understand how such oscillations respond to a variability of their environment. The variation has strongest impact when its frequency is close to a multiple of the natural frequency of the oscillation.  The first project will identify various consequences resulting from such near-resonant variations. It is expected that the results on spiral dynamics will also be relevant for excitable media like heart muscle. In view of the significance of spirals during life-threatening ventricular fibrillation the  question whether multi-frequency forcing can annihilate spirals is of particular interest. 2) Self-sustained activity of networks of neurons is essential for various tasks of the brain such as its ability to quickly store information for a brief duration while performing a task based on that information (e.g. when dialing a phone number) and then deleting it. The second project will shed light on what kind of connectivity between the neurons is favorable for tasks like that. - Teaching graduate students analytical and computational methods and their application as well as communication skills is an integral part of both research projects.<br/><br/>"

The primary goal is to develop precise, mathematically certain statements about these models by applying techniques from the fields of analysis and partial differential equations.  This research is related to the underlying physical science in several ways:  first, it can validate, determine limits on the range of applicability, or in some cases invalidate the models;  second, rigorous mathematical analysis of the models can lead to deeper understanding of the physical phenomena;  finally, by determining topologies in which the models are well-posed and elucidating underlying reasons for this structure, the work can set the stage for the development of computer procedures for the effective computation of approximate solutions.<br/><br/>The proposer will study mathematical questions concerning important models of compressible fluids and materials.

In particular, we analyze the <br/>Markov Decision Problem (MDP) with n states and m actions <br/>for each state, a special class of real-number linear programs <br/>with the Leontief matrix structure.  The research objectives and <br/>activities include the following: 1) Develop a new class of <br/>algorithms, ""combinatorial interior-point algorithms"", for <br/>solving the MDP, with the best achievable complexity result and <br/>practical efficiency; and establish certain complexity lower <br/>bounds for the MDP, which may provide a ""negative result"" on <br/>the quest for whether or not there is a strongly polynomial time <br/>algorithm for LP.  2) Both undergraduate and graduate students <br/>will participate in the project, new course materials on the MDP <br/>will be produced, and the PI will also give presentations to the <br/>Stanford Summer Program for grades K-12 and community <br/>college students in the Bay Area. 3) Apply the new fast MDP <br/>algorithm to research activities in function areas such as Call <br/>Admission and Routing, Strategic Asset Allocation, Supply-<br/>Chain Management, Emissions Reductions, and Semiconductor <br/>Wafer Fabrication.<br/><br/>Due to the relentless research effort in LP algorithms, a linear <br/>program can be solved today one million times faster than it was <br/>done twenty years ago. Businesses, large and small, use linear <br/>programming models to optimize communication systems, to <br/>schedule transportation networks, to control inventories, to plan <br/>investments, and to maximize productivity.  Furthermore, LP <br/>has become a popular subject now taught in undergraduate, <br/>graduate, and MBA curriculums, advancing human knowledge <br/>and promoting scientific understanding. Recently, there has been <br/>a renewed and strong interest in the MDP (a special large-scale <br/>LP) due to its wide applications.  With the rising demand in <br/>telecommunication network resources, effective management is <br/>as important as ever. Call Admission (deciding which calls to <br/>accept/reject) and routing (allocating links in the network to <br/>particular calls) are examples of decisions that must be made at <br/>any point in time. The objective is to make the ""best"" use of <br/>limited network resources.  Such sequential decision problems <br/>can be addressed by a dynamic programming model and the <br/>MDP. Another application: the threat of global warming that <br/>may result from the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other <br/>""greenhouse gases"" poses a serious dilemma.  In particular, cuts <br/>in emission levels bear a detrimental short-term impact on <br/>economic growth.  At the same time, a depleting environment <br/>can severely hurt the economy - especially the agricultural <br/>sector - in the longer term. To complicate the matter further, <br/>scientific evidence on the relationship between emission levels <br/>and global warming is inconclusive, leading to uncertainty about <br/>the benefits of various cuts. One systematic approach to <br/>considering these conflicting goals involves the formulation of a <br/>dynamic system and MDP model that describes our <br/>understanding of economic growth and environmental science, <br/>as is done by Nordhaus.  However, these MDP problems are too <br/>complex to be solved by the current MDP solvers.

These systems are frequently metastable.  They give rise to challenging and novel issues for modeling, analysis, and simulation.  In this project we have isolated two broad areas for investigation directly from potential application.  Diffusion- mediated transport applies to Brownian motors and molecular ratchets and, typically, involves very small scales. Here, there is a collaboration between a diffusive process, which tends to spread density isotropically through a medium, and a transport process, which tends to localize density, to produce net transport or work when either taken separately would not. Methods from Monge-Kantorovich mass transportation theory are employed to determine the metastable environment of this type of system, but additional techniques seem to be required for better information.  The second broad area concerns interfaces in polycrystalline materials and especially the large-scale simulation of grain growth.  Here we are implementing a novel data structure and carefully designed algorithms to produce simulations which can accommodate experimentally derived energy and mobility functions and also be large enough to produce reliable statistics.  It is a fundamental question to actually derive the relationship between the statistics and the simulation. <br/><br/>Mesoscale phenomena in biological and material systems assume prominence when an intermediate length or time scale is required to assess gross system behavior or when the finer active scales cannot be directly interrogated.  These systems are frequently metastable.  They give rise to challenging and novel issues for modeling, analysis, and simulation.  Here, we have chosen two quite different areas with important applications.  Diffusion-mediated transport lies behind the Brownian motor.  This mechanism is implicated, most importantly, in the motor proteins responsible for eukaryotic cellular traffic.  The opportunity to discover the interplay between chemistry and mechanics and to elaborate the implications of metastability could not offer a more exciting venue.  The second broad area concerns interfaces in polycrystalline materials and their large-scale simulation. Most useful materials are polycrystalline, comprised of many small grains separated by interfaces called grain boundaries.  These interfaces play a role in many material properties and across many scales of use.  Preparing arrangements of grains and boundaries, a texture suitable for a given purpose, is a central problem in microstructure. There is a changing paradigm of experimental science.  Automated data acquisition technologies, now practiced in disciplines as varied as materials science and molecular biology, allow interrogation at vastly diverse ranges of scales.  These scales need not be the smallest nor the largest and, indeed, they are typically those mesoscales which are rich in information.  The principal challenge is the development of strategies for the extraction of this information in a reliable and robust way.  Simulation is becoming an increasingly important tool and, moreover, interpreting the results of this type of simulation is a major question. We believe that understanding the predictive character of large-scale simulations of metastable systems used to interrogate and model physical and biological systems is an emerging fundamental challenge for computational science.  The goal of this project, of course, is to meet this challenge.<br/>"

Schaeffer<br/>Institution: Duke University<br/>Title: FRG: Collaborative Research: Physical, Mathematical and Engineering Problems in Slow Granular Flows<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This proposal addresses a spectrum of fundamental and applied problems in the slow flow of granular materials. It includes coordinated efforts in experiment, mathematical analysis, modeling, and numerical simulation, supported by a long-standing industrial collaboration.  Continuum models of granular materials are desirable from several points of view, but the associated partial differential equations are typically ill-posed, a mathematical difficulty that has severely hampered progress, especially for multidimensional flow.  This ill-posedness reflects a real instability, the tendency of the deformation in granular flow to localize into shear bands.  Fundamental issues surrounding the continuum description will be addressed through inter-related projects that investigate: (i) the role of discreteness and nonlinearity in regularizing the ill-posed continuum description, (ii) the formulation from micromechanical considerations, based on experiments and MD simulations, of a continuum model that accounts for microscopic velocity fluctuations, (iii) mathematical predictions and experimental tests of multidimensional steady-state hopper flows, and (iv) the settling of powders, an industrially significant prototype two-phase flow problem.<br/><br/>The research program attacks different aspects of a basic question:  What behavior of slowly flowing granular material can be understood by modeling the material as a continuum?  This is particularly an issue for industrial settings such as the flow of agricultural grains in a converging hopper:  When a silo is discharged, the granular material flows somewhat like a continuous fluid, but the forces on the hopper walls are unlike those exerted by a fluid due to the solid-like properties of the material and its discreteness.  Scientifically, we wish to understand these properties, especially the role that the discreteness of the material plays in the models.  Among other contributions, this research is expected to improve predictive capabilities in the materials- handling industry and thereby increase efficiency in manufacturing.  The group will create a research environment that integrates research with the training of students and post-docs, through weekly group meetings, participation in conferences and a new course on granular materials.  Collaboration across fields will be facilitated by the proximity of the mathematics and physics departments at Duke University, and by the existing collaborations between PIs at NC State and Duke Universities.<br/><br/>"

The basic mathematical models for such lubrication flows with strong surface tension effects are fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equations. These equations yield certain singular behaviors that make them problematic. In this work, these difficulties are overcome through the use of physically-motivated generalized models that include interaction forces between the liquid film and the solid substrate. These so-called disjoining-pressure or ``dewetting-film'' models will be used as the basis for the study of an array of interconnected problems. The goals of this research project are: (i) to mathematically establish that dewetting film models can provide faithful representations of the important physical effects in coating flows, and (ii) to extend this basic research to the design of microfluidic devices. These goals will be carried out using a combined computational and analytic study of the nonlinear partial differential equations for the dewetting models. Applying numerical simulations and similarity solutions to the two-dimensional version of the models, the dynamics of flows in structured geometries will be obtained; this work will be combined with a study of mechanisms used to drive thin film fluid flows and their stability.<br/><br/>This project focuses on mathematical models for describing the motion of drops of fluids on solid surfaces. The impact of this work lies in its role as basic research supporting advances in biomedical engineering and microfluidic technology. A major focus of this project is the use surface-tension effects for active transport of liquids. Using carefully controlled changes in the local environment, we can create surface tension forces to manipulate fluid droplets in any desired manner. This approach is a key element used in the designs of microfluidic devices for the next generation of biomedical research tools. The project will also examine how material properties of the solid surfaces influence the motion of more complicated fluids. This work will serve as the basis for understanding the important physical factors in the formulation of drug delivery bio-gels used in physiological coating flows and other biologically-motivated fluid flow problems."

These meetings have traditionally been the main general international conferences on this topic for more than 30 years.  The meeting will feature 7 one-hour survey lectures on topics of current interest (including classical approximation, wavelets, multivariate splines, nonlinear approximation, neural networks, surface approximation, and the mathematics of imaging).

Its current vitality is attested to by the large number of specialized conferences, new and well-established journals, and recently-founded research centers devoted to the subject. In addition to providing a forum for the exchange of ideas, the meeting will also help identify trends and areas for future research. The conference will help educate graduate students by exposing them to the latest research and helping them identify problems in approximation theory and related areas. Students, young researchers, minorities, and women will have the opportunity to meet leaders in the field, as well as to present their own research. Two-thirds of the requested funding will be devoted to supporting these groups, and senior researchers will be asked to help identify candidates to participate.

These applications have resulted in the development of several new subject areas of approximation theory, including neural networks, radial basis functions, and wavelets, and the subject has become more and more interdisciplinary.  This research will have a major impact on medicine, science, engineering and information technology for years to come."

This involves interesting and nonstandard issues in singular perturbation theory, dynamical systems and bifurcation, spectral theory of linear operators, and nonlinear partial differential equations, and should result in the development of new mathematical tools of general application. The ultimate physical goal is an understanding of stability phenomena that is both more complete and more precise than can be obtained within simplified models: on the one hand resolving philosophical puzzles at the level of mathematical foundations and on the other yielding quantitative predictions at the level of practical application. The plan of attack centers around Evans function and related spectral techniques developed recently in the study of stability of viscous shock fronts.<br/><br/>The stability of regular flow patterns is an old and central topic in fluid, gas, and plasma dynamics, deciding which (stable) patterns will typically be observed, and which (unstable) are only mathematical and not physically observable solutions.  The transition from stability to instability is of particular importance, since it usually signals the arising of alternative, more complicated flow patterns close to the original (now unstable) one- this is a way to understand complicated flows by the study of simpler and better-understood ones.  Despite a large and well-known body of theory on this subject, dating back to the late 1800's, there are still many aspects that are poorly understood, particularly for compressive, viscous, or reacting flows.  Here, we propose to study several of these issues arising in compressible gas and plasma dynamics, and in combustion, applications in which such usually neglected effects are of considerable practical importance.  Our goal is, by including these mathematically problematic terms, to move existing theory from the qualitative to the quantitative regime, obtaining new information of use to practitioners at the same time that we advance the mathematical theory. The planned activities have both analytic and numerical components, and involve collaboration with domestic and foreign colleagues and with current and former graduate students and post doctorates. This may be expected to strengthen and extend existing networks of cooperation across field and institution, and to aid in training of graduate and postdoctoral students.  The ultimate aim of these investigations, of quantitative predictions of transition to instability, would, if achieved, be of direct and practical use at the level of engineering, in chemical, manufacturing, and other processes.<br/>"

The research addresses several unsolved scientific problems through a combination of approximate analysis and computation. The specific projects include: (1) The investigator will determine the continuum equations for a sediment at low volume fraction, with special attention to the proper way to understand particle diffusion, and the role of intrinsic noise in the dynamics; (2) The investigator will attempt to uncover the origin of recently observed violations of the no slip boundary condition on hydrophobic surfaces. In particular the investigator will address both the stability and the dynamical consequences of small bubbles adhering to the solid surface, as observed experimentally; (3) The investigator will study the role of elastic stresses in influencing the morphology of growing tissue, and in particular develop mathematical models for the morphology of growing yeast colonies; (4) The investigator will develop accurate short time solutions to the Fokker Plank equation in arbitrary potentials as a means towards a novel algorithm for numerical computation of dynamics in fluctuating environments. The educational programs center around teaching a unified view of ''the art of approximation'' (including both asymptotic and numerical methods) to students at all levels. New courses at the graduate level and the beginning undergraduate level will be developed to teach how to effectively combine analysis with computation, for understanding difficult mathematics problems. <br/><br/>The proposal consists of two parts: the research questions to be investigated address important problems of current interest, whose solution could lead to significant scientific and technological advances, with impact on fields ranging from applied mathematics, to materials science, to geophysics and biology. The specific problems range from developing mathematical models for understanding when fluid sticks to surfaces to developing new ways of simulating complex objects undergoing Brownian motion to developing a proper mathematical description for a set of particles falling in a fluid. These are all fundamental questions whose solution could significantly advance the design and development of materials for nanotechnology. For example, all nano-scale objects in an underlying fluid undergo Brownian motion; the lack of an efficient numerical algorithm for simulating these objects severely hampers computational design efforts. The second part of the proposal is educational, focusing on developing methodologies for teaching the art of approximation (combining computation and approximate analysis in a single framework). By finding ways of training students at all levels to effectively combine analysis and computation, they will be better educated to address the important questions of today. The materials that are developed will be broadly disseminated, both through web-based and traditional texts. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The focus is on the theory of electrostatic-elastic and electrostatic-fluidic systems. The electrostatic-elastic problem of interest concerns the electrostatic deflection of elastic membranes. The study of steady-state deflections leads to the analysis of semi-linear elliptic partial differential equations. The solution set to such equations can depend heavily on the domain. In this work we will extend the theory of electrostatic deflection of membranes to include complications such as partially supported boundaries and domains which are not simply connected. Additionally, we will extend the theory of electrostatic-elastic systems to the nanoscale. In particular, we investigate the electrostatic deflection of carbon nanotubes. This requires a modification of the standard theory to handle the unique nanotube geometry. The electrostatic-fluidic problem of interest concerns induces instabilities on the surface of thin liquid films. The analysis of this problem leads to the study of thin film type equations with a novel nonlinear term due to the electrostatic pressure. Under this award, we will develop a nonlinear stability theory for such problems and extend the basic theory to the study of other electrostatic-fluidic systems of interest in MEMS and NEMS.<br/><br/>The advent of microelectromechanical systems has revolutionized numerous branches of science and industry. The rapidly developing field of nanoelectromechanical systems promises even more radical change. From biotechnology to materials science, from microelectronics to aerospace engineering, the impact of MEMS and NEMS cannot be overstated. However, in order to fully realize the potential of these systems, a theoretical understanding is necessary. This requires the construction and analysis of mathematical models of MEMS and NEMS systems. Such analysis allows for improved device design and often suggests new avenues for exploration. Interestingly, the ultra-modern technology of MEMS and NEMS often relies upon a phenomenon familiar to anyone who has walked across a carpet on a cold, dry, winter's day; namely, the phenomenon of electrostatics. Many MEMS and NEMS devices use the attraction between electrostatic charges to generate forces. In this project, we study such devices. In particular, we study the use of electrostatic forces to move mechanical components and we study the use of electrostatic forces in moving fluids. This analysis will yield insight into the operation and future design of efficient MEMS and NEMS devices. Additionally, as part of this project our research in MEMS and NEMS will be incorporated into the curriculum at the University of Delaware. Utilizing our new applied mathematics laboratory, students of mathematics will broaden their educational experience and try their hand at comparing their theories to the results of experiments they perform themselves. <br/>"

The research is focused on incompressible inviscid fluids of constant density, moving under the influence of gravity and surface tension on the free surface, with irrotational flow.  The work centers on three problem areas.  The first will establish the existence of exact twin-soliton solutions, obliquely-interacting identical two-dimensional solitary waves.  Work in the second area aims to prove the existence of three-dimensional propagating waves that decay to zero in both propagating and transverse directions in water with large surface tension.  The third problem area concerns the existence of three-dimensional propagating waves bifurcating from a two-dimensional generalized solitary wave, a solitary wave with ripples at infinity, in water with small surface tension.  In this work, the exact fully nonlinear governing equations, rather than approximate model equations, are employed to study three-dimensional propagating surface waves in water.  Interplay of theoretical fluid dynamics and applied analysis is essential to the project. <br/><br/>The theory of water waves is essential for understanding and control of many important natural phenomena, such as ocean waves generated by wind or earthquakes, and waves generated by ships.  This project focuses on the mathematical theory of three-dimensional water waves.  The research will contribute to the design of ships with significantly reduced wave resistance, as well as understanding of water-wave phenomena observed in experiments.  Design of ships with low wave resistance is especially important for eliminating giant waves generated by fast ferries, which threaten coastlines and have been blamed for many boat accidents.<br/>"

The status of nonselfadjoint Sturm-Liouville operators is by far not as complete even though they are currently under intensive investigation by a number of people. The present research project aspires to make a contribution in this area, in particular with regard to inverse problems. The main tool which sets the treatment of selfadjoint problems apart from others is the spectral theorem. The dire consequences of its absence can sometimes be overcome when it is assumed that the di.erential equation has (or its solutions have) certain structural properties. For example, Floquet theory guarantees a certain structure for the solutions of periodic equations, which in turn allows to draw conclusions for the spectrum which are very similar to the selfadjoint case (intervals become analytic arcs). Another class of such potentials are the so called algebro-geometric potentials which have been intensively investigated in the past few decades by many people including the PI. It is planned to apply the expertise gathered to obtain results for this kind of potentials and certain perturbations of them. In particular, recovery of the potential of a Schrodinger equation from the location of eigenvalues and resonances will be investigated.<br/><br/>Physical laws are encoded by differential equations. The problem of obtaining solutions (or at least some of their properties) knowing the coefficients of the differential equation is usually called a direct problem. The inverse problem, on the other hand, is the problem of obtaining the coefficients from a certain knowledge about the solutions (often knowledge about spectral properties). The goal of the project is to investigate certain aspects of such problems. The differential equations investigated have widespread applications in physics and engineering, e.g. recovering material properties inside an object from measurements on the outside of the object. The solution of inverse problems is at the heart of medical and industrial imaging, mineral exploration, and earth quake studies to name a few."

The propagation characteristics of such beams will be studied under various flow conditions using asymptotic and numerical models.  Particular emphasis will be placed on three-dimensional and non-axisymmetric beams for which nonlinear effects are most pronounced.  Secondly, a theoretical study will be made of the so-called resonant self-acceleration of modulated wavetrains; this strong nonlinear interaction between the wavetrain envelope and the induced horizontal mean flow can cause instability and breakdown of nearly vertically propagating wavetrains.  <br/><br/>Although not as familiar from everyday experience as ocean surface waves, internal gravity waves are in fact ubiquitous in oceans, lakes and in the atmosphere, where they play an important part in transferring momentum and energy.

In the kinetic limit, the phase space distribution of a solution to this equation converges to a linear Boltzmann equation. Beyond the kinetic scale, one expects that the Boltzmann equation is still correct in dimension three or higher provided that the diffusivity is renormalized. The first project aims to study this renormalization for time scales longer than the kinetic scale. The second project concerns the viscosity of the lattice gas models. Recently the PI has established the divergence rate for the diffusion coefficient for the asymmetric simple exclusion process in dimension two. The goal of this project is to extend this result to the dimension one case and to the lattice gas models with the Navier-Stokes equation as the formal limit. <br/> The fundamental question regarding the conductivity of electrons in semiconductors is how conduction occurs. As the technology is reaching the stage that the semi-classical theory no longer applies, the quantum effect will dominate and a mathematical rigorous theory is of fundamental importance. The first project aims to establish the quantum corrections of the standard semi-classical theory based on the Boltzmann equation. This will provide the first rigorous understanding of these quantum dynamical effects. The second project investigates the validity of the lattice gas models for fluids. These models, besides being widely used to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations, are important models for non-equilibrium statistical physics. The goal here is to establish the divergence rate of the viscosity for these models. This will give the first clue concerning how well the Navier-Stokes equation models the two-dimensional fluid. <br/>"

It includes coordinated efforts in experiment, mathematical analysis, modeling, and numerical simulation, supported by a long-standing industrial collaboration. Continuum models of granular materials are desirable from several points of view, but the associated partial differential equations are typically ill-posed, a mathematical difficulty that has severely hampered progress, especially for multidimensional flow. This ill-posedness reflects a real instability, the tendency of the deformation in granular flow to localize into shear bands.  Fundamental issues surrounding the continuum description will be addressed through inter-related projects that investigate: (i) the role of discreteness and nonlinearity in regularizing the ill-posed continuum description, (ii) the formulation from micromechanical considerations, based on experiments and MD simulations, of a continuum model that accounts for microscopic velocity fluctuations, (iii) mathematical predictions and experimental tests of multidimensional steady-state hopper flows, and (iv) the settling of powders, an industrially significant prototype two-phase flow problem.<br/><br/> The research program attacks different aspects of a basic question:  What behavior of slowly flowing granular material can be understood by modeling the material as a continuum?  This is particularly an issue for industrial settings such as the flow of agricultural grains in a converging hopper:   When a silo is discharged, the granular material flows somewhat like a continuous fluid, but the forces on the hopper walls are unlike those exerted by a fluid due to the solid-like properties of the material and its discreteness.  Scientifically, we wish to understand these properties, especially the role that the discreteness of the material plays in the models.  Among other contributions, this research is expected to improve predictive capabilities in the materials-handling industry and thereby increase efficiency in manufacturing.  The group will create a research environment that integrates research with the training of students and post-docs, through weekly group meetings, participation in conferences and a new course on granular materials.  Collaboration across fields will be facilitated by the proximity of the mathematics and physics departments at Duke University, and by the existing collaborations between PIs at NC State and Duke Universities.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>"

Methods include the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, scientific computing, mathematical modeling, asymptotics, and experiments.  Connections will be made with applications such as the role of surfactants in lung physiology, and the emerging field of microfluidics.  The weekly Focused Research Group meeting, a central organizing feature of the project, combines research and education by promoting discussion and interaction across disciplines, and among faculty, students, and post-docs.  <br/><br/>The central theme of this project is the study of how surface tension forces govern the motion of micro-scale fluids in many different settings.  Progress in this basic research on thin liquid films will lead to new theoretical understanding of the physics of fluid flow on a microscopic scale, which is crucial to the emerging technology of microfluidic devices.  These ""labs on a chip"" are transforming biotechnology in much the same way that microelectronics has transformed the computing industry.  Contributions from this project will help to identify fluid flows and surface properties relevant to specific devices, as well as establishing the theoretical underpinnings for future research in this area.  In addition to microfluidics, research will also be undertaken in the modeling of surfactant transport in the liquid lining of the lung.  In developing new theory for this important physiological application, the research group will focus on how the surfactant changes surface tension, giving rise to a force that mobilizes the fluid coating of the lung walls.  Development of theory, experiments, and numerical simulations in this project will involve ongoing interactions with scientists and engineers directly connected with the applications. <br/>"

These methods will provide improved intuition about how a structure's geometry determines its overall optical properties (group velocity, dispersion, resonances, radiation rates, etc.) They will also lead to improved numerical schemes for computing the spectral properties of photonic structures.<br/><br/>There is a large physics and engineering literature on photonic microstructures and their applications -- which include optical fibers and devices for use in data transmission and computing.  The design and analysis of such structures relies mainly on intuition, experimentation, and computer simulation. The  research between New York and Lucent Technologies will employ mathematical analysis to provide new sources of intuition and improved techniques for simulation -- leading, we hope, to the design of improved photonic microstructures and devices. This GOALI cooperative activity<br/>between New York University and Lucent Technologies will provide a postdoctoral researcher with valuable industrial experience.<br/><br/>"

We have been and will continue to be particularly interested in two specific models: the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity, and micromagnetics. In the area of micromagnetics, we studied previously some simplified two-dimensional model in the asymptotic regime corresponding to sharp ""domain-wall"" transitions. We established some optimal energy estimates, and exhibited optimal patterns for the transition profile, which fit very well with the ""cross-tie wall"" observations, and gave a first example of a non one-dimensional optimal profile in a vector-valued phase-transition problem. We intend to pursue this analysis towards more physically relevant models. In the area of the Ginzburg-Landau model, we previously focused on understanding the apparition, structure, and location, of vortices. We established a Gamma-convergence result deriving a limiting free-boundary problem, and proved convergence to some limiting vortex-densities, which we characterized, for minimizers as well as critical points. The project is to pursue further the analysis in the regime of high-applied fields, and turn towards the study of the associated dynamical models. We hope to establish the limiting dynamical laws obeyed by the vortices, first for a finite number of them, then for an infinite number of them, via some new estimates and an energetic approach to gradient-flow. Beyond that, we will be interested in understanding better the convergence of gradient flows for general Gamma-converging energies.<br/><br/>This project, in the field of analysis and PDEs, is concerned with the analysis of statics and dynamics in some models from physics, in particular the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity and microagnetics. In both cases the focus is on understanding, via rigorous mathematical proofs, the qualitative behavior of solutions to such models, and in particular explain the structure and the dynamics of singularities arising in some asymptotic regimes.<br/><br/>The purpose of such research is thus two-fold. First to shed light on the understanding of the specific physical problems themselves: by obtaining asymptotic expansions and explicit formulas, one can explain physical experiments, confirm or disprove the validity of models, and by rigorous<br/>analysis one can one also derive reduced simplified models (for example reducing the dimension) that are easier to work and compute/simulate with. The second purpose is more mathematical. As mentioned, the underlying philosophy is to manage to reduce the original asymptotic problems to simpler limiting problems (of lower dimension) on which the core phenomena (here singularities) can be tracked down. This is the main philosophy of ``Gamma-convergence''. In order to perform such analysis, one needs to develop appropriate mathematical tools and provide the right settings to understand the phenomena. One also wishes to understand how much of the behavior is particular, and how much can be extended and understood as a more general mathematical phenomenon, with the hope that what is understood for one specific model may in turn help to understand others. <br/>"

This project focuses on a technology transfer from contemporary ideas in topology, geometry, and dynamics to bear upon application domains which include the following: First, Robotics: tools from configuration space theory, CAT(0)complexes, and computational topology will be directed toward specific problems in reconfigurable robotics, sensor-based navigation of mobile agents, and self-assembly systems. Second, Parabolic coupled systems: a Morse-theoretic homotopy index for braids will be used to solve parabolic variational problems arising in pattern-formation PDE's, discrete Lagrangian mechanics, and coupled oscillators. A Floer-theoretic extension of the braid index will also be developed for infinite dimensional systems. Third, Hydrodynamics: tools from contact geometry and topology will be directed toward solving global problems of the dynamics and stability of Eulerian fluid flows in dimensions higher than two.<br/>In most systems of interest in science and engineering, multiple cooperative tasks must be globally coordinated. A common thread is that whether the tasks involve macro-scale robots, micro-scale devices, coupled oscillators, or fluid particles, there is an abstract space of configurations lurking behind the physical phenomena. Unearthing and examining those properties of physically-motivated configuration spaces which capture the global features, the topology, geometry, and dynamics, holds the promise of providing global tools which transcend the physical instantiation of the system at hand: ostensibly different systems possess similar topological underpinnings. The research component of this project is the development of contemporary topological and global-geometric techniques for analyzing the dynamics and coordination of systems of interest in engineering and computer science. The overall goal is an effective technology transfer from cutting-edge perspectives in topology to bear upon systems in application domains, which include robotics, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. This is combined with a blend of pedagogical service across graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels, featuring a focused research group on topological robotics and a high-school outreach program of expository lectures on the relevance and joy of mathematical research.<br/><br/><br/>This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The first is the large deviations analysis of occupancy models.  Occupancy models provide a simple, generic probabilistic construct that has found use in many fields.  The proposed large deviations approach is different from and complementary to much of the previous analysis of such models.  Motivated by problems from both wired and wireless communications, the research program will develop explicitly computable large deviation asymptotic approximations, and will also develop methods such as importance sampling to provide accurate results even in the non-asymptotic regime.  The second topic is the design of stochastic adaptive algorithms for mobile communication.  This area of application is narrower in scope, being of particular interest to engineers of next generation, high-rate wireless access systems. However, within that scope, the activities are general and fundamental in nature. The emphasis here is on the development of methods for the analysis of scheduling algorithms in wireless, and on the development of new algorithms.<br/>  This project will develop mathematical methods for two important areas in modern telecommunication, with an emphasis on a broad university/industrial training of graduate students.  A key component of the research program is the joint supervision of graduate students between Bell Labs and Brown University.  For the graduate students that are involved, there will be summer internships at Lucent Technologies, which will supplement the more traditional training in a number of ways.  Both research areas of focus, namely occupancy models and wireless scheduling, are challenging intellectual problems that are motivated by developing commercial technology.  In addition to working with specific industrial mentors, the students also have the opportunity to attend talks, seminars and generally benefit from exposure to a wide variety of current problems and solution methods whose development is in progress.  The proposed collaborative research and associated seminar series will help to strengthen the ties between Bell Labs and Brown University, invigorating the intellectual climate at both institutions.

Proposed research includes studying the existence and properties of momentum conservation laws in nonholonomic dynamics, energy-momentum methods in stability analysis, the qualitative analysis of dynamics of systems with non-free group actions, nonlinear feedback stabilization, and the energy-based approach to tracking problems, both holonomic and nonholonomic.  Momentum conservation laws in nonholonomic mechanics are subtle as the classical Noether theorem does not in general apply. This leads to rich dynamics which the investigators study.  The role of integrability and discrete symmetries in nonholonomic systems is also analyzed.  The investigators study various extensions of the energy-momentum method to both stability, stabilization and control of physical systems.  In the nonholonomic setting integrability of the momentum equation is utilized, while in general use is made of the method of controlled Lagrangians.<br/><br/>The dynamics of systems with velocity constraints (such as rolling and sliding constraints)  has numerous applications in industry; robotics and the dynamics of wheeled vehicles are examples. In applications, stabilization of steady-state motions (such as the straightforward motion of a car at a constant speed) is often desired.  The investigators use various tools from the geometric theory of dynamics and control for studying such motions and, more importantly, for programming desired motions in the presence of control forces.  The study is ultimately aimed at the design of energy-efficient controllers based on the natural mechanical features of the systems under investigation.  The dynamics of single-wheeled vehicles is of special interest because of their exceptional, maneuverability.  More complex systems are studied as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The main ideas behind the<br/>construction of the new, less dissipative central schemes are to use<br/>more precise estimate of the smooth and nonsmooth parts of the solution<br/>by considering non-rectangular control volumes; to use a more accurate<br/>projection of the evolved data onto the original, non-staggered grid;<br/>and to avoid the loss of information when very accurate fully-discrete<br/>schemes are reduced to a much simpler semi-discrete form.<br/>The second main goal of the project is the application of central schemes<br/>to various multi-phase and multi-fluid flow models, the Saint-Venant<br/>systems of shallow water equations (which describe flows in rivers and<br/>coastal areas), multi-layer shallow water systems, models of transport of<br/>pollutant in shallow water, the Euler equations of gas dynamics subject<br/>to a static gravitational field, chemotaxis models, reactive flows (in<br/>particular, the models describing stiff detonation waves), extended<br/>thermodynamics, shallow water equations on a rotating sphere, acoustic<br/>wave propagation, heterogeneous elasticity, granular material flows.<br/>Naturally, these applications involve multiple space dimensions, complex<br/>geometries and moving boundaries/interfaces, This would require further<br/>development of the theory and implementation of central schemes.

Turbulent wave action<br/>is responsible for the transfer of energy between the very large<br/>scales of storms and the small scales of wind ripples at which<br/>dissipation takes place. In an atmospheric example, mixing by<br/>upward propagating breaking waves plays a significant role in the<br/>dynamical coupling between the lower and the upper layers of the<br/>atmosphere. The research proposed here will contribute to the<br/>understanding of fundamental physical mechanisms behind these<br/>important phenomena, and hence improve our capability to predict<br/>and quantify climate changes. The proposal will also have a strong<br/>educational impact, through the training of graduate students, the<br/>development of a research seminar for undergraduate students, the<br/>teaching of challenging undergraduate classes, and by having<br/>undergraduate students participate in summer projects focused on<br/>the research.<br/>"

The distribution of species/particles among different locations affects their interaction with other species/particles as well as their movement. Thus, cross diffusion should be taken into account. However, cross diffusion systems have only been studied, and few results were discovered, no more than two decades ago; and very little that we know about the qualitative properties of their solutions. The presence of the cross diffusion terms makes these systems strongly coupled parabolic systems since the couplings are also present in higher order terms (diffusion terms). This strong coupling has introduced not only enormous difficulties in analytical treatments but also reopened many fundamental questions as well as unveiled many interesting phenomena in the theory of parabolic systems. Our proposed research focuses on two problems: regularity and long time dynamics of solutions. The study of regularity properties of solutions of strongly coupled parabolic systems, as we shall explain in details, plays an essential and fundamental role in global existence theory. Instead of considering these systems in their most general settings, where it is known that only partial answers could be expected, our focus will be on systems that arise in applications, and satisfy certain structure conditions, which can guarantee a complete answer to the regularity question. The second goal is to investigate long time dynamics and coexistence for certain parabolic systems where strong couplings are assumed to be not in their full force. In particular, we will consider a class of triangular cross diffusion systems that describe many important processes in ecology, biology, particle physics, etc. We propose to study this issue by extending our findings in our previous research on reaction diffusion counterparts. <br/><br/>People, species and particles move, or diffuse, and interact with each other in their habitats. In order to understand these phenomena, mathematical models of reaction-diffusion systems have been introduced in many areas in applicable sciences. A good understanding of the dynamics of their solutions can help to answer important life questions. In ordinary diffusion, motility of the species (or particles) is determined solely by its own characteristics but not on the presence of other species in question. That is, the interaction among the unknown components is present only in the reaction terms. Cross diffusion studies the motion of species/particles using the information gathered from others present in the environment. While it is naturally believed that the distribution of organisms among different locations within a habitat affects their interaction with others as well as their movement or dispersal, cross diffusion does occur. The introduction of cross-diffusion terms into the systems makes the problem much more mathematically challenging and extends the application range of reaction-diffusion equations.  Cross diffusion systems have recently drawn special interests and received heightened scientific attention, but few are results concerning the long time dynamics of solutions.  Broadly speaking, the aim of this proposal is to study a class of cross diffusion systems arising in certain chemical, ecological and biological applications with chemotactic response. Our main focus is on the global existence, regularity property and the asymptotic behavior of solutions for large times, after transient effects have disappeared. Progress in this area can force the development of new mathematical tools, and also help to understand life questions such as whether and how a community of interacting populations can persist (survive and avoid extinction). Recent and partial results for similar systems with chemotactic response introduced have encouraged us to go further in this new direction. We propose to continue and extend our results on models with chemotaxis, which simulate the interaction of diffused microbial organisms, and investigate the role of chemotactic effects on the dynamics of organisms. The successful completion of this project will represent a significant step forward in the understanding of the roles of dispersal strategies (cell motilities, chemotaxis, etc.) and competitive abilities in many ecology and biology applications.<br/>"

The emergence of macroscopic order and the spontaneous breaking of spatiotemporal symmetries are features common to many natural phenomena.  Virtually every structure seen in our world can be considered the result of a long sequence of successive symmetry-breaking instabilities of a complex nonlinear system under nonequilibrium conditions.  The interdisciplinary field of pattern formation seeks a common understanding of such spontaneous formation of spatial and spatiotemporal patterns in systems from areas as diverse as fluid mechanics, solid state physics, nonlinear optics, chemistry, and biology.  While much progress towards understanding pattern formation has been made in recent years, fundamental challenges remain. <br/><br/>This award supports participants in the Workshop on Dynamics and Bifurcations of Patterns in Dissipative Systems, held at Colorado State University in the spring of 2003.  The goal of the workshop is to bring together theorists and experimentalists from different fields, from applied mathematics to theoretical and experimental physics, unified by their interest in nonlinear phenomena and in search of a deeper understanding of pattern formation and dynamics in complex systems.  The workshop will stimulate communication and collaboration between experts, advanced graduate students, and young researchers in identifying key ideas, new advances, and open questions in the mathematical analysis of spatiotemporal patterns in dissipative systems.  Topics of interest include stability, bifurcation, and dynamics of patterns, reduction of governing equations, and the role of symmetry.  The presentations and roundtable discussions will stimulate further theoretical and applied investigations in pattern formation and analysis. The extremely rapid pace of developments in the science of patterns, identified as one of the six grand challenges for physics in a new era, lends urgency to the goals of the workshop."

In order to avoid finite-time singularities in the Euler equations that govern the dynamics of a vortex sheet, it is necessary to regularize the equations.  This project compares three different regularization methods of current importance: vortex blob methods, Euler-alpha models, and physical viscosity.  At present it is unknown whether different regularizations have different limits as the regularization parameter approaches zero, and this project aims to answer this question through a combination of numerical studies and analytical methods.  An answer to this question is of intrinsic mathematical interest and of practical importance for numerical simulations. <br/><br/>Possible outcomes to this investigation include:  1) Different regularizations of the Euler equations give different limits at a fixed time.  This would be of interest for both intrinsically mathematical reasons and for applications.  2) The limits are the same, and the chaotic features observed in recent work on the vortex blob method are present in all cases, including the viscous case.  This would give significant insight into the physics of real fluid motion.  3) The limits are the same, and do not include the chaotic features.  This would indicate that regularization can introduce artificial irregularities, and would suggest work for improved regularization methods.  This work aims to present conclusive evidence towards one of these possible scenarios.  It will result in increased understanding of regularizations of the Euler equations and of fluid dynamics with small viscosity. <br/>"

This has been triggered by the need for<br/>knowledge of their long term behavior.  Moreover, a better<br/>understanding of these systems might lead to insights in the<br/>underlying mechanisms, which are usually much more complicated<br/>and less well understood than in the physical sciences.  An<br/>in-depth analysis sometimes reveals unsatisfactory behavior, e.g.<br/>extinction of a certain species or -- at the opposite end of the<br/>spectrum -- persistence of an infectious disease, and require<br/>appropriate modifications.  In this project the investigator uses<br/>control theory in both analysis and possible modification of the<br/>behavior of biological models.  The main idea is to consider these<br/>models from a feedback perspective -- provided this is possible<br/>of course --, which is a central topic of interest in control<br/>theory.  It is argued that certain biological (sub)systems are<br/>actually feedback systems.  Two examples are studied from this<br/>point of view.  The first is the chemostat model with crowding<br/>effects, while the second concerns certain classes of<br/>predator-prey systems.  Stability issues are of primary concern in<br/>this study.  A second part of the work is devoted to control (or<br/>modification) of the behavior of chemostat models with possibly<br/>multiple resources.  The novelty of the approach lies in the way<br/>the control is implemented, by means of feedback control.  The<br/>very principle of this type of control is that the control action<br/>is based on the state of the system.  The usual strategies<br/>appearing in the literature consider constant controls leading to<br/>bifurcation analysis or control signals that depend only on time<br/>-- but not on the state of the system.<br/>     Many biological systems are under close examination these<br/>days.  The human genome project, infectious diseases such as AIDS,<br/>the flu, or even those caused by a bio-terror attack are but few<br/>of the compelling examples.  Usually these systems are very<br/>complex and hard to understand, let alone control.  The aim of<br/>this project is to use the perspective of control theory in<br/>dealing with these problems.  Ideas from control theory have been<br/>very successful in applications in more traditional areas.<br/>Chemical and nuclear plants, airplanes, vehicles and satellites,<br/>robots and audio-visual equipment are nowadays equipped with<br/>computers controlling the smooth operation of the specific<br/>application.  The question is whether control theory can<br/>contribute to rapid developments in the biological sciences.  As<br/>an example, consider a biological system in which a number of<br/>organisms compete against each other.  A basic question is whether<br/>or not the species survive.  Depending on the application one<br/>would like the answer to this question to be yes (for example if<br/>some of the species are endangered) or no (for instance if one of<br/>the species is a malignant virus).  Sometimes the answer turns out<br/>to be no where a yes is desired or vice-versa, and then the issue<br/>becomes whether this can be modified by suitably manipulating the<br/>system.  This type of problem is central in control theory.  The<br/>lessons learned in the areas mentioned above should prove<br/>valuable in a biological setting.<br/>"

Spirn<br/><br/>Title: Asymptotics of conservative PDEs and instability of vortex patches and filaments<br/><br/>ABSTRACT: The proposed research concerns asymptotics of conservative<br/>partial differential equations (PDE) and instability of the incompressible Euler equations in three specific areas. The first project concerns the long time behavior of vortex solutions in the nonlinear wave equation. Although recent progress has led to greater understanding of how concentrations behave in the nonlinear wave equation, very little is known about how such solutions radiate energy after long times; we will rigorously study this question.  Second, we will study the nonlinear wave equation in asymptotically thin domains. Conventional wisdom holds that most PDE's with an asymptotically large aspect ratio will be well approximated simply by dropping the dimension of the PDE and relying only on the planar direction; this work will examine the precise timescales for which this practice is acceptable. The third project involves the nonlinear instability of various PDE's arising from the incompressible Euler equations, in which the governing dynamics reduce to the behavior of an interface -- such as in two-layer models and vortex patches.<br/><br/>Often, physical phenomena are well modeled via nonlinear PDE's. Such<br/>equations are exceedingly difficult to study, both numerically and<br/>theoretically, yet their understanding is crucial to the further progress of many areas of physics and engineering. Two of the projects outlined above offer rigorous methods for simplifying classes of these equations, not only providing insight into the basic behavior of fluids and quantum field theory, but also greatly reducing the scope of numerical simulations. Such reductions in computational costs should aid physicists, computer scientists, and engineers. The third project endeavors to classify the stable structures in fluid dynamics, helping us to gain a better qualitative understanding of the way fluids behave.<br/><br/>"

This research is strongly motivated by problems arising in applications and will be used to prove optimality of families of extremals for problems from two different application areas, namely (a) the minimization of the base transit time in semi-conductor devices in electronics and (b) the analysis of mathematical models for cancer chemotherapy when explicit upper limits on the number of cancer cells or lower limits for bone marrow are included.  (a) In electronics, the problem of choosing the base-doping profile to minimize the base transit time in semi-conductor devices generally is solved numerically.  In this project, the problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with state space constraints, and different models corresponding to both homojunction and heterojunction bipolar transistors are analyzed.  For silicon bipolar transistors, explicit analytic solutions for general carrier diffusion coefficients will be derived, and their optimality will be proven by constructing a complete synthesis.  (b) In many mathematical models for cancer chemotherapy the aim is to minimize the number of cancer cells at the end of a pre-determined fixed therapy interval while limiting the toxicity of the drugs through a penalty term.  This, however, does not always prevent the number of cancer cells from rising to unacceptably high levels in between.  It therefore is more realistic to consider models that incorporate explicit limits on the cancer cells as state-space constraints.  The analysis of optimal controls for such models will be pursued.<br/><br/>In this project, mathematical conditions will be developed that guarantee the optimality of controlled processes in the presence of strict limits.  This theoretical research will be guided by two practical problems, one from electronics, the other biomedical.  In the electronics topic, complete analytical solutions will be developed for a simplified model describing the speed of certain semiconductor devices.  In the biomedical area, mathematical models for chemotherapy of cancer or other diseases will be analyzed in the presence of restrictions, for example, that bone marrow must not fall below a specified minimum level or that cancer cells are not allowed to increase beyond a maximum level.  These topics also will be used to illustrate optimal control methods on an undergraduate level with more relevant and realistic problems than are currently available in most textbooks on the subject.<br/>"

However, in many applications the presence of symmetry is an<br/>idealization. It is important therefore to understand which aspects of the dynamics of the<br/>symmetric system are robust with respect to small symmetry-breaking imperfections. In many<br/>cases the loss of both discrete and continuous symmetries introduces global bifurcations<br/>into the dynamics and hence the possibility of chaotic time-dependence.

Additional funding from the NATO ARW program will cover the travel expenses of the Key Speakers, as well as those of junior participants from NATO Partner countries (mostly Eastern European countries). The aim of the workshop is the evaluation of critical needs in nonlinear homogenization and novel applications in modeling materials systems exhibiting complex microstructures. The behavior of composites, polycrystals and smart materials is often nonlinear. There have been important and significant developments over the last two decades both in terms of nonlinear homogenization methodology (deterministic and stochastic), as well as in terms of novel applications to the above-mentioned classes of materials.  Also, phase transformations can be studied by using similar methods.  Homogenization methods offer promising new tools for constructing macroscopic models in biomechanics.  It is thus highly desirable to gather specialists in nonlinear homogenization, composite materials and micromechanics to promote progress in each of these fields keeping in mind the potential technological applications.  The main topics of workshop are: 1) Convex and non-convex homogenization methods and applications to advanced composites, smart materials and structures like plates and shells; 2) Homogenization estimates for polycrystalline aggregates in elasticity, plasticity and shape memory alloys: the effect of texture and its evolution; 3) Multi-scale modeling and discrete-to-continuum passage; 4) Recent developments and new directions in shape optimization; 5) Functionally graded structures for maximum strength and stiffness; 6) Structures of bi-stable inertial elements: waves, averaging, control; and 7) Homogenization methods in modeling bone and soft tissues. <br/><br/>The need for research in the field of nonlinear homogenization stems from the ever-increasing role of composites, polycrystals and smart materials in high-tech industries.  Materials such as functionally graded materials, piezoelectric composites, magnetic materials and ferroelectrics also belong to this class.  It has also become increasingly clear that living tissues exhibit very complex hierarchical microstructures.  Among the broader impacts of the proposed workshop are the following.  The conference is strongly multi- and inter-disciplinary in character, involving mathematicians, engineers and material scientists with various sub-fields of specialization.  In addition, it is expected that the workshop will provide opportunities for the transfer of information between Western and Central/East European countries, between research centers and universities, and among researchers from different scientific areas.  The workshop, whose proceedings will be disseminated through a NATO Science Series publication, will seek to identify open problems and future trends in the above-identified areas.  Finally, the meeting will include several graduate students, young investigators and faculty from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The investigators<br/>develop and use techniques of geometric singular perturbation<br/>theory to project and analyze the dynamics of these complicated,<br/>high-dimensional neuronal networks onto lower-dimensional slow<br/>manifolds.  These techniques allow them to understand how<br/>different synaptic and intrinsic parameters contribute to and<br/>modulate network behavior.  They work closely with<br/>experimentalists who, in a parallel research program, are<br/>investigating the effects of synaptic depression in the<br/>crustacean STG.<br/>     Synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of a synapse to<br/>change its strength as a function of its usage.  It is widely<br/>found in neuronal circuits across the brain.  While experimental<br/>studies of short=term synaptic plasticity (STSP) are necessarily<br/>focused on the particulars of the neural system under<br/>investigation, modeling of the type proposed here can provide<br/>insights into the more general properties of STSP.  The<br/>investigators study the possibility that seemingly independent<br/>roles for STSP can be grouped together based on how the network<br/>architecture constrains STSP to operate.  Elucidating the general<br/>principles behind these operations provides a framework for<br/>understanding how STSP participates in very diverse neuronal<br/>computations across brain regions.  Due to its interdisciplinary<br/>nature, this project is expected to be of interest to members of<br/>the experimental, computational and analytic neuroscience<br/>communities.  Additionally, the investigators continue to teach<br/>computational neuroscience and mathematical biology courses that<br/>they recently developed.  Graduate and undergraduate students<br/>have the opportunity to work directly with their experimental<br/>collaborators.  Thus students become well positioned to continue<br/>pursuits in either experimental or theoretical fields, or in an<br/>area that combines the two.

The first part of the project deals with the statistical modeling of turbulent velocity and methods of analyzing the statistics of scalar (for example, temperature) fluctuations.  A characteristic feature of turbulent velocity is the presence of a wide range of scales.  This induces a similarly wide range of scales in fluctuations of temperature and hence in the local fluctuations of, for example, the refractive index.  The study of the refractive index in the turbulent air is an important challenging problem for mathematical analysis as well as technological applications.  The second part of the project addresses the statistical properties of wave motion in atmospheric turbulence.  In particular, the project focuses on several regimes where simplified description of waves can be derived, some of which are known to be widely applicable.  They include the parabolic approximation, the white-noise approximation, and the radiative transfer limit.  The goal is to formulate a mathematical framework to study the various approximations in a rigorous and unified way.  The details of the solutions in the various approximations will be investigated, providing guides for the design of communications and imaging systems.<br/><br/>Understanding of scalar and wave transport through atmospheric turbulence is essential for many important applications, including heat and contaminant transport, laser and wireless communications, remote sensing, and imaging.

The first, with Harold Widom, is to <br/>study the connection between the ``Airy process'' and integrable differential<br/>equations.  The Airy process is a stochastic process that is expected to <br/>describe a wide class of growth processes.  The distribution function for the<br/>Airy process at one single time is the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution <br/>function.  In this case the distribution function is represented as either a <br/>Fredholm determinant of a certain operator (the ``Airy kernel'') or in terms <br/>of a solution to a certain nonlinear ordinary differential equation called <br/>Painleve II.  The finite-dimensional distribution functions for the Airy <br/>process (at many different times) are also expressible as  Fredholm <br/>determinants of an integral operator (the ``extended Airy kernel'').  The <br/>goal is to find the corresponding integrable differential equations and to use <br/>these differential equations to analyze the Airy process.  The second project,<br/>again with Widom, is to complete earlier work on the asymptotics of <br/>solutions to the periodic Toda equations by determining the asymptotics <br/>on what are called the ``critical curves.''  The third major project,  with <br/>graduate student Momar Dieng, is to find explicit Painleve type <br/>representations for the distribution function for the next-largest, next-next <br/>largest, etc. eigenvalues in the random matrix models GOE and GSE.  <br/>These distribution functions will have applications to statistics. If time <br/>permits certain combinatorial sums involving Hall-Littlewood symmetric <br/>functions will be analyzed.<br/><br/>The famous bell-shaped curve, known more formally as the Gaussian <br/>distribution function, is well-known due to its many applications in the<br/>social sciences, the physical and biological sciences, and engineering.  <br/>Mathematicians in the early part of the twentieth century gave precise <br/>conditions under which  one can expect to find the Gaussian distribution.  <br/>It is now common in these disciplines to apply these conditions (``sums of <br/>independent random variables'') to predict the appearance of the Gaussian <br/>distribution.  When  these conditions fail and we are dealing with strongly <br/>dependent random variables, we cannot expect to see the Gaussian.  <br/>Quite remarkably it has been realized in recent years that the distribution <br/>functions of the largest eigenvalues in various random matrix models <br/>describe new universal laws for a wide variety of problems appearing in<br/>combinatorics, growth processes, random tilings, queuing theory, the <br/>analysis of large data sets (``principal component analysis'') as well as <br/>applications to the physics of quantum dots.  These distribution functions, <br/>known as the Tracy-Widom distribution functions, are now realized in <br/>terms of a time dependent process called the Airy process. (The  Airy <br/>process plays the same role as Brownian motion does to the Gaussian <br/>distribution.)  One of the goals of this project is to find differential <br/>equations that characterize the Airy process.  These differential equations<br/>will facilitate analysis of the Airy process much in the same way that the <br/>ordinary differential equation (Painleve II) has aided in the description of <br/>the Tracy-Widom distribution functions.  A second project is to go beyond <br/>the largest eigenvalue distribution functions and to consider, for example, <br/>the next-largest eigenvalue distribution functions for a class of models <br/>called GOE and GSE.  The GOE case is  particularly relevant to <br/>multivariate statistics and these additional distribution functions can be <br/>expected to find applications to problems involving large data sets.  <br/><br/>"

First, with collaborators and a doctoral student, the<br/>investigator analyzes computational methods used to simulate<br/>large, complex systems of reactions in biochemistry, combustion,<br/>and air pollution engineering. These processes, such as the<br/>production of certain proteins, the burning of natural gas, and<br/>the formation of nitrous oxides in the atmosphere, typically<br/>involve a few hundred species, each of which participates in<br/>several reactions, with the reaction times ranging from<br/>nanoseconds to milliseconds, even to minutes.

The investigator aims to<br/>show that there is a highly accurate method that can be used to<br/>improve the accuracy of other widely-used methods, which are<br/>embedded in major computer codes. Second, the investigator and a<br/>doctoral student study mathematical models of bioremediation, in<br/>which microorganisms are used to degrade environmentally-harmful<br/>organic compounds. Mathematics provides an advantageous approach<br/>to determine important quantities, such as the wave speed with<br/>which the biologically-active zone propagates through a wet soil<br/>column and how this speed depends on the many physical<br/>parameters.

The project is stimulated by Huffaker's<br/>classic experiment, which provided the first demonstration of the<br/>mediating role of spatial processes in certain ecological<br/>interactions. Huffaker noted that synchronies in the phases of<br/>population cycles of localized aggregates within host plants of<br/>herbivorous mites and of the mites that preyed upon them<br/>occasionally spread over an entire area, but that the synchrony<br/>can be broken by demographic and environmental stochasticity. He<br/>conjectured that the complementary regularizing mechanisms that<br/>generate synchrony, and the complementary stochastic mechanisms<br/>that generate asynchrony, together generate the complex waves and<br/>patterns seen in these predator-prey interactions in nature.<br/>Existing stochastic patch models have been formulated that<br/>successfully simulate complex, and evidently chaotic,<br/>spatio-temporal patterns that have typically accompanied<br/>persistent dynamics. Accordingly, such models have difficulty in<br/>providing reliable predictions of behavior due to the large<br/>variance seen in replicate data sets. This substantially limits<br/>their practical application to the biological control of crop<br/>pests. In previous work, the investigator formulated a family of<br/>deterministic models, including an idealized paradigm defining a<br/>class of reaction-diffusion systems. He studies two general<br/>issues relating to the analysis and practical applications of the<br/>reaction-diffusion system and related models. First, he<br/>investigates the presence of several distinct families of stable<br/>waves and spatial patterns of these equations, their<br/>instabilities and bifurcations, and the presence of exotic<br/>wave-like patterns. By combined analytical and approximate<br/>methods, he describes theoretical mechanisms by which such<br/>unstable waves can form the organizing center of spatio-temporal<br/>chaos, while in other regimes, complex but non-chaotic, stable<br/>spatio-temporal patterns appear spontaneously. A second topic<br/>concerns the derivation of the model, which is based on<br/>experiment. This addresses the manner in which the<br/>reaction-diffusion model simulates stochasticity through<br/>postulated low-density thresholds in the growth rates. The<br/>investigator studies hybrid numerical procedures addressing the<br/>crucial issue of parameter estimation, which can be problematic<br/>both for stochastic patch models and for the reaction-diffusion<br/>model, but at opposite spatio-temporal scales. For example, the<br/>low-density thresholds involve the micro-local dynamics of a<br/>small number of individuals, whereas large-scale emigration over<br/>large regions is difficult to measure in a laboratory. However,<br/>simple stable waves may suggest one instance in which this may be<br/>possible. The investigator examines this in numerical<br/>simulations with patch models, which may form the basis for new<br/>and simpler experimental designs that can detect such behavior.<br/>Together, these two approaches present a unified picture of how<br/>""dynamic stochasticity"" driven by the presence of certain<br/>unstable waves and spatio-temporal patterns is theoretically<br/>linked to parameters of population change governing behavior at<br/>the smallest micro-local scales, and thus the generation of<br/>asynchrony through demographic and environmental stochasticity.<br/> Plant-eating mites, and the mites that eat them in turn,<br/>often show cycles of growth and decline in numbers that are<br/>closely related. Sometimes the populations decline rapidly to<br/>near-extinction levels. But in a classic experiment Huffaker and<br/>colleagues showed that these strongly coupled cycles can be<br/>moderated by small changes in demographic or geographic factors,<br/>leading to a long-term survival of both species that shows itself<br/>in patterns, in time and space, of the numbers of predator and<br/>prey mites. Of course, when the prey mite is eating a valuable<br/>crop, one wants both mite populations to go extinct. So issues of<br/>how mite populations vary together are of considerable practical<br/>importance in the biological control of crop pests. The economic<br/>impact of phytophageous species is considerable, and although the<br/>use of predatory mites as a biological control is widespread in<br/>certain local agricultures, many agricultural enterprises rely on<br/>chemical pest controls. Chemical controls provide a short-term<br/>solution, but have many damaging long-term effects. However, the<br/>risks and uncertainties of biological pest control are difficult<br/>to quantify due to their complex and unpredictable patterns of<br/>behavior. The investigator's numerical simulations indicate the<br/>presence of many different kinds of chaos, some of which achieve<br/>better levels of suppression of both herbivore populations and<br/>crop damage. The project explores new theoretical and<br/>computational tools that may find practical application in the<br/>biological control of crop pests and, in other contexts, in<br/>inoculative control of certain exotic species."
