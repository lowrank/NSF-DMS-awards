It is         a product of joint efforts of two known specialists in this area,               Professors Chow and Menaldi.  The main research effort will be invested         in the study of various theoretical issues in the stochastic control            problems.  It is assumed that dynamical process is subject to influence         of random signals.  The goal is to determine a control function that            optimizes a certain objective, expressed as a function on process               trajectories.  The control is supposed to have an impulse character.            This is an idealized version of a physical situation where one can              observe abrupt changes inprocess trajectories, which can be thought of          as discontinuities, or jumps.  Fo example, the inventory stocks in a            warehouse may be represented in this way, as they experience a jump in          the value at the delivery of new stock.  The control of an impulse              nature is usually represented mathematically by Dirac distributions.            The timings and masses of such impulses are the control parameters that         one wants to select in an optimal fashion."

His main interests lie in            designing a conceptual framework for computer oriented procedures that          seek a minimum of a function of many variables subject to constraints.          The class of problems that Han is studying involves smooth, i.e.                differentiable functions of n variables which may be approximated by            quadratic functions.  The variables are not restricted to integer               values.  This class of problems is often solved by iterative methods in         which the minimization is done sequentially by searching for minimum of         the function along certain special directions.  With the development of         new computer architectures it became more and more important to adapt           the existing procedures to new possibilities.  In parallel processing,          arithmetic and logical operations can be done by many processors at the         same time.  Han proposes to investigate minimization methods that are           based on a decompositon of the problem into several search problems             with directions that are independent in a certain sense.  Such                  techniques could become useful in parallel processing and could yield a         important speed-up of practical computing."

It is hoped that this approach            will simplify the theory of equilibrium and will induce more effective          algorithms for computing equilibria of large scale systems.  Three              specific projects are proposed.  The first project addressed equilibria         in traffic networks.  A travel demand is associated with each                   origin-destination pair of modes of a netowrk.  A travel cost is                assigned to each link of the network.  In the equilibrium traffic               pattern, no user will be ablle to decrease his travel cost by altering          his travel decisions.  This can be characterized by a mathematical              conidition in a form of variational inequality.  The principal                  investigator will establish existence of equilibrium taffic patterns            under weak assumptions, and will develop conceptual algorithms for              finding such equilibria.  The second project aims at developing a new           approach for the study of general economic equilibrium, based on the            theory of variational inequalitites.  The main idea is to show that             Walrasian equilibria can be obtained as solutions to a variational              inequality, in an approporiate space."
