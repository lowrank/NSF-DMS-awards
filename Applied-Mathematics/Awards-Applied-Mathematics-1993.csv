Multivariate splines are piecewise polynomial functions with  certain smoothness.  The pieces need not fit together as  smoothly as if they all were part of the same polynomial.   Roughly speaking, the higher the degree of the piecewise  polynomial relative to its smoothness, the more roughly the  pieces can fit together.  Because polynomial functions are the  easiest functions to manipulate and because almost all problems  in the real world are multivariable or multiparametric in nature,  multivariate splines are a good tool to model the target  functions.  Although the theory of bivariate splines with large  degree versus smoothness is available, bivariate splines have too  large a degree to be used in practice efficiently.  That is, only  bivariate splines with small degree versus smoothness can achieve  the efficiency and the accuracy required by computer aided  geometric design, numerical image processing, and numerical  solution of partial differential equations.

In this proposal a  combination of numerical and analytical techniques will be used.  We propose to determine the domain of existence of invariant tori  both by using recursive generation of the Fourier series for the  tori, and by continuation of the Cantor sets from the  anti-integrable limit.  The goal is to develop methods for  estimating practical stability boundaries and for investigating  the transition to chaotic behavior.  Computations will determine  the robustness of the tori of various frequency vectors, leading  to a generalization of the noble numbers that provide the most  robust frequencies in two dimensions.  A study of one  dimensional, resonant tori will also be undertaken-these may be  more persistent than two-tori, and form an important component of  the barriers to transport.  Transport in four dimensions. will be  studied by numerical computation of exit time decompositions for  cylinders of various homotopy types.  Our goal is the development  of a geometrical description of trapping regions and resonance  zones and a characterization of the practical stability domain  around an elliptic point.  New techniques for control of  transport will be developed for symplectic systems.       All of the fundamental equations of physics are formulated  as Hamiltonian dynamical systems.  We propose to study the  structure of the orbits of these systems with the motivation  being to understand the problem of ""transport. "" This is of  primary importance in such areas as particle accelerator  confinement, chemical reaction rates, fluid mixing, plasma  confinement in magnetic fusion devices, asteroid and planetary  ring stability, etc.  The basic question is: how does a system  evolve from one state (e.g. a confined beam in an accelerator),  to another (e.g. beam hits the tunnel wall), and how long does   this take.  Typically trajectories must wend their way through  exotic structures such as Cantor sets and self-similar fractals,  some of which exhibit a remarkable ""stickiness"", in order to move  through the phase space.  The construction and visualization of  these structures requires careful computer study guided by  mathematical insight.  A major problem is that the systems of  interest correspond to four and higher dimensional spaces--our  ordinary three-dimensional intuition fails.  In various  applications transport is either to be encouraged (speeding up  reaction rates) or discouraged (confining particles); we will  investigate techniques for accomplishing both tasks.  ***"

Most of the models involve partial  differential equations, specifically reaction-diffusion equations  or systems explicitly incorporating spatial effects in their  coefficients.  Some of the activity is directly focused on  modelling specific phenomena such as the spread of exotic plants  into the Florida Everglades.  The significance of this portion of  the activity is in providing ways of understanding and  predicting the results of land management and conservation  policies.  Other parts of the research are focused on more  general problems in the design and evaluation of mathematical  models in ecology, with the aim of providing new or improved  mathematical tools for other scientists working on related  problems.  Many of the mathematical methods are taken from the  theory of dynamical systems; in particular, the idea of  permanence or uniform persistence and alternatives to that idea  are especially important.  Other important components of the  mathematical methodology are nonlinear analysis, especially  bifurcation theory and related topics, and the spectral theory of  elliptic operators.  In addition to itsapplied value the research  aims to yield new mathematical results in those areas.       The project deals with the development and analysis  of mathematical descriptions of how populations interact with  the spatial aspects of an environment.  Mathematical models  are effective means of identifying what factors are important in  the growth or decline of populations.  Spatial features of  an environment, such as its size, shape, and geographic  variability, can affect the growth or decline of the resident  populations in the environment.  The models of the present  project are particularly well-suited to quantifying these  effects.  The analysis of the models involves new and challenging  mathematics, and provid es a flexible theoretical tool for  objective assessment of the viability of the species in question.   Moreover, understanding the models can also suggest what data to  collect or what experiment to run in actual situations.  A  better understanding of the effects of the spatial aspects of an  environment upon the viability of species within the  environment can improve the design of wildlife refuges and the  development of management schemes for dealing with problems  arising from habitat fragmentation, whether the fragmentation is  the result of a natural disaster such as Hurricane Andrew or the  eruption of Mount St. Helens, or the result of human activity  such as logging, mining or development.  ***"

In solving these problems  numerically, it is very convenient to use a uniform Cartesian  grid in spite of the fact that the interface may cut between grid  points.  The investigator and his colleagues develop finite  difference methods that aim to give highly accurate solutions at  all grid points while maintaining the efficiency and ease of  implementation of uniform grid methods.  Several specific  problems are studied in depth.  One goal is to develop improved  versions of Peskin's ""immersed boundary method"" for  incompressible fluid dynamics in regions with complicated moving  boundaries, such as blood flow in a beating heart.  Hyperbolic  wave equations with discontinuous coefficients arise in modeling  the structure of the earth in seismic oil exploration.  Other  applications include porous media equations arising in oil  reservoir simulation and groundwater transport, and multi-phase  solidification problems.  In modeling fluid motion near rigid  boundaries, an additional problem arises in solving an  ill-conditioned system of equations for the strength of  discontinuities at the boundary.  Iterative methods for solving  such problems are studied.       Simulating the behavior of complicated structures in the  real world typically involves solving large systems of equations  that cannot be solved exactly.  Instead the solution must  be approximated by numerical methods on high performance  computers. The investigators study problems in which there is a  boundary or interface that has a complicated shape and may be  moving in time. Examples include the surface of a body of water  or a bubble surrounded by fluid, the surface of a beating heart,  or the boundary between oil and some fluid that is injected into  the earth to force oil out of an oil field.  In these examples  the equations being solved model the flow o f some fluid.   Another problem is to study the motion of the boundary between  melting ice and the surrounding water, or between different  phases of a substance more generally.  In this case the equations  model the conduction of heat.  In oil exploration it is necessary  to model the motion of seismic waves in the earth and the manner  in which they reflect off interfaces between different kinds of  rock deep within the earth.  The goal of the project is to  develop relatively simple methods that can be used to solve a  wide variety of such problems with complicated boundaries or  interfaces.  ***"

Systems of integrodifference equations, in  turn, exhibit a new  variety of diffusive instability and pattern  formation.  The investigator proposes to study the traveling  waves and cycles and the varied spatial patterns that arise in  these models, employing a variety of analytical and computational  techniques.  Some equations have solutions that show repetitive behavior  either in space or in time, developing patterns.  It is of  interest to determine under what conditions such pattern  formations can arise.  This research will shed light on pattern  formation in general.  The equations studied here are related to  models of ecological processes.  Landscape ecology is beginning  to investigate how ecological processes generate the complex  spatial patterns observed on the landscape and how these  patterns, in turn, constrain or determine the rates of the  processes.

The                  investigator and his colleague David Yuen extend the usual                      canonical formulation of constant property simulation to include                realistic depth-dependent thermal expansivity and viscosity                     thermal conductivity along with multiple internal  phase                        transitions and internal heat generation.  The presence of a                    triple point in the phase diagram and a more  accurate                          temperature-dependent viscosity are also incorporated into the                  mathematical formulation.  The investigators use the newly                      developed proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and linear                      stochastic estimation (LSE) techniques to compress the enormous                 amount of data resulting from large-scale three-dimensional                     numerical simulations.  The POD and LSE techniques are also used                to characterize and understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of                  the relevant coherent structures, such as hot rising thermal                    plumes and cold sinking sheets.  The investigators study relevant               geophysical problems such as the underlying causes of large-scale               circulation in the mantle, the relative stationarity of                         upwellings from depth-dependent material properties,                            gravitational instabilities caused by multiple phase transitions                and the effect of temperature dependent viscosity on the mantle                 dynamics.  They also conduct simulations with an imposed                        time-dependent boundary condition at the bottom to account for                  the cooling of the core, in order to study the thermal history by               starting at very high Rayleigh number, like 10**8, and slowly                   lowering the Rayleigh number via cooling.                                            The investigators use modern mathematical theories and                     numerical techniques to study the three-dimensional dynamics of                 the Earth's interior.  An important issue arising in the last                   year is the possibility for gravitational instabilities to                      develop in the mantle due to phase transitions.  This instability               results in periodic eruption of superplumes and associated                      intense volcanic activity.  The collaborators are among the first               groups to model this phenomenon in three dimensions.  They plan                 to study this further by incorporating more realistic flow laws                 and thermodynamics.  There are still many aspects in this                       phenomenon of gravitational instability to explore, as increasing               evidence from the correlation between past trench sites and the                 cold anomalies in the lower mantle, inferred from seismic                       tomography, suggests that such mantle instabilities could have                  occurred in the past 100 million years.  Recognition of these                   instabilities may change traditional views of the role of                       steady-state processes.  They also investigate the nature of                    coherent large-scale flow structures in the lower mantle as                     revealed by seismology, and what effects these instabilities have               on the long-term thermal evolution of the Earth and Earth-like                  planets.  It was only a few years ago that the idea of a thermal                attractor from the collisions of plumes was introduced in                       geophysics.  They expect that work on large-scale coherent                      structures maintained dynamically by mantle convection may also                 affect traditional views of geophysical behavior."

Stochastic adaptive control is                 the optimal ergodic control of an unknown system and includes                   identification and control. For finite dimensional, continuous                  time, unknown linear stochastic systems the research will improve               existing results for completely observed systems and result in a                better conceptual understanding of partially observed systems.                  For unknown stochastic linear distributed parameter systems the                 initial work on adaptive control of systems described by analytic               semigroups with boundary or point control will be expanded to                   stochastic hyperbolic systems. For unknown, finite dimensional                  nonlinear stochastic systems the results for almost self-                       optimality and self-optimality will be improved. The adaptive                   control of unknown stochastic distributed parameter systems will                be initiated for families of semilinear equations with                          cylindrical noise.                                                                   Most physical systems require the intervention of control                  mechanisms for their optimal performance. Typically the system is               not completely known and often contains random and unknown                      perturbations. The control of an unknown system subject to                      unknown random perturbations is called stochastic adaptive                      control. Most controlled systems require stochastic adaptive                    control in order to meet system performance criteria. This                      project will investigate problems in stochastic adaptive control                that are motivated by potential applications to physical systems.               It is anticipated that significant improvements in the conceptual               understanding of adaptive stochastic control processes and their                applications will be obtained ."

Recently a number of researchers have introduced a  variety of high order splittings of the exponential into products  of exponentials, leading to high order FFT based methods.  The  investigator and collaborators have established that the  exponentials can be replaced by Pade approximants  yielding finite-difference or finite-element methods and also  that high order splittings are possible in the time-dependent  case.  The first part of this proposal is to extend the  applicability of these methods.  The investigator and  collaborators have introduced Lanczos reduction techniques for  approximating the reflection coefficient associated with the  planar interface of two inhomogeneous refractive index media.   The second part of this proposal is to develop accurate and rapid  high order wide-angle approximations to the Helmholtz equation  base on Lanczos reduction, making it feasible to model highly  divergent beams in components such as reflectors and microprisms.   The investigator is also examining the possibility of using  propagation techniques to accurately generate soliton solutions  to a variety of nonlinear Schrodinger equations.       The investigator has, in collaboration with  electrical engineers, developed techniques for mathematically  modeling the propagation of light through electro-optical  devices, such as waveguides, filters, gratings, corner  reflectors, switches and modulators.  The ability to use  computers to simulate light passing through devices reduces the  time and cost involved in designing new devices by cutting the  number of actual physical models that are needed in the process.   The results of these collaborations are already in use at a  variety of research and development centers, inclu ding Hughes  Aircraft, Corning Glass, AMOCO Technology Center, Bell Northern  Research, NIST.  The range of applicability of the modeling  techniques and their efficiency must keep pace with the constant  introduction of new materials and the down-sizing of components.   It is anticipated that the proposed research will provide some of  these improved modeling techniques and thereby will have an  economic and strategic impact on technologies based on these  devices, including optical communications.  The research should  also affect other fields that deal with wave phenomena,  for example acoustics, seismology, quantum chemistry and physics.  ***"

They are commonly used in the biological  modeling of populations.  The focus of this project is on means  of determining the long-term behavior of solutions of this wide  variety of differential equations.  From the dynamical systems  point of view,  the investigator aims to find and exploit common  features of the dynamics exhibited by this wide class of systems  in order to determine asymptotic behavior.  Monotonicity, the  preservation of a partial order relation on the space of initial  states by the dynamics, is one such feature shared by many  systems that model competing populations of organisms, neurons,  etc.  More realistic models often take the form of complex  hyperbolic systems modeling the time-evolution of densities of  populations structured by size, age, stored nutrient, etc.   Often, in their original form, these systems are mathematically  intractable and means must be found to transform them to simpler,  more well-understood, dynamical systems.  Finding transformations  of these complicated systems to simpler ones is an aim of the  present study.       Mathematical modeling of interacting populations  of organisms, neurons, etc., is an important area of  current interest.  The goal is to try to explain observations of  complex behavior in real populations by ignoring all but the  ""essential"" features of the interactions and constructing  simplified models of these systems that are amenable to  mathematical analysis.  If too much biology is ignored in the  modeling then the models do not mirror the interactions of real  populations; if too little is ignored, the models become so  complicated that present knowledge does not permit successful  analysis.  Progress in applying the rapidly d eveloping field of  dynamical systems to biological systems has steadily pushed this  fine line between biologically irrelevant models and  mathematically intractable ones forward, so that ever more  biology can be incorporated into the models, making them more  realistic to biologists, better mirrors of real populations,  while yet remaining tractable.  Essentially, the aim of this  project is to push further in this direction.  ***"

The principal themes of this work are the fundamental problems of  finding various criteria for the uniform persistence of these  considered systems, the global stability of steady states, the  existence of periodic solutions and spatial patterns, and the  existence of chaotic behaviors.  These topics indeed cover most  aspects of the so-called global qualitative analysis of nonlinear  systems.  In particular, the investigator studies some  mathematical models of populations dispersing among patches in  heterogeneous environments, where various kind of interactions  are considered. In addition to performing the traditional local  stability or bifurcation analysis, he considers global stability,  bifurcation, and chaos aspects of the nonlinear systems.       Time delays and space variations constitute  integral components of most ecological, biological,  physiological, chemical, physical, economic and atmospheric  processes.  Almost all these real-life processes are nonlinear in  nature.  They are normally too complicated to simulate in a lab,  or too difficult to understand from experimental work alone.  In  order to better manage or control such processes, it is necessary  to study them mathematically.  Most of the previous approaches to  these applied mathematical problems have been local (pretending  the system behaves in a small region as if it were linear rather  than nonlinear) and thus do not paint the whole picture of the  real systems.  This project tries to gain a full view of the  real picture by focusing on the nonlinear effects of the dynamics  of the considered systems.  This work offers a better  understanding of the dynamic interplay of the effects of time  delays and diffusions.  In particular, the final results can be  useful to ecologists, engineers, and system scientists.  ***"

Both  models involve interactions between the blood's fluid dynamics  and the mechanics and chemistry of developing aggregates.  For  the microscopic-scale model, the project involves: 1) completing  the development of the numerical tools needed to extend  simulations to three dimensions; 2) exploring and implementing  strategies for performing computationally intensive  three-dimensional calculations on high-performance parallel  computers; 3) constructing a computational analogue of the  experimental flow chamber of his collaborator J. Hubbell  (Chemical Engineering, University of Texas) and comparing  simulations with it to Hubbell's data on the dynamics of  aggregate growth; 4) modifying aspects of the model that concern  a platelet's response to pro-aggregating agents and the  efficiency of platelet-platelet cohesion; and 5) exploring the  range of behavior of the model and its sensitivity to parameter  variations.  For the continuum model, the project requires: 1)  developing numerical methods to study forms of the model that  allow strain-dependent aggregate breakup; 2) developing  techniques for incorporating into this model platelet  interactions with the blood vessel's wall or the reactive surface  of a prosthetic cardiac valve; and 3) studying the behavior of  the model when aggregation is initiated by exogenous stimuli in  bulk flow, or by contact with a reactive wall of  a coronary-artery-sized vessel.  In the latter context, it is  of particular interest to study how the interaction between flow  and vessel geometry affects aggregate formation.       Platelet aggregates form on blood vessel walls in response  to vascular injury; they are also major constituents of  the life-threatening blood clots associated with vascular diseas e  and with the use of cardiovascular prostheses.  The modeling and  simulations carried out in this project complement  traditional laboratory experimentation.  They provide detailed  information, of a type that is generally not attainable in the  laboratory, about the dynamic interactions among the components  of the aggregation response.  This additional information will  increase our insight into the physical and chemical controls on  the aggregation process.  These studies also lay the foundations  for further development of aggregation models and for their  application to clinically interesting questions, including how  flow and vessel geometry interact to influence aggregation within  natural vessels, such as the coronary arteries, or prosthetic  devices, such as vascular grafts or artificial hearts.  The  numerical tools developed in this project should also be valuable  in solving a broad range of biofluid dynamics and engineering  problems.  ***"

For the biological experiments an organism is  used that is easy to culture, has a short generation time (i.e.  yields long time series data) and allows an accurate census of  animal numbers: flour beetles of the genus Tribolium.  In the first  part of the study the objectives are model identification and  parameter estimation.  In the second part, the concern is to  document transitions in the qualitative behavior of the  demographic dynamics.  Rates of reproduction and adult mortality  are manipulated in order to cross boundaries in parameter space  from stable equilibria, to periodic cycles, to chaos.  In phase  three the objectives are to test hypotheses concerning the  existence of these unusual demographic dynamics and develop  methods for identifying these phenomena in experimental data.  A  major contribution of this project is an unequivocal example of  experimentally manipulated transitions between qualitatively  different dynamical behaviors of a biological population as  predicted by a mathematical model.       In the last ten years or so, the recognition that simple  equations can generate complex dynamics has led to an outpouring  of fascinating theoretical possibilities for the explanation of  population time series data.  Understanding the observed  fluctuations in animal population numbers is a central question in  population biology; it has far-reaching applications in areas  ranging from food production and pest control, to the management  of renewable resources, to the conservation of species diversity.  The hypothesis that fluctuations are the result of nonlinear  dynamic forces has proved to be elusive to test due to the  difficulties of gathering adequate ecological data, of  experimentall y manipulating ecological systems, and of evaluating  complex mathematical models with ecological data.  In this research  project the investigators' approach to testing nonlinear  population theory is to connect mathematical models rigorously  with experimental biological data by means of newly developed  statistical methods for nonlinear time series.  The project is  unique in its interdisciplinary approach because it involves both  theory and experimentation and utilizes the talents of the  biologist, statistician, and mathematician.  It is unusual in the  field of population biology to have an interdisciplinary effort in  which investigators from all of these disciplines are involved in  all aspects of the project, from experimental design and  implementation, through theoretical modeling and analysis, to  statistical testing and verification.  The ultimate goal is to  demonstrate the usefulness and importance of nonlinear mathematics  in gaining a rigorous understanding of the dynamics of animal  populations and in particular of fluctuations in population  numbers, be these fluctations regular or ""chaotic."""

He will continue the research                 on the ""geometric instability theory"" for the Euler equation                    which would allow  treatment of flows of an ideal fluid with                    singularities.                                                                                                                                                  The Dynamo problem concerns the  process of a magnetic field                    generation by the motion of a highly conducting fluid.  This                    process is responsible for the existence of the magnetic field of               the Earth, solar magnetic field and magnetic fields in                          astrophysics.  It also can be achieved in laboratory although                   experimental difficulties are considerable.  The suggested                      mathematical study sheds light on the process of ""fast"" (most                   efficient) generation of the magnetic field.  This ""fast"" process               takes place on a time scale many orders of magnitude less than                  the time of Ohmic decay of the magnetic field.  Another line of                 research is the investigation of hydrodynamic instability using                 ideas from dynamo theory.  General conditions for instability of                fluid flows are of fundamental importance in the areas of fluid                 and aerodynamics."

Properties of such stochastic differential equations, such as                   existence and uniqueness of solutions, solvability properties and               continuous, or measurable, dependence of solutions on the data,                 will be investigated. This study will provide the fundamental                   tools for the second part of this project, which is concerned                   with singular-regular stochastic control problems for nonlinear                 diffusions. The singular-regular model is distinguished by                      involving both measurable controls and measure-type controls. In                some cases, constraints on the state process are imposed, which                 leads to so-called reflecting type models. The focus of this part               of the research is on issues which are of fundamental interest in               control theory and applications, such as characterizing the value               function and optimal policy and deriving sufficient and/or                      necessary conditions on the optimal control.                                          This research project will develop a unified framework for                a broad class of stochastic control problems by combining                       classical stochastic control theory with the newly developed                    singular stochastic control theory. The latter is a rapidly                     expanding area of research and poses many challenging theoretical               issues related to partial differential equations and stochastic                 analysis. The principal applications of this research are to                    optimal control problems for dissipative dynamical systems under                uncertainty. Specific anticipated applications are to                           position/speed control policies for an aircraft operating under                 uncertain weather disturbances; to financial economics problems                 such as option pricing, consumption/investment optimization with                transaction costs, optimal control of storage or inventory type                 systems, among others."

The               maximum time for which the solution exists is called the blowup                 time. When the dynamics contain a control the blowup time depends               on the control. It is natural to pose the problem of optimally                  controlling the blowup time. The main direction of this research                will be to characterize the blowup time and associated blowup                   set, that is, the set on which the blowup time is finite, as a                  function of the initial conditions of the problem. Additional                   problems of interest include optimal control of extinction time,                that is, the first time the system reaches the zero state, which                is related to classical questions of controllability, and optimal               control of the quenching time, that is, the first time the                      derivative blows up but the function remains bounded.                                This project is concerned with controlling the onset of                    unbounded behavior in singular systems.  Mathematical models of                 phenomena such as thermal combustion exhibit this behavior, which               is known as blowup. In such problems the solution of the model                  problem becomes unbounded in finite time. As a practical matter,                it may be desired to delay the onset of blowup for as long as                   possible in order to allow, for example, the temperature to                     increase as much as possible prior to combustion. Similarly,                    certain biological and economic problems can be described by                    equations which exhibit blowup in finite time. Maximizing the                   blowup time in a system governing the growth of tumors, for                     example, would be effected through the use of chemotherapeutic or               radiation therapy as the control. Controlling the extinction time               of such a system would amount to minimizing the time at which the               tumor size decreases to zero."

All nonlinear waves in nature, from the light waves of  laser physics to water waves on the surface of the ocean, are  modeled mathematically by partial differential equations known  as nonlinear wave equations.  While linear wave equations have  been well understood for some time, scientists and mathematicians  knew little about the behavior of solutions of nonlinear wave  equations until the recent explosion in scientific computing  power.  While scientific computation can suggest and discover new  and unexpected behavior in solutions of nonlinear wave equations,  one can never be certain of the outcome of numerical experiments.   Mathematical studies, often of further idealized models, are  required -- not only to ensure the validity of the numerical  experiments, but also to establish qualitative behavior in the  model.  With results  certain for the model nonlinear partial  differential equations, physical experiments can then be used to  validate the wave equations as a description of real waves in  nature.  This project, taken together with the experiments in  nonlinear optics on the ``light-liquid crystal'' interaction,  addresses each of these related areas (scientific computation,  mathematical studies, and physical experiments) in the  mathematical studies of nonlinear waves.  ***"

Their immediate goal is to  find out how the inner part of the kidney (inner medulla)  concentrates urine.  The role of loops of varying lengths and  their parallel operation are studied.  Presently available  experimental data, as well as new data, as it becomes available,  are utilized to calibrate and exercise the models.  Current  algorithms for solving the stiff multipoint boundary value  differential equations for serial computers are adapted for the  parallel supercomputers.  New algorithms based on split system  solvers are developed for parallel computation.       Mammals maintain the volume and composition of their  body fluids within very narrow limits.  A basic mechanism for  this purpose is the kidney -- which can produce urine that is  either more or less concentrated than plasma or other body  fluids.  The kidney consists of a large number of distinct  functional units called nephrons, operating in parallel.  The  human kidney contains roughly one million nephrons.  A lengthwise  cross-section of the kidney reveals two distinct parts: the  cortex and the medulla.  In view of differing physiological  characteristics of the tubules, the medulla is subdivided into  the outer and the inner parts. Mathematical models have been  responsible for many of the basic ideas leading to our  understanding of the urinary concentrating mechanism.  These  models --- using experimentally available parameters --- have  established that the outer medulla uses the active mode  (metabolic pumps) for concentration but no model has been able to  generate any significant concentration in the inner medulla.  How  the inner medulla concentrates urine is still one of the major  unsolved problems in renal physiology.  Hypotheses continue to be  proposed to answer this question.   Mathematical models are  essential in the testing of such alternate hypotheses. Realistic  and comprehensive models involve the solution of thousands of  equations.  Therefore, it is essential that the solution  algorithms for the algebraic equations not only run fast and but  also minimize computer storage.  Since the nephrons operate in  parallel, algorithms and computers that are able to utilize this  physiological property are eminently suitable for kidney  modeling.  The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to  develop efficient methods for parallel computers to understand  the concentrating mechanism of the mammalian kidney.  The use of  these methods in several other important physiological  modeling applications will also be investigated.  The project  increases our fundamental understanding of basic and essential  physiological functions, develops software and algorithms that  can be used in other physiological studies, and may have  significant diagnostic implications.  ***"

It is intended to                      develop of the related partial differential equations with                      gradient constraints, to study optimal reflection barriers in                   multi-dimensional cases and to investigate other problems                       pertinent to singular control in queuing, inventory and flexible                manufacturing models.                                                                The proposed research lies within the area of optimal                      stochastic control. This type of control problem arises in models               involving automatic cruise control of an airplane subject to                    uncertain wind conditions, of a space vehicle subject to small                  perturbations in mechanical units. The solution to this problem                 suggests the optimal timing of the correction of the course of                  the airplane of the space vehicle. Singular control also appears                in queuing/production/manufacturing models. In a typical model of               a flexible manufacturing system one seeks the optimal scheduling                of turning on and off the production unit, the timing of buying                 new equipment or increasing the capacity of the existing unit,                  finding optimal levels of inventory stocked for supply, etc. In                 many cases when the production process faces uncertainties due to               fluctuation of demand or due to unreliability in the process                    itself, it is possible to use the theory of singular control to                 address the questions posed above."

Its goals are to find  the minimal order among real dynamic compensators needed for  arbitrary pole assignability and to derive a formula for the  degree of the Rosenthal compactification of dynamic compensator  space. Techniques involving the Schubert calculus developed by  the principal investigator in solving the static output feedback  pole assignment problem are expected to be important in the study  of the minimal order dynamic compensator problem.        The poles of a linear system determine its frequencies and  amplitudes of vibration, and their locations determine whether or  not the system is stable. Therefore, in control design for a  physical system such as an airplane or robot arm, a major  objective is to move the poles of the plant into its stability  region, i.e., a region where the principle modes of vibration die  out at a prescribed rate, using output feedback. Output feedback  usually involves a dynamic compensator and the higher the order  of that compensator, the more complicated the controller needed  to shift the poles becomes.Therefore, it is important to be able  to design minimal order dynamic compensators.

The primary                       theoretical focus of this work is the analysis of bifurcations to               periodic solutions near resonance for multidimensional                          multiparameter systems and the description of related phenomena,                especially the phenomenon of passage through resonance.  The                    methods employed include several aspects of the geometric                       analysis of nonlinear dynamics and classical perturbation theory:               ``Melnikov'' theory, Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction,                                elliptic functions and expansion in a small parameter.  There is                also an important computational component; especially,                          integration of differential equations, computer graphics and                    computer algebra.                                                               The theory will be applied to physical systems modeled by systems               of coupled nonlinear differential equations. The primary                        application proposed for this project is to study the motions of                a DC motor driven  mechanical linkage.  It is proposed to                       determine the existence and stability of periodic motions, the                  stabilization of periodic motions by feedback control and the                   effects of slow variation of control parameters near resonance.                      When mechanical or electrical components are linked together               (for example when a motor is connected to a machine) it is                      important to determine the subsequent operational capabilities of               the coupled system. In the design and operational control of                    coupled systems the following phenomenon can occur: a small                     effect produced by one of the components can have a large effect                on the operation of the coupled system.  This phenomenon can be                 used to advantage in electrical devices, for example amplifiers,                but often it has dramatic undesirable consequences when present                 in machinery. A motor attached to an elastic support may operate                smoothly until a small change in its rotational speed causes                    a large vibration and subsequent failure of the motor or                        its linkage.  This is analogous to the classic example of an                    opera singer breaking a wine glass with her voice.  The proposed                research seeks to find methods to determine the effects                         of couplings among mechanical or electrical components by                       developing  techniques to analyze mathematical models for the                   operation of such coupled systems.  These methods will be useful                in the design of machinery as well as the design of auxiliary                   systems needed to control its operation."

One objective of                this research is to build self-consistent equilibrium stellar                   dynamic models of elliptical galaxies, with special emphasis on                 galaxies in which orbits of more than one basic family are                      present.  For self-consistency, the different orbits that are                   dynamically possible must be populated in such a way that the                   resulting gravitational field is exactly that needed to hold the                galaxy together.  The second aim of the work is to understand the               kinematic properties of the stellar dynamic models, and to relate               them to observations.  Projections of the kinematic properties of               real galaxies  on the plane of the sky can be observed, and                     provide only indirect  information from which to determine the                  true intrinsic motions.  A third aim of the work is to study the                oscillations and stability of disk-like galaxies.                                    A typical galaxy is composed of hundreds of billions of                    stars, each of which moves on its own individual orbit according                to well-known physical laws of dynamics.   Galaxies are also                    interesting examples of complex systems, whose behavior comes                   from the combined effects of much simpler components.  This                     project aims to build mathematical models that incorporate the                  basic characteristics of real galaxies, matching observations as                far as possible, which is not simple because only flat pictures                 of the truly three-dimensional galaxies are ever observed.

Thus, a major difficulty is to find the right weak formulation in which one can prove that there exists one and possibly the unique weak solution.  When the concept of measure-valued solutions is used, he will carefully look for evidence to show that it is inevitable.  If weak solutions are not unique or stable, he will look for appropriate entropy criteria and stability conditions or the underlying mechanism of instability.  The methods to be used include the $BV$ calculus of Vol'pert, the concentration-cancellation method of DiPerna-Majda, and potential theory of Calder\'on-Zygmund type.  Explicit exact solutions are possible and he will construct and use them extensively.  He will also investigate weak convergence of numerical schemes for weak solutions.

Specific transonic problems to be                       analyzed are design of optimum critical axisymmetric bodies,                    flows about lifting, not-so-slender transonic wings and the                     transonic area rule, and wind tunnel flows.

The issues to investigate  include the connection between linear stability and spectrum, and  the existence of center manifolds which allow the reduction of  the dynamics to ODEs.  While these issues are well understood in  Newtonian fluid dynamics, very little is known in viscoelastic  fluids; ii) the study of instabilities and qualitative dynamics  of fluid interfaces.  Previous work in the area has been  concerned with linear stability and ""simple"" bifurcations.  The  proposed research will concern more complicated bifurcations,  such as sideband instabilities, and situations where several  unstable modes coexist; iii) the study of flow problems with open  boundaries.  Such open boundaries arise from truncation of flow  domains for numerical purposes. The proposed research is aimed at  addressing questions relating to open boundaries in viscoelastic  flows, and the possibility of artificial instabilities resulting  from the presence of open boundaries.  A graduate student will  work on the existence of steady flows for model equations  resulting from kinetic theories of polymer solutions.       The proposed research is aimed at further developing the  mathematical theory of the flow of polymeric liquids, as well as  multilayer flows.  Such flows are important in many industrial  processing operations. The results of the proposed research will  be helpful in developing a better qualitative understanding of  such flows and in developing methods for their numerical  simulation.  The research focusses in particular on the study of  instabilities, i.e. qualitative changes in the nature of the flow  when certain parameters are changed, and on problems introduced  by artificial boundaries which arise w hen the flow domain is  truncated for numerical purposes.  ***"

This proposal deals with computational methods for parameter  estimation in distributed parameter systems.  Parameter  estimation is the process of determining coefficient functions,  typically for partial differential equations, from observations  of solutions.  The work of this project was made possible by  recent advances in scientific computing and image processing.  In  the field of image processing, the development of so-called  ``Total Variation'' based techniques enables the reconstruction  of much sharper images than was previously possible.  The  development of parallel computers allows the solution of complex  2- and 3-dimensional problems, which were previously intractable.   Direct applications of research in parameter estimation include  the improved reconstruction of images from electromagnetic,  thermal, and acoustic data.  Radar and sonar are perhaps the most  well-known examples.  Others include noninvasive medical imaging  techniques such as CAT scans, sonograms, and Magnetic Resonance  Imaging (MRI).  Seismic data processing, where recordings of  disturbances which have passed through the earth are used to  infer the internal structure of the earth, is yet another  important example.  Parameter estimation also plays a key role in  the development of mathematical models, i.e., mathematical  descriptions of physical phenomena.  These models are used to  describe processes ranging from the transport of toxic chemicals  through the soil to the spread of the AIDS epidemic.  ***"

Both elastodynamics and                             diffusion-driven dynamics will be considered.

For example, in  Partial Differential Equations, we study the dependence of the  flows upon parameters, concentrating on the boundary conditions,  diffusion coefficients, dissipation coefficients and the shape of  the domain.  Comparison of flows defined by such equations will  be restricted mostly to the global attractors.  For Functional  Differential Equations, we will be primarily interested in  singular  perturbation problems which relate the solutions to the  properties of maps defined by limit equations.       Many physical systems are modeled by partial differential  equations defined on a bounded domain.  The study of the effects  of the domain (its shape, etc.) on the dynamics is of paramount  importance.  This is especially true if the geometric properties  ofl the domain act as a control variable, as, for example, those  included under lthe name lof optimal shape design, as well as  others.  Also, many domains are small in some directions and it  is advantageous to make a reduction to a lower dimensional domain  for design as well as computational purposes. The present  proposal addresses questions of this type.  In lazer optics and  models in ecology and biology, one encounters singularly  perturbed delay differential equations.  In such cases, the limit  equation for the singularly perturbed parameter equal to zero  is mapping.  We address in this proposal the relationships  between the dynamics of the delay equation and the dynamics of  the map.  ***"

Numerical  Approximation of Invariant Tori.       More in particular, Luca Dieci expects to continue working  on differential Riccati equations (DREs) and on applications  related to these equations.  Algorithmical and theoretical work  is specifically planned for the numerical solution of symmetric  DREs, a common occurrence in Engineering applications.  The main  effort here will be in studying stable indirect solution  strategies for the DREs, rather than direct discretizations.   Luca Dieci intends also to continue studying numerical questions  connected to the integration of matrix equations whose solution  is a unitary matrix.  He plans to devote time and resources to  the approximation of Lyapunov exponents, an issue which provided  the motivation for studying matrix equations with a unitary  solution.

The project addresses both  the development, analysis, and implementation of novel numerical  methodologies, and their application to challenging problems in  fluid dynamics.  Multiple scales problems are computationally  difficult because the uniform resolution of the smallest scales  present would lead to a prohibitively large number of degrees of  freedom in the approximate solution.  They are also a  common feature of scientifically and technologically important  fluid flow phenomena.  Mathematically, they are generally  associated with singular perturbations of the governing  equations, and can be analyzed by asymptotic techniques.  The  investigator uses asymptotic analysis in a number of ways to  guide and complement the numerical computations.  Particular  problems to be studied in detail include the generation and  interaction of sound waves with concentrations of vorticity in  slightly compressible flows, the effects of complex reaction and  diffusion mechanisms on flame dynamics, and nonlinear waves in  incompressible fluids in cylindrical geometries.  Slightly  compressible flows have two distinct time scales, the fast scale  being associated with the propagation of sound waves and the slow  with incompressible flow effects.  Understanding the interaction  between the dynamics on these disparate scales is of importance,  for example, in aeroacoustics.  Numerical problems considered  include the construction of accurate radiation boundary  conditions at artificial boundaries for long time computations  and the development of efficient time-stepping procedures.  For  the combustion problems, the investigator experiments with  various high order difference methods for solving the zero Mach  number reacting flow equations.  Using adaptive methods to  capture the thin flame front, he undertakes a detailed study of   various models for the chemical kinetics and transport  coefficients.  For the simulation of cylindrical flows, he has  developed efficient Chebyshev pseudospectral methods for  differential operators in cylindrical and helical coordinates  with coordinate mappings to resolve internal critical layers for  high Reynolds numbers.  One application will be to the  long-standing problem of transition to turbulence in pipes.       The science of wave propagation has a rich history  and provides a unified approach to the analysis of diverse  physical phenomena.  Advanced numerical methods, in concert with  modern computing technology, are a powerful tool for the  comprehensive study of the dynamics of nonlinear waves.  The  computational approach runs into difficulties, however, when  disparate scales are present.  These can be time scales, where  different waves propagate at very different speeds, or spatial  scales, where certain physical quantities vary greatly in  relatively thin layers.  To fully resolve the finest scales  throughout the physical domain is far too taxing for even the  most powerful computers.  Therefore, one must develop specialized  methods, based on a careful mathematical analysis of the solution  structure.  The specific problems considered here display both  multiple time scales (sound wave - vortex interactions) and thin  layers (reaction zones in flames).  They are fundamental problems  from the physical point of view, and also provide a testbed for  new computational techniques.  ***"

The objective is to find numerical  algorithms suitable for large parallel computers that can much  more efficiently model the dynamics of macromolecules such as  proteins, DNA, and lipids.  Emphasis is on the use of integration  schemes, notably symplectic schemes, that can use large time  steps to produce qualitatively correct simulations for long-time  integrations.  The goal is to obtain the desired information with  the least computational effort, and the methodology is to  use mathematical analysis and computational experiments on  model problems.  The techniques developed are to be tested on  realistic molecular models as part of a different, complementary  research project involving software development.  Among the  techniques to be considered, the better known ones are multiple  time steps, constraint dynamics, and fast Coulomb solvers.

The first question which  Mischaikow is trying to answer is: given a parameterized family  of differential equations what minimal dynamic structure is  common to the system at all parameter values.  For equations such  as Cahn-Hilliard, Ginzburg-Landau, Fitz Hugh-Nagumo, differential  delay with negative feedback and others the goal is to derive  nontrivial model flows and continuous surjections from the global  attractors of the systems of interest onto the model flows.  For  other dynamical systems such as the Henon map, the Lorenz  equations, non-monotone cyclic feedback systems the goal is to  obtain a semi-conjugacy from an invariant set to subshift  dynamics on a finite set of symbols. The second question involves  singular perturbation problems.  The goal in this case is to  compute Conley indices for the perturbed system (and thereby gain  information about the dynamics) using only the dynamics of the  singular system.  The problems being considered include thin  domains and fast slow systems.       Most mathematical models are not derived from first  principals, and hence, are based on heuristics, intuitive  understandings, and approximations of the physical system.  This  means that it is impossible to know precisely the appropriate  parameter values or even nonlinearities used in the model.   Therefore, it is important that the qualitative dynamic  structures observed in the mathematical system be  robust with respect to changes in the nonlinearities and  parameters.       The goal of Mischaikow's work is to develop applicable  mathematical techniques which can identify such robust dynamics  structures.  ***"

Among                    these new tools is the Exponentially Small Exchange Lemma (called               EXSEL), which was developed by the author with C. Jones and N.                  Kopell, and which has been used successfully to prove the                       existence of multiple fast-pulse homoclinic orbits in perturbed                 multi-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems, as well as in                      traveling wave problems for coupled reaction diffusion equations.               It is proposed here to analyze four fundamental aspects of                      resonance phenomena in singularly-perturbed systems: (1) the                    existence of resonant sub- and super-harmonic orbits, (2) the                   geometry of islands of stability, which are obstructions to                     mixing in adiabatic chaos, (3) the resonant response of                         homoclinic structures in the forced, damped sine-Gordon equation                which are conjectured to be sources of chaos, (4) the existence                 of periodic orbits in problems of passage throughresonance.                          Physical problems with multiple time scales arise in many                  branches of science and technology, including fluid mechanics,                  accelerator dynamics, plasma physics, neurophysiology, and                      biology. These problems are modeled mathematically as                           singularly-perturbed or adiabatic systems.  Despite the long                    history of progress and the considerable continuing interest in                 this area, a wealth of open problems exists. This proposal                      concerns a group of four fundamental mathematical questions                     concerning resonance phenomena and homoclinic behavior that are                 of direct significance in the applications. Several new                         mathematical techniques, some developed by the author, have                     recently become available which offer substantial promise of                    solving these problems. While the main goal of the work proposed                here is to use and extend the scope of these new tools, it is                   also endeavored to answer the above questions with an eye toward                the technological applications. Toward this end, the proposer                   points to his successful development of enhanced fluid-mixing                   technology as an application of his earlier work on the geometry                of homoclinic tangles in singularly-perturbed systems."

However many, if not most, practical                  control systems, such as those required on high performance                     aircraft, are only poorly, or not at all, modelled as linear                    control systems. This project seeks to develop methodologies and                their interconnections for robust control of nonlinear stochastic               control systems analogous to those for linear stochastic control                systems."

The tools of  nonlinear analysis will be supplemented by some numerical  simulation and the special methods of inverse scattering theory.

Waves are important in many fields, such as Acoustics, Optics, Gas Dynamics, Combustion Theory, Ocean Dynamics, Solid Mechanics, etc.  Many advances have been made in Non-linear Wave Theo ry in the last few decades, but many puzzles remain. An example of the Wave Theory problems in this proposal is the ""von Neumann Paradox"" of Weak Shock Reflection and Focusing.  This problem has been the object of much study since John von Neumann pointed it out, but remains open. The P.I. and a graduate student advanced significantly in prior research and are very close to a complete resolution.           A resolution of the Paradox will have considerable scientific significance and will shed light into many important practical problems. Example: issues in noise generation or control; such as ""sonic boom"" reflection, generation and amplification of sound by reflection or transmission from shear, shocks or rapidly moving surfaces. Another example occurs in the treatment of kidney stones (Lithotripsy) by use of focused weak shocks. It seems clear that a firm grasp of the details of Weak Shock Focusing should be very important in reducing the amount of ""collateral"" damage --living tissue destruction-- produced by this technique. ***"

Deterministic and statistical equilibrium theories of coherent  structures in turbulence will be explored using both analytical and numerical  methods.  These theories, which  complement the cascade-oriented concept of a  driven and dissipative system, provide models for the long-time, large-scale  behavior of flows and fields governed by conservative evolution equations.    Their equilibrium solutions are characterized by variational principles,  such  as a maximum entropy principle with constraints dictated  by the conservation  laws for the governing dynamics.  Theoretical tools and computational algorithms will be developed  to solve the  constrained optimization problems that arise from these general principles.      A variety of fundamental, prototype problems derived from specific physical  applications will be treated with these methods; they include, for instance,     the organized vortex structures in a shear layer, and the most probable          state of a magnetically-confined plasma.  Most of the tractable problems of this  kind are essentially two-dimensional; however, some aspects of the analogous  three-dimensional problems will be also tackled using extensions of the same  methods.    The principal aim of this research is to develop a basic understanding  of the  physics of turbulence.  The turbulent medium can be an  ordinary fluid, such as  water flowing in a pipe or air streaming past a wing; or, it can be a magnetized  plasma, such as ionized gas  in a thermonuclear fusion reactor.  Simplified  mathematical models  of these complex physical problems are formulated in order  to  investigate some fundamental properties of the phenomena they exhibit.   Particular attention is focussed on the coherent or organized structures that  emerge and persist in the presence of turbulent disorder.   These structures are  studied quantitatively by deriving and then solving equations that captu re the  coarse-grained behavior of the system while partially ignoring its fine-grained  fluctuations.    In this way, useful predictions can be made of physical systems  having a very  large number of degrees of freedom, which otherwise would be beyond the grasp of  current methods of mathematical analysis or computer simulation. An  interdisciplinary approach will be adopted in which abstract analytical tools,  modern computing techniques, and solid physical reasoning are employed in a  unified manner."

The study entails developing computer algorithms,  explicitly solving stochastic process models, and collaborating  with various experimental groups.  Production of chromosome  damage (for example, illegitimate recombinations, involving the  exchange of fragments between two different chromosomes) after  induction of DNA double strand breaks during the interphase part  of the cell cycle is analyzed, using probabilistic models for DNA  geometry, motion, and reactions at the macromolecular level, in  particular polymer models for large-scale chromosome structure  and motion.       Comparisons of the effects of densely ionizing radiation to  those of sparsely ionizing radiation, relevant to chromosome  geometry and to biological dosimetry, are made.  Statistical  questions that arise when very detailed experimental information  about specific individual chromosomes is made available by modern  fluorescent labeling techniques are answered by extending already  developed Monte-Carlo simulations based on previously analyzed  biological models.       Understanding how ionizing radiation damages chromosomes is  important in understanding cancer induction by  radiation, understanding how to cope with radiation accidents or  waste, and improving tumor radiotherapy.  Such understanding  requires geometric information about the chromosomes in a live  human cell; conversely, information about radiation damage  contributes to understanding chromosome geometry, which is of  fundamental biological importance.  While much effort has been  devoted to sequencing the DNA in chromosomes and to modeling  local geometry of chromosomes, quantitative geometric models of  the larger scales of main interest in analyzing radiation  produced chromosome aberrations are just now being developed, by  the principal investig ator and others.  The project combines  standard information on the physics of ionizing radiation with  these new biological models of chromosome geometry to analyze how  the damage is formed. In particular, preliminary mathematical  investigations and a literature search show that, due to  geometric effects, densely ionizing radiations, such as alpha  particles from radon daughters, make a larger fraction of certain  specific kinds of damage (e.g. centric chromosome rings) than  other kinds of chromosome damaging agents, including sparsely  ionizing radiations such as x-rays. This ""signature"" of densely  ionizing radiations should help in realistic assessments of  radiation hazards and will help in understanding chromosome  geometry.  ***"

In                         particular, they focus on the role of biased random motions in                  creating order at two levels of organization.  At the cell/tissue               level they investigate how apparently random cell motions can                   self organize into tissue geometries via boundary inhibitions and               intercellular communication.  At the molecular/cell level they                  examine several intracellular motility phenomena that appear to                 extract work from random thermal motions by employing chemical                  bond energy to ratchet molecular assembly and disassembly.                           This study aims at basic questions about how cells move                    and change shape during morphogenesis, and how macromolecules                   are transported across cell membranes.  The issues are important                for fundamental understanding, and also have implications for                   such problems as wound healing and the development of tissues.                  During and after protein synthesis on ribosomes the nascent                     polypeptide chains must be transported across internal membranes                into intracellular compartments such as endoplasmic reticula and                mitochondria.  How this is accomplished is a mystery, for                       it appears to proceed in the absence of a metabolic energy                      source such as nucleotide hydrolysis.  The investigators propose                a mechanism to explain this process based on the idea that                      the thermal motions of the amino acid chain can be biased by                    any process that makes it difficult for the chain to go                         backwards.  Examples of such processes are binding of                           chaperonins, glycosylation, and/or chain folding.  The propulsion               mechanism of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is               another example of a process that works, they believe, by                       ratcheted Brownian motion.  This bacterium drives itself by                     building a tail of cross-linked actin filaments.  They propose to               model this process by simulating the coupled dynamics of tail                   assembly and the Brownian motion of the bacterium."

(1).  Statistical behavior of two dimensional turbulence.  There are  two major problems in this area.  The first is concerned with the  spatial (scaling) behavior and the second the temporal scaling  behavior.  Classical theory attempts to answer these questions  via Kolmogorov-like arguments.  Recently this classical picture  is challenged by a combination of very detailed numerical and  analytical results of E and Majda.  The investigator continues  this study to establish an alternative picture for 2D turbulence.  (2). Mathematical and numerical problems for incompressible flows  in the presence of boundaries.  In particular, the  investigator studies the separation of boundary layers and the  approximation to Navier-Stokes equation before the separation.   Recently he has shown that in the presence of an adverse pressure  gradient the steady boundary layers have to separate and  separate self-similarly.  Now he takes up the unsteady Prandtl  equation, examining its validity in describing the boundary  layers in the zero-viscosity limit.  Previous results of Fife et.  al. are restricted to the class of solutions satisfying some  uniform bounds (independent of viscosity).  The existence of such  a class is in doubt.  On the numerical side, the investigator  studies numerical methods with vorticity boundary conditions  through the introduction of a simple model problem that captures  the essence of the full problem and is explicitly computable.   Such a program has already been carried out for the projection  method by E and Liu.       One can view both problems as preparation for  studying turbulence.  In reality, most turbulence is generated at  the fluid-solid boundary through friction.  Large-scale  computing offers another dimension for studying such problems.   But the efficient exploitation of this new dimension also  requires powerful numerical methods.  At the present time, even  the basic issues in formulating a nu merical method are unsettled  whenever boundaries are present.  Insight can be improved  drastically if simple representative models are introduced.  This  motivates the investigator's study and design of numerical  methods. Understanding of turbulence is a central problem in  applied mathematics, with broad scientific and technological  ramifications.  ***"

Quadrature is a term given  to methods of integration, especially numerical.  It has been  highly developed in one dimension with tools such as the Gaussian  quadrature formula.  The present work seeks to carry out  numerical integration through methods of cubature in several  dimensions.  The generalization is far from straightforward.  The  quadratures and cubatures require knowledge of orthogonal  polynomials, particularly with common roots.  In  the multidimensional case, orthogonal polynomials with common  roots were thought to be rare.  However recent work now  establishes that there are many Gaussian cubatures.

Work will also be done applying the cubature formulae to the  theory of interpolation in several variables.       The use of orthogonal polynomials in numerical  integration provides formulas which are optimal in the sense of  being exact for polynomials of the highest possible degree.

Furthermore, since these  problems are extremely challenging ones to try to solve with  numerical methods, it is natural to first consider related   simpler model problems.  Recent research shows that the solutions  of the two-component Vlasov Poisson equations (2CVPE) for a  collisionless plasma of electrons and positively charged ions,  with the initial condition being an appropriate measure, have  many properties that are direct analogues of solutions of the 2-D  vorticity equation for an incompressible fluid with vortex sheet  initial data.  The 2CVPE is simpler to treat analytically and  easier to solve numerically.  It should be an extremely useful  and an important model problem for suggesting answers to the open  problems about vortex sheets.  The investigator conducts a  numerical investigation of the 2CVPE and its ""viscous""  regularization, the two-component Fokker-Planc equation.  The  goal is to determine properties of solutions to these systems of  equations when the initial data is a measure.  Recently  discovered exact solutions of the 2CVPE will focus this work.   The investigator also conducts a numerical investigation of the  2-D incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations with  appropriate vortex sheet initial data.  He uses the insight  gained from the study of related model problems from plasma  physics to motivate and guide this work.  This work is designed  to provide answers to many of the open problems about properties  of solutions of the Euler equations with vortex sheet initial  data.       Fluid dynamics is the study of continuous media like air and  water.  Scientists formulate problems in this field by applying   the fundamental laws of physics such as the conservation of mass,  momentum and energy.  For most probl ems this procedure leads to  sets of mathematical equations that are too complicated to solve.  Based on physical or mathematical intuition, the scientist then  tries to find a simplified formulation of the original problem  that is simple enough to solve, but sufficiently complicated to  describe the essential features of the original problem.  The  mixing process between layers of fluid that have different  densities, like air and water, or layers of fluid moving at  different velocities, is very complicated and occurs in a wide  variety of important applications.  The flow of air over an  airplane is also very complicated.  In order to predict the  trailing wake behind an airplane, or the mixing process in a  fluid, scientists often use a simplified model of the fluid  called a vortex sheet.  This is the simplest realistic  description of not only these problems, but many other large  Reynold's number flows.  Unfortunately, despite the wide-spread  use of vortex sheet models in many problems in fluid dynamics,  many mathematical properties of vortex sheets remain poorly  understood.  The goal of this proposal is to provide answers to  many of the fundamental questions about the mathematical  properties of vortex sheets.  Successful completion of the  proposed work will lead to an increased understanding of the  strengths and limitations when using vortex sheets to model  complicated fluid flows."

In many free-surface flows, the  effects of viscosity and surface tension appear to be so small  that they are neglected.  However, attempts to solve the motion  of the free surface by numerical techniques, boundary integral  techniques for example, soon run into difficulties due to the  formation of curvature singularities.  Only when one of the  fluids is effectively a vacuum do numerical calculations indicate  that the motion of the free-surface is well-posed.  Obviously,  the effects of surface tension and viscosity, no matter how small  the coefficients are, become very important close to the time of  singularity development.  Precisely how these regularizing agents  prevent singularity formation, and what the nature of the  subsequent motion is, are the main thrusts of this proposal.  To  achieve this objective, the investigator uses a simple  mathematical view that describes singularity formation through  the analytic extension of the boundary integrals into the complex  arclength variable (or other suitable parametrization variable).   In this complex plane, singularities are born, depending on the  details of the initial conditions.  These singularities then  track through the complex plane, and may reach the real axis in  finite time.  At that point they become physically relevant.   Preliminary studies of the influence of surface tension show that  the singularities slow down and fail to reach the real axis in  finite time, but they get extremely close.  The close proximity  of these singularities to the real axis plagues standard  numerical methods, because of the high resolution needed to  capture the extremely distorted free-surface.  Instead, the  investigator uses a method that represents any singularities in  the complex plane explicitly, so that the rest of the behavior of  the free-surface is analytic.  In  particular, this analytic part  can be represented by Fourier series very accurately.  The first  task is to use this approach on a simpler classical free-surface  flow problem, the fingering instability in a Hele-Shaw cell.  The  second is to explore the method on the Kelvin-Helmholtz  instability of an interface between two incompressible fluids of  equal density and in the presence of surface tension.       Surfaces between immiscible liquids and gases occur  abundantly in nature and technology.  Some examples include the  rise of bubbles in chemically reacting units, falling rain-drops,  spray jets, and oil and water flowing in the ground.   Mathematical models that attempt to describe the motion of  surfaces typically exhibit great sensitivity to the details of  the motion.  Consequently, computer simulations can suffer from  inaccuracies unless extraordinary care is taken.  The  investigator develops a conceptually new mathematical approach  that will allow severely deformed geometries to be tracked  reliably.  In particular, the approach will be able to track the  long term behavior of water penetrating oil in a Hele-Shaw Cell,  a mathematically similar model for the motion of oil and water  during secondary stage recovery from an oil-field.  Once  completely understood on this important problem, the approach  will be adapted to the study of rising bubbles and dendritic  formation during crystal growth.  ***"

The methods are developed with the goal of handling harder problems such as fluid flow around an obstacle. Also, statistical equilibrium theories of coherent structures in turbulence are explored using numerical methods. The approach used here is based on maximizing an entropy subject to the conserved quantities of the flow. This formulation is based on the Euler's equations. The investigator has also recently developed a model of DNA which will be compared to actual DNA in nature. This model will be used to answer some conjectures about DNA. The investigator develops accurate methods for solving equations describing the evolution of an interface between two different fluids. This type of interface occurs, for example, in secondary oil recovery where water is used to expel remaining oil. The stability of the interface between the water and oil is important for efficient recovery of the oil. In addition, some simplified models of fluid flow are developed and solved to investigate some fundamental properties of turbulence. The fluid could be air around an airplane wing. This research focuses on predicting coherent structures. The investigator has also recently developed a model of DNA which will be compared to data from actual DNA in nature. This model will be used to address some conjectures about DNA which are of fundamental importance. ***"
