The principal investigator is also                      interested in analyzing the behavior of defective crystals.                     These problems concentrate on areas that are the subject of                     intense work of material scientists but they escape the framework               of classical mathematical theories.  Therefore, accomplishing                   these goals is not only important for the industry and technology               but it also contributes to the advance of mathematics, since it                 requires manipulation of very recently developed mathematical                   tools and maybe the introduction of new ones."

The mathematical models come from                 the theories of nonlinear elasticity and viscoelasticity, and                   their analysis involves the study of singular solutions of                      hyperbolic and elliptic systems and the use of techniques from                  the calculus of variations.                                                          The most common way of testing when a polymer or metal will                fail under the influence of an external force is to subject the                 actual material to loading until it breaks or deforms.  This is                 fine if one is interested only in the gross properties of the                   material, but if one wants to understand why the material fails                 at a given load then one must have recourse to mathematical                     models of the material.

It is                       intended to focus first on the practical purposes of feedback                   stabilization of highly-nonlinear systems.  Of particular                       immediate interest is a generalization of the classical zero-                   dynamics manifold only by some high-order condition (immediately                related to tracking through singularities).  This is envisioned                 to parallel the development of condition for controllability,                   from linear, over first order nonlinear to eventually high-order                nonlinear conditions.

These asymptotic                  methods allow one to estimate performance criteria even when an                 exact solution is not available, and the approximate answers                    they provide are very often highly accurate when compared to                    exact solutions for simpler cases and numerical simulations.                         Most people do not enjoy waiting in line.  In a more general               sense, such ""waiting problems"" occur frequently in computer and                 communication systems.  For example, when you make a long                       distance call the telephone company's computers may have to put                 your call into a waiting line if there is a large number of calls               in progress at the time of your call.  Depending upon how                       efficiently the phone system is able to prioritize your call you                may be able to complete your call or you may hear a recorded                    message informing you to try again.  Similar problems arise when                computers ""talk"" to each other:  if the queueing of data is not                 done properly then the transmission of data is either slowed down               or stopped completely.  With this research the principal                        investigator will use approximation techniques to provide                       estimates of waiting times in various computer and communication                systems."

Such                    topologies give rise to topologies on convex functions, with a                  function identified with its epigraph, the set of points on or                  above its graph.  In the last two years, Professor Beer                         introduced a topology compatible with Mosco convergence of                      sequences of convex sets, showing that it is stable with respect                to duality if and only if the underlying space is reflexive.                    Several characterizations of the topology were obtained, and                    continuity properties of a variety of operators and functionals                 on convex sets were studied.  In response to the unsuitability of               this Mosco topology in the nonreflexive case, and in view of some               prior promising results regarding the norm convergence of linear                functionals and their level sets, Professor Beer studied the                    topology of uniform convergence of distance functionals on                      bounded sets.  Not only is this topology stable with respect to                 duality without restriction, but it is also the right convergence               notion in terms of the stability of solutions of convex                         optimization problems.

He also hopes to become involved in                applications of set convergence in evolving research in the                     foundations of nonsmooth analysis, e.g., to certain optimization                problems."

The                   first area involves the study of fluid stability;  in particular,               Bayly will try to extend results on broadband instability from                  two dimensions to three dimensions.  The goal of this research is               to develop a global picture of instability modes and hence, a                   coherent picture of broadband instabilities in general flows.                   The second area involves the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo                   problem;  in particular, the investigator and a colleague at NYU                will try to discover what is needed to produce a fast dynamo.                   Their strategy is to perform high-resolution MHD simulations of                 dynamo actions and establish rigorous error bounds on the                       numerical discretizations.                                                           Various types of fluid dynamical phenomena involve the                     creation and evolution of instabilities.  An instability is                     produced when a small or large perturbation upsets an existing                  balance of forces and leads to the formation of a new equilibrium               state, which in turn might itself change in response to new                     perturbations.  It is easy to imagine that one is interested in                 such changes in equilibrium states, since the design of apparatus               depends crucially upon what the prevailing equilibrium state is                 thought to be in a given flow situation.  The investigator will                 use analytical and computational tools to describe the evolution                of broadband instabilities in complex flows and the impact of                   relatively large disturbances."

In particular, he                  will investigate so-called singular bifurcation problems, wherein               small changes in the bifurcation parameter can cause large                      responses in the system, laser instabilities, and the changing                  time history of the moving interface in certain pharmaceutical                  problems involving the time-release of medication. This proposal                is concerned with bifurcation phenomena.  As an illustration,                   stand a plastic ruler on its end and push on the top end.  If you               do not push very hard nothing happens.  But if you push                         sufficiently hard the first thing that happens is that the ruler                bows, either to the left or to the right.

Of particular interest is the                         approximation of a set called the global attractor, which is a                  finite-dimensional, fractal set that lies inside of an infinite-                dimensional phase space.  In order to describe the global                       attractor the principal investigators plan to construct an                      algebraic approximation method that uses smooth finite-                         dimensional manifolds to approximate the fractal set and then to                implement this method on a computer.

This is very important and timely research, and it is of               sufficient complexity that the PI will employ analytical methods                from geometry and bifurcation theory, in addition to                            computational techniques.  The goals of the research are twofold.               The first goal is to discover different types of wave patterns                  that result from the complex interactions of shocks and fluid                   structures, while the second goal is to develop numerical methods               that allow one to follow the evolution in time of the waves                     generated by the interactions.                                                       Many phenomena in fluid dynamics arise out of the                          interactions of different types of waves with each other and with               internal fluid structures such as interfaces.  What makes these                 interactions difficult to study mathematically is that they are                 described by systems of nonlinear differential equations, and so                one must use computers in order to generate solutions.  But this                is tricky also, because computers can often generate meaningless                information, unless the numerical methods used are reliable.  The               PI will study such problems with ""intelligent"" numerical methods.               These are methods that have sufficient analytical and physical                  theory built into them that they produce sharp approximations to                the correct physical solutions."

Previous mathematical analysis of                  shear-band formation has included a complete numerical                          investigation of the growth of perturbations into shear bands and               a stability analysis of the homogeneous-shear solution.  The                    results of this work have shown reasonably good agreement with                  experimental data, but an understanding of this underlying                      mechanism of band formation has been missing.  The principal                    investigator will seek to provide such an understanding by means                of the proposed modelling approach.                                                  Many physical processes are at work during the formation of                shear bands in stressed materials.  Up to now applied                           mathematicians and engineers have relied largely on two                         approaches to understanding these processes.  The first approach                involves performing experiments on actual stressed materials,                   while the second approach involves solving numerically the                      systems of partial differential equations that govern the                       material.  Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, but                  neither one is able to give a satisfactory explanation of the                   basic physical mechanisms that govern band formation.  The                      principal investigator will employ a different approach based                   upon modelling the materials with a simpler set of equations and                extracting more useful information with the aid of certain                      asymptotic methods."

In                    particular, the research consists of two major lines of inquiry.                The first one is the use of analytical methods derived from                     multi-scale asymptotics to obtain an effective medium theory that               is valid for long times when dispersion effects are important.                  The second one is the construction and implementation of                        numerical schemes that employ relatively large grids to describe                accurately the fine structure of waves as well as their bulk                    properties.  Research such as this has applications to many                     diverse areas, including seismology, oil exploration and                        crystallography.                                                                     Wave phenomena are a familiar and significant part of the                  natural world.  Over the last century mathematicians and fluid                  dynamicists have developed fairly accurate theories that describe               the behavior of waves in homogeneous media such as air or water,                theories that have been validated through extensive laboratory                  experiments.  In contrast to this, our understanding of the                     behavior of waves in homogeneous media is very limited, due in                  large measure to the difficulty of performing reliable                          experiments.  For example, understanding the behavior of                        (seismic) waves inside of the earth is crucial to any theory of                 earthquakes, and yet it is well nigh impossible to set up an                    experiment that would allow us to measure such complicated                      phenomena.  Thus recourse must be had to mathematical models of                 waves in inhomogeneous media.  In this proposal the principal                   investigator will use analytical and numerical techniques to                    describe the propagation of waves in periodic media."

The project consists of three parts.  The optimal control of a                  singularly controlled Brownian motion will be studied using the                 results for free boundary problems.  This approach has yielded                  regularity results when the dimension is equal to two and it is                 the first multi-dimensional result which yields the construction                of the optimal process.

The second part of this                      project is devoted to the perturbation theory of infinite                       dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations.  As a case study, the                    principal investigator will study an asymptotic problem related                 to simple exclusion processes.

Specifically he               will study two major problem areas:  the development and                        implementation of numerical codes that can resolve the acoustic                 equations in the presence of vorticity, and the posing of                       physically correct and numerically consistent boundary conditions               for flow problems in unbounded domains.  The vorticity that is                  generated near sharp edges like the engines or the landing gear                 creates difficulties for conventional numerical codes, and so                   the principal investigator is developing a finite element code                  that obviates many of the problems associated with vorticity.                   With regard to the posing of proper boundary conditions it is                   necessary to set boundary conditions on an artificial interface,                in order to make the computations for a problem in an infinite                  domain tractable.                                                               The problem of aircraft noise during landings and takeoffs is of                growing concern to many communities and local governments.  One                 obvious solution of this problem is to design airplanes whose                   engines and exterior surfaces operate at minimal noise levels.                  As one can imagine easily this is a complicated phenomenon, and                 so mathematicians and aerodynamicists often resort to modelling                 the complex sets of equations with simpler ones, and then                       solving the approximate equations numerically.  However this can                be tricky too, since aircraft generate vorticity, which                         influences the noise pattern and which often defeats conventional               numerical schemes.  The principal investigator is working on                    numerical algorithms that can handle the vorticity and the                      unboundedness of the flow domain in a computationally efficient                 manner."

One of the goals of the                    present research is to analyze the evolution of vorticity from                  smooth initial conditions by a combined analytical and numerical                solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in the limit of vanishing               viscosity.

For example, there are still many unanswered               questions regarding the role that dissipative mechanisms play in                the interaction of two or more shock waves and the long-time                    stability of such waves.  The principal investigators will use                  analytic and asymptotic tools to answer these questions and                     related ones.  In addition to the usual equations of fluid                      dynamics  the principal investigators will study systems of                     equations in magneto-hydrodynamics, the kinetic theory of gases,                and the theory of shallow water waves.                                               Dissipative forces like friction can be small in certain                   problems in fluid dynamics, but their effect cannot be neglected.               For example, the viscosity (internal friction) of a gas is very                 small and yet it affects the large-scale behavior of objects that               move through the gas.  The principal investigators will study how               such small dissipative mechanisms can influence the formation and               propagation of shock waves in gases.  A shock wave is something                 like a sonic boom, and it is an important feature of flows at                   high speeds."

The                   motivation for this study is the question concerning how much one               can say about a vibrating membrane if one knows the nodal lines.                The nodal lines are the curves along which the eigenfunctions of                the membrane vanish.  In one dimension the nodal lines are points               (nodes).  Nodes are of interest in engineering applications                     because they represent the optimal locations for the support of a               mast or placement of a bearing on a shaft, while nodal lines                    enter into the analysis of flaws in holographic plates.                              What can you say about a vibrating string if you know the                  nodes or a vibrating membrane if you know the nodal lines?  Nodal               lines are the fixed curves or points on the standing waves                      generated during the vibration.  This is an example of an inverse               problem:  one attempts to determine an object or process from the               data it produces.  Such inverse problems have important                         engineering applications and the principal investigator will                    employ analytical and numerical methods to study the                            discontinuous problems and the uniqueness of the density."

One of the many important problems that modern technology                  has created is involved with the transmission of light waves and                radio waves through the earth's atmosphere.  For example, the                   shuttle astronauts have to worry about their communication with                 the earth because the earth's atmosphere very often interferes                  with their radio signals.

The analysis is                 based on the systematic reduction of complex systems of equations               to simpler model equations by means of asymptotic equations.                    The model equations are studied using a combination of explicit                 solutions, perturbation methods, qualitative analysis, and                      numerical calculations.                                                              The research lies in the general area of applied                           mathematics.  Physical systems in which disturbances propagate at               finite speeds are often modelled by hyperbolic partial                          differential equations.  Examples include compressible gas flows,               elasticity, magnetohydrodynamics, and general relativity.  When                 the speed of the disturbance depends on the strength of the                     disturbance, the equations are nonlinear.  An outstanding                       property of nonlinear hyperbolic waves is the formation of                      shocks.  Shock waves are of significant practical importance                    (e.g. in sonic booms or the nonsurgical destruction of kidney                   stones) and pose many challenging mathematical problems."

Specific                problems for study include the description of how viscous effects               influence the tendency for vortex sheets to develop curvature                   singularities.                                                                       Many fluid dynamical phenomena in nature are operative in                  the idealized limit of zero viscosity or zero surface tension.                  For example, the motion of bodies in air at speeds well below the               speed of sound can be studied under the approximation that the                  air is inviscid.  Of course, this is a fiction since air does                   have a small, nonzero viscosity, but the neglect of viscous                     effects is justified when calculating a host of aerodynamical                   coefficients, since the small effect of viscosity is not nearly                 as important as a larger effect, such as a pressure drop.                       However there are many fluid dynamical phenomena whose very                     existence depends upon the presence of a formally small force                   like viscosity, and it is just such phenomena that are the                      objects of study in this proposal.  In particular, this                         research will study how viscous effects influence the roll-up of                vortices inside of thin layers of fluids."

The consensus questions to be considered arise when one is confronted with several classifications for the same collection of objects and needs to determine the agreement among them. Much of the research which will be undertaken involves Stinebrickner's s- consensus method which simultaneously produces a consensus classification and an index measuring the degree of agreement. A revised s-consensus method has been shown to satisfy three minimal and reasonable axioms which describe consensus behavior. Efforts will focus on the discovery of new methods which produce a consensus classification and index simultaneously and the discovery of new axioms which consensus methods may satisfy.

Specifically, they propose to develop decomposition algorithms suited for parallel processing and to integrate the above schemes for parallel computation of values and subgradients of necessary functions into implementations of such decomposition algorithms. Progress from this proposal will result in better algorithms which will provide faster more accurate results in linear programming appearing in industry and government.
