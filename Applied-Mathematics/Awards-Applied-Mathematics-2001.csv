Depending on the setting, it can lead to a significant speed up of combustion or to the quenching of the flame.  The main goal of this project is to improve fundamental understanding of this important phenomenon.  In particular, this work explores analytically how the geometry, scaling, and intensity of the velocity field determine the effect advection has on combustion.  A primary goal is to determine the optimal geometry for the fastest extinction of the flame, or for the most effective speed up.  The models to be studied include passive reaction-diffusion equations with physically-motivated reaction terms, systems of reaction-diffusion equations, and active scalar models with feedback of temperature and concentration on fluid velocity.  The methods of analysis include maximum-principle-based techniques, estimates on solutions of partial differential equations, and functional inequalities, as well as some methods of harmonic and spectral analysis. <br/><br/>The influence of strong fluid advection on combustion plays a crucial role in many important combustion processes in technology and in nature.  Strong fluid advection may drastically enhance the rate of burning, leading to higher efficiency, or, in some situations, extinguish the flame. This question has been extensively studied by engineers, physicists, and mathematicians alike. However, until very recent work of several research groups, there were few rigorous results on the topic. Building on the technique developed in earlier works, the project seeks to deepen the understanding of this phenomenon, in particular relating the geometric characteristics of the fluid flow with the effect it has on combustion. The potential impact of the project is an improved knowledge of combustion processes in settings as diverse as internal combustion  engines and stars. The research may lead to direct suggestions on the most efficient ways of flame suppression or enhancement.  In addition, the techniques developed for tackling this problem may prove useful in analyzing other partial differential equations.  <br/><br/>"

In addition, numerical tests show that local regularization methods can work well to resolve sharp features of solutions without having to rely on nondifferentiable or nonquadratic optimization schemes.  To date, the convergence theory for the local regularization of Volterra problems has been limited to only mildly ill-posed inverse problems.  In the case of more severely ill-posed problems, there is numerical evidence that certain local methods may suffer from lack of stability and/or convergence.  Because of the cost efficiencies of local regularization methods, an important question is therefore whether new variations of these methods can be developed for which stability/convergence can be proven in the general case.  The PI proposes to develop two new variations of local regularization methods which show promise in numerical tests and for which there is hope of establishing a general stability/convergence theory.  The PI also proposes to develop adaptive schemes for the selection of variable regularization parameters in local regularization methods.  Variable parameters are of use in applying more smoothing in some parts of the domain and less in others.  In numerical tests adaptive local regularization techniques have been shown to be effective in determining the variable regularization parameter at the same time that local parts of the solution are recovered.  Because no convergence theory exists at the present time for such an approach, the PI proposes to study such adaptive schemes and develop a theory which will be useful in making recommendations for adaptive parameter selection methods.  The PI also proposes to extend these ideas to nonlinear Volterra problems and to linear non-Volterra problems.<br/><br/>Inverse problems occur widely in many applications, including problems of biomedical imaging (CT scans and X-rays), image reconstruction (from satellites or other sources), and geophysical exploration.  The Volterra class of inverse problems arises in the determination of the surface temperature of a space vehicle as it re-enters the earth's atmosphere; additionally, Volterra inverse problems appear as models for remote sensing problems.  While classical methods exist for for solving such problems, classical methods are often very inefficient and lead to overly expensive solution techniques.  A second disadvantage of classical solution methods is readily seen in imaging applications where reconstructed images may have blurred edges and inadequately detailed features.  The PI proposes to address both of these difficulties with the development of new solution methods based on the ideas of local regularization.  The use of these newer methods can lead to a significant decrease in cost for the solution of a wide class of practical inverse problems, with improved resolution of detailed features of solutions."

This will be accomplished by a combination of various techniques.  One approach will exploit the mathematical structure of fiber transmission models in order to eliminate unessential degrees of freedom.  The reduced models that will result will be more tractable mathematically and also much more computationally efficient.  Another approach that will be used is the application of linearization and importance sampling techniques to enable the simulation of systems at realistic data error rates.  These methods will be combined to study the main sources of impairment in optical fibers in order to achieve an accurate evaluation of system performance.  All the techniques to be developed will be carefully validated by comparison to more computationally time-consuming models and to experiments.  <br/><br/>The development of high-data-rate optical fiber communications is one of the great technological achievements of the late 20th century; in the last decade alone, data rates have increased by four orders of magnitude.  This enormous increase has made possible the growth of the global Internet that promises to continue to revolutionize day-to-day communications.  Because demand for further growth continues unabated, however, system capacity is becoming limited by fiber transmission effects.  It has therefore become crucial to accurately model and calculate the impairments due to non-ideal fiber properties when designing systems.  Due to the tremendous data capacity that will be required of future transmission systems (terabits per second of aggregate capacity) and the need for extremely small transmission error rates (less than one error per trillion bits), realistic attempts to model and predict the effects of these impairments as they appear in practical systems present a number of difficult mathematical and computational challenges.  The techniques that will be developed in this collaborative research project are expected to yield large reductions in the computational time required to model optical communication systems, and at the same time produce new insights into system behavior.  Because these methods will be capable of providing detailed information about system performance at realistic data error rates, we believe they will lead to significant changes in the way in which optical transmission systems are modeled, and, ultimately, in the way that they are built.   <br/>"

Under the metallographer's microscope the same surface reveals, after etching, an underlying polycrystalline structure. Many materials, including metals, ice and rocks, are aggregates of tiny<br/>crystals or grains, which assume different orientations in space and are separated by interfaces called grain boundaries. Comprehensive mapping of grain boundaries and individual grain orientations in polycrystals has recently become possible with the emergence of orientation imaging microscopy. Details about grain orientations, e.g., the misorientations of neighboring grains, are called microtexture. Microtexture could exert a strong influence on the mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials (e.g., on the volume of backscattered ultrasonic noise, which<br/>at sufficiently high levels renders ultrasound totally useless for material flaw detection in aircraft engines; an undetected metallurgical defect in the No. 2 engine was the culprit for the crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in 1989).<br/><br/>The main objectives of the present project are as follows: (i) to reexamine the mathematical foundations and properties of several theoretical constructs which have been proposed by material scientists for describing microtexture in various degrees of detail and sophistication; (ii) to delineate the effects of microtexture on the mechanical anisotropy of sheet metals in forming operations; (iii) to study the effects of microtexture on the acoustoelastic behavior of stressed polycrystals; (iv) to develop further an earlier study that concerns using the dispersion of Rayleigh waves for the nondestructive inspection of surface layer of residual stress, which is imparted on critical components of aircraft engines to enhance their high-cycle fatigue performance.<br/><br/><br/>Date: May 18, 2001<br/>"

A canonical illustrative example <br/>of keen national interest is the noise reduction problem in an acoustic <br/>chamber (aircraft's or rotorcraft's cockpit or cabin, etc).  This couples <br/>the oscillatory behavior of the unwanted acoustic pressure (noise field) <br/>within the chamber with the elastic vibrations of a flexible wall of the <br/>chamber, possibly reinforced by sandwiched layers, and possibly <br/>accounting for thermo-elastic effects.  Pairwise sets of piezo-electric <br/>patches bonded on the flexible wall, once suitably wired, develop an <br/>elastic moment that is meant to dampen out the noise in the acoustic <br/>chamber.  Mathematically, the acoustic pressure is modeled by a second <br/>order scalar hyperbolic equation (wave equation), while the flexible <br/>wall is modeled by a plate-like Kirchhoff equation with or without <br/>structural damping.  In the first case, the plate has a parabolic <br/>behavior, in the second a hyperbolic behavior, resulting therefore in <br/>either hyperbolic/parabolic coupling, or in hyperbolic/hyperbolic <br/>coupling of the overall structure.  Two additional key, novel, <br/>distinguishing features of the present project are: (i) first, the <br/>linear or non-linear PDEs describing the coupled structure have variable <br/>coefficients in space, which is always the case when the properties of <br/>the medium depend from point to point; (ii) and, moreover,  the flexible <br/>wall may be curved (rather than flat), and thus modeled by a shell <br/>(rather than a plate).  Accordingly, differential geometric methods are <br/>then proposed in the control theoretic analysis of the overall coupled <br/>structure, to cope with these two serious difficulties.  The goal is to <br/>optimally control - according to a pre-assigned optimality criterion - <br/>and asymptotically stabilize the coupled structure.  The methodology of <br/>this project consists in first establishing a mathematical theory, to be <br/>followed next by a numerical analysis thereof, to yield effective and <br/>computable algorithms.<br/><br/>Recent Federal research has convincingly demonstrated smart <br/>materials/structures to be a laboratory reality.  This is also confirmed <br/>by a Workshop Report for the National Science Foundation entitled: <br/>""Rebuilding and enhancing the Nation's infrastructures: a role for <br/>intelligent material systems and structures"", 1993.  These new structural <br/>concepts actively damp noise and vibration, suppress flutter at trailing <br/>edges of airfoils and enable active twist/camber of both fixed wing and <br/>rotorcraft; attenuate or suppress water borne signatures (active <br/>acoustic signature control), etc. The transition of novel smart<br/>structures into new, truly revolutionary platforms faces many obstacles.  <br/>The most significant is design optimization: both of the smart structure <br/>and its communication and control systems. The present project aims at <br/>producing a contribution in this area, based on solid mathematical <br/>foundations and analysis.<br/>"

The positioning accuracy of the system can be improved by minimizing the effect of the hysteresis.  To reach this goal it is necessary to have an accurate representation of the hysteresis, and a control strategy that provides compensation for the hysteresis.  Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of using the KP operator to model hysteresis.  This work also demonstrated the use of the inverse KP operator to create an open loop control that minimized the positioning error caused by the hysteresis.  The results of that work are restricted to an actuator working under a fixed set of operating conditions.  As these conditions change the performance of the model and the control degrade.  To remedy this situation the proposed three year research program will focus on the modification of the KP operator so that it is capable of modeling hysteresis over a wide range of operating conditions (temperature and load).  As before, the inverse operator will be used as part of a controller designed to minimize positioning error over a range of operating conditions.  The major program tasks are: 1) The determination of the conditions necessary for data that is used to identify the nonnegative measure of the KP operator; 2) The modification of the KP operator to explicitly include variables associated with the temperature of the actuator and the load acting on the actuator; 3) The inversion of the modified KP operator and the development of a control based on this inverse.  Computer simulations and experimental data will be used to evaluate the relative performance of the KP and modified KP operators.  Similarly, the performance of controllers based on the inverses of both operators will be compared to determine if the positioning accuracy of the actuator can be improved by incorporating load and temperature variables into the KP operator.  <br/><br/>A key component of many mechanical systems is the positioning subsystem.  This subsystem typically consists of a controller that uses sensor information to drive an actuator such that a desired position is attained by a system component.  For a satellite-tracking antenna, it may be the system that aims the parabolic antenna dish at the desired point in the sky, or it is the system that is used to position a specimen under the probe tip in a scanning probe microscope (SPM).  Whether it is a system for pointing an antenna or imaging microscopic structure, the accuracy of the positioning directly impacts the overall effectiveness of the system.  For an SPM a piezoceramic type actuator is used for positioning.  A relationship between the actuator input and the resulting position, called hysteresis, limits the accuracy of this type of actuator.  The hysteresis introduces a positioning error that cannot be effectively minimized with conventional control strategies.  However, over the past decade several methods have been developed that are capable of minimizing this error for fixed operating conditions.  The proposed program is directed at extending a method based on the KP operator so that it can be used to reduce the hysteresis error over a range of actuator operating conditions.  The two major benefits of the program are: 1) The results can be used to improve the accuracy of currently installed positioning systems such as those used for microscopic imaging and integrated circuit production and 2) The program will actively engage a diverse undergraduate student population to state of the art research.  The second of these benefits is as significant as the first, for this effort will include the development of an experimental test facility at Ferrum College for both computer simulation work and experimental testing.  Students at the college will be active participants in the design, implementation and execution of experiments directed at the development and evaluation of the hysteresis models and the actuator controllers.  Additionally, they will apply material learned in their undergraduate courses to analyze experimental data and system performance.  The program will provide a rare opportunity for undergraduate students in this region to experience advanced research typically only found at a major research university or industrial research center.  This program will also be an introduction for this region of the state to advanced technology."

We are working to create stable algorithms by utilizing the principle of causality and by characterizing the scattering data, as much as we possibly can. Inverse scattering problems are often posed in either the ""frequency<br/>domain"" or in the ""time domain"". Theoretically, the two are equivalent, one set of data being related to the other by the Fourier transform. However, features that are easily seen in one domain can appear much more complicated in the other. For example, the scattering operator, in the frequency domain is easily seen to satisfy certain bounds.  The analogous bounds in the time domain appear much more complicated.  Similarly, the timing of reflections (i.e. you hear reflections from nearby objects before you hear those from objects further away) becomes a property of ideals in spaces of analytic functions when translated to the frequency domain.<br/><br/>A main feature of our approach is to carefully analyze how to express each such feature in both contexts, and use these to help characterize the scattering data and enforce stability.<br/>The fundamental task of science is to investigate the world. Most often, we accomplish this goal by directing waves (e.g. light, X-rays, sound) at an object and  observing the waves after they have interacted with that object.  In some cases, the results of such an experiment can be readily understood (e.g. a photograph, a single X-ray).  However, as our technology becomes more and more complex, the data from an experiment are less and less likely to be directly meaningful. More and more, sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques are necessary to translate data into something which is meaningful to the human investigator (e.g. a CAT scan, a neutron scattering experiment). This is the general role that Inverse Problems plays in science today.  It is the mathematical science of interpreting experiment. When we solve inverse problems we run physics backwards, deducing the cause from the effect. While physical intuition often suggests the best imaging experiments, an imaging algorithm is not a model of a natural process. In particular, these problems are often ill-posed, and physical principles must often be applied in ways that are radically different than how they would function in a ""forward problem"" which directly models nature. Thus they offer a unique opportunity for using  mathematical intuition to supplement physical intuition. This project seeks to employ physical principles in novel ways to develop stable imaging techniques. Here is an example, discovered under previous NSF support. We observe reflections of waves from a layered lossless medium with unknown wavespeed. If one makes a guess at the wave speed in part of the medium and uses that guess to compute the reflection one would have seen from the rest of the medium, then either the guess is correct or the computed reflections violate the principle of causality by arriving back at the receiver too soon. We used this principle to develop a very stable algorithm.<br/>"

The presence of nonlinearity often requires a combination of asymptotic and perturbation methods, scientific computation, and rigorous mathematical analysis to achieve a solid mathematical framework for understanding a given physical system.  By direct collaboration with both industrial partners and members of the physics and electrical engineering academic community, quantitative models for the nonlinear optics and atomic systems of interest will be developed based upon first principles.  These models will be studied in appropriate parameter regimes where simplified nonlinear dynamical systems theory can be applied. The results will then be recast in terms of their original experimental context so that the theoretical predictions can be tested, verified, and modified as necessary.  The specific applications of interest concern optical parametric oscillators, optical fiber lasers and devices, and Bose-Einstein condensates.  All these systems exhibit a stable evolution of nonlinear pulses, fronts, and periodic wavetrains.  <br/><br/>This research in mathematical modeling and analysis addresses three classes of important problems.  With rapidly developing materials and devices, nonlinear optics remains at the forefront of enabling technologies for communications and information systems. Of primary importance is the stabilization of optical pulses.  This research aims to provide a general description of the stability of pulses in a wide variety of lasers and devices where nonlinearity plays a key role.  Optical parametric oscillators have tremendous potential application for tunable coherent radiation, pattern recognition, and optical information processing.  This work will establish regions of control for the pulse and front structures in these optical devices, facilitating practical implementation of the technology.  Bose-Einstein condensates, which have been only recently realized experimentally, are expected to have applications in quantum logic and matter-wave transport.  Trapping the condensate and sustaining it for long time periods are fundamental for making the Bose-Einstein condensates a viable technology. This research will focus on various periodic trap configurations that can stabilize the condensate in both attractive and repulsive states. <br/>"

A general area of interest <br/>that encompasses several parts of this proposal is the relationship <br/>between energy preservation and asymptotic behavior in dynamical systems <br/>and between reversible and irreversible behavior. In the integrable <br/>systems area the proposer is interested in the nonabelian Toda lattice, <br/>infinite-dimensional generalizations of Toda, and generalized smooth <br/>and discrete rigid body systems.

For elasticity, the investigator will build on a recent breakthrough that enabled the construction of the first stable mixed finite element methods for the displacement-stress formulations with polynomial trial functions, and also work towards the development of simpler nonconforming mixed finite element methods and extensions to three dimensional elasticity problems.  Concerning discontinuous Galerkin methods--finite element methods in which the approximating piecewise polynomial functions are discontinuous, with modifications incorporated into the variational formulation to achieve consistency--the investigator will work with his collaborators to build on recent work on the unification and classification of such methods to develop a unified approach to the analysis of and discrimination among a wide class of discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic equations.  Application will also be made to the numerical simulation of elastic plates incorporating shear.  The third and largest effort concerns the numerical solution of Einstein's field equations relating mass and the curvature of space-time.  The emphasis here will be on understanding the fundamental properties of the Einstein equations most relevant to their numerical solution and the basic difficulties that have beset previous attempts at numerical simulations of them.  The work will be guided by the goal of simulating the coalescence of inspiralling pairs of black holes and the resulting emission of gravitational radiation, which is a problem of fundamental importance to gravitational physics and also because such simulations will be essential to realization of a new generation of observatories based on gravitational wave detectors.<br/><br/>Computer simulation is a key tool for the design and testing of complex engineering structures.  In recent decades computer simulation has also joined experiment and theory as one of the main paradigms of scientific investigation.  In both areas, many of the most complex systems are first modeled by systems of partial differential equations--in which the language of calculus is used to express the variations of the relevant physical quantities in space and time--and then these systems of differential equations must be approximated by numerical algorithms, which harness the power of modern computers to perform billions of arithmetical operations a seconds to extract the solutions to the equations to the required degree of accuracy. In recent decades the principles for the design and validation of such algorithms have been developed for many of the basic systems of differential equations encountered in science in technology, but many more complex systems have so far resisted effective computation, and that is the thrust of this research.  A particular emphasis will be on numerical algorithms for accurate determination of the stresses internal to elastic structures, which is essential to building safe and economic engineering structures.  A second emphasis will be on developing methods to simulate Einstein's equations of general relativity, especially for predicting the output of gravitational radiation--minute ripples that propagate on the curved surface of space-time--from massive cosmological events such as black hole collisions.  Computer codes capable of making such predictions are needed to realize the effectiveness of a new type of observatory based on gravitational radiation currently being constructed, which will provide mankind with its first window on the dark matter that makes up 90% of the universe. <br/>"

The principal advantage of FTS is the tremendous throughput improvement compared to dispersive or filter spectrometers.  Traditional FTS techniques, however, require a precision scanning mirror.  This requirement significantly increases the cost, and is difficult to implement for use from a moving platform or for a dynamic target.  A more recent technique does not require scanning. This provides the ability to acquire all spectral bands simultaneously, allows high spatial resolution from a moving platform, improves the reliability, and lowers the mass, volume and cost. These non-scanning FTS, however, have yet been unable to exploit the tremendous potential throughput advantage of FTS, since they require operation in a ""pushbroom"" mode.  In this mode, a narrow slit masks the field-of-view (FOV) to a narrow strip and this severely reduces the throughput.  The proposed approach uses deconvolution techniques to provide spatial resolution along-track, without the need for a narrow field mask.  This technique can therefore simultaneously provide both the throughput advantage of traditional FTS, and all the advantages of non-scanning FTS.<br/><br/>Imaging spectrometry is a powerful tool for Earth Science, particularly for investigation of land cover and land use change. When applied to Space Science, particularly exploration of the solar system, imaging spectrometry is the primary tool for global determination of surface mineralogy and is also useful for studies of atmospheric composition. In Human Exploration and Development of Space, spectrometry is being employed for diagnostics of reusable rocket engines, by observation of the exhaust plume.  The proposed technique provides a factor of 10 to 1000 advantage in throughput compared to current techniques for imaging spectrometry, allowing greatly improved radiometric resolution. The absence of moving parts improves the reliability and lowers the cost, mass and power requirements.<br/>"

Novel technological applications involve highly ordered phases such as the ferroelectric smectic~C*.  Ferroelectricity in liquid crystals is a consequence of the chirality of the phase (i.e., molecules are arranged in helical patterns). Chirality also turns out to be a central attribute of all living organisms. This fact brings a biological scope to liquid crystals research. This proposal deals with mathematical and modeling issues of advanced liquid crystal materials, in the context of applications to optics and rheology.    Ferroelectricity and chirality are at the core of the proposed models. One of the issues of the project is the modeling of ferroelectric display. The switching time of such a display is much less than that of other liquid crystal technologies (e.g., shutters are capable of a 70 microseconds transition time); it also allows for sequential coloring. The project also addresses related current trends of thin film research for liquid crystals, with a view towards biological applications. One such trend relates to the need of miniaturization of devices, such as the manufacturing of very thin ferroelectric displays (from 10 to 100 nano-meters thickness). These are particularly needed in interactive video applications, where some of the display components are intended to be wearable.  One related aspect of the proposed research is the study  of interfaces and contact surfaces between liquid crystals and isotropic fluids, and the role of smectic liquid crystal phases as surfactants.    Such questions are also relevant in studies of biological membranes and processes, such as the transport of drugs through cell walls, and the attachment of proteins to strains of DNA.    The analysis of flow problems will encompass uniaxial and biaxial nematic, chiral and smectic liquid crystals and polymers.  The PI will also carry out research related to applications of  liquid crystals to optical switching and telecommunications, and will search for industrial partnership in such topics.  The work will incorporate modern theories of partial differential equations and calculus of variations. Numerical simulations will also be carried out for some of the problems. The PI will continue the very active program of connecting research activities  with undergraduate education through the following: the  summer REU program,  organization of industrial seminars, participation and organization of open houses for undergraduate students as well as for  high school students, first year seminars, and bringing state of the art computer software and technology to undergraduate mathematics. <br/><br/>Since their discovery at the end of the nineteen century, liquid crystals have been at the core of   the most exciting scientific events, and have brought one of  the truly remarkable technological advances of the twentieth century. They are found in the most basic household items, such as watches and calculators, to computer screens and instrument display panels (LCD). Following    the commercialization of the first display device towards the mid 20th century,   the physical and mathematical modeling  of liquid crystals has played  a major role in their technological development,  during the last quarter of the 20th century.  Moreover, the mathematical challenges posed by the liquid crystal models of continuum mechanics brought a wealth of activity in analysis and partial differential equations.  These achievements, in turn, prompted further technological developments.  The future of the liquid crystal research promises new levels of scientific and technological advances, but it is also filled with challenges. The goal of the proposed research is to actively participate in this endeavor and work on the forefront of the modern liquid crystal research. This proposal deals with mathematical and modeling issues of advanced liquid crystal materials, in the context of applications to optics and rheology. The work will incorporate modern theories of partial differential equations and calculus of variations. Numerical simulations will also be carried out for some of the problems.<br/><br/><br/>Date: June 25, 2001<br/>"

This will achieve a unification of the various existing versions of the finite-dimensional Pontryagin Maximum Principle, incorporating them all into a single result, which, in addition, will be more general in scope and will also apply to hybrid problems.  Several other related lines of research will be pursued: sufficient conditions for an optimum for families of trajectories, using extensions ---due to the PI in collaboration with B. Piccoli---of V.

Such problems occur in many areas of science, ranging from the more traditional automatic control questions that arise naturally in engineering (e.g. control of power plants, aircraft, or various mechanical devices) to the more recent applications in biological and medical problems (e.g. the search for optimal ways to administer combinations of several medications).  The common aspects of all these problems are (a) that they involve the search for strategies for influencing (i.e., ""controlling"") the behavior of a system so as to get it to achieve a desired goal in the best possible way (""optimal control"") or, at least, to come as close as possible to that goal, and (b) that they have a definite dynamical structure (for example, one needs to know not only how much of each medication to administer, but also the specific time sequence in which this is to be done).  The search for solutions to optimal control problems has been made more difficult by the fact that the existing mathematical methods involve a collection of different techniques that cannot be combined into a single theory.  This means that most real-life problems do not fit within the framework of existing techniques, especially when these problems are ""hybrid,"" in the sense that they combine continuous aspects with discrete ones.  The ultimate goal of the PI's proposed research is to produce tools that will make it possible to attack large classes of such problems by means of a single, systematic, user-friendly approach."

The first one is equivalent to the universality conjecture of the local eigenvalue statistics of random matrices, an equilibrium problem. The second one is the construction of relativistic Vlasov kinetic theory from a microscopic model, a nonequilibrium problem. As to the first problem, we use a new, entirely analytic strategy to extend the known universality for the unitary matrices also to the other types of random matrices: real symmetric, complex normal, and quaternionic self-dual. The strategy applies to the bulk and to the edge of the spectrum. We also apply our method to the study of the Laughlin wave function of superconductivity, which is of a related structure. As for the second problem, we use the recently laid microscopic dynamical foundations of relativistic many-particle theory to establish the first derivation of relativistic Vlasov kinetic theory in form of a weak law of large numbers. We also study its fluctuations around the limit in form of a central limit theorem. <br/> The universality conjecture is currently one of the top priority problems of random matrix theory, a subfield of probability and mathematical physics. Its applications range from nuclear physics, nanotechnology and superconductivity on the physics and technology side to deep number theoretical implications on the mathematical side - which in turn have applications in cryptography and related fields. The conjecture has been proven so far for the simplest type of matrices, but a proof for more general matrices has so far been elusive. The relativistic Vlasov theory of charged particle systems forms the dynamical basis for a large part of high temperature plasma physics, with applications ranging from thermonuclear fusion research to space plasma research, e.g. about the solar wind and magnetic storms. Its microscopic atomic underpinnings, which have so far eluded researchers, will make it possible for the first time to systematically study the accuracy of Vlasov theory and in particular to compute its leading corrections."

The<br/>mathematically unique conformal maps produced by the algorithms<br/>allow surface-based coordinate systems to be computed on the<br/>brain surface so that surface positions can be precisely<br/>determined.  Moreover, if one puts foci of functional activation<br/>onto the flattened surface, one can then visualize and measure<br/>the relationship between brain function and brain anatomy.  These<br/>new surface-mapping techniques and their application to the brain<br/>surface permit biomedical researchers and clinicians to rapidly<br/>and accurately map and compare the locations of physiological and<br/>pathological ""events"" in the brains of research subjects and of<br/>patients with a variety of neurological and psychiatric<br/>disorders.

The research explores mathematical phenomena that are relevant to the modeling of nonlinear physical systems and the analysis of experimental data.  We consider the method commonly used by scientists to ""reconstruct"" the dynamics of a nonlinear physical system from experimental data, and we study the mathematical relationship between the reconstructed dynamics and the true dynamics.  We will also develop methods for forecasting the behavior of spatiotemporally chaotic systems, such as the Earth's weather, given limited measurements of the state of the system.  Further, we will study fractal measures that arise in chaotic fluid flow and their application to problems of mixing and magnetic field generation. <br/><br/>Chaotic dynamics has been observed in many aspects of nature; in weather, it has been called the ""butterfly effect.""  Chaos can be an obstacle in some cases (limiting the predictability of the weather) and an asset in others (such as industrial mixing applications).  Our research concerns the mathematics behind the methods scientists use to model and forecast chaotic systems.  Our intent is both to examine the validity of apparently useful but unproven methods, and to develop new and improved methods.  Long-term benefits may range from better weather forecasts to more efficient procedures for mixing chemicals. <br/>"

It is a distinctive feature of multidimensional conservation laws in self-similar coordinates that they change type, being hyperbolic far from the origin but of mixed type near the origin.  Analysis of behavior near the origin gives rise to interesting open problems in elliptic partial differential equations, including nonlinear free boundary value problems, degenerate oblique boundary problems, and quasilinear degenerate elliptic systems.  Such problems arise in many different combinations in the study of two-dimensional Riemann problems, including those for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics.  This project also investigates a class of singular non-quasimonotone elliptic systems that arise in models of biological morphogenesis experiments and certain predator-prey interactions.   <br/><br/>Multidimensional conservation laws are mathematical models for fundamental processes in physics and engineering, such as high-speed flows and supersonic jets.  While tools for numerical simulations of multidimensional conservation laws have been developed extensively, there is very little analytical theory available.  It is our goal to establish parts of the needed theory and to investigate the structure of solutions for such problems.  The results of the project will have application to a wide a variety of physical systems.<br/> <br/>"

The work on biofilms focuses<br/>on systems of advection-diffusion equations coupled to ordinary<br/>differential equations with coupled nonlinear boundary conditions<br/>in piecewise-smooth domains.  Aside from well-posedness and the<br/>existence of multiple steady states, which are nontrivial<br/>questions, the important biological information comes from key<br/>eigenvalues for associated nonstandard eigenvalue problems and<br/>their dependence on parameters.  Both mathematical analysis and<br/>numerical simulations are required for an understanding.  The work<br/>on the paradox of the plankton focuses on the classical model of<br/>n-species exploitative competition for k essential<br/>(non-substitutable) nutrients.  If n is larger than k there can be<br/>no equilibrium coexistence of all n species so one must seek<br/>oscillatory coexistence.  The investigator exploits certain<br/>heteroclinic structures (cycles of equilibria) that arise<br/>naturally in such systems in order to seek periodic coexistence<br/>solutions.  The theory of competitive and cooperative systems can<br/>play a significant role.  Abstract dynamical systems theory comes<br/>into play in the work on robust persistence.  Specifically,<br/>understanding chain recurrent sets and Morse decompositions of<br/>the boundary dynamics (where one or more species are absent) are<br/>key to showing that persistence for a dynamical system is robust<br/>to perturbation of that system or of its parameters.<br/>     Dynamical systems that arise naturally in many areas in the<br/>biological sciences often have special features not shared by<br/>systems arising in the physical sciences.  Broadly speaking, the<br/>investigator develops mathematical methods that exploit these<br/>special properties and applies them to specific problems.  The<br/>main focus is on the long-term behavior of the dynamics after<br/>transient effects have disappeared.  Progress in this area can<br/>help to answer important biological questions that are subject to<br/>mathematical modeling, such as whether an infectious disease<br/>becomes endemic in a population or becomes extinct, or which<br/>species in an ecosystem can survive and which will become<br/>extinct.  A substantial effort is devoted to understanding the<br/>dynamics of mathematical models in three areas of the<br/>biosciences.  The first is microbial growth and competition in<br/>environmental settings where biofilms may form on surfaces.<br/>Biofilms are of great importance in the health sciences and food<br/>industry where their formation typically results in negative<br/>outcomes.  They are responsible for food and water contamination,<br/>dental caries and periodontal disease, and the contamination of<br/>medical implants.  The investigator studies under what conditions<br/>biofilms may form and what bacterial densities can be expected.<br/>The second is a fundamental issue in population biology, the<br/>so-called ""paradox of the plankton"": why can so many plankton<br/>species (and, more generally, species of other taxa) be supported<br/>by so few limiting resources?  The investigator provides<br/>mathematically rigorous results for the existence of oscillatory<br/>coexistence states of the relevant mathematical models when the<br/>number of species exceeds the number of resources, as is typical<br/>in natural environments.  The third is a more robust theory of<br/>persistence (also called permanence) for dynamical systems<br/>arising in population dynamics.  In its simplest form, this theory<br/>seeks not to determine the global behavior of solutions of a<br/>dynamical system representing interacting populations but rather<br/>to answer the more basic question: What species are present at<br/>the end of the day?  While past research in this area has<br/>primarily ignored the fact that population models are only<br/>approximately correct, the investigator seeks to provide answers<br/>to the basic question that hold true for all small perturbations<br/>of the model equations.<br/><br/>"

The investigators<br/>organize a workshop to consider mathematical structures with<br/>application to specific problems in fields increasingly connected<br/>to mathematics, for example the global geometry of macromolecular<br/>folding, including both proteins and RNA.  Recent mathematical<br/>results allow for a treatment of the full spatial folding<br/>problem: how do the physico-chemical properties of macromolecules<br/>determine their spatial folding characteristics?  Roughly,<br/>folding can be modeled as a family of weighted arcs, each arc<br/>corresponding to a chemical bond, the weight the Boltzmann<br/>strength of the bond.

The first topic concerns creep in a two phase composite given that one knows the behavior of the constituent phases. The problem is to obtain bounds on the range of creep that might occur, and to identify microstructures having the maximum and minimum creep. The second topic concerns the complex dielectric constant of homogeneous or heterogeneous materials which governs how a material reflects, transmits and absorbs radiation. Given measurements of the complex dielectric constant over a range of frequencies, the problem is to say something definite about the response of the material over an interval of frequencies outside the measured range. The third topic, which represents a continuation of previous work, is to explore the range of values the average strain can take in a composite which is subject to a fixed average stress, as the microstructure is varied. The objective is to bound this range, and to identify optimal structures that generate strains at the boundary of the range of admissible values. Such structures should be useful as ``stress guides'' for channeling stress to desired locations. The particular question of what microstructures make the best possible hydrostatic compression to shear converters will be investigated. The fourth topic is to explore the properties of a rather exotic class of microstructures, called partial differential microstructures. These may turn out to be the best microstructures for solving certain optimal design problems.<br/> <br/>A better understanding of the macroscopic response of materials is of central technological importance. This importance stretches across the board, from understanding the macroscopic response of engineered materials (of critical importance to the defense, automotive, and aerospace industries), to understanding the macroscopic response of polycrystalline and porous rocks (relevant to earthquake prediction and to the oil industry), to understanding the macroscopic response of sea ice (important to climate modeling), to understanding the macroscopic response of biological materials (such as tissues, bones, shells and tendons). This proposal will enhance our understanding in ways that will (1) facilitate the development of new materials having unusual properties that are achieved by tailoring the microstructure; (2) provide limits on the response of composite materials, that could be essential for assessing the safety of such materials in desired applications; and (3) predict certain aspects of the response of materials to radiation outside frequencies where the response has been measured, which could be important if the material is biological and if one wants to know if radiation could be harmful outside frequencies where its effects are known.<br/><br/>Date: May 30, 2001<br/>"

While the fundamental equations describing fluid motion, the Navier-Stokes equations, are well-known, it is generally computationally expensive and analytically infeasible to solve the full equations exactly. To better understand these systems, it is necessary to turn to simplified or reduced models resulting from systematic approximations of the full equations. The semi-discrete approximation techniques which are utilized in this project focus primarily on reducing the dimension of the full fluid equations by exploiting symmetries or widely disparate lengthscales in specific systems. The resulting predictions from the reduced models will be compared qualitatively and quantitatively with experimental data.<br/><br/>Fluid dynamics arises in a multitude of biological, environmental and industrial applications. This project is designed to develop models that describe basic hydrodynamical phenomena such as hydraulic jumps that can arise in jet impingement cooling systems and hydrodynamical systems with flexible boundaries. The latter include spinning magnetic media such as disk drives, and biological problems such as insect flight, blood flow in arteries and dynamics of the syrinx in song birds. Undergraduate participation is an integral part of both the experimental and mathematical aspects of the program. Mathematical models will be tested in the new Fluid Dynamics Laboratory which will provide a hands-on environment in which students learn to integrate mathematics with physical phenomena. This unique approach encourages students to apply their mathematical skills in consort with their physical intuition within the framework of contemporary research.<br/>"

Although there exist proposed solutions of idealized (and unrealistic) spin glass models, the principal investigators' interests center on answering fundamental statistical mechanical questions that bear on the behavior of real laboratory spin glasses.  These questions, many of which remain controversial despite two decades of intensive study, include the nature of ordering in the equilibrium spin glass phase, understanding anomalous behavior, such as slow relaxation and aging arising from nonequilibrium dynamics, and proving the presence or absence of a phase transition in finite dimensions.  The methods used and concepts introduced should be relevant not only for spin glasses but also for other disordered systems, many of which remain poorly understood.  Moreover, the generality of the principal investigators' approach to dynamics should yield progress in certain aspects of nonequilibrium dynamics in both homogeneous and disordered systems.<br/><br/>Our deep physical and mathematical understanding of ordered systems in the solid and liquid state --- for example, crystals, ferromagnets, superconductors, liquid crystals, and many others --- has been both of fundamental scientific importance and has spurred profound technological change throughout the second half of the last century.  However, there exist many systems, both familiar and unfamiliar, in which randomness or disorder plays a key role, and in which our mathematical and physical understanding remains comparatively primitive.  One familiar example is ordinary window glass, where the atoms or molecules are ""stuck"" in random locations (as opposed to a regular crystalline array as would be found, for example, in ice).  Spin glasses are disordered magnetic systems which are thought to be prototypes for this kind of macroscopic ""frozen-in"" disorder. Disordered systems in general present both fundamental scientific challenges and at the same time hold great promise for applications.  The latter includes not only the possibility of new materials and devices but also the creation of new algorithms and applications to the biological and other sciences.  Progress in understanding these systems is therefore greatly desirable.  Spin glasses may be more amenable to mathematical analysis than other materials in this class.  Nevertheless, little fundamental progress has been made even here.  The principal investigators' work is aimed at resolving basic mathematical and physical issues concerning these materials and at providing a general theoretical approach for a wide variety of disordered systems.<br/><br/>"

Microscopic misfits are certain types of deformations and electrical/magnetic polarizations that are experienced by the microscopic components of a composite material.  In a ceramic-metal composite (cermet), for example, the two basic components of the mixture have different coefficients of thermal expansion; heating, therefore, gives rise to misfits - i.e., microscopic deformations which would be mismatched, were it not for constraints of continuity of elastic displacements at the boundaries between ceramic and metal.  Misfits thus produce microscopic stresses that determine, to a substantial extent, the macroscopic composite behavior.  The proposed efforts in these regards will seek to provide a theoretical understanding of misfits, so that materials with improved properties can be designed. One of our goals, for example, seeks to design ceramics that do not shatter at elevated temperatures, and are thus appropriate for use in turbine blades at high temperatures.  Problems of scattering by inhomogeneous media, on the other hand, play central roles in a wide variety of applications, including radar, sonar and remote sensing, medical microscopy, optical communications and non-invasive evaluation.  The work proposed here will seek to develop fast high-order solvers for a variety of configurations arising in engineering practice. In view of recent results, it is envisioned that the proposed techniques will significantly enhance our prediction capabilities in both materials science and computational wave propagation.<br/><br/>The proposed work impacts a number of areas of federal strategic interest, including high-performance computing, materials research, medicine, biology and national security. The specific research is in two distinct areas, namely 1) estimation of the overall behavior of inhomogeneous materials containing microscopic misfits, and, 2) evaluation of wave propagation and scattering by inhomogeneous media. These efforts seek to produce highly efficient computational methods for engineering of materials with specified properties, for the solution of problems in optics and microscopy, and for remote sensing problems related to radar and sonar. <br/><br/>Date: June 18, 2001<br/>"

The planned Hyp2002 conference will be the ninth meeting in the bi-annual international series which became one of the highest quality and most successful conference series in Applied mathematics. There have been many new developments in hyperbolic and nonlinear evolution PDEs since the last international hyperbolic PDEs conference was held in the US at Stony Brook in 1994. In the 2002 hyperbolic PDEs conference to be held at CalTech, we would like to bring young and active scientists together with leading researchers from different disciplines to address the theoretical, modeling, and computational issues in solving hyperbolic PDEs and more generally nonlinear evolution equations arising from various application areas. In fact, we would like to broaden further the scope of our next hyperbolic conference to include new and exciting research areas such as multiscale modeling and simulations (deriving and simulating meso-scale or nanoscale material properties in micro devices), geophysical applications (wave propagation in random media, coarsening of multi-phase flows through multiscale porous media), computational biology and computational chemistry, free boundary problems arising from materials science and multi-component fluid dynamics (thin films, crystal growth, multi-fluid interfaces, solid/liquid interfaces). The conference will provide a forum to exchange and to stimulate new ideas from different disciplines, and to formulate new challenging problems that will have important physical and industrial impacts.<br/><br/>Theoretical and numerical studies of hyperbolic problems have made tremendous impact in the developments of US economy and technology. Many high-resolution methods developed in the hyperbolic community have helped design faster airplanes, new materials, and improve our space exploration program. The hyperbolic conference series and its proceedings have become a focal point for active research in a growing field, where theory, numerics and applications complement each other. The earlier conferences were focused more on theoretical aspects of hyperbolic conservation laws. As computers became more and more powerful in the late eighties and the nineties, many effective numerical methods have been developed in simulating hyperbolic systems arising in aerodynamics and fluid dynamics applications. The hyperbolic meetings in this series have been very successful in steering the development of new high-resolution algorithms for solving complex physical systems. Many of these developments found new applications outside their traditional area of Computational Fluid Dynamics, including materials science, multiphase/multicomponent flows, combustion/detonation, flows with free boundary, geometrically based motions for image processing and more. We believe that hosting such a high level conference in the US will greatly benefit the US scientists working in this general area. It is especially helpful in educating our graduate students and postdocs, providing them with the opportunity to be in touch with the leading experts working on the frontier of this field. We will take several measures to attract young scientists. An effort will be made to increase the number of women <br/>"

The project includes derivation and mathematical analysis of models, development of algorithms for the approximation of solutions, implementation of the algorithms as computer codes, comparisons of the output of numerical simulations with field data, the use of the models for prediction and their development as a tool for effective coastal engineering.  The basic issue under consideration is challenging in that it involves the temporal evolution of two free surfaces whose dynamics are connected in a complex and nonlinear way.  The wave motion involves the deformation of the water's  surface, or in the case of internal waves, the pycnoclines.  Even over a fixed bottom, these issues are difficult in their exact formulation, and consequently model equations are typically used.  In the present conception, the bottom is not fixed, and this added complexity is what makes the issues proposed here for study scientifically very interesting.  In view are three-dimensional models that are initiated by incoming wave fields from deep water.   These models will allow for long-shore variation and take account of reflection.  It is planned to develop such models and to test them extensively against both laboratory experiments and field observation.  Comparisons are in view at several sites around the world, including the Field Research Facility of the US Army Corps of Engineers at Duck, NC, a site of the Polish Academy of Sciences on the Baltic Sea, the North Coast of the Magdelan Islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Gold Coast of Australia, the Island of Djerba off the Tunisian coast and two regions in Morocco (Alger in the Gibraltar Strait and Agadir on the Atlantic coast).      <br/><br/>The motivation for carrying out the study outlined above is several-fold.  First is the pure science of the subject.  The project involves interesting and substantial issues from hydrodynamics, partial differential equations, and sediment transport theory.  Secondly, it is an ideal venue in which to acquaint students with interdisciplinary research.  There is a strong practical reason for this study as well.  The erosion and retreat of coastlines is a worldwide phenomenon.  Global warming will increase the activity of storms, raise the sea level, and further degrade the present, sometimes catastrophic state of many beaches.  Fragile Arctic coasts, beaches on the Great lakes and on many coastal regions already display the unmistakable signs of deterioration caused by these global changes and aggravated by social developmental pressure.  Severe erosion is likely to spread to many coastal areas within half a century and thus increase the demand for effective prevention methods.  The present project aims at deepening our understanding of fundamental wave-bottom interaction processes, especially as regards sediment dispersal. Going beyond the science, the project also grapples with the intelligent use of this kind of knowledge in designing coastal protection strategies.  With experience already in hand, it is clear that there are a variety of protection options and that it is not always smart to simply build some permanent, often-ugly structure.  So-called 'soft' protection methods are a useful addition to the reperatoire of the coastal engineer.  These are much less expensive when they can be made to work.   The assessment of the practicality of a protection plan, be it 'hard' or 'soft' relies upon the kind of knowledge investigated under the auspices of this project. <br/><br/>"

The project addresses both modeling of specific FP processes and the study of more general mathematical problems motivated by these modeling efforts. Specific modeling topics <br/>include the study of initiation of FP waves, their linear and nonlinear stability and fluid dynamical behavior. Asymptotic approaches are used to determine the structure of the polymerization wave and the composition of the product, as well as such experimentally measurable characteristics of the wave as its propagation velocity as a function of the kinetic and thermophysical parameters of the problem and the initial conditions. Topics of a more general mathematical nature are concerned with threshold phenomena in reaction diffusion systems, existence of time-periodic traveling waves of monotone parabolic systems, new kinds of integro-differential equations describing polymerization kinetics, and new forms of solutions of reaction diffusion systems, the so-called quasi-traveling wave solutions, the characteristics of which, including the propagation speed, vary slowly in time.<br/><br/>The importance of the proposed studies of frontal polymerization is twofold. First, it is a method to produce polymers which have become an integral part of human life. It bears strong similarities with another technological process occurring in a frontal regime, namely, self-propagating high-temperature synthesis which uses combustion waves to synthesize desired inorganic materials. Unlike the frontal polymerization process, the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis process is well-studied and is known to enjoy certain advantages over conventional technology, in which the mixture is placed in a furnace. These include (i) shorter synthesis times, (ii) less expense, since the internal chemical energy of the reactants is used rather than the external energy of the furnace, (iii) the use of simpler equipment, and (iv) purer products, since the high-temperature wave burns off volatile impurities. Similar benefits can be expected in polymer synthesis. Specifically, energy costs and waste solvent production can be reduced and unique materials obtained. However, before any advantages can be achieved and the frontal polymerization process becomes a competitive technology, a better understanding of the factors that affect frontal polymerization is necessary. Second, studies of specific models of frontal polymerization pose questions of a more general mathematical nature that are related to the behavior of solutions of general reaction/diffusion/convection systems. The study of these more general problems contributes to the understanding of specific frontal polymerization problems.<br/><br/>Date: June 18, 2001<br/>"

This will be accomplished by a combination of various techniques.  One approach will exploit the mathematical structure of fiber transmission models in order to eliminate unessential degrees of freedom.  The reduced models that will result will be more tractable mathematically and also much more computationally efficient.  Another approach that will be used is the application of linearization and importance sampling techniques to enable the simulation of systems at realistic data error rates.  These methods will be combined to study the main sources of impairment in optical fibers in order to achieve an accurate evaluation of system performance.  All the techniques to be developed will be carefully validated by comparison to more computationally time-consuming models and to experiments.  <br/><br/>The development of high-data-rate optical fiber communications is one of the great technological achievements of the late 20th century; in the last decade alone, data rates have increased by four orders of magnitude.  This enormous increase has made possible the growth of the global Internet that promises to continue to revolutionize day-to-day communications.  Because demand for further growth continues unabated, however, system capacity is becoming limited by fiber transmission effects.  It has therefore become crucial to accurately model and calculate the impairments due to non-ideal fiber properties when designing systems.  Due to the tremendous data capacity that will be required of future transmission systems (terabits per second of aggregate capacity) and the need for extremely small transmission error rates (less than one error per trillion bits), realistic attempts to model and predict the effects of these impairments as they appear in practical systems present a number of difficult mathematical and computational challenges.  The techniques that will be developed in this collaborative research project are expected to yield large reductions in the computational time required to model optical communication systems, and at the same time produce new insights into system behavior.  Because these methods will be capable of providing detailed information about system performance at realistic data error rates, we believe they will lead to significant changes in the way in which optical transmission systems are modeled, and, ultimately, in the way that they are built.   <br/>"

The latter problem is an <br/>example of a situation where the contact line (refereed to as the triple <br/>junction in this case) occurs at the intersection of a liquid/liquid/gas <br/>interface.  Even though the contact line occurs in these many areas, our <br/>understanding of it is very limited.

The defining equations result from averages of some primitive equation, such as the Navier-Stokes or Euler equations. Nonlinear terms in the primitive equations lead to new unknowns in the averaged equation and the need for closure relations. These are difficult to determine, or even to measure experimentally. Closure is nonunique, as different closures apply to different flow regimes, and different closures may define competing equations to describe the same flow regime. The different equations may be complementary in that they describe the same situation in differing levels of detail. They also may reflect unresolved differences of scientific opinion. For these multiple reasons, the analysis of the equations is of considerable importance to science. The proposal here is primarily concerned with methods of analysis that delimit or shed light on the closures that are valid descriptions of fluid flow.<br/><br/>Multiphase flow, and more generally the study of turbulence, is one of the major unsolved problems of importance to physics and to engineering. Flow of oil, gas, and water mixtures in a pipeline or in the rocks of a petroleum reservoir provide examples of such flows.  Thermal mixing layers in meteorology leading to formation of thunderstorms provide another example. The formation of salt domes in geological formations, the study of controlled fusion to provide ample energy sources, and the study of late stage supernovae, or stellar explosions are further examples. In all cases, the phenomena is too complex, detailed and varied to be described usefully at a fine level of detail.

Such a study of averages of mixtures, and the appropriate equations is the purpose of this proposal. Because of the importance of the problem, many methods are used for the study of mixtures: experiment, theory and numerical simulation.

Chatter is a self-excited oscillation between the machining tool and the work piece that limits productivity of machining operations, reduces the quality of the product, and shortens machine tool life.  Drilling itself is one of the least well understood machining processes due to the complex geometry of the cutting surface, and simple linear models of drilling have had limited success.  We are developing nonlinear models that incorporate information from finite element models for metal cutting as well as information about vibrational modes of the drill.  The resulting models take the form of delay differential equations.

We will utilize new capabilities in large-scale simulation software and build on previous theoretical work done at Boeing to perform dynamic stability analysis.

Many<br/>of the mathematical results relate to the derivation and<br/>subsequent analysis of subsystems of equations capturing dynamics<br/>on disparate time scales.  One challenge in this endeavor is that<br/>the additional features considered prevent the application of<br/>known methods that could otherwise be used to reduce the<br/>subsystem sizes and thereby facilitate analysis.  The particular<br/>activity patterns that are investigated are sustained, localized<br/>activity of cell populations in the thalamus involved in sleep<br/>rhythms and in tracking head direction; wave propagation, block,<br/>and reflection in inhomogeneous neuronal media such as branching,<br/>thickening, or damaged neurons; and periodic and chaotic<br/>oscillations in a heterogeneous population of respiratory<br/>pacemaker cells in the brain stem.

Thus, the results of this<br/>project yield insight into pattern formation and selection<br/>mechanisms that apply in specific neuronal contexts but that also<br/>constitute more generally occurring phenomena.<br/>     Neuronal networks of the central nervous system can<br/>typically display multiple types of rhythmic activity, ranging<br/>from periodic bursts of synchronized oscillations to traveling<br/>waves of activity to more disorganized patterns.

The presence of the particles affects the flow of the liquid, and this, in turn, affects the motion of the particles, so that the problem of determining the flow characteristics is highly coupled. It is just this latter feature that makes any fundamental mathematical problem related to liquid-particle interaction a particularly challenging one. The goal of this project is to furnish a mathematical analysis of one of the several important and still not completely understood aspects of this fascinating subject, namely, the orientation of homogeneous, symmetric particles sedimenting in Newtonian and viscoelastic liquids. In particular, the PI intends to furnish a quantitative and rigorous explanation of the challenging ""tilt-angle phenomenon"" that is observed in certain viscoelastic liquids, where particles orient themselves at a preferred angle with the main flow. The angle depends on the shape of the particle, their mass and on the physical properties of the liquid. Liquid models such as Oldroyd-B with shear-dependent viscosity will be used, along with some suitable analytical tools (the ""splitting method"") that the PI with his collaborators has been developing over the last few years for the study of well-posedness of several viscoelastic liquid models.<br/><br/>The orientation of homogeneous long bodies in liquids of different nature is a fundamental issue in many problems of practical interest. In composite materials, the addition of short fiber-like particles to a polymer matrix will to enhance the mechanical properties of the material; for instance, it could make the material softer or harder, and more durable. The degree of enhancement depends strongly on the orientation of the fibers and the fiber orientation is in turn caused by the flow occurring in the mold. Another important application occurs in separation of macromolecules by electrophoresis. Modern applications include weight determination of proteins, DNA sequencing, and diagnosis of genetic disease. Electrophoresis involves the motion of charged particles (macromolecules) in solution, under the influence of an electric field. The orientation of the molecules plays an important role, since it is responsible for the loss of separability during steady-field gel electrophoresis. A final, but not less important application of particle orientation, occurs in blood flow, where the blood cells under certain flow conditions tend to chain themselves along the axis of the artery at certain preferred angles (tilt angle). <br/>"

The problem of nonuniform sampling and reconstruction<br/>is treated in the context of shift-invariant subspaces, Besov<br/>spaces, and in arbitrary dimensions.  The theory is developed for<br/>the case when the samples are obtained from weighted averages.<br/>Density conditions for exact reconstruction are established.  When<br/>the data are noisy, incomplete, or when the assumptions needed<br/>for exact reconstruction are not satisfied, bounds on the error<br/>between the reconstructed and original signal are derived in<br/>terms of the sampling densities, the averaging functionals, and<br/>the noise statistics.  The development of the mathematical<br/>framework and the computational schemes requires a new set of<br/>techniques and ideas, and involves several areas of mathematics<br/>including wavelet theory, frame theory, functional analysis, and<br/>harmonic analysis.<br/>     The project is motivated by problems arising in data<br/>transmission, geophysical exploration, astronomy, spectroscopy,<br/>and biomedical imaging.  The problem of reconstructing a signal or<br/>an image from a set of nonuniform samples is encountered in many<br/>applications of signal or image processing.  For example, the loss<br/>of data packets during transmission through internet or from<br/>satellites can be viewed as a nonuniform sampling and<br/>reconstruction problem.  In geophysical exploration, the earth's<br/>magnetic field is measured by a combination of airborn, fast<br/>moving acquisition devices, as well as scattered stationary<br/>devices resulting in highly nonuniform sampling patterns, and a<br/>huge data set.

In fact, modern digital<br/>data processing of signals or images always uses a sampled<br/>version of the original analog signals or images.  However, the<br/>sampling devices are never ideal, and the collected data consist<br/>of average samples.  Moreover these data are often very large,<br/>incomplete, and corrupted by noise.

Therefore the investigator aims to 1) quantify the<br/>conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a signal<br/>exactly from different sets of nonuniform average-samples; 2) use<br/>these analytical results to develop explicit, and computationally<br/>efficient reconstruction schemes; and 3) analyze the performance<br/>of the algorithms under adverse conditions, or when the data are<br/>incomplete or corrupted by noise.  The development of a theory and<br/>algorithms that perform well under stringent and realistic<br/>situations will help the analysis, processing and management of<br/>very large data sets obtained digitally by new acquisition<br/>modalities, and transmitted or received by communication networks<br/>such as the internet, cellular phones, and other distributed<br/>communication systems.<br/><br/>"

First, for communication <br/>networks such as the Internet, packets of data are often lost in transmission <br/>and are retransmitted according to a protocol invisible to the user.  In <br/>many applications, the subsequent delay is unacceptable and best possible <br/>reconstruction from what is initially received is necessary.  Second, it has <br/>been shown that wireless communication systems which employ multiple <br/>antennas can have very high channel capacities.

The answer is that all of these (and a host of other <br/>important questions) are ``theoretically possible''.

The first line is concerned with the gravitational lensing that occurs when a galaxy lies close to the line of sight between us and a much more distant source, such as a quasar.  Electromagnetic waves from the distant source are both bent and slowed down as they pass close to the galaxy.  As a result, the ""gravitational lens"" may produce multiple images of that quasar.  A number of quasars that are multiply imaged by galaxies are now known.  The configuration of those images and their relative magnitudes is determined by the distribution of mass in the intervening galaxy.  The principal investigator has developed methods for calculating the lensing properties of elliptical lenses.  Applied to observational data, these properties can be used to make deductions about the distribution of mass in the lensing galaxy.  He will develop methods that are more powerful and refine them as necessary after testing them on observational data.  The second line of investigation is concerned with the dynamics of the stars, which are the major visible components of galaxies.  Its ultimate aim is to build dynamical models of galaxies, but two preliminary topics are to be studied first.  One is investigation of how central density cusps and central black holes, which are widely believed to be present in many galaxies, influence the orbits of the stars, and to what extent they allow galaxies to be triaxial.  The other is to improvement of a procedure for analyzing orbits and computing their fundamental frequencies and orbital densities.  The two lines of investigation are complementary because both the orbits of the stars in a galaxy, and the gravitational lensing properties of that galaxy, are influenced by all the matter of the galaxy, whether visible or dark. <br/><br/>This project looks at galaxies, the fundamental building blocks of the Universe, from two perspectives.  One is that of gravitational lensing and the other is that of the motions of the stars of the galaxies.  Light rays are bent when they pass close to a massive object such as a galaxy.  Consequently, a galaxy that happens to lie between us and a distant quasar can cause us to see multiple images of that object.  This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing.  It is of much current interest because it provides a tool for investigating the combined effects of the visible and dark matter content of a galaxy, since both contribute to the lensing.  There are a number of instances of galaxies that produce four images of the same distant quasar.  The principal investigator is developing theories for deducing what those image systems, their configurations and their relative strengths, tell us about the arrangement of mass in those galaxies.  That arrangement is critical for the structure of the galaxy.  Galaxies contain swarms of hundreds of billions of stars.  The motions of those stars are governed by the gravitational forces due to all the mass of the galaxy, both visible and dark.  Understanding the motion of stars in galaxies will facilitate understanding the large-scale structure of the universe.<br/>"

They develop implementations of discrete<br/>conformal mapping for multidisciplinary use, both within<br/>mathematics itself where complex analysis is being reinvigorated<br/>by new discrete techniques, and in the larger scientific context<br/>with visualization and analysis of scientific data.  The Riemann<br/>Mapping Theorem guarantees unique conformal maps between any pair<br/>of conformal 2-discs (or conformal 2-spheres); the conformal<br/>geometry preserved by such maps carries valuable mathematical<br/>structure.  Such surfaces arise naturally in many scientific<br/>contexts as piecewise flat (from data) or smoothly embedded (from<br/>theory) surfaces in 3-space.  Recently the new computational<br/>technique of circle packing has allowed computational<br/>approximations to these conformal maps.

The proposed research focuses on (i) applying this recently developed multiscale geometry to refine and improve important continuum descriptions of single crystals undergoing slipping on more than one crystallographic system, (ii) identifying via a relaxation technique from the calculus of variations a geometrical variable that measures the volume swept out by submacroscopic vacancies and understanding the connection between this variable and different types of dislocation movements, and (iii) obtaining relations that complete the system of balance laws and constitutive relations that arise when a continuous body undergoes structured deformations and motions.  This research bears on the fields of materials science and engineering and on the mathematical study of geometry at multiple length and time scales.  <br/><br/>The geometrical changes in a deforming paper clip or other metallic body that appear continuous and smooth to the naked eye often appear to be jerky and abrupt when viewed in a microscope.  Similarly, the smooth stretching of a plastic sandwich bag or other thin plastic film appears differently at macroscopic and submacroscopic scales.  The most successful theories for studying macroscopic changes in a body - paper clip, sandwich bag, or otherwise -- brought about by applied forces or heat sources are called field theories.  The success of field theories rests first on our physical understanding of how a particular substance, e.g., the particular metal comprising the paper clip or the particular plastic constituting the sandwich bag, influences the detailed form of the field theories and, second, on our mathematical understanding of the equations that comprise the field theory.  The research undertaken in this project is part of an ongoing program to enrich these field theories by permitting them to describe and predict the behavior of a body that changes shape differently at macroscopic and submacroscopic length scales.  The desired outcome of this research is refined, improved field theories that permit more accurate simulations of the behavior of technologically important materials.<br/><br/>Date: June 25, 2001<br/>"

Shreve<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Work is proposed in two areas.  The first is the analysis of queueing<br/>systems with deadlines under heavy traffic conditions.  Consider a<br/>queueing system with renewal process arrival streams.  Suppose that<br/>upon arrival, each customer is assigned a lead time, the amount of time<br/>until the customer's deadline for service elapses.  One can model the lead<br/>times of the customers in queue at a station as a counting measure on the<br/>real line, the location of the point masses corresponding to customer lead<br/>times.  Research will address the convergence of these measure-valued<br/>processes under heavy-traffic scaling.  Research will also be directed to<br/>mathematical models for finance.  On such model is for an option on a<br/>traded account.  For the simplest of these, an account trading one<br/>underlying geometric Brownian motion and a constant-interest-rate money<br/>market, there is a strikingly simple optimal rule: hold the geometric<br/>Brownian motion long when the account value is negative and short when<br/>the account value is positive.  For an option on two geometric Brownian<br/>motions, there is a conjectured optimal rule, which is supported by<br/>numerical analysis.  The proof appears to require the development of new<br/>mathematics.  A second mathematical finance problem concerns the<br/>development of a unifying model for risk-neutral pricing of credit<br/>derivatives.<br/><br/>This research has two parts.  The subject of the first part, queueing<br/>systems with deadlines, arise in communication networks, especially<br/>networks used to transmit digitized video or audio signals.  Data which<br/>are too long delayed can cause unacceptable disruption  of the signal.<br/>The proposed research  will provide a basis for performance analysis of<br/>heavily-loaded communication networks which take deadlines into account.<br/>The subject of the second part, mathematical models for finance, builds on<br/>the revolution in finance begun by the Black-Scholes option pricing <br/>formula.  The particular work proposed here  is concerned with proper<br/>pricing and usage of financial instruments whose purpose is to insure<br/>against loss, either due to drastic reduction in market value (options on<br/>a traded account) or default (credit derivatives)."

The PI will utilize both analytical and numerical methods to address a number of challenging questions related to two important problems in domain identification.  The first problem involves the detection and identification of an inhomogeneity inside an otherwise known domain.  The second problem involves determination of an unknown portion of the boundary of a domain.  In each case, information is provided in the form of overly posed boundary values on a portion of the boundary of the domain.  Specific attention will be focused on the development of realistic models for cracks and inclusions inside a thermally conductive body, theoretical and numerical questions related to the inverse problem of crack and inclusion detection from thermal data, the development of stable and reliable algorithms for the determination of an unknown portion of the boundary of a domain from thermal data, and the investigation of a number of issues related to the mathematical modeling of corrosion.<br/><br/>When studying physical objects or processes, many properties cannot be measured directly, either because it is impractical to do so, or because unwanted damage to the object would result.  Well-known examples include the detection of tumors inside the human body, the detection of oil reservoirs or mineral deposits deep underground, and the detection of hidden damage inside an object such as an aircraft wing or fuselage.  The field of inverse problems focuses on determining or estimating these non-measurable properties by measuring other properties, then using a mathematical model (usually a partial differential equation) to connect these measurements to the desired properties.  This project investigates the use of thermal methods to determine properties of the inside of objects without damaging them.  A portion of the outer surface is heated, then the temperature on the surface is measured over a period of time.  The relationship between the measured temperature and the structure of the inside of the object can be modeled mathematically.  This project focuses on the analysis of this mathematical model, and on the development of a practical algorithm which will permit the extraction of information about the interior of the object from these temperature measurements.  This analysis will provide a theoretical foundation to develop stable and reliable algorithms for use in a wide variety of important applications, including the analysis of corrosion damage inside aircraft wings and fuselages, the inspection of newly manufactured objects for interior cracks or voids (quality control), and in medical diagnostics."

The method is based on <br/>expressing the exact Lagrangian fluid flow as a composition of a smooth <br/>deterministic volume-preserving Lagrangian flow and a rough stochastic <br/>flow consisting of volume-preserving near-identity transformations.  This <br/>decomposition is asymptotically expanded about the identity, substituted <br/>into the variational principle, and then averaged.  The resulting <br/>deterministic system of equations is termed the Lagrangian averaged <br/>Navier-Stokes (LANS) equations in the presence of viscosity, and the <br/>Lagrangian averaged Euler (LAE) equations in the ideal case when <br/>viscosity is absent.  Both the LAE and LANS models are parameterized by <br/>a small spatial scale alpha, and are derived in such a fashion as to <br/>accurately reproduce the dynamics of the Euler and Navier-Stokes <br/>equations at spatial scales larger than alpha, while averaging (or <br/>homogenizing) the fluid motion at scales smaller than alpha.  Unlike <br/>current approaches such as Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or <br/>Large Eddie Simulation (LES) models which add artificial dissipation to <br/>the system to remove subgrid scales, the LAE/LANS equations preserve <br/>the underlying structure of the inviscid dynamics, namely, energy, <br/>helicity, and circulation, by instead using a geometric, nonlinear dispersive <br/>mechanism.  As a result, our LANS model, unlike RANS or LES, does not <br/>artificially suppress intermittency, a fundamental feature of fluid <br/>turbulence. The resulting system is a set of dynamically coupled partial <br/>differential equations for the mean velocity field and covariance tensor.  <br/>This system will be the backbone of a massive analytic and computational <br/>assault on the modeling and understanding of fluid turbulence.<br/><br/>Although heavily studied by numerous researchers for over a century, <br/>incompressible fluid turbulence elusively remains one of the last great <br/>challenges of modern scientific exploration.  Its understanding is of <br/>paramount importance in a wide range of engineering and physical <br/>applications, ranging from the design of airplanes and automobiles, to <br/>daily weather forecasts and global climate prediction.  Roughly speaking, <br/>a flow becomes turbulent when all of the spatial scales in the fluid are <br/>activated, or in other words, when the fluid is moving so chaotically, as to <br/>create smaller and ever smaller vortices.  In such a flow regime, the <br/>trajectory of each fluid particle appears unpredictable, yet the challenge is <br/>to derive a mathematical set of equations which can describe this <br/>unpredictable motion.   About 150 years ago, the Navier-Stokes equations <br/>were introduced for this very purpose, and although it is now generally <br/>accepted that these equations do indeed provide a remarkable physical <br/>model of reality, it remains a mathematical mystery as to whether or not <br/>unique solutions to these equations exist for all time.  Moreover, even <br/>numerical approximations of these equations on the world's fastest <br/>supercomputers are incapable of modeling the small-scale structures and <br/>patterns which are formed in a turbulent regime -- the computer simply <br/>runs out of memory long before it can simulate the prohibitively small <br/>vortical motion.  The LANS model, described above, is intended to <br/>alleviate these fundamental difficulties, and make the computational <br/>simulation of turbulent flows feasible.<br/>"

This will be accomplished by a combination of various techniques.  One approach will exploit the mathematical structure of fiber transmission models in order to eliminate unessential degrees of freedom.  The reduced models that will result will be more tractable mathematically and also much more computationally efficient.  Another approach that will be used is the application of linearization and importance sampling techniques to enable the simulation of systems at realistic data error rates.  These methods will be combined to study the main sources of impairment in optical fibers in order to achieve an accurate evaluation of system performance.  All the techniques to be developed will be carefully validated by comparison to more computationally time-consuming models and to experiments.  <br/><br/>The development of high-data-rate optical fiber communications is one of the great technological achievements of the late 20th century; in the last decade alone, data rates have increased by four orders of magnitude.  This enormous increase has made possible the growth of the global Internet that promises to continue to revolutionize day-to-day communications.  Because demand for further growth continues unabated, however, system capacity is becoming limited by fiber transmission effects.  It has therefore become crucial to accurately model and calculate the impairments due to non-ideal fiber properties when designing systems.  Due to the tremendous data capacity that will be required of future transmission systems (terabits per second of aggregate capacity) and the need for extremely small transmission error rates (less than one error per trillion bits), realistic attempts to model and predict the effects of these impairments as they appear in practical systems present a number of difficult mathematical and computational challenges.  The techniques that will be developed in this collaborative research project are expected to yield large reductions in the computational time required to model optical communication systems, and at the same time produce new insights into system behavior.  Because these methods will be capable of providing detailed information about system performance at realistic data error rates, we believe they will lead to significant changes in the way in which optical transmission systems are modeled, and, ultimately, in the way that they are built.   <br/>"

Donald Goldfarb and Garud Iyengar.<br/><br/>Abstract. <br/><br/>Second-order cone programs (SOCPs) are convex optimization <br/>problems in which a linear function is optimized over the <br/>intersection of an affine linear manifold with the Cartesian <br/>product of second-order (Lorentz) cones.  Linear programs (LPs), <br/>convex quadratic programs (QPs),  and quadratically constrained  <br/>convex quadratic programs can all be formulated as SOCPs, as <br/>can many  other problems that do not fall into these three problem <br/>classes. On the other hand, since a second-order cone constraint <br/>is equivalent to a linear matrix inequality, semidefinite <br/>programs (SDPs) include SOCPs as a special case.  Computationally <br/>speaking, an SOCP falls  between an LP or a QP and an SDP. Interior <br/>point methods solve all of these problems in polynomial time. <br/>Although, the  computational effort required to solve an SOCP is <br/>greater than that required to solve an LP or a QP, it is <br/>substantially less than that required to solve an SDP of similar <br/>size and structure. However, in many ways, an SOCP is closer to <br/>an SDP than an LP or QP since its feasible set is non-polyhedral. <br/>The proposed research focuses on several aspects of  SOCPs, <br/>including the development of numerically stable algorithms for <br/>SOCPs that take advantage of sparsity in the data, the study of <br/>SOCP-based approximation algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization <br/>problems, the study of computational aspects of cut generation methods <br/>for mixed 0-1 SOCPs and the applications of SOCPs in robust financial <br/>optimization. <br/><br/>SOCPs are excellent models for applications that arise in a broad range <br/>of fields from  engineering, control, and finance, to robust and <br/>combinatorial optimization. The wide applicability of SOCPs and the <br/>need for efficient, numerically stable algorithms to solve them makes <br/>their study worthwhile.  <br/>"

Within the first theme, the long term goal is to provide a model of internal waves in layered stratification that correctly accounts for dispersion and high nonlinearity, to be used in alternative to the currently adopted non-dispersive and weakly nonlinear models.  The aim is to retain the advantage of the simplicity of these theories with respect to the full Euler (or Navier-Stokes) governing motion equations, while still maintaining the ability to describe wave dynamics of practical interest.  Highly nonlinear regimes often generate instabilities.  The causes and evolution of these instabilities for fully nonlinear internal waves are the focus within the second theme.  In particular, stability criteria based on the Howard-Miles theorem for stationary shear flows and parametric instability occurring at stable Richardson's number will be revisited in the context of internal gravity waves.<br/><br/>This research focuses on an area of wave propagation which has widespread atmospheric and oceanic applications, and, therefore, large societal implications.  For instance, large internal waves generated by wind forcing of the upper ocean may have a strong feedback effect on the intensity of hurricanes.  Thus, numerical codes based on models capable of representing accurately large amplitude waves and their dispersive behavior (responsible for the spreading of wave energy over increasingly larger regions) can play an important role in hurricane forecasts, at little additional cost with respect to the currently employed hydrostatic codes.

Fluid models (deterministic, continuous state and time variables) are considered which describe queuing network configurations motivated by applications in manufacturing, communications and vehicular traffic control.  Optimal control problems are formulated using the general approach of nonlinear robust control, resulting in an appropriate Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation which determines the value function of a dynamic game.  Solutions to this HJI are constructed by methods similar to classical techniques involving (bi)characteristics or a field of extremals.  While this approach is well understood in general, it has had little development in applications to queuing networks.  One reason for this is that the precise mathematical description of queuing systems often involves a Skorokhod problem formulation to account for the changes to systems dynamics when some of the queues become empty.  A major goal of the project is to develop this approach for a variety of examples (e.g. different network structures and cost criteria) in order to discern the mathematical structure of solutions to the HJI, the form of the optimal policies themselves, and how the unique features of the Skorokhod problem formulation can be treated in this approach.  Using the understanding of solutions to the HJI gained through these case studies, numerical methods are developed to analyze larger and more complex examples.  The mathematical tools produced will contribute to the theory of robust control in general, to problems involving Skorokhod dynamics in particular, and will introduce robust control techniques to the area of traffic control.<br/><br/>The flow of ""traffic"" through a network, whether vehicles on a system of intersecting roads, products in a multistage manufacturing process, or ""packets"" of information in an electronic network, is an increasingly important aspect of our commercial and public services infrastructure.  In the familiar example of vehicles on a system of roads the network consists of several intersections connected by roads of various sizes.  The different streams of traffic that meet at an intersection must take turns or share the limited capacity of the intersection.  The efficiency of the network depends on the strategy which controls the traffic streams that are allowed to use the various intersections at each moment of time.  (In the most familiar vehicular setting this simply means the scheme which governs the sequence and timing of traffic lights.)  Now that sensors are available to detect the number of vehicles waiting or traveling on each of the roads in a network, the design intelligent signal light control strategies to manage the network with optimal efficiency is a natural goal.  The same general issue of service allocation strategy is present in manufacturing or communication systems, although the terminology and specific features of the networks are different in those settings.  Traffic and network engineers have developed various ways to study the performance of network service control strategies ""experimentally"" and to adjust those strategies to current network conditions in an adaptive way.  However, with only a few exceptions, past research has not developed systematic tools to identify service control strategies whose performance is optimal in a precise mathematical sense.  This project develops mathematical ideas and tools for this purpose.  The new understanding and mathematical techniques which result should be a valuable contribution to the management and design of high performance networks."

Neurons and circuits there, in the medial superior<br/>olive (MSO), have specialized biophysical properties for<br/>processing and preserving precise timings.  These neurons have<br/>distinctive firing properties.  When a steady stimulus is<br/>presented they fire only once, at stimulus onset; many other<br/>types of neurons would behave tonically, firing throughout the<br/>stimulus presentation.  This property of phasicness is believed<br/>crucial for the MSO cell's role in precise temporal processing.<br/>In contrast, tonic cells are assumed to be less capable of<br/>tracking rapidly changing signals.  The MSO cells have a special<br/>potassium current, IK-LT, that underlies their phasic behavior.<br/>The investigator and his colleagues systematically study how the<br/>temporal processing ability of a neuron changes as the neuron is<br/>transformed from phasic to tonic mode, say by gradually adjusting<br/>the strength of IK-LT (using pharmacological blockers and<br/>electronic methods of re-introducing the blocked current).  When a<br/>cell is in phasic mode does it track a time-varying signal<br/>better, or does it perform better coincidence detection, than<br/>when it is in tonic mode? The research combines both experimental<br/>and theoretical approaches.

This project also explores the<br/>influence of randomness on the temporal processing abilities.<br/>Some randomness is intrinsic to the auditory nervous system, and<br/>it is believed to be functionally important.  Without sources of<br/>variability, these nonlinear neuronal systems tend to phase-lock<br/>too well, impairing a system's ability to perform discrimination<br/>tasks.  The investigator therefore also assesses the effects of<br/>randomness on the temporal processing power of phasic and tonic<br/>cells and on the theoretical models.  This work seeks to test<br/>whether the commonly accepted notion, that phasicness enhances<br/>temporal processing power, passes a set of quantitative criteria<br/>and, if so, to develop a theoretical foundation that supports the<br/>notion and that extends to other neural and possibly some<br/>chemical and physical systems as well.  A related subproject is to<br/>develop computational models that help explain the dynamic<br/>effects seen experimentally as interaural phase (or amplitude or<br/>frequency) is varied dynamically.  A deeper understanding of some<br/>surprising effects, as seen in the auditory mid-brain, should<br/>contribute to developing a theory for how motion of sound sources<br/>is analyzed in the brain.<br/>     It is believed that some neural computations involve<br/>cellular and circuit properties that enable encoding and decoding<br/>based on precise timing of action potentials.  Sound localization<br/>in the auditory system offers a compelling example.  It serves as<br/>the case study for this research, that seeks a more qualitative<br/>characterization of cellular properties that correlate with<br/>precise temporal processing.  Many cells in the auditory brain<br/>stem contribute to the system's ability to detect coincidence of<br/>interaural signals.  These neurons have distinctive firing<br/>properties.  When a steady stimulus is presented they fire only<br/>once, at stimulus onset, while neurons of many other types will<br/>continue to fire until the stimulus is turned off.  This property<br/>of phasicness is believed crucial for precise temporal<br/>processing.  In contrast, tonic cells are assumed to be less<br/>capable of tracking rapidly changing signals.  The biophysical<br/>basis, a special potassium current, IK-LT, appears to underlie<br/>phasicness in the brain stem neurons.

Although there exist proposed solutions of idealized (and unrealistic) spin glass models, the principal investigators' interests center on answering fundamental statistical mechanical questions that bear on the behavior of real laboratory spin glasses.  These questions, many of which remain controversial despite two decades of intensive study, include the nature of ordering in the equilibrium spin glass phase, understanding anomalous behavior, such as slow relaxation and aging arising from nonequilibrium dynamics, and proving the presence or absence of a phase transition in finite dimensions.  The methods used and concepts introduced should be relevant not only for spin glasses but also for other disordered systems, many of which remain poorly understood.  Moreover, the generality of the principal investigators' approach to dynamics should yield progress in certain aspects of nonequilibrium dynamics in both homogeneous and disordered systems.<br/><br/>Our deep physical and mathematical understanding of ordered systems in the solid and liquid state --- for example, crystals, ferromagnets, superconductors, liquid crystals, and many others --- has been both of fundamental scientific importance and has spurred profound technological change throughout the second half of the last century.  However, there exist many systems, both familiar and unfamiliar, in which randomness or disorder plays a key role, and in which our mathematical and physical understanding remains comparatively primitive.  One familiar example is ordinary window glass, where the atoms or molecules are ""stuck"" in random locations (as opposed to a regular crystalline array as would be found, for example, in ice).  Spin glasses are disordered magnetic systems which are thought to be prototypes for this kind of macroscopic ""frozen-in"" disorder. Disordered systems in general present both fundamental scientific challenges and at the same time hold great promise for applications.  The latter includes not only the possibility of new materials and devices but also the creation of new algorithms and applications to the biological and other sciences.  Progress in understanding these systems is therefore greatly desirable.  Spin glasses may be more amenable to mathematical analysis than other materials in this class.  Nevertheless, little fundamental progress has been made even here.  The principal investigators' work is aimed at resolving basic mathematical and physical issues concerning these materials and at providing a general theoretical approach for a wide variety of disordered systems.<br/><br/>"

In particular, the investigator<br/>would like to understand if there are any fundamental<br/>relationships upon which a framework for this theory can be<br/>developed.  Therefore, to minimize extraneous effects the<br/>investigator continues to study what is perhaps the simplest<br/>continuous model that explicitly incorporates a spatial variable:<br/>a system of reaction diffusion equations with Lotka-Volterra<br/>reaction terms, where the reaction term of each species is<br/>identical, and where the birth rate is spatially and temporally<br/>heterogeneous.  This model allows for a variety of perturbations<br/>through which one can study the impact of various factors in the<br/>evolution of dispersal rates.  Of course, this model has several<br/>limitations.  The first is the assumption that leads to the<br/>dispersal being represented as simple diffusion.  The investigator<br/>wishes to understand the effects of taxis on the relationship<br/>between dispersal rates and spatial heterogeneity.  On a more<br/>general level the investigator intends to replace diffusion by an<br/>integral kernel.<br/>     That ecology and evolution are fundamentally influenced by<br/>the spatial characteristics of the environment is well accepted.<br/>As an example of this one may consider the paradox of diversity.<br/>Simple mathematical models that do not include any spatial<br/>component give rise to the principle of competitive exclusion:<br/>when two species compete for the same limited resource one of the<br/>species usually becomes extinct.  On the other hand it is commonly<br/>observed that in a wide variety of habitats a multitude of<br/>species coexist.  This can be explained, at least in part, by<br/>including spatial effects.  Of course, once spatial components are<br/>introduced, dispersal rates become a central feature.<br/>Unfortunately, our understanding of cause and effect in this more<br/>general situation is poor.  The reasons for this appears to be<br/>fourfold.  First, the number of variables in realistic ecological<br/>and environmental models is enormous.  Second, spatial<br/>heterogeneities occur at all scales of the environment.  Third,<br/>obtaining precise data for these variables from field studies is<br/>extremely difficult.  Finally, current mathematical techniques for<br/>handling models that incorporate both spatial and dynamical<br/>properties seem to be inadequate.

Particular attention is focused on the investigation of how stability properties are preserved by finite dimensional semidiscrete approximation schemes and how stability properties are affected by disturbances or by system parameters.  The PI studies most issues by making use of an appropriate renorming of the underlying state space.  The idea of the renorming method is that while every mathematical model is associated with a natural norm (which measures an important quantity in the model, such as energy), it is often the case that a judicious choice of a new norm can be especially useful for insight into a specific issue such as exponential stability.  Frequently a new norm also allows construction of improved Galerkin approximation schemes.  For linear models, the PI considers applications including hybrid systems (i.e. coupled dynamics, such as models of thermoelasticity) and systems of delay equations, as well as questions such as the implications of renorming in feedback control problems.  For nonlinear models, the renorming is an issue for investigation at the stages of linearization and approximation. <br/><br/>Today's scientists and engineers are using increasingly complex and sophisticated mathematical models, and they often require quite accurate answers to difficult and delicate questions.  A particularly important issue for many models, and the main focus of this project, is exponential stability.  Typical of questions related to exponential stability would be - do vibrations of a mechanical structure (robot arm, smart material actuator, satellite antenna, digital reading device, ...) dissipate and at what rate; does the flow of a fluid (around a wing or rudder, in a mixing process, ...) stay smooth or become turbulent; do computer simulations preserve the stability behavior of the original model; etc.  These and other issues will be investigated using a mathematical method known as renorming, which also often leads to the construction of improved computer simulation methods (approximation schemes).  Undergraduate students will be actively involved in some lines of research, giving them an exposure to topical and scientifically relevant mathematical models, training in the use of the latest scientific computing algorithms and software, and an appreciation of applied mathematics."

There are three major issues based on this approach that will be investigated.  One concerns the exploration of the convexity properties of G-closures with the goal of developing new numerical approximations to the elusive set. This approach may lead to the new analytic results in several basic cases, where the G-closure is still not known.  The second issue is to make use of the new formula for effective tensors in terms of the W-transformation of Milton for studying effective behavior of the random media. That formula provides a new series expansion for the fields and effective tensors of the random composites. The new expansion is shown to converge rapidly even for a relatively high contrast media. Finally, we will develop a new and exciting idea of space-time composites proposed recently by Lurie.  The space time composites refer to composites whose electromagnetic properties change rapidly in time.  These temporal oscillations may be a result of high frequency vibrations of the composite specimen or of an active nature of the material itself. <br/><br/>This project's research is centered on the investigation of properties of complex and smart materials.  Examples of such materials include composites (used in spacecraft, airplanes, cars, skies, golf clubs, etc.), random media like rock, clay or bone, novel active materials that are used in sensors and actuators.  This grant provides funding for a variety of research and educational activities that includes a small elasticity demonstration lab. The main purpose of the lab will be to heighten students' interest in mathematics through the inclusion of experiments and demonstrations.  The lab will also facilitate involvement of undergraduates in mathematical research and interdisciplinary interaction throughout the College of Science and Technology at Temple University. The grant will also support a multi-prong applied research program unified by the common mathematical tools used in this research.  One of the goals of this project is the prediction of properties of composite materials. Success in this direction may make it possible to reduce or eliminate expensive and time-consuming measurements of elastic properties of composite materials by providing good theoretical predictions.  Another application is to the study of high-contrast disordered media, of interest in hydrology for prediction of the permeability of large volumes of sedimentary rock based on local measurements.  The permeability is a crucial property of soil that determines how ground water, oil or pollutants propagate underground.  Yet another application is to the novel field of space-time composites: composite materials whose components are in rapid relative motion or whose components have the ability to change their properties rapidly in time without mechanical motion.  The success of this part of the project will be essential for designing and understanding the new generation of smart materials that are able to respond quickly to a changing environment. <br/>"

Analysis of behavior near the origin gives rise to interesting open problems in elliptic partial differential equations, including nonlinear free boundary value problems, degenerate oblique boundary problems, and quasilinear degenerate elliptic systems.  Such problems arise in many different combinations in the study of two-dimensional Riemann problems, including those for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics.

Theme 2 focuses on a new <br/>construction approach of interpolatory multiresolution analysis (I-MRA).  <br/>The key observation is that an interpolatory sequence can be defined by <br/>sampled reproducing kernel function of a subspace V of an MRA.   It is <br/>expected that such an interpolatory sequence can easily form a basis or <br/>frame of V, giving rise to an interpolatory ""interface"" to the MRA, and a <br/>construction methodology of I-MRA.  Theme 3 studies applications of <br/>PFFSs in the Sinc-type methods for interpolations and quadratures.  The <br/>motivation is to explore the advantage of fast decaying properties of <br/>PFFSs in the Sinc-type applications.  In theme 4, the P.I. expects to apply <br/>similar interpolation techniques as described in theme 2 to study multi-<br/>band samplings using frames and/or PFFSs as fundamental tools. The <br/>technique of PFFSs with their flexibility is expected to play a role.<br/><br/>Each research topic is highly motivated by its applications in data/image <br/>compression, sampling and interpolation for efficient numerical <br/>implementations.  PFFS is a tool to study a subspace V while ""standing"" <br/>outside of it.  In doing so, one is given the freedom and additional ""room"" <br/>to perform tasks in V by using advanced tools not available in V.  In <br/>signal/image processing, such advanced properties of PFFS are extremely <br/>useful because it is known that biorthogonal wavelets of finite length with <br/>symmetry are desirable for reducing ``blocking'' and ``ringing'' effects, and <br/>yet such biorthogonal wavelets do not reside in its dual wavelet subspace. <br/>We believe that PFFS shall not only provide a class of biorthogonal <br/>wavelet examples, the additional information (known from the <br/>construction) contributed by PFFS will provide practical insight about <br/>""blocking"" and ""ringing"" artifacts, and thereby delivers new solutions and <br/>enhanced signal/image compression rate and communication speed.   <br/>Other applications of PFFSs in irregular sampling (for multi-band <br/>functions) as well as in the Sinc-type methods (for interpolation and <br/>quadratures) are all based on applying flexible properties of PFFSs.  The <br/>expectations include enhanced practical efficiency and improved rate of <br/>convergence.   The project on interpolatory multiresolution analysis has <br/>practical applications in data acquisition/sampling while simultaneously <br/>performing the wavelet transform.  One of the key ingredients of the study <br/>is to build an interpolatory ""interface"" to a given MRA and still keep the <br/>underlying desirable wavelet properties.<br/>"

Optimization usually takes place in the presence of equality and inequality constraints. Differential algebraic equations (DAEs) are implicit systems of differential equations. Usually it is also assumed that the Jacobian with respect to the highest derivative is singular. An integer quantity called the index is one measure of how different a DAE is from being an explicit ordinary differential equation. Many problems are most naturally initially modeled as a DAE particularly those that are analyzed and simulated using computer generated mathematical models. DAEs occur in optimization because the original problem is a DAE, because of the activation of constraints, and when partial differential equations are numerically solved using the method of lines. Many problems also involve delays either because delays are inherently present in the process or because of delays in control or feedback loops. Direct transcription methods are a popular approach for the solution of optimal control problems. Recently it has been shown that the usual theory of DAE integrators needs to be substantially modified when DAEs occur during the numerical solution by direct transcription methods of inequality constrained optimal control problems. The primary focus of this proposal is the numerical solution of inequality constrained optimal control problems including those with delays using direct transcription methods. Theory will be developed, the theory will be applied to numerical algorithms and their implementation in production codes, and the algorithms will be applied to a number of applications. The interaction between optimization, delays, direct transcription, numerical discretizations, and state inequality and equality constraints is far from fully understood. This proposal will carefully examine this interaction. In addition, more general DAE simulation algorithms will be developed.<br/><br/>  Designing controls and process behavior which are optimal in some sense is fundamental to designing efficient and effective processes. The optimization can include minimizing energy consumption, producing a part in minimum time, maximizing part quality or maximizing product production. In general, the availability of robust DAE simulation, analysis, and optimization software will result in more accurate models and predictions of performance, which in turn translates to more efficient processes and their more efficient operation resulting in better performance. The particular theoretical and computational questions to be examined are motivated by, and will be applied to, applications arising at the Boeing Corporation. The specific applications each of which may have delays, are real time control, chemical processes, and aerospace vehicles. However, the results will be publicly distributed and will find use in a variety of software packages and in a number of similar applications that affect a wide range of industries. High performance and efficient use of complex processes is a basic need in modern engineering and science. The training of young scientists in the areas of this project and the establishment of both industrial and international aspects to their research will be a significant contribution of this research project for years to come. <br/>"

In this class of models, the dynamics of the macromolecules is described by two independent Gaussian stochastic processes, one based in network theory and the other in reptation theory for concentrated polymer solutions and polymer melts, while the expression for the stress tensor is given as the expectation of a function of these dynamics. Previous work of the PI has established the good performance of this model in predicting some material functions of several polymer melts in rheometric flows. In this work, the ability of the model to describe quantitatively the behavior of polymeric liquids in engineering flow fields is evaluated. This is achieved by developing a micro-macro simulation program and solving a flow problem in an engineering geometry. In the micro-macro simulation approach, the coarse-grained molecular model is coupled to the conservation equations from continuum mechanics. The system is then solved by iterating the following two steps: (1) The polymer stress field is computed from a known discrete velocity field using stochastic simulation techniques, and (2) Updated velocity and pressure fields are found using the finite element method to solve the conservation equations, where the polymer stress from the first step enters the momentum equation as a known body force. The model is further developed by modifying its dynamics as represented by the stochastic processes. Examples of modifications are the inclusion of terms to account for nonaffine deformation of the configuration vectors and the introduction of noise into the time evolution of the stochastic processes.  <br/><br/>Polymeric fluids have a complex microstructure formed by their molecules which gives them both viscous and elastic properties. Among the unresolved challenges in viscoelastic fluid mechanics and the related fields of rheology, materials science and polymer physics are the development of accurate rheological, or stress, models for viscoelastic fluids and the development of good numerical simulation techniques for solving flow problems in engineering applications. This research project aims to advance both of these developments. Such developments are needed for understanding the physics of these complex fluids and for establishing the relevant connections between an engineering flow process and the material behavior and microstructure of the fluid being processed. It is known that the quality and efficiency of an engineering processing procedure and the properties of the processed material are affected strongly by the stresses experienced by the fluid during processing. Since the stress experienced by a polymeric fluid during processing is determined by the flow-induced microstructure within the fluid, it is desirable that stress models for such fluids take microstructure into account. The goal of this research is the analysis and further development of a class of microscopic-based models for polymeric fluids previously introduced by the PI. Toward this goal, a micro-macro simulation program is developed which combines the microscopic-based description of the molecules' dynamics and related stress with a macroscopic description of the flow field. This program is then used to analyze the model in an engineering flow process. The model is also further developed through the inclusion of additional physics by modifying its dynamics. <br/>"

The conference will focus on four overlapping <br/>themes: i) Mathematical Methods for Multiscale Problems, ii) Industrial <br/>Mathematics, iii) Mathematical and Computational Biology, and iv) <br/>Material Science. Multiscaled models are found in a wide range of <br/>applications and pose difficulties for both mathematical and numerical <br/>analysis. What is, for instance, the effect of the fine scale behavior on the <br/>solutions? How well should the fine scales be resolved to obtain accurate <br/>information? etc.  The problems to be discussed in Industrial Mathematics <br/>come from areas such as microelectronic, chemical manufacturing and <br/>material processing, and will focus on the process of technology transfer. <br/>The extreme complexity of the problems studied in Mathematical Biology <br/>precludes a traditional ""pencil and paper"" approach and calls rather for an <br/>integrated approach between mathematical modeling and computer <br/>analyses. This trend has been accelerated by the development of <br/>productive partnerships between experimentalists, theoreticians and <br/>mathematicians with similar interests but very different areas of expertise. <br/>Successful examples will be discussed. The study of emerging <br/>applications in the Material Sciences such as granular flows, thin films or <br/>smart materials has led to the discovery of new kind of instabilities and <br/>interface propagation problems. This session will aim at facilitating the <br/>migration of the most successful analysis and computational techniques <br/>from specific areas of Material Science to other problems.<br/><br/>The conference aims at accomplishing three main goals: Interaction, <br/>Showcase, and New Activities. Interaction: The conference will provide a <br/>forum and gathering place for applied mathematicians in the Southeast. It <br/>will reach out to several groups that are underrepresented in traditional <br/>meetings. First, many successful collaborations have been established <br/>between applied mathematicians and scientists from local companies and <br/>governmental laboratories in technological parks such as Research <br/>Triangle Park, NC. Several industrial partners have been invited to give <br/>presentations. Second, there are emerging centers of excellence within the <br/>many local colleges and historically black institutions. Speakers and <br/>students from such institution have been invited to contribute to the <br/>success of the conference. Showcase: The high level of activity in Applied <br/>and Industrial Mathematics is not always accurately represented through <br/>the usual channels of communication. Indeed, by its very nature, a sizable <br/>part of the work done in Industrial Mathematics gets to be published in <br/>specialized engineering type journals, reaching only a small portion of the <br/>Applied Mathematics community.

Special <br/>care has been taken to provide younger scientists and graduate students <br/>with the opportunity to present their work and take an active part in the <br/>conference. New activities: The audience is expected to span a whole <br/>spectrum of expertise, experience and background, from recognized <br/>researchers in academia to engineers from the private sector and national <br/>research laboratories to students and people with limited research <br/>experience in Applied Mathematics.

Thus, for example, solutions for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws will develop generic singularities in finite time, whereas the existence of balancing forces in other time-dependent problems, e.g., the 2-D incompressible Euler equations, retain global smoothness for all time. This project proposes to analyze those borderline cases, where the persistence of features such as smoothness and finite-time breakdown vs. time decay etc., does not fall into any one particular category. Instead, global features depend on crossing critical threshold associated with the intrinsic configurations of our problems. The presence of various forcing mechanisms in nonlinear convection-dominated PDEs changes the physical situation, and is responsible for the complexity of the underlying problem. Our proposed research falls into four major sub-categories, all tied to the central issue of critical threshold phenomena in nonlinear balance laws: (i) The question of global smoothness/finite-time breakdown for Euler-Poisson equations. We also plan to study the critical threshold phenomena for solutions of Euler-Poisson equations, its relation to semi-classical limits of nonlinear Schrodinger equations and to augment these studies by high-resolution numerical simulations; (ii) Lack of L2-concentrations (-- and hence global existence) of weak solution for Euler equations, depending on the initial configuration in appropriate borderline regularity spaces; (iii) Questions of global vs. local existence for restricted Euler and Navier-Stokes dynamics; and finally, (iv) The issue of crossing the critical sub-characteristic threshold condition in hyperbolic relaxation problems, where there is a balance between different orders of nonlinear convective waves.<br/><br/>The breakdown of waves on the beach is a familiar phenomenon. This breakdown phenomenon depends on whether the waves accumulate sufficient strength, height etc. and in general, they depend on whether the initial configuration crosses intrinsic critical thresholds which distinguish between finite time breakdown and long term persistence of the smooth wave patterns. The goal of this project is to study a variety of critical threshold phenomena in problems governed by time-dependent problems. While many such problems develop finite-time singularities and other problems retain global smooth solutions, we focus on borderline cases, where intrinsic features of the solutions like smoothness vs. generic finite time breakdown, boundedness, time decay, etc, hinge on the delicate balance between the nonlinear convection and the (possibly nonlinear) forcing terms. In particular, the persistence of such global features does not fall to any particular category, but instead, these features depend on crossing critical threshold associated with the general configurations of our problems, very much like the conditional breakdown of waves on the beach. These are precisely the kind of problems that are of great research interest in various applications. The critical threshold phenomenon in nonlinear balance laws is not well understood, and the available techniques to study such phenomena need to be further investigated. In this context, there are many issues to be clarified, inter connections to be analyzed -- even in simplified settings, and general understanding of the critical threshold phenomena in realistic situations is sought in terms of both analytical and numerical studies. Professors E. Tadmor and H. Liu will continue their ongoing cooperative and individual research on the critical threshold phenomena in the context of Euler-Poisson equations, incompressible Euler equations, long time existence and finite time breakdown of restricted Euler and Navier-Stokes dynamics, and hyperbolic relaxation systems. <br/>"

The simulation technique and coarse-grained model discussed in this proposal are based on kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) simulations, which are an established method of simulating crystal growth on an atom-by-atom basis. While believed to be faithful to the micro-scale physics, KMC simulations are extremely slow and there is a recognized need for models appropriate for larger length and time scales.  The first of the two approaches discussed in this proposal is a new simulation technique referred to as an Atomistic Difference Scheme. In this method, one assumes that the distribution of atoms on the surface of the film is in near equilibrium and can be computed by time-stepping difference equations derived directly from the KMC transition probabilities. The topography of the crystal, on the other hand, is assumed to evolve on a slower time-scale and is computed on a discrete basis that conserves mass.  The second approach seeks a homogenized, continuum version of this micro-scale model.  The continuum model takes the form of partial differential equations that describe the system's evolution on macroscopic length and time scales.  A final component of this investigation considers the application of these two methods to a continuous processing configuration where substrate (a tape) is continuously passed through a deposition zone. The continuously moving contact-line and its stability are of particular interest.<br/><br/>Epitaxial films are of vital technological importance in the semi-conductor industry.  As applications for high-temperature super-conductors (HTSC) develop, epitaxial films hold still further promise, with extensive efforts under way to produce HTSC wires and tapes that have enormous current-carrying capacities.  At the same time, the film growth process is a burgeoning source of inspiration for applied mathematicians, requiring a wide range of mathematical techniques and simulation tools to explore the behavior of these systems over an enormous range of length scales.  In particular, the research undertaken in this proposal seeks to enhance our ability understand and control the nano-scale structure of materials, placing a special emphasis on linking atomic-scale models with traditional modeling approaches.<br/><br/><br/>Date: June 22, 2001<br/>"

That is, <br/>the control policies can be adjusted continuously and <br/>instantaneously, or the state processes can be stopped arbitrarily <br/>within some time interval.  However, this assumption is often <br/>violated in practice. The first part of the project is concerned<br/>with some new formulations for stochastic optimization problems <br/>in order to accommodate these practical constraints. These models <br/>share a common feature: random intervention times determined by <br/>exogenous signal processes. In the context of optimal control, <br/>the decision maker is allowed to adjust the level of control <br/>only at times when an exogenous process gives him a green light; <br/>for example, when an Poisson process makes a jump. In the area of <br/>optimal stopping, the state process is allowed to be stopped only <br/>at times when it receives certain signals from an exogenous process.  <br/>Both formulations admit explicit solutions and can be applied to <br/>model practical constraints on control policies or stopping times. <br/>The second part of the project is concerned with a class of diffusion <br/>processes with jumps. The major effort is put on their applications <br/>to economics and finance.  The reason for the introduction of such <br/>processes is that the classical diffusion model for stock prices <br/>cannot explain many empirical puzzles. For example, an abnormality <br/>called volatility smile is often observed in option pricing, and the <br/>return distributions of financial assets exhibit a leptokurtic feature. <br/>We intend to explain these phenomena, using the jump processes to model <br/>stock prices in a financial market or the values of economic projects <br/>in investment problems. The discontinuous behavior in the underlying <br/>processes requires new techniques to obtain explicit solutions to <br/>certain pricing and wealth optimization problems.  The research project <br/>includes pricing commonly traded exotic options, analysis of utility<br/>maximization, and evaluation of investment projects.<br/><br/>Stochastic optimization is one of the main topics in modern applied <br/>mathematics, with many applications in disciplines like engineering, <br/>biology, economics and finance, etc. The purpose of this research <br/>project is to systematically develop mathematical theories that are <br/>more faithful to real life problems, so that the conclusions drawn <br/>from them can be used with more confidence. For example, a better <br/>understanding for the uncertainty of stock prices can help agents <br/>reduce the risk in financial practice. However, in developing more <br/>realistic models, one must be aware of the subtle balance between <br/>complexity and mathematical tractability. A realistic yet too <br/>complicated model can be mathematically untractable. The goal of <br/>the project, therefore, is to develop analytically or numerically <br/>solvable models that embrace the essence of the practical problems. <br/>To this end, some new formulations are considered for general <br/>stochastic optimization problems in order to accommodate some <br/>practical constraints; for example, the controller can intervene <br/>the system only at times when an exogenous process sends out a <br/>certain signal.  Also considered are some new models for <br/>economics and finance that incorporate the drastic changes of <br/>stock prices over short periods of time. These new models can be <br/>used to explain many empirical puzzles that the classical models <br/>fail to do, and to help agents develop better portfolios to reduce risk.<br/><br/>"

There are many shortcomings in these models that make them unrealistic and ad hoc. The main objective of our proposal is to use a third approach based on certain forms of nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS) for two closely related purposes: to provide microscopically realistic parameters for HVBK theory and the classical theory of vortex filaments and to elucidate superfluid turbulence using new variants of the NLS that are more faithful to real helium II. More specifically we plan: (1) use NLS equations to study the process of vortex line reconnection in sufficient detail to characterize quantitatively the accompanying radiation of sound and Kelvin waves. The results will allow us to define reconnection rules that could be used when classical theory is applied to superfluid turbulence. (2) Use NLS theory to simulate superfluid turbulence in the low temperature regime to study the transition between weak and strong turbulence states in the superfluid. (3) Analyze dissipative NLS models that include damping from the mutual friction between superfluid and normal fluid. (4) Study and classify attractors, bifurcation sequences, and routes to chaos in solutions of forced and dissipative NLS equations. Our main goal is, however, to elucidate superfluid turbulence in the low temperature regime in which experiments are currently in the planning stage. <br/><br/> Superfluid turbulence has been studied experimentally for many years and has by now become a major branch of cryogenic physics. In addition to the intrinsic intellectual challenges of the subject, there are several reasons for this. Helium is used as a coolant for superconducting magnets and for infrared detectors, to name just two of several engineering applications. The flow commonly becomes turbulent in these contexts. The subject also has implications beyond the field of helium research, such as in the study of high temperature superconductivity, systems of magnetic spins, melting transitions of crystals, and the origin of glitches in neutron star rotations. Superfluid turbulence may also provide insights into classical fluid turbulence, especially at high Reynolds numbers, where the vorticity has an intermittent, fractal character.  <br/>"

The equations to be studied include both dissipative and Hamiltonian systems.  As an example of the former, Professor Wayne will study the long-time behavior of the Navier-Stokes equations in the neighborhood of vortex solutions.  He will construct finite dimensional invariant manifolds in the phase space of these equations and use them to study both the long-time asymptotics of solutions of the equations and the existence of vortex solutions for which no explicit formulas exist.  In related work he will derive and rigorously justify approximate equations for the motion of waves on the surface of a fluid, studying in particular the interaction of colliding waves.  In addition, by using ideas first developed to study finite dimensional, nearly integrable, Hamiltonian systems, he will investigate the validity of commonly used beam and plate models for motion of elastic materials in thin domains.  Finally, in collaboration with a mathematical biologist at Brown University, Professor Wayne will study the existence and stability of pulses in models of neural tissue. <br/><br/>The systems under study arise in many applications, including materials science, fluid mechanics, and biology.  Even though it is impossible to solve the equations that govern their motion explicitly, applications require at least a qualitative understanding of the behavior of their solutions.  For instance, the equations that describe vibrations of elastic materials are so complicated that their solution remains very time consuming, even with modern computational tools.  Consequently, engineers have derived many approximate models for the behavior of such systems, particularly in situations where one dimension of the system is much smaller than others, as is the case for beams and plates.  Very little is known rigorously, however, about how well these models actually mimic the true behavior of the beam or plate.  This research aims both to provide accurate estimates of the errors that occur in using such models and to develop an algorithm that permits one to systematically improve the models.  In a similar vein, Professor Wayne will also investigate models for waves on the ocean.  Recently it has been realized that the wake of high-speed ferries can produce solitary waves of sufficient magnitude to cause significant damage at the shore.  The mechanism by which these waves are created in the wake is not yet understood.  Understanding the relationship between the solitary waves of the model problem and the solutions of the actual water wave problem may shed light on the creation and propagation of this type of wake.   <br/>"

One class <br/>of problems concerns the deformation and breakup via tip streaming of <br/>drops and bubbles in extensional flows.  Tip streaming refers to the <br/>phenomenon where a bubble develops a deformed shape featuring <br/>cusplike ends, from which fine filaments or small bubbles are emitted into <br/>the exterior fluid.

The PI shall continue his development of an analytical theory <br/>for the deformation and evolution of slender bubbles with surfactant, <br/>focusing on the effects of soluble surfactant and its influence in tip <br/>streaming. Mathematical difficulties in the analysis are associated with a <br/>jump in boundary conditions at ""stagnant caps"" of surfactant on the free <br/>surface.  Techniques employed to address these difficulties include <br/>singular perturbation theory, theory of singular integral equations and <br/>Riemann-Hilbert problems, and complex variable theory in moving <br/>boundary problems.

There are three main <br/>areas of research.  The first is analysis of regularity <br/>and shock formation in initial value problems for weak <br/>solutions of the Einstein equations.  The second area is <br/>development of shock-matching methods with application to <br/>blast waves in general relativity.  The third area is <br/>investigation of oscillations in systems of conservation <br/>laws, with particular emphasis on analyzing oscillations <br/>that are generated in transonic flow.  As part of the <br/>project, we combine Glimm's theory of wave interactions <br/>with the theory of general relativity to analyze shock <br/>wave interactions for Einstein's equations.  Since the <br/>Einstein equations contain the compressible Euler <br/>equations as a subsystem, results on shock wave <br/>propagation in general relativity are expected to have <br/>new implications for analysis of shock waves in classical <br/>fluids.<br/><br/>We are developing a theory of shock wave propagation in <br/>Einstein's theory of general relativity. A shock wave is <br/>best known as the blast wave that marks the leading edge <br/>of an explosion.  In that case, the shock wave is the <br/>surface between the rapidly expanding material and the <br/>ambient, undisturbed air into which the shock front <br/>propagates. In general relativity, shock waves are waves <br/>in the curvature of spacetime itself. There are thus new <br/>and interesting fundamental issues involved in extending <br/>Einstein's equations to a setting that admits shock wave <br/>propagation.  As part of the project, we are constructing <br/>new exact solutions of Einstein's equations that <br/>incorporate a blast wave into the Big Bang -- the <br/>explosion that first set the universe into expansion.  <br/>The mathematical results will also have application to <br/>shock waves in ordinary fluids.<br/>"

Problems to be studied include equations arising in physical applications that at some critical value of a parameter are either ill-posed in the real domain or are structurally unstable. The methods enable control over sensitive dependence close to a critical point in the parameter space. <br/><br/>Many phenomena in nature are modeled by equations that depend sensitively on parameters. Such equations arise in descriptions of fluid mechanics, crystal growth and pattern formation. The underlying sensitivity can make such problems difficult to tackle using computer simulations. It is important to develop theoretical tools based on mathematical analysis to allow precise understanding of such phenomena, and our research is geared towards this goal."

In particular, the Principal Investigator will study (1) multiphase Whitham equations in one spatial dimension, and (2) Whitham equations in several spatial dimensions. The primary interest of the first project is in the interaction of single-phase oscillations and generation and propagation of double and higher phase oscillations. The basic goal of the second project is to understand how the zero phase Whitham solution develops singularities in several dimensional space. The proposed methods will be both analytical and computational. <br/><br/>Results of this project will have broad impact in interdisciplinary work. The multiphase Whitham equations in one spatial variable play an essential role in both zero dispersion limit and modulation theories of nonlinear dispersive oscillations. They also have applications in the transmission of pulses in optical fibers. The Whitham equations in several spatial dimensions are intrinsically connected to Landau-Ginzburg models in topological field theory and the Seiberg-Witten solution in supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory."
