Establishing some corresponding results on <br/>these  spaces  with the idea of better understanding the <br/>approximation potential of positive definite functions and their applications is of special interest to us. In addition, we wish to address some of the <br/>inadequacies of radial basis function (RBF) approximation applicable to all <br/>manifolds; namely, the limitations of the ""native space"" theory for RBF's in <br/>terms of convergence of interpolants,  and questions concerning the ability of <br/>globally supported RBF's to approximate locally. In addition, the proposer <br/>wishes to investigate certain questions about constrained approximation.<br/><br/>A major goal of our proposed research is to develop better methods to both <br/>represent and analyze data obtained from scattered sites located either in  <br/>space or from sphere-like objects. For example, imagine temperature readings <br/>obtained at scattered sites over a particular region of the earth. One aim is to obtain temperature readings (or smog density readings, ozone readings etc.) <br/>over the the entire region by creating an appropriate model(function). Such a <br/>model makes ""predictive"" readings at unsampled sites possible. Also taking an <br/>increasing number of samples over a given region should yield a ""better"" model <br/>to the underlying phenomena.

One important <br/>example is the propagation of pulses, and pulse trains, in optical fibers. <br/>Other examples are fronts and spiral waves that arise, for instance, in <br/>autocatalytic reactions or during cardiac arrhythmias. This project is <br/>concerned with investigating such patterns and their interactions using <br/>analytical techniques. Specifically, the existence and stability of multi-<br/>bump pulses in partial differential equations with phase symmetries such <br/>as the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation is addressed. Another issue is <br/>to understand the interaction between small Turing patterns and large <br/>fronts or pulses that may lead to modulated time-periodic waves. While <br/>the interaction between pulses is amenable to a finite-dimensional (though <br/>not standard) perturbation analysis, it seems difficult to explain the <br/>interaction between Turing patterns and fronts by a reduction to a finite set <br/>of equations since this interaction involves the continuous spectrum. <br/>Another problem where the continuous spectrum becomes important is the <br/>interaction between a planar spiral wave and the boundary of a domain.

An <br/>optical pulse that is sent through an optical fiber encodes a single bit of <br/>information.

The goal of the<br/>project is to provide a better theoretical understanding of how<br/>the spatial distribution and movement of individuals affect the<br/>persistence or extinction of populations.  The motivation is to<br/>gain insight into the ways that spatial effects contribute to the<br/>maintenance of biodiversity and the ways that changes in the<br/>spatial aspects of the environment can threaten biodiversity.<br/>The project is primarily concerned with the construction and<br/>analysis of models for edge-mediated effects and the development<br/>of methods for translating assumptions about the behavior of<br/>individuals on a small spatial scale into conclusions about the<br/>dynamics of populations on a large spatial scale.  Edge-mediated<br/>effects occur when the presence of an interface between habitat<br/>types has an effect on population dynamics.  An example of an<br/>edge-mediated effect might occur if a fragment of habitat were<br/>cut off from a larger region by a road that some species would<br/>cross but others would not.  If the presence of the edge (the<br/>road) thus resulted in a change in the species composition of the<br/>ecological community in the fragment, that would be an<br/>edge-mediated effect.  Issues of scaling from local behavior to<br/>large-scale conclusions arise in ecology because it is often<br/>possible to determine small-scale behavior by observing a few<br/>individuals, while directly observing the overall dynamics of a<br/>large population is much more difficult.  The methodology of the<br/>project is to construct mathematical models for spatially<br/>distributed populations and then to analyze those models'<br/>predictions of persistence or extinction for the species they<br/>describe.  The mathematical models are typically based on<br/>ordinary or partial differential equations.  The analysis<br/>typically involves ideas from dynamical systems, nonlinear<br/>functional analysis (especially bifurcation theory), and partial<br/>differential equations (especially comparison methods and<br/>elliptic spectral theory).  A secondary goal is to obtain new<br/>mathematical results that are useful in the context of<br/>applications.<br/>     The investigators study ways of using mathematics to<br/>understand ecological problems.  The problems mostly involve<br/>spatial aspects of the environment; for example, how to design<br/>the most effective nature reserves, or how to predict the likely<br/>effects of the fragmentation of natural habitats on the<br/>populations that inhabit them.  The problems also involve<br/>interactions between different biological species, for example<br/>predators and prey.  The methodology is to express the essential<br/>features of a biological system in terms of equations and then to<br/>study the equations to determine what they predict.  The analysis<br/>often requires the development of new mathematical results, which<br/>may be of use to other investigators.  A typical goal of the<br/>analysis is to determine how various environmental and biological<br/>factors affect the persistence or extinction of populations.  A<br/>reason for using mathematical models is that in situations<br/>involving endangered species, genetically engineered organisms,<br/>or large scale environmental change, it is often impossible to do<br/>experiments but crucial to have some idea of what to expect.<br/>Some of the models are directly motivated by problems in refuge<br/>design or pest control.  Others are motivated by basic scientific<br/>questions about the effects of the spatial aspects of<br/>environments on populations.  But even those may prove to be<br/>relevant to issues raised in the contexts of environmental<br/>protection and the biological effects of global change.

The<br/>investigator studies links between the estimates of energy<br/>dissipation rate of three-dimensional boundary-driven flows based<br/>on the Navier-Stokes equations and Kolmogorov's heuristic<br/>estimate of energy dissipation rate for turbulent flows, and<br/>connections between the asymptotic degrees of freedom predicted<br/>by the Navier-Stokes equations (either as the fractal dimension<br/>of the global or exponential attractor, or as the number of<br/>determining modes, nodes or volume of the system) and those from<br/>conventional turbulence theory in combination with the heuristic<br/>Landau-Lifschitz argument.  The second class of problems is<br/>boundary layer behavior associated with incompressible viscous<br/>fluids whose dynamics are governed by the Navier-Stokes<br/>equations.  Both the case with non-permeable boundary and the case<br/>with permeable boundary are studied.  Results are checked via<br/>numerical simulation and laboratory data.  Some relevant efficient<br/>numerical algorithms are developed as well.  The third clas of<br/>problems is related to geophysical flows, emphasizing emergence<br/>and persistence of large scale coherent structures based on the<br/>barotropic quasi-geostrophic model.  Three prototype problems are<br/>studied.  The first is a selective decay problem for geophysical<br/>flows that predicts the emergence of Rossby waves directly from<br/>the dynamic equations.  The second is a spin-up problem with<br/>random forcing of small scale positive vortices.  The third is<br/>the barotropic quasi-geostrophic equations on the sphere.<br/>     Fluids are indispensable to our life.  They range from the<br/>air we breathe and water we drink to oceans and atmosphere that<br/>cover the surface of our the earth.  Study of the motion of these<br/>fluids is crucial to us.  At this stage full resolution of the<br/>complete dynamic equations lies beyond the capability of the most<br/>powerful computing system available today.  Hence approximation<br/>methods (both numerical and asymptotic) are needed to provide<br/>qualitative and quantitative results on the behavior of the<br/>fluids for simplified but prototypical situations.  The problems<br/>proposed here are prototypical and understanding them will<br/>facilitate our understanding of fundamental concepts related to<br/>fluid and geophysical fluid dynamics.  Study of these typical<br/>examples will further our understanding of more realistic and<br/>sophisticated problems that are important in many engineering<br/>applications (such as wing design or turbulent combustion) as<br/>well as in weather prediction, climatology and environmental<br/>phenomena.<br/><br/>"

Our goal is to develop<br/>asymptotic properties of such algorithms. By using weak convergence methods,<br/>suitably scaled sequences will be shown to converge to appropriate diffusions.<br/>Part II treats a class of hybrid models. Approximation schemes for<br/>systems involving singularly perturbed Markov chains with weak and strong<br/>interactions will be developed, which are useful for natural time-scale<br/>separation and reduction of complexity for large-scale systems.<br/>Part III investigates asymptotic properties of solutions of Cauchy problems<br/>arising from null-recurrent diffusions. Our focus is on obtaining convergence<br/>and rate of convergence of the solutions. One of the primary motivations comes<br/>from the investigation of singularly perturbed systems. The results will be<br/>useful to the ever expanding applications in optimization, controlled Markov<br/>systems, hierarchical decision making, production planning, telecommunication,<br/>queueing networks, and system reliability.<br/>Part IV models single-machine scheduling problems under random processing <br/>time, and/or under random machine breakdowns<br/>and repairs, and/or subject to random compression of processing times.<br/>Our objectives are to develop feasible models and to obtain optimal<br/>scheduling policies for the underlying systems. These results will allow us<br/>to design scheduling models and strategies for more complex jobshops by<br/>considering integrated processes as single-machine systems.<br/><br/><br/>Nontechnical explanation:<br/><br/>To bridge the gap between theory and applications, this research project<br/>includes three components: modeling, asymptotic analysis, and simulation.<br/>The ultimate goals are to provide useful models, to investigate their basic<br/>properties,  and to develop sound and feasible algorithms.<br/>Part 1 proposes two classes of algorithms with applications to machine<br/>learning,<br/>image segmentation, and various global optimization tasks.<br/>To meet the increasing demand on robust design and control of systems in<br/>speech<br/>and pattern recognition, signal processing, telecommunications, and<br/>manufacturing, Part 2 aims to reduce the complexity of a large-scale<br/>system of complex structure by using a simple system via approximation<br/>schemes.<br/>The origin of the planned work for Part 3 stems from the effort of modeling<br/>uncertainties due to random influence  such as demands for a product in a<br/>manufacturing system or fluctuation in the stock market. To control<br/>the underlying system, it is imperative to understand the system's long-term<br/>behavior, which is our primary goal.<br/>In production planning, it is vital to provide good strategy<br/>in sequencing the parts to be processed by the machines. Part 4 proposes<br/>single-machine scheduling models in uncertain environment.<br/>The proposed work aims to develop optimal scheduling policies.<br/>The overall planned work represents a continuation of the PI's recent <br/>preliminary exploration in these areas.

These investigationswill aim to develop methods for approximating functional relationshipsamong (large) finite data sets when the underlying data points are drawn from finite dimensional spheres or other compact spaces with a high degree of homogeneity, or from high dimensional Euclidean spaces.  The high degree of symmetry and homogeneity of spheres and Euclidean spaces,and the use of radial functions, which respect much of the symmetry and homogeneity, provide a major unifying feature of the different investigations. In each of these domains there exist a well defined and effectively computable set of (invariant) polynomial kernels whichdepend on many fewer parameters then the underlying space, but which can and will be used to develop the sought after approximation, integration and fast computational processes. The development of explicit approximation processes on spheres and Euclidean spaces, together with computable bounds on the errors in these processes, will enhance the infrastructure for practical scientific computation.  By reliance on radial function expansions, practical computations based on scattered data sets become feasible.  The fast computational methods forpolyharmonic radial functions in Euclidean spaces will extend existingmethods for thin-plate splines in ordinary three space, and facilitateeffective  application of multivariate Laplacian spline interpolation andsmoothing techniques, including cross-validation, to extremely large data sets.Many scientific and engineering problems involve modelling the complexfunctional relationships between two, three or more continuousquantities. The aim of this research is to develop new mathematicaltechniques to approximate such relationships by simpler functions,together with estimates for how close these approximations come to thetruth. By use of combinations of simple functions which depend only onthe distance between two points in space or on the surface of a spheresuch as the earth, this work hopes to provide highly efficient means ofapproximation and modelling; computational codes which exploit thesemethods should be able to deal in practical time with extremely largedata sets.  For example, existing methods based on exact modelling require several quadrillion operations for sets containing 100,000 points. Methods based on the approximations developed here will reduce this by afactor of a billion, so only several million operations are required.Todays computers can rapidly handle this number of operations."

These problems are associated with stochastic <br/>adaptive control which is the control of an incompletely known <br/>stochastic system.  Typically to solve an adaptive control problem <br/>it is necessary to identify the unknown parameter of the system and <br/>simultaneously to construct a control.  The cost functionals for the <br/>control problems are typically ergodic (average cost per unit time).  <br/>A family of processes, fractional Brownian motion, is proposed for <br/>development by extending a stochastic calculus and using these <br/>processes for adaptive control problems.

The basic idea of domain decomposition <br/>in this context is to decouple the global optimality system through an <br/>iterative procedure on individual elements, in which the couplings at the <br/>vertices and/or edges are replaced by certain boundary conditions. At each <br/>iteration the local problems, which are themselves local optimality <br/>systems, may be solved in parallel.  The choice of boundary conditions in <br/>the local problems must be such that, in particular, the transmission <br/>conditions in the global optimality system are restored in the limit of the <br/>iterations. The motivation for this approach is twofold. On the one hand, <br/>controllability properties and optimal control laws are more readily <br/>available at the local, subdomain, level.

The transmission conditions in the global problems, which of <br/>course must be also realized numerically, are very difficult to handle <br/>numerically at the global level.  It is very natural, therefore, to decompose <br/>such structures into their canonical constituents, to discretize those and <br/>then run the computations in parallel with the communications between <br/>elements taking place once an iteration step is completed.<br/><br/>In many practical applications it is necessary to devise control laws to <br/>regulate the dynamic behavior of structures such as trusses, frames, robot <br/>arms, solar panels, antennae, airfoils or deformable mirrors that are <br/>comprised of multiple  interconnected flexible elements such as beams, <br/>membranes, plates, shells or combinations thereof. This research will <br/>explore optimal control, approximate controllability, and exact <br/>controllability of such structures by means of domain decomposition.

The goal is to use experiments to test and guide development of theoretical models and thereby obtain a unified experimental, theoretical, and numerical understanding of the evolution of nonlinear, three-dimensional surface waves over deep water.  In particular they study (1) the dynamics of two obliquely interacting Stokes wavetrains, and (2) the dynamics of many obliquely interacting Stokes wavetrains that form resonantly interacting quartets.<br/><br/>The investigators are building a precision facility in which to generate three-dimensional water waves with any desired shape, speed and complexity.  One reason for these experiments is that an understanding of the fundamental physics of such waves greatly enhances the ability to model ocean waves.  Models of ocean waves are necessary for a variety of applications, including shipping, construction, and defense.  Models presently in use rest upon some mathematical assumptions that have never been tested and are possibly incorrect.  The experiments of this project are designed to test these assumptions.  A second reason for these experiments is that water waves are a physical application of the solutions to a special class of partial differential equations.  These equations arise in many fields: oceanography, meteorology, plasma physics, and optics.  Water waves provide a manageable experiment in which to study the application of the mathematics and to test the underlying assumptions and regimes of validity.  If these equations model well the water wave experiments, then investigators in many fields have more confidence in applying them to other fields and in developing more such models.

Typically the underlying coefficients are <br/>`recurrent' (in particular quasi-periodic) functions of time. This includes <br/>examples of forced oscillations and (finite as well as infinite dimensional) <br/>quantum oscillators with external (time dependent) quasi-periodic and <br/>ergodic forcing fields. Many such examples have been numerically and <br/>theoretically investigated recently. Motivated by these examples, the <br/>project is geared towards finding precise analytical results. The standard <br/>method of proving stability results is via well established techniques like <br/>the KAM technique or the use of `hyperbolicity'. On the contrary, in this <br/>project we shall mainly focus on the unstable behavior. We analyze the <br/>stability properties of the linear system via the dynamical properties of <br/>suitable `skew-product flows' associated with it. For example, instability <br/>of forced oscillations is captured in terms of the absence of point spectrum <br/>of the associated quasi-energy operator and this in turn is reflected in the <br/>ergodic behavior of certain skew-product flows generated by the given <br/>linear system.  Consequently our technique is a blend of methods of <br/>topological dynamics, ergodic theory, and ideas from control theory. <br/>Viewing the desired perturbations as `controls with certain constraints' <br/>allow us to apply methods of control theory to create chaotic behavior. <br/>With this viewpoint and with the techniques developed thus far, the <br/>project plans to examine questions of genericity and prevalence of chaotic <br/>or unstable behavior, absence of zero Lyapunov exponents, ergodicity and <br/>proximality for specific families of equations arising in physics and <br/>engineering. Finally the non-linear implications of the theory developed <br/>will be examined by developing results about time-dependent (or non-<br/>stationary) linearization and normal forms.<br/><br/>This project investigates long term time evolution, particularly the <br/>unstable and chaotic behavior of certain classes of dynamical systems. <br/>Motivated by the recent theoretical and numerical study of forced quantum <br/>oscillators with random or quasi-periodic forcing, this project plans to <br/>provide the underlying analytical reasons and precisely predict the long <br/>term behavior of such systems. The systems we consider model several <br/>mechanisms of practical and theoretical interest such as (a) behavior of <br/>electrons and other `spin 1/2 particles' subjected to external random <br/>magnetic fields, (b) phonon conduction and polarization of light in optical <br/>fibers, and (c) propagation through random media such as (quasi)-crystals <br/>with irregularly distributed impurities. Typically most of the existing body <br/>of knowledge is about two extreme cases, namely either when the external <br/>forcing field has no randomness (e.g. is periodic) or is as random as can be <br/>(technically this means the process is stochastically independent). Using <br/>the analytical tools of ergodic theory, topological dynamics and control <br/>theory, the project will investigate finer details relating the chaotic nature <br/>of evolution of the system to the precise data about the nature of <br/>`correlation function' and `rate of mixing' of these random forcing <br/>processes. The project will attempt to find and identify the underlying <br/>features of these systems that determine various types of unstable behavior <br/>and obtain quantitative information about quantities such as the Lyapunov <br/>exponents which are indicators of the degree of chaos. Some by-products <br/>of our investigations will have important implications to engineering <br/>disciplines such as filtering theory and to systems and control engineering.<br/>"

(i) Under the first heading come two problems on parallel computations.  The first concerns a divide and conquer approach to the problem of computing the mean first passage matrix for Markov chains, work that was started in the case when the process is a random walk with an underlying cutpoint graph structure, e.g., a tree.  The second problem is to investigate the speed-up due to the addition of processors, when the number of blocks (natural partitions) is kept fixed, in a model of asynchronous iterations.  One factor here is the type of coefficient matrix to which the model is applied.  <br/>(ii) Under the second heading  comes a problem encountered when working on<br/>convergence of infinite products of matrices.  It is known that in iterative methods for computing a solution to singular systems, e.g., in computing the stationary distribution for a Markov process, the magnitude of the subdominant eigenvalue determines the asymptotic rate of convergence.  We have noticed that for random stochastic matrices the subdominant eigenvalue seems to decay exactly as the square root of n.  We suggest investigating this behavior.  (iii) Here we suggest two problems on approximating the algebraic connectivity of a graph which is the second smallest eigenvalue of its Laplacian matrix.  Estimates of this quantity are used in various graph-based algorithms such as the spectral separator method.  In the first problem we suggest investigating bounds derived from the generalized group inverse of the Laplacian which seems to yield good lower bounds. In the second problem we propose studying the algebraic connectivity of random graphs on n vertices.  Throughout the proposal we give examples from the literature for the applications of the problems set forth.<br/><br/>Because many practical problems are very intricate, we need to build models to represent them and then develop a way of understanding and handling the models.  Such modeling frequently results in large arrays of numbers or, what is often associated with the arrays, a system with many equations and many unknowns.  The numbers in the array can be of a random nature if the model represents a physical situation (scientific, economic, social or statistical) in which there is some randomness involved. If the model represents a more deterministic physical situation, there will be definite numbers with some relations between them.  Once we have a model,  there may be many parameters and features which we need to measure and compute. This proposal suggests seven problems.  Two of the problems concern certain high-performance computing with these models.  The computations are to be performed in parallel so as to achieve speed-up of the computation and, if possible, a reduction in the number of computations.  Two examples of questions are: If a problem partitions naturally into a number of subproblems which are called blocks, and if we begin to increase beyond the number of blocks, the number of computers/processors applied to solve in parallel the entire problem, do we necessarily continue to increase the speed of calculations, or is a point of saturation reached after a while and what do we do then?  A common situation in which such a problem arises is in data-fitting, sometimes known as the least-squares problem.  Another problem for computation in parallel is in physical systems which have states with a probability of going from one state to another.  An example is various types of population concentrations such as urban, suburban, rural, etc. with a probability of moving from one type of region to another.  We may be interested in the distribution of the population in the different conurbations after a short term.  It turns out that such predictions  may be done in parallel under certain underlying assumptions.<br/>"

New nontrivial<br/>extensions of these methods have previously been developed to solve<br/>problems in a wide variety of applications, which led to remarkably<br/>accurate results.  We plan to continue the development of these methods,<br/>and to apply them in particular to models arising in the performance<br/>evaluation of queueing systems.  Several aspects of the project are<br/>directly related to problems arising in the analysis of high-speed<br/>communication systems.  We also propose to study problems in mathematical<br/>physics, related to diffusion-convection, bifurcation, and tunneling<br/>through potential barriers.<br/><br/>An important aspect of our research program is the study of queues or<br/>lines.  In its simplest form, a queueing system consists of a server and a<br/>queue or waiting room.  Customers arrive, possibly at random times, and<br/>request service of random length from the server.  If the system is empty,<br/>an arriving customer is sent directly to the server.  Otherwise, the<br/>customer is relegated to wait in the queue.  One is interested in<br/>developing mathematical models of the queueing system and computing<br/>performance measures, such as the average number of customers waiting, the<br/>average waiting time, the utilization, etc., to help understand the<br/>behavior of the system.  For complicated queueing systems, the performance<br/>measures are difficult to compute and a major goal of our research is to<br/>construct useful approximations to them.  The main application of our work<br/>in queueing is to high-speed communication networks such as the Internet.  <br/>Here the customers are packets of information (bits), such as data files,<br/>voice messages, or video.  The server is hardware such as a router or<br/>switch, which transmits the packets along the Internet.  At each switch,<br/>the packets are stored in a queue, if needed, before transmission.  These<br/>buffers can only a fixed number of packets.  Arrivals finding a full<br/>buffer are lost and hence the system performance is degraded.  The<br/>performance measures, average buffer size, average packet delays, and the<br/>probability of losing information, is important in the design and tuning<br/>of high-speed communication networks.  Our research provides network<br/>designers with mathematical tools for approximating these performance<br/>measures.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Topics include<br/>nonlinearity in the context of stochasticity, chaos and<br/>population control, the impact of periodic environments on animal<br/>abundance, demographic dynamics and natural selection,<br/>nonequilibrium species interactions, and statistical questions<br/>concerning parameterization and validation of models.<br/>     With a sound understanding of the underlying dynamics of<br/>animal populations, ecologists can anticipate the consequences of<br/>environmental degradation and learn better ways to manage natural<br/>populations and control populations of pests.  For example, one of<br/>the experiments suggests that, by taking advantage of the<br/>""sensitivity to initial conditions"" that is the hallmark of a<br/>chaotic system, managers can dramatically decrease pest<br/>population numbers without the use of chemical pesticides by<br/>making small perturbations at critical times.  The marriage of<br/>ecological theory and experiments by the interdisciplinary<br/>research team leads to new techniques for the application of<br/>mathematics to ecological problems.

The spreading of an oil spill on the ocean <br/>surface can serve as an example. The objective is <br/>to derive an equation for the averaged evolution of the passive<br/>scalar in the ensemble of random waves. The analysis of this<br/>basic problem is used for the investigation of Wave Turbulence <br/>(dynamics of a system of random waves weakly interacting with each<br/>other). <br/>The proposal contains also the description of two related projects <br/>about systems with Strong Nonlinearity: Rayleigh-Taylor Instability <br/>and Materials with Non-Monotone Stress-Strain Relation.<br/><br/><br/>In practical terms the problem of Turbulent Transport by<br/>Waves can be put like this. Suppose oil is spilled in the ocean. Ocean<br/>waves have a profound effect on the evolution of this spill.<br/>The first goal of the proposal is to derive an equation for the<br/>drift and spreading of the spill. The same mathematical problem<br/>arises in other problems of the ENVIRONMENT: the<br/>spreading of pollutants in the atmosphere or the motion of<br/>phytoplankton in the ocean. We also apply the problem of<br/>Turbulent Transport by Waves for the investigation of Turbulence<br/>of Waves, such as ocean waves, or sound waves, or planetary<br/>waves, which govern the weather. All these problems are important<br/>for the understanding of the ENVIRONMENT and GLOBAL CHANGE.<br/>Two related projects about systems with Strong Nonlinearity <br/>are included in the proposal as well: (1) the so called<br/>Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which is crucial for the NUCLEAR FUSION<br/>(with inertial confinement); (2) the dynamics of solids with<br/>non-monotone stress-strain relation (stretching of such a solid<br/>can decrease the resisting force).

The investigator models and analyses the<br/>effects of waves and currents on coastal dynamics.  This is<br/>challenging because of the presence of two free surfaces, the<br/>water surface and the movable bottom, both of which change over<br/>time, and which interact with each other through complex,<br/>nonlinear processes.  The model features nonlinear, dispersive,<br/>dissipative partial differential equations to describe the<br/>evolution of waves coming in to the shore from deep water.  These<br/>equations, which are of Boussinesq type, are coupled to a model<br/>for run-up and reflection at the shoreline.  Once the evolution of<br/>the water surface is approximately known, the velocity field in<br/>the bulk of the fluid may then be determined via potential<br/>theory.  This velocity field is then viewed as driving a viscous,<br/>sediment-laden boundary layer in which the sediment transport is<br/>taking place.  The velocity distribution in this layer is<br/>determined using ideas similar to those pioneered by<br/>Longuet-Higgins.  By applying conservation of sediment mass in an<br/>infinitesimal form, a differential equation is thereby inferred<br/>that serves to determine the bottom deformation.  Thus the entire<br/>model is somewhat complicated, consisting of a nonlinear<br/>initial-boundary-value problem for the wave motion coupled in a<br/>nonlocal way to a conservation law for the bottom movement.  This<br/>model is developed in detail, analysed and implemented as a<br/>computer code.  Model predictions are compared with field data.<br/>It is also proposed to link the computer code with input from a<br/>Geographical Information System, to allow easier deployment of<br/>the model in real situations.<br/>     The underlying motivation for the project is two-fold.<br/>First, there is a desire to understand both qualitatively and<br/>quantitatively some of the fundamental processes that lead to the<br/>formation and maintenance of bottom structure in coastal zones<br/>and on continental shelves.  This involves a thorough knowledge<br/>of both the wave environment and the dynamics of the bed as it is<br/>influenced by waves and by currents.  Second, and not less<br/>important, the project responds to the need for new and more<br/>sophisticated tools to aid in the development of strategies to<br/>deal with real coastal engineering problems.  The project has the<br/>potential to contribute to the study of a number of important<br/>scientific and environmental issues.  The ocean margins in North<br/>America are vast and in many places, troubled.  Indeed, erosion<br/>of unconsolidated coastlines is a world-wide phenomenon that is<br/>not well understood.  Global warming will aggravate these<br/>problems by increasing sea levels, thus causing shore retreat and<br/>providing a better base for the scour and erosion associated with<br/>wave activity.  Fragile Arctic coasts and low-altitude regions<br/>are already displaying unmistakable signs of deterioration caused<br/>by these global changes.  Severe erosion may well spread to other<br/>coast regions within the next half century, and thus there will<br/>be an increased interest in effective prevention methods.  In<br/>addition to ""hard"" protection schemes such as the construction of<br/>seawalls and the like, there will be an increased demand for<br/>""soft"" protection strategies that take advantage of natural<br/>processes.<br/>"

Antoulas, Rice University<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate problems of approximation of <br/>linear operators. The approximation method considered is based on the <br/>singular value decomposition of the operator in question. More precisely, <br/>we propose to study the existence of a unifying framework for the optimal <br/>and sub-optimal approximation of (i) unstructured operators in finite <br/>dimensions, and (ii) structured (Hankel) operators in infinite <br/>dimensions. It is expected that this study will shed light on a large <br/>class of singular-value-decomposition based approximation problems.<br/><br/>In order to predict the behavior of dynamical systems such as, a <br/>compact disc (CD) player,  a chemical reaction, or a multi-story building, <br/>and appropriately modify (control) this behavior according to given <br/>specifications, a mathematical model is needed. Often, (detailed) models <br/>for these dynamical systems can be obtained using so-called finite-element<br/>methods. The resulting complexity of such models is very high. However, <br/>for both simulation and control purposes low-complexity models are needed,<br/>an important requirement being that these simplified models retain key <br/>features of the original high-complexity systems. The purpose of this <br/>project is to study approximation methods which yield low-complexity <br/>models with (theoretically) guaranteed properties. This is a necessary <br/>step towards addressing, in a second phase, the problem of control of <br/>such dynamical systems. It is expected that this project, besides its <br/>significance for mathematics, will have an impact on application problems <br/>arising in several engineering disciplines, and on the theorerical <br/>foundations of high performance computing. <br/><br/><br/>Sub-project on internet based education<br/>---------------------------------------<br/><br/>The advent of the internet is radically changing the way teaching is <br/>done at universities. An important new concept in this regard is that <br/>of ""Asynchronous Learning"", where students learn anytime, anywhere, <br/>and at their own pace, using the internet. A key ingredient in this <br/>mode of learing is access to online exercises, with the capability of<br/>instantaneous grading and feedback both for the student and for the <br/>instructor. In traditional courses, the instructor gets feedback on <br/>how well students have understood a certain concept at a later time,<br/>when instruction has moved on to a new topic, and re-elaboration <br/>becomes cumbersome. This issue can be addressed by making available <br/>online excercises and tests which are graded instantaneously. Careful <br/>selection of the exercises is required however, so as to help the <br/>beginner and challenge the advanced learner. We propose to study the <br/>issue of ""automatic problem generation and grading"" for a course in <br/>the broad area of linear algebra and dynamical systems. We will start <br/>by reviewing and evaluating several existing methods for computer-based <br/>generation and grading of assignemnts, for instance: (i) the ""Mallard"" <br/>instructional environment developed at the University of Illinois, <br/>(ii) the ""Autodidact"" instructional environment developed at the <br/>University of Grenoble; the former is a general platform which can in <br/>principle be adapted to handle many different courses, while the latter <br/>is geared towards courses in dynamical systems and control. It will <br/>subsequently be decided whether to adopt one of these existing <br/>platforms and/or the degree of modification required to address the <br/>needs of the chosen course.<br/><br/>"

In the first <br/>part of our work, we will study the coupled hyperbolic and parabolic--like <br/>PDE's which model structural acoustic systems under the action of <br/>unbounded pointwise observation and control, with a focus here upon <br/>issues of optimization and exact boundary controllability. In a particular <br/>structural acoustic, control design application, pointwise boundary control <br/>is implemented for the purpose of attenuating external noise in an acoustic <br/>chamber. Moreover, the efficacy of the point boundary control is <br/>measured by point observations of the acoustic pressure. Accordingly, the <br/>governing PDE model involves highly unbounded control and observation <br/>operators. Before one can consider the optimal control of the controlled <br/>and observed structural acoustic PDE, wellposedness of the dynamics <br/>under the influence of these point observations and control must first be <br/>established. This effort to establish regularity will require new techniques <br/>of pseudodifferential analysis to establish microlocal PDE estimates that <br/>cannot be obtained globally. Moreover, before optimization of the PDE <br/>system can proceed, there must be an identification and characterization of <br/>a state space which allows pointwise observations of the acoustic pressure. <br/>This effort to properly characterize the state space will also have a heavy <br/>microlocal component. Subsequently, we will consider various quadratic <br/>optimization schemes for the structural acoustic PDE's under such point <br/>control and observation, with a view toward developing a characterizing <br/>Riccati Equation and finite element approximation of the optimal control <br/>laws. The second phase of the project involves a continuation of our <br/>previous studies on controllability and stability properties of a now <br/>classical system of thermoelasticity. In particular, we attempt to extend a <br/>recent result of exact--approximate controllability to the case where the <br/>coefficient of thermal volume expansion is allowed to vary with the <br/>properties of the plate material. In addition, we will study the longstanding <br/>problem of null controllability for the linear system of thermoelasticity. <br/>Both these controllability investigations will employ novel Carleman and <br/>pseudodifferential multipliers and techniques, as opposed to standard <br/>differential multiplier methods. Nonlinear stabilization problems for <br/>systems of thermoelasticity in the absence of rotational inertial will also be <br/>considered.<br/><br/>The motivation for this project is drawn from the fact that the classes of <br/>coupled PDE's to be considered frequently arise in the development and <br/>application of smart materials technology. Loosely speaking, a ""smart"" <br/>material or structure is that which has a miniaturized control system <br/>embedded within one or more of its components, so as to induce a desired <br/>result or physical state. For instance, this control system might function in <br/>such a way so as to negate unwanted external influences, or to assist the <br/>material in attaining an optimal shape (optimal with respect to some <br/>predetermined design specification). Examples of such smart materials---<br/>these comprising both sensor and actuator---may be found in structural, <br/>structural acoustic, thermal/structure and fluid/structure interaction <br/>systems. The mathematical modeling of these composite structures will <br/>often culminate in the appearance of the aforementioned coupled systems <br/>of PDE's. Moreover, inasmuch as the various components of the control <br/>mechanism are typically affixed to the structure's boundary, or embedded <br/>within its medium, and/or in collocation at specified points of the <br/>structure, the associated system of PDE's which describes the particular <br/>interaction will have a control input term present therein. The principal <br/>intent of this project then is to obtain a better understanding and foresight <br/>concerning the effect of active control on composite materials by <br/>analyzing the behavior of their corresponding governing equations. In <br/>addition, by performing rigorous numerical simulations on these PDE <br/>models, it is our intent to generate approximate control laws that can be <br/>implemented for ""real--time"" engineering control design.<br/>"

Smoldering often occurs when oxidizer <br/>supply to the reaction is limited, for example because it must flow <br/>through porous media to reach the reaction site.

Understanding the mechanisms and processes behind smoldering <br/>can enhance fire safety as well as allow better control for engineering <br/>uses of smoldering combustion.

Through a correspondence  between Beltrami fields and the Reeb dynamics of contact  structures, one can import techniques from contact topology  and pseudoholomorphic curve theory to answer questions of  existence of solutions and of forced recurrence. In addition,  knot-theoretic techniques shed light on the global properties  of the Euler equations on Riemannian manifolds. Goals of this project include the resolution of the Weinstein Conjecture on solid tori (which would imply that steady force-free fields in a tokamak have closed field lines), the spectrum of knot types which can/must appear as closed flowlines in steady Euler flows, and the implications of the tight/overtwisted  dichotomy in the hydrodynamical context with respect to  hydrodynamic instability and energy minimization.   <br/><br/>One of the enduring challenges in science is the comprehension  and taming of fluid behavior: from tornadoes to ocean currents,  we live in a world of complicated fluid dynamics.  All of these phenomena have mathematical manifestations ---  projections onto a simplified abstract setting whose  analysis yields clues to the workings of the physical world. This project will focus on the equations governing ``perfect'' fluids: models appropriate for certain non-viscous  fluids and plasmas alike. Emerging techniques from global  geometry and topology provide tools for attacking problems heretofore beyond the reach of analysis. Surprisingly, such  seemingly unrelated questions as ``How do strings tie up  into different knots'' and ``What does geometry in four  dimensions look like'' are closely tied to questions of  recurrence and stability in steady fluid flows. <br/>"

These features lead to a dynamics <br/>of granular materials whose richness and scope rivals that of fluid dynamics.<br/>At the same time, particle materials used in technological applications are<br/>becoming smaller, and, consequently, the presence of interstitial fluid is<br/>becoming increasingly important.

The scientific objective of this course of research is to produce new methods for the study of phenomena in incompressible flow systems which are not easily approached with existing methods.  For incompressible flow systems, the divergence constraint requires the solution of global elliptic equations which greatly increases the complexity and computational cost of simulation. Many fluid systems also contain a large range of relevant length scales which necessitates the use of spatially and temporally adaptive methods.  When applicable, integral equation methods offer the possibility of efficient, adaptive, high-order methods which are readily applicable to complex computational geometries and are also highly parallel.  Three distinct applications of FMM will be developed and coupled with adaptive fluid solvers:<br/>solution of the Poisson equation, solution of the surface Laplacian,<br/>and the fast summation of impulse potentials, each in the context of a<br/>specific physical problem.  The numerical study of Boussinesq<br/>convection, in which strong localized fronts develop, requires that a<br/>standard Poisson equation be solved.  Simulating front formation of<br/>the quasigeostrophic thermal scalar and internal waves in two fluid<br/>systems requires that a psuedo-differential operator equivalent to a<br/>surface Laplacian be inverted.  A new approach to modeling thin<br/>flexible membranes in incompressible flows requires that membrane<br/>forces be evaluated at all grid points as well as a Poisson equation<br/>be solved to enforce incompressibility.  For all of these physical<br/>problems, adaptive methods offer the opportunity to study problems<br/>which are unapproachable with uniform mesh methods.<br/><br/>The range of important fluid flow applications which the proposed<br/>research could impact is quite diverse.  Examples include modeling the<br/>ocean or climate, predicting oil recovery or contaminant flows in the<br/>ground, simulating combustion or nuclear reactions, and modeling the<br/>flow of blood in organs like the heart or kidneys.  For these types of<br/>applications, the solution of linear equations represents the most<br/>computationally intensive part of the overall computer model.  The use<br/>of integral equation methods to solve the linear equations within<br/>these models represents a distinct change from the majority of current<br/>computer simulations.  Any increase in the efficiency in which these<br/>equations can be solved translates directly into the ability for<br/>scientists to run larger and more accurate models.  The <br/>mathematical and computational techniques necessary to make integral<br/>equation methods an attractive alternative to more standard approaches<br/>has only been fully developed in the last 10 years.  Because of the<br/>complexity and newness of these methods, little work has been done to<br/>exploit their power in applications involving fluid flow.  The<br/>applications that will be pursued as test cases for the new methods<br/>represent problems for which current numerical techniques are<br/>inadequate for answering fundamental questions of interest to<br/>scientists.  The algorithms developed will also serve as a stepping<br/>stone for future methods applicable to more complicated problems."

We focus on model selection<br/>criteria based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler entropy distance between<br/>the unknown probability and a Bayesian prior.  In the special case of<br/>diffusion processes, this leads to a constrained stochastic control<br/>problem that can be solved via Lagrange multipliers.

The technology derived<br/>here, which is based on the mathematical fields of probability, statistics<br/>and numerical analysis, is used to develop accurate tools for pricing and<br/>managing complex financial instruments.  The motivation for this research<br/>comes from the fact that quantitative finance offers many challenging<br/>mathematical and computer-related problems.

Our primary focus is on numerical techniques <br/>which can efficiently and reliably utilize the capabilities of modern <br/>computers to simulate problems whose scale has hitherto precluded their detailed study.  <br/>A large scale wave propagation problem will generally be given in an extended spatial <br/>and/or temporal domain. In engineering applications, the domain will also usually <br/>involve bodies with complex shapes. These features all pose difficult challenges to <br/>numerical algorithms. The radiation of energy to the far field is a feature of <br/>most wave systems and is associated with large spatial domains. To make computational s<br/>solutions feasible, the domain must be artificially truncated. This truncation introduces <br/>errors which have been difficult to estimate or reduce. In recent years, we, along with <br/>other researchers, have developed new techniques for imposing accurate truncations, which <br/>solve this problem in some special but important cases. As part of this project, we will <br/>extend the applicability of these new methods. Long time simulations also make special <br/>demands on the accuracy of numerical approximations. In particular, small inaccuracies <br/>in the wave speeds or the effects of numerical damping will generally accumulate to <br/>produce large errors. Therefore, highly accurate methods must be used. However, these are typically difficult to apply in complex geometries. We will work on the development <br/>and analysis of new methods with high orders of accuracy which can be more easily <br/>utilized near bodies with complicated shapes. Finally, we will study some basic<br/>problems related to the existence, smoothness, and asymptotic approximability <br/>of solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the <br/>motion of most common liquids and gases. We are particularly interested in <br/>flows which are slow in comparison with the speed of sound. Such flows are <br/>typically modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, whose <br/>mathematical theory, though still quite incomplete, is better developed. We, <br/>however, retain the compressible effects, and study both theoretically and by <br/>simulation the relationship between the solutions of the two systems.<br/><br/>     In our work we focus on some specific physical systems, primarily from the<br/>fields of acoustics and fluid dynamics. As such, we hope to enhance our <br/>capability to use high-performance computing to predict the production and<br/>interaction of sound with fluid flows. However, due to the general importance <br/>of wave theory and the underlying unity of its mathematical description, most <br/>of our results will be directly applicable in diverse areas such as <br/>electromagnetism and elasticity. In the long term, an improved capability to <br/>simulate waves will have important applications including the reduction of <br/>aircraft noise, the improvement of radar and sonar imaging, the predictability<br/>of the effects of earthquakes, and the design of better communications systems.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Turkington<br/>Department of Mathematics and Statistics<br/>University of Massachusetts, Amherst<br/><br/><br/>The research project concerns statistical models of turbulent fluid<br/>motions.  In particular, these investigations focus on equilibrium<br/>models of coherent structures in developed turbulent flows that are<br/>either two-dimensional or quasi-geostrophic.  The principal motivation<br/>for this work comes from applications in geophysical fluid dynamics.<br/>Statistical equilibrium models defined by Gibbs ensembles are<br/>constructed from the conserved quantities for the underlying fluid<br/>dynamics.  The continuum limit of these lattice models is analyzed<br/>using probabilistic techniques, especially the theory of large<br/>deviations.  This approach furnishes rigorous derivations of the<br/>constrained maximum entropy principles whose solutions are the most<br/>probable macroscopic states of the systems.  These macrostates<br/>represent long-lived, large-scale flows that self-organize in the<br/>turbulent vorticity field.  For instance, they can be zonal shear<br/>flows or embedded vortex structures.  In a variety of contexts,<br/>including one-layer barotropic flows and two-layer baroclinic flows,<br/>the variational problems governing these states are solved numerically<br/>by means of a robust and accurate method.  In this way, quantitative<br/>predictions about the macroscopic behavior of the system, which is<br/>turbulent on the microscopic scales, can be made without resolving all<br/>the scales of motion.  Another direction of the research is to extend<br/>these equilibrium theories to a new class of quasi-equilibrium<br/>theories determined by collective variables that are not necessarily<br/>conserved quantities.  This extension allows the same general approach<br/>to be applied in situations where the coherent states are<br/>slow-varying, but unsteady.<br/><br/>Turbulent fluid flow remains one of the unsolved puzzles of physical<br/>science.  A better theoretical understanding of turbulence would<br/>greatly improve our ability to compute the behavior of natural fluid<br/>motions.  In particular, geophysical fluid flows -- the large-scale<br/>motions of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere -- are very difficult to<br/>predict because of their turbulent fluctuations.  Nevertheless, these<br/>flow systems, whose motions are mainly horizontal, have special<br/>properties not shared by general fluid motions in three dimensions.<br/>Consequently, they tend to exhibit organized behavior in their largest<br/>features while they remain disordered and random on a range of smaller<br/>length scales.  The research conducted in this project addresses the<br/>mathematical and computational issues involved in modeling phenomena<br/>of this type.  Specifically, the work seeks to develop the tools<br/>necessary to calculate the persistent, predominant states of nearly<br/>two-dimensional fluid systems without resolving the full complexity of<br/>their detailed behavior.  With such tools in hand, the typical or<br/>""most probable"" states of geophysical flows can be characterized and<br/>computed.  Besides being of fundamental interest in the field of fluid<br/>dynamics, these states can used as building blocks in predictions<br/>about the long-term trends in the ocean-atmosphere system, and hence<br/>they are relevant to weather forecasting and climate modeling.<br/><br/>"

The first direction involves a <br/>new class of numerical methods for such problems. Specifically, note that <br/>one of the most persistent difficulties with control and estimation of <br/>significantly nonlinear systems has been computational cost. Dynamic <br/>programming methods for H-infinity control and risk sensitive stochastic <br/>control lead to nonlinear PDEs (typically Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman <br/>equations) which must be solved over some region of the state-space. <br/>Since the number of state variables can be quite high, the dimension of the <br/>regions over which one needs to solve these PDEs increases. This restricts <br/>the set of problems for which one can compute such controls to those with <br/>very low state-space dimension. By changes in the underlying definitions <br/>of addition and multiplication certain classes of nonlinear Hamilton-<br/>Jacobi-Bellman equations are transformed into problems with linear semi-<br/>groups. This property has led us to new methods that exploit this linearity. <br/>For instance, certain steady-state problems lead to spectral methods for <br/>linear problems (over the new algebras). It is hoped that the possible <br/>improvements in speed with these methods will lead to an ability to solve <br/>a wider range of problems. Some simple examples are already being <br/>tested. The second direction involves risk averse limits in nonlinear <br/>control systems. It is now well known that risk averse limits of risk <br/>sensitive controllers lead to robust/H-infinity controllers. However, the <br/>classes of systems for which this has actually been proven is rather small, <br/>and does not include most typical problems. We have recently obtained <br/>some uniqueness results that should allow one to extend the risk sensitive <br/>limit results for infinite time-horizon problems to a reasonably wide class. <br/>Analogous work on risk sensitive limits in the estimation problem is <br/>beginning as well.<br/><br/>Many modern systems, from active automotive hydro-suspension systems <br/>to fighter aircraft, behave in a significantly nonlinear manner. These <br/>systems require active control in order to perform at increasingly <br/>competitive levels. There is a serious technical challenge in that the design <br/>of nonlinear controllers requires extremely heavy computational loads. In <br/>fact, the computation of controllers where the number of system state <br/>variables is more than two or three has been unattainable in general. The <br/>difficulty is that these computations require the solution of a nonlinear <br/>partial differential equation over a space whose dimension is that of the <br/>number of state variables. A recent advance is the observation that, despite <br/>the nonlinearity, the propagation of these solutions is often still linear IF <br/>one switches to the max-plus algebra in place of the traditional definitions <br/>of addition and subtraction. In the max-plus algebra, traditional addition is <br/>replaced by maximization, and traditional multiplication is replaced by <br/>addition. One of the goals of this project is to exploit this max-plus <br/>linearity to extend the class of nonlinear systems for which we can design <br/>active controllers.<br/>"

For wave transport, we<br/>propose a phase-space approach by means of the Wigner transform.  We<br/>show that a middle range of sound frequencies couples with the flow<br/>field: they convert into each other through mutual scattering and<br/>stretching.

The objective of this proposal is to develop theoretically-<br/>sound, practically-useful passivity-based low-gain and low-and-high gain <br/>control methods for designing feedback controllers that achieve global <br/>asymptotic stability, performance robustness against modeling uncertainty, <br/>and disturbance attenuation, for a large class of nonlinear systems which <br/>cannot be adequately controlled by existing methods. A unique thread in <br/>our theoretical development would be the systematic use of small controls <br/>and feedback passivation, which focus on ways to exploit the inherently <br/>dominant nonlinearities of the dynamic system in the feedback design, <br/>rather than to design controllers by canceling the nonlinearities via <br/>feedback linearization. The purpose of a feedback control is to stabilize or <br/>regulate the system globally and do so in a robust fashion, that is, in a <br/>manner that is not sensitive to various perturbations and structural <br/>uncertainties in the system. A unified, passivity-based theory of robust <br/>nonlinear control would contribute to our ability to design high <br/>performance nonlinear controllers capable of attenuating disturbances and <br/>tracking desired trajectories, without relying as much on an accurate <br/>description of the system model or model parameters and on explicit <br/>descriptions of the disturbance signals as does conventional modern <br/>control theory.<br/><br/>Many dynamic systems of practical importance (e.g. robotics, electrically <br/>stimulated muscles, rotating machines, induction motors, power systems, <br/>aerospace vehicles, aircraft, missiles and so on) have essentially inherent <br/>nonlinear characteristics that cannot be ignored in feedback design. More <br/>importantly, control systems that exploit their genuine nonlinearities are <br/>likely to achieve better performance than those that do not.  Because most <br/>engineering systems involve highly nonlinear actuators, sensors and <br/>process elements, a goal of active research is to transform a nonlinear <br/>system into a linear system for which well-defined linear control <br/>techniques are readily applicable. This approach has serious limitations, <br/>e.g. the requirement of high energy actuators and the lack of robustness of <br/>such schemes to parameter variations and disturbances. Consequently, <br/>these techniques have had relatively little successful in solving real-world <br/>problems.  The research plan in this proposal addresses the needs called <br/>for in feedback design, and it proposes approaches to tackle some of the <br/>most important issues that we believe are critical to the advancement and <br/>application of nonlinear control theory. The main outcome of the proposed <br/>research will be new, systematic design methodologies for the control of <br/>nonlinear dynamic systems, which are not available in the existing <br/>literature. The significance of this proposal is that it identifies the main <br/>barriers that hamper the advance and application of nonlinear control <br/>theory, but also delineates concrete problems for the control of inherently <br/>nonlinear systems, and suggests theoretically innovative and practically <br/>feasible methods to resolve them. A number of important and challenging <br/>open problems will be solved. In the long term, it will provide insight and <br/>thrust for future investigations into several theoretical and practical issues. <br/>It is believed that the benefits to a systematic approach towards using low <br/>energy control will be becoming more widely appreciated, particularly in <br/>industries (e.g. manufacturing, aerospace, power and biomedical <br/>engineering) where many applications of nonlinear control with actuator <br/>saturation can be found. It is also expected that the nonlinear control <br/>schemes to be developed in this program will find much broader <br/>applications in other branches of engineering than traditional control <br/>theory, due to their significant features and the inclusion of realistic <br/>assumptions.<br/>"

They focus attention on two particular protein<br/>motors: ATP synthase and kinesin.  The former is a rotary motor<br/>that combines in one protein the two major mechanism of energy<br/>transduction: The F1 portion hydrolyzes ATP to generate a rotary<br/>torque, and the Fo portion utilizes the energy stored in a<br/>transmembrane electrochemical gradient to generate a rotary<br/>torque in the opposite direction.  Kinesin is a molecular motor<br/>that hydrolyzes ATP to generate linear force and displacement<br/>along its microtubule track.  Both of these motors have been<br/>characterized in great detail, mechanically and biochemically as<br/>well as structurally.  The challenge is to incorporate this<br/>diverse body of information into a comprehensive model that<br/>provides a consistent explanation for each motor's behavior.  The<br/>investigators have formulated models for both motors comprising<br/>ATP synthase.  These models contain several phenomenological<br/>components that must now be modeled at a more detailed level to<br/>provide mechanistic explanations.  In particular, the process of<br/>binding ATP to the catalytic site is the heart of the energy<br/>transduction mechanism.  They model this process in detail.  The<br/>starting point for the proposed kinesin work is their 1995 model,<br/>which is tested against more recent data, such as trajectory<br/>variance as a function of load (an experiment that they<br/>suggested).  The role of elasticity in molecular motor function,<br/>which they have demonstrated in the context of imperfect Brownian<br/>Ratchet motors, is studied in kinesin (which is connected to its<br/>load through a flexible protein linkage), and also in chromosome<br/>transport during cell division, in protein translocation across<br/>intracellular membranes, and in the elastic coupling that<br/>connects the F1 and Fo motors comprising ATP synthase.  The<br/>influence of the water environment on the operation of molecular<br/>motors is investigated by developing a new<br/>mathematical/computational framework for mesoscale fluid<br/>dynamics.  This methodology combines a traditional continuum<br/>description of the fluid with random forces that simulate<br/>Brownian motion.

Biological cells are<br/>now known to be teeming with protein motors, which, like tiny<br/>robotic machines, conduct the business of life through mechanical<br/>processes driven by the expenditure of chemical energy.  The<br/>mechanisms by which these motors operate are fundamental secrets<br/>of nature, vital to the understanding of life itself.<br/>Experimental investigations suggest possible mechanisms, but it<br/>is only through mathematical modeling and computer simulation<br/>that one can tell whether a proposed mechanism will account, in a<br/>quantitative way, for the observed behavior of any particular<br/>molecular motor.

These<br/>implementations are being used to study the Euclidean and affine<br/>mean-curvature motion of curves in three-dimensional spaces.  Two<br/>applications are being pursued by the investigators.  The first<br/>application is the detection of blood vessels in Magnetic<br/>Resonance Angiography (MRA) images.

For example, it has been known for <br/>many years that a function of two variables can be recovered completely <br/>from its averages on three squares whose sidelengths are pairwise <br/>irrationally related. Since convolution by characteristic functions of <br/>squares is a standard model for remote sensing of images by arrays of <br/>photodetectors (e.g., electronic cameras), this fact suggests that a high-<br/>resolution image can be recovered from low-resolution images sensed by <br/>arrays of photodetectors placed at three distinct distances from the image. <br/>Recent results of the principal investigator and collaborators indicate a <br/>strong link between the theory of sampling on unions of regular grids of <br/>irrationally related sizes. Several aspects of this type of nonuniform <br/>sampling are to be investigated. Specifically, (1) higher dimensional <br/>sampling with applications to high resolution tomography and to <br/>deconvolution from averages over rotated squares, (2) sampling for <br/>functions bandlimited to circular domains with applications to <br/>deconvolution of images blurred by photosensors with circular apertures, <br/>and (3) higher order sampling with applications to deblurring when the <br/>blurring function is a smooth spline. A second focus of the research is in <br/>wavelet applications to tomography. The principal investigator and <br/>collaborators have shown that the wavelet transform is a valid theoretical <br/>and practical tool for analyzing local aspects of the Radon transform, the <br/>primary mathematical model in CT. The principal investigator proposes <br/>to continue this analysis by studying the recovery of edge information in <br/>images directly from a wavelet-based edge analysis of their CT images. <br/>This would have the advantage of constructing an accurate edge picture of <br/>the original image without the loss of SNR inherent in any reconstruction <br/>or backprojection scheme. The natural noise-reduction properties of <br/>wavelets should also help in reducing noise in the measured CT data.<br/><br/>This research has two foci. The first is related to the problem of super-<br/>resolution of digital images. Any digital black-and-white image consists <br/>of individual pixels on which the image intensity is a fixed shade of gray. <br/>In this case, features of the image at scales smaller than one pixel in size <br/>are invisible to the imaging apparatus. For example, in a satellite image of <br/>New York City in which the pixel size corresponds to one city block, it <br/>will be impossible to distinguish different buildings in a given block. All <br/>of the buildings (features) will be blurred into a single shade of gray on <br/>that block. Such an image is a blurred version of a hypothetical ""perfect <br/>image."" The goal is always to get as close as possible to this perfect <br/>image. It has been observed that certain classical mathematical results can <br/>be interpreted as saying that it is theoretically possible to take several <br/>blurred images of different pixel sizes and combine them in such a way as <br/>to recover the perfect image exactly. Perfect deblurring is not possible in <br/>any realistic system but it is possible to significantly improve the <br/>resolution in an image by combining several blurred images in a specified <br/>way. The principal investigator has contributed to this program by <br/>observing that the deblurring problem here described is actually very <br/>closely related to the well-studied signal and image processing problem of <br/>interpolation from samples. The principal investigator's work has <br/>demonstrated that it is possible to provide very simple deblurring <br/>formulas. The current research project focuses on finding practical <br/>schemes to implement these formulas on computers. The second focus of <br/>this project is on applications of the technique of wavelet analysis to <br/>problems in tomographic imaging. The term tomographic imaging"" refers <br/>to devices such as medical CAT scanners that form very sharp (much <br/>sharper than x-rays) non-invasive images of the inside of an object. Such <br/>imaging techniques are also used in industrial applications such as <br/>detection of cracks in metal structures. The principal investigator <br/>proposes to study the recovery of edge data in images directly from a <br/>wavelet-based edge analysis of their tomographic data. This would have <br/>the advantage of constructing an accurate edge picture of the original <br/>image without the distortion inherent in standard reconstruction schemes."
