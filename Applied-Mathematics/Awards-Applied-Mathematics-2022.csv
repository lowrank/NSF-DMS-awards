Wave turbulence is manifested in many physical systems, including familiar water waves, water surface gravity and capillary waves, and a great variety of waves in plasmas (in particular, in fusion devices). A Bose-Einstein condensate is a state of matter that was first predicted theoretically in 1924 and produced experimentally in 1995. While quantum phenomena are exhibited on micro-scales, and nature is well described on macro-scales by classical mechanics, for a Bose-Einstein condensate macroscopic quantum phenomena become apparent. The quantum kinetic theory that describes some physical properties of this state of matter is the second subject of this research. Although wave turbulence and quantum kinetics are dramatically different as physical phenomena, their mathematical description uses similar equations. Despite the widespread applications of these kinetic equations, little is known rigorously in this field. The aim of the project is to develop mathematical techniques and apply them to concrete physical situations, leading to a more profound understanding of both wave turbulence and quantum kinetics.<br/><br/>The project is aimed at developing the theory of the existence, uniqueness, finite-time condensation, and relaxation to equilibrium for strong solutions of the kinetic equations. The principal investigator will address the local-in-time existence via techniques of harmonic analysis and novel Strichartz-type estimates. For important questions related to 3-wave wave turbulence, regularity theory for the kinetic equation with a particular broadening (regularization) of the resonance set will be used. This research project is informed by several sub-fields of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and the work has potential applications in optical turbulence, oceanography and atmospheric sciences, and quantum physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rather than a few central outlets (TV channels, newspapers) acting as a common and external frame of reference, many now derive their information through interaction on social platforms. Therefore, the dynamics of opinion formation have become more self-organized where large scale behaviors emerge as a result of local interactions without a central authority, similar to a flock of birds or a shoal of fish. But how are opinions formed in social networks? Is the structure of social networks a reaction of the users' opinions or does the network shape the users' opinions? One of the key motivations for this project is the following paradox: while the use of social media has supposedly increased the connectivity among individuals, opinions have become more polarized; homophilic ""echo chambers"" appear to be a ubiquitous feature of the structure of social media. These observed behaviors call for a close examination of the interplay between social media interaction and the dynamics of opinion formation at scale in order to better understand the rise of polarization and echo chambers. This project will also provide research and mentorship opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>As an emergent behavior, the underlying dynamics of opinion formation is unknown and cannot be derived from physical principles. Thus, the framework developed in this project is interdisciplinary at its core and combines both mathematical modeling (dynamical systems, graph theory) and data acquisition and analysis (natural language processing, sentiment analysis, clustering algorithms). This project will investigate novel dynamical systems modeling the interplay between a graph and a system of opinions. The aim is to characterize conditions resulting in polarization, consensus, or a transition between these two states. Then, experimental data will be extracted from the major social media platforms using a variety of data capture techniques. The resulting measurements will allow for an investigation of how the network structure of social media and the distribution of its user's opinions change overtime, providing insight into the interplay between these two dynamics. The ultimate goal is to refine the modeling pursuit with experimental data in order to investigate what is driving the observed trend towards polarization. Finally, using models validated with empirical data, the project will investigate various strategies aimed at reducing polarization and enhancing the natural flow of various opinions within a large audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their uses range from the strongest components on airplanes to the smallest sensors and proteins in living materials.  When polymers are suspended in solvent with ionic materials such as salt, as is typical in biological applications, the resulting interactions are among the most complex in all of nature. This investigation will derive and analyze models for the entropic and enthalpic interaction of diblock polymers in suspensions as a prototype of lipids in biology.  It aims to identify the role of polymer substructure on the self-adhesion tendencies of charged polymers that lead to self-assembly of complex biological organelles, such as the thylakoid membranes that drive photosynthesis in plants and the Golgi apparatus that is vital to protein manufacture and transport in humans.  The project is intended to illuminate the role of hydrophobic-hydrophilic phase separation on the detailed structure of lipid bilayers and its impact on membrane permeability. Most significantly, new methods will be investigated for the casting of lamellar membranes destined for water purification applications that combine microfluidic flow with the systems? natural phase separation tendencies. The project includes training for undergraduate and graduate students through involvement in the research.<br/> <br/>Functional polymers contain charged or polarizable groups that induce strong interactions with solvent and with other polymers. System behaviors become increasingly complex when several types of polymers or multiple solvents are combined. This project addresses a broad scaling limit that renders fundamental systems amenable to analysis. This arises from free energy landscapes of polymer systems that combine entropy, enthalpy, and pressure. Pressure is large and enforced through incompressibility. Enthalpy is smooth, entropy is singular in key regions. The singular enthalpy limit is an approach that resolves the connection problem for optimal packings of diblock polymers by patching linear enthalpic flows to the stable and unstable manifolds of fixed points from a vicinity of the singular entropy domain to find points of intersection. Robust families of connection solutions lead to novel interface flows in the sharp-interface limits, including adhesion effects. Establishing linear convexity will allow for rigorous sharp-interface reduction. Incorporation of flux leads to weakly heteroclinic connections that parameterize the response of bilayers to pressure gradients, leading to determination and control of membrane permeability. The focus on self-assembly of charged polymers and the stacking behavior of the associated bilayer vesicles have broad application to photosynthesis, through thylakoid membranes, and the behavior of organelles such as the Golgi apparatus. The formation of lamellar membranes at interfaces between immiscible fluids is relevant to membranes for water purification systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, fast and accurate predictions of weather phenomena (both terrestrial and solar), ocean dynamics, and groundwater flow are vital to economic growth and stability.  These predictions typically incorporate computer simulations of mathematical models; however, to make accurate predictions, these models need to be properly ""initialized""; that is, they need to know the current state of the system very precisely and the models need to be adjusted based on actual observations of the system in question.  For example, in order to accurately predict the weather, models often require the current state of the weather to be known on the scale of a few inches, but weather observation stations are often spaced several miles apart.  Since weather is a highly chaotic phenomenon, small errors in the observations and/or sparsity in the actual observations can lead to significant errors in the predictions.  To address this issue in the past several decades a collection of techniques known as ""data assimilation"" have been developed.  Data assimilation incorporates observational data into the mathematical model of the system of interest in order to drive the prediction to the correct state.  However, the standard data assimilation techniques, known as the Kalman filter and four-dimensional variational (4D-VAR) approaches, are very computationally costly, and major challenges still exist when adapting them to complex systems.  Recently, a new algorithm for data assimilation, known as the Azouani-Olson-Titi (AOT) algorithm has emerged as a fast, robust, highly accurate technique which is easy to adapt to a wide variety of models, and which is computationally inexpensive to add to an already existing computational model.  This project will not only extend and improve the AOT algorithm, but it will also use new ideas and technologies invented by the PIs and coauthors to adapt the AOT framework to learn more about the underlying mathematical model itself, further improving predictive capabilities.  This project fosters mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, interdisciplinary research, and interaction with national labs.  The impacts of this project will be far-reaching and will pave the way for new techniques which will greatly speed up data assimilation in simulations of highly complicated fluid flows, introduce novel techniques for parameter learning and model reconstruction, and provide a computational approach to investigating fundamental mathematical problems. The computational technologies and mathematical tools developed will be useful to scientists and engineers in other fields as well.<br/><br/>This project builds on previous work of the PIs on the AOT algorithm, which showed that this algorithm can be adapted to learn the (unknown) parameters of the system, and even the form of the model itself, while simultaneously recovering the ""true"" state of the system. Extensions of the preliminary work will be carried out, and rigorous justification for convergence of the algorithm will be completed for physically interesting systems, including noisy data and sparse-in-time observations. In addition, several extensions of AOT itself will be numerically tested and rigorously investigated: nudging for intermittent observations, as well as nudging based on moving observers. AOT will also be implemented and tested for a multi-physics large-scale model of the Earth's oceans, for the Richards equation for soil moisture, and for a simplified fluids experiment using real-time collected data. This project will optimize observer requirements for better accuracy, significantly lowering costs. The methods described here have the potential to reduce production and computational cost for experiments, making them more useful to researchers working on real world problems. Moreover, novel proof methods will be developed to prove convergence in the cases of nonlinear AOT algorithms, AOT-based on moving observers, AOT-based model recovery, temperature-based AOT, and extensions of AOT to geophysical settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim is to characterize the large-time behavior of solutions of complex-type nonlinear equations in mathematical physics, which describe wave propagation in quantum systems and nonlinear optics models, among others. Finding the possible asymptotic states of such systems is critical to both qualitative and quantitative understanding of the physical phenomena and to applications. For example, the fundamental question in quantum mechanics of finding the breakup components of a molecule that is perturbed by a laser pulse is of this type. Similarly, the energy loss of light pulses moving a long distance in an optical fibre and the effects of time dependent noise on the stability of quantum and optical devices are examples.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to ?nd the asymptotic behavior and other properties of the solutions for a general class of nonlinear Schrödinger equations. A key part of the project is to ?nd all possible asymptotic states. This is an exceedingly di?cult task for nonlinear equations, and results of general nature are scarce. The complexity of the equations considered necessitates di?erent analytical, computational, and numerical tools. A combination of modern functional analytic methods and physical insights will be developed. In the case of spherical symmetric initial data and perturbation term, which can also depend on time and space variables, the goal is to show that the solutions break into a free wave and a (weakly) localized part and to derive the properties of the localized part.

Online dictionary learning (ODL) is a mathematical formulation that emulates the human ability to extract patterns in real time. ODL has found fruitful applications in various domains such as text analysis, image reconstruction and denoising, medical imaging, and bioinformatics. However, existing theories and algorithms for ODL are facing significant challenges in coping with modern streaming data. This project will advance both the theoretical understanding and algorithmic capacities of existing ODL methods. More specifically, the project will address challenges in handling streaming data with multi-modal attributes, partial labels for further classification or inference tasks, and heterogeneous structure in the form of networks. This project will also involve interdisciplinary collaboration and provide research opportunities for students at all levels. <br/><br/>The project aims to advance the theory and algorithms of ODL in the following aspects: 1) Obtain the worst-case rate of convergence and iteration complexity of generalized ODL algorithms to stationary points for a stream of structured signals under Markovian dependence; 2) Devise supervised ODL algorithms for learning class-discriminating dictionaries from labeled streaming data with provable convergence guarantees and rate of convergence; 3) Use the theory and algorithm for supervised ODL with tensor-valued signals to develop methods of supervised and temporal network dictionary learning, where the former will learn discriminative basis subgraphs from network data for network classification and denoising applications and the latter will learn basis subgraphs and their time-evolution for reconstructing given temporal or multilayer networks. A key element is the development of stochastic majorization-minimization type algorithms that can handle complex surrogate functions depending on data type using block-minimization and regularization techniques. This project will also provide students with research experiences in optimization, machine learning, and network science. Specific topics for undergraduate research experience will include generating a repository of optimal network dictionaries for various real-world networks, network-level regression and inference experiments with biological networks, and temporal brain network analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematical modeling of these effects lies at the intersection of applied mathematics and statistical physics, and it involves the study of kinetic equations, a class of nonlinear partial differential equations that captures the behavior of large number of particles in terms of the particle density. This project concentrates on two specific kinetic equations: the first describes the time evolution of the particle distribution when particles interact through binary collisions that can occur at very large microscopical distances, the second arises in the statistical description of charged quantum particles. The intent is to validate the fidelity of these models to the physical systems by studying the qualitative properties of their solutions, to ensure that a temporary breakdown of the models does not occur. The project will provide training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/> <br/>The project aims at expanding the mathematical understanding of the dynamics of collisions in dilute gases and plasma by analyzing two kinetic partial differential equations. The first is the Landau equation, which describes the time evolution of the particle distribution when particles interact through binary collisions of grazing type. The second is the Landau-Fermi-Dirac equation, which arises in the statistical description of charged quantum particles. Both equations present challenges due to nonlinear terms, nonlocal features, and degenerate coefficients. The first part of the project deals with the qualitative properties of solutions, such as global well-posedness and finite time blow-up, characterization of the long-time behavior, and connection with macroscopic fluid equations. The second part concerns the validity of the Landau-Fermi-Dirac approximation as a correction to the Boltzmann equation in the grazing regime.

Developing efficient and operational protocols for optimal mass transport and mixing, heat transfer, and for identifying the attributes and long-time behavior of flow-transport related dynamical models, especially under limited experimental data and/or resources, has attracted increasing attention in both academic and industrial communities.  This research aims to place these problems within a flexible and rigorous mathematical system and control framework, and to develop solution strategies based on infinite dimensional system control and estimation tools. This research will support the investigator?s long-term career goals of promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and education among different research groups at the institution by advancing knowledge and exploring real-world applications.

The fundamental equations of fluid mechanics describe many natural phenomena, including the motion of air in weather modeling, the lift of an airplane, mixing of fluids with applications in industry, flow of liquids through pipes, generation of electricity through wind and water, and the flow of blood through the body. The full equations are too difficult to solve explicitly or even by computer, hence mathematical attention focuses on properties of the equations. Such properties include whether solutions for given initial conditions exist for a long time or break down in finite time; whether solutions are stable and can be predicted with small errors, or fundamentally unstable and unpredictable; and the validity of simplifying approximations used to make the equations more manageable. These questions are difficult and longstanding. For instance, the question of long-time existence for the idealized three-dimensional fluid equations has remained open for well over a century. Both analysis and geometry have been used to study such questions, and the primary goal of this conference is to bring together senior and junior researchers with expertise in these two areas to share perspectives, techniques, and results, and to train the new generation of mathematicians.<br/><br/>The workshop will feature a mathematically diverse group of speakers whose expertise spans multiple relevant areas.

In practice, the number of particles, and therefore the complexity of the system, ranges beyond the capabilities of the best computing resources. This project aims to achieve a substantial reduction in computational complexity through a statistical point of view, focused on the probability of finding at a given time a particle in the system at a certain position in space and moving with a certain velocity.

Precipitous losses of Arctic sea ice affect not only the polar marine environment, but can impact, for example, weather patterns, ocean currents, storm tracks, and precipitation amounts in the Northern Hemisphere. As a material, sea ice is a multiscale composite of pure ice with millimeter-scale brine inclusions and centimeter-scale polycrystalline microstructure. Even the ice pack itself is a granular composite of ice floes in a sea water host. A principal challenge in modeling sea ice and its role in climate is how to use information on small scale structure to find the effective or homogenized properties on larger scales relevant to process studies and coarse-grained climate models. Also of interest is the inverse problem of recovering parameters controlling small scale processes from large scale observations, such as in remote sensing. These central issues are addressed in this project by exploiting special mathematical properties of effective parameters that are common to several important problem areas in sea ice modeling. They include fluid and electromagnetic transport through sea ice, diffusion processes like heat flux enhanced by brine convection, and ocean surface waves in the ice pack.  Sea ice shares close similarities with other naturally occurring and engineered composites. Our mathematical results on sea ice will give new insights and findings about other composite materials, and vice versa. This research will help to advance how sea ice is represented in climate models and improve projections of the fate of Earth's sea ice packs and the ecosystems they support. This project will also provide support, training, and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. <br/> <br/>A powerful approach in the mathematical theory of homogenization is the analytic continuation method, which provides integral representations for the effective parameters of composite materials, treated as Stieltjes functions of their parameters. The complexities of composite microgeometries are distilled into the spectral properties of self-adjoint operators, like the Hamiltonian in quantum physics, which become random matrices when the system is discretized. Early applications of the method to sea ice focused on remote sensing and electromagnetic properties, with sea ice treated as a two-phase composite. Extensions of the method to polycrystalline media, advection diffusion processes, and surface waves through the ice pack have yielded only elementary bounds on the effective parameters, based on the coarsest information like the mass of a spectral measure in the integral, which is the brine volume fraction for sea ice as a two-phase composite, or the area fraction of ocean covered by ice floes for surface waves. However, exploiting deep parallels with random matrix theory descriptions of quantum physics brings Anderson transition concepts like field localization, mobility edges, eigenvalue repulsion, and band gaps into homogenization for classical transport in two-phase composites. In the funded work we will explore new insights that this approach can give us in the above problem areas, where the effective parameters are Stieltjes functions. For example, how do sea ice effective properties depend on crystal size and structure, can some ocean waves be localized by the ice pack geometry, and how does the fractal nature of composite geometry influence effective transport and spectral properties. This approach opens many questions of mathematical interest, while at the same time provides novel tools to address questions of critical importance in understanding sea ice processes in the rapidly changing polar marine environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study synchronization in systems with group interactions. In addition to advancing basic understanding of synchronization processes, the theories and techniques developed in this project will facilitate prediction and control of synchronization patterns with potential benefits in many areas of science and engineering.

These mechanisms are always present in our ocean and atmosphere, as well as that of other planets. They are collectively responsible for many well-known phenomena that we observe in nature, e.g., jet streams, zonal jets, the El Niño cycle, and Jupiter's Great Red Spot, to name only a few. These mechanisms typically serve to constrain the motion of the fluid in a very particular way. For instance, it is observed that in a rapidly rotating fluid in three-dimensions, particles that are aligned along a common vertical parallel to the axis of rotation move nearly in unison, thus rendering the overall motion of the flow to be essentially two-dimensional. Despite many experimental and computational efforts to understand the precise development of such phenomena, the mathematical justification for them, that is, from directly studying the equations of motion themselves, remains largely open. This project will systematically address such concerns in various geophysical settings. This project will also provide research and mentorship opportunities for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as postdoctoral scholars.<br/><br/>An overarching goal of this project is to understand various manifestations of finite-dimensionality and its interconnections with the mechanisms of dissipation, rotation, and stratification. The main approach will be through the study of the regularity and long-time behavior of solutions to the associated equations of motion that allow one to obtain precise quantitative relations between the parameters representing the strength of these various mechanisms with the smallest relevant length scales of the fluid flow. The main models of interest will be those that arise naturally in geophysics such as the rotating Navier-Stokes equations and the stably stratified Boussinesq equations. In order to properly quantify the effects carried by rotation and stratification, anisotropic dispersive estimates, and careful analyses of resonance structures inherent in such systems will be carried out. A novelty of this project is the interplay between physical space- and frequency space-based approaches. Although both approaches have seen success in studying the regularity of solutions, the frequency space-based approach is well-suited for quantifying the number of degrees of freedom, while the physical space-based approach is well-suited for exploiting information about the spatial analyticity radius. This project attempts to merge these two approaches in ways that allow one to jointly exploit the reductions in dimensionality in both physical-space and frequency-space that is observed in rotating or stratified fluid flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such systems occur in medicine (liver perfusion, lymphatic circulation, the closing and opening of heart valves), geomechanics (fracture propagation, coupling between the surface and groundwater flows), and other applications. Numerical simulations of such systems are based on discrete approximations to the governing equations. To accurately describe the dynamics, interface tracking methods, in which the nodes of the computational mesh are aligned with the parametric representation of the interface, are often used. However, interface-tracking methods rapidly become difficult to apply when domain deformations are large. To prevent numerical failures, computationally expensive mesh regenerations or similar techniques are necessary when mesh elements become highly skewed. The diffuse interface method is an alternative strategy based on a fixed mesh approach. For this method, the model is reformulated using a phase-field function that smoothly transitions from zero in one region to one in the other region. The computational mesh nodes do not have to be aligned with the interface, whose location is now captured using the phase-field function. This approach is useful even when the domain does not change in time, or in cases where the interface between the two regions is difficult to determine exactly, or when the geometry of the interface is complex. However, the diffuse interface method introduces an additional error at the interface, which needs to be carefully controlled. This project aims to establish mathematical foundations for application of the diffuse interface method in fluid dynamics. The techniques developed in this work are expected to be applicable to other coupled systems involving fluids and poroelastic and/or elastic structures as well. The project includes training of graduate students through involvement in the research.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of mathematical theory and numerical methods for the diffuse interface method applied to coupled systems in fluid dynamics.

The aim is to further our understanding of certain phenomena by utilizing rigorous and quantitative mathematical results. Numerical simulations will also be used in parts of the project. The phenomena that will be studied are motivated by applications to real-life problems with potential societal impacts and are characterized by the presence of singularities and the coupling between different length and time scales. In the first part of the project, the exchange between walls and incompressible fluids will be considered by studying the effect of injection and suction on fluid flow and the effect of the motion of multiple bodies immersed in the fluid and their possible collisions, as in debris flow and sedimentation. In the second part of the project, the object of investigation will be how an incompressible flow transports and deforms directional objects, as in magnetic and conducting fluids, and the interplay between mixing and diffusion, as in biological processes. The last part of the project concerns modeling of faults buried deep in the Earth's crust and their monitoring using data from Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and satellites, with the ultimate goal of predicting the onset of seismic events. The project provides also training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, particularly members of under-represented groups.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is the study of various problems modeled by partial differential equations concerning the behavior of incompressible fluids and elastic solids, using analytic and geometric techniques. The problems under investigation are motivated by fundamental physical phenomena and bring about challenging mathematical questions, such as fluid-structure interaction problems in the presence of collisions, and non-local and non-linear interface conditions for elastic dislocations. The project is divided into three main parts. The first part concerns the behavior of inviscid and slightly viscous fluids with boundary injection and suction, which can be used to control turbulent flows in pipes and channels and stabilize the viscous boundary layer. The motion of rigid bodies in a viscous fluid when slippage is allowed will also be studied, with applications to debris flow and sedimentation. The second part concerns measures of mixing and stretching for transport of vectors  by a flow, such as in magneto-hydrodynamics, and enhanced dissipation for degenerate operators, with applications in electro- and thermo-rheological fluids and mathematical biology. The third part concerns seismic faults and fault monitoring using GPS and satellite data. Progress on these problems is likely to have impact in other fields, such as geophysics and engineering. The presence of multi-scale effects and singularities gives cohesiveness to the project. While its focus lies on analytic results and techniques, several of the proposed problems, such as optimal mixing and modeling of faults, have a natural computational counterpart that will be addressed together with  collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will focus on the mathematical analysis of migration patterns of interfacial layers and microfluidic flows in novel materials to understand their mechanisms and predict their patterns. Providing accurate theoretical predictions of their evolution will advance, for instance, the design of microfluidic devices and lower manufacturing costs. The training of undergraduate students and high school students will be integrated into this interdisciplinary research project.<br/><br/>The first scientific goal of this project is to develop a novel decomposition for bulk-interface interactive dynamics and use it to predict the pattern formation of a multilayer transition profile. Using quantitative estimates based on the global stability of partial differential equations with dynamic boundary conditions and a reduced invariant manifold for the slow-motion persistence of the multilayer pattern, the main intent is to show that the coupled bulk dynamics does not destroy the slow-motion pattern of material defects at the leading order. The second goal is to systematically generalize Onsager?s linear response principle to obstacle problems for interactive dynamics with topological changes. The investigator aims to derive a new phase field model for geometric motions of microfluidic flows, which automatically builds in migration mechanisms of interfacial layers whenever topological changes happen.

Exotic quantum states of matter present under extreme conditions (low temperatures, strong magnetic fields) exhibit symmetries that resist a simple geometric description. Rather, their symmetries are understood through topology: qualitative geometry in which angles and lengths are ignored.  The study of topological states is as important for their application to quantum technologies as for understanding the physical world.  Of particular interest are the applications in quantum information.

Two key themes in quantum symmetries are braided fusion categories and motion group representations: the first models the topologically invariant features of topological phases of matter, and the second encodes the topological dynamics of anyons and loop-like excitations.  Understanding how the models are related through symmetries and phase transitions will provide a clearer picture of the landscape of topological phases of matter.  In a complementary direction, the investigator will develop methods to understand the physically relevant representations of the braid group and higher dimensional generalizations.

Improved thermal transport technologies are an important part of efforts to improve overall energy efficiency. Common methods of thermal transport enhancement involve inserting passive or active obstacles in flows or increasing the roughness of walls. These methods can enhance mixing of fluid both near and away from heated surfaces but also increase the power needed to drive the flow, so the net gain in efficiency is often limited. New ways of manipulating flows may yield superior heat transfer efficiency. This project will develop a systematic approach to identify useful flows and the forcing that generates them. The approach adapts constrained optimization methods for partial differential equations (PDE) that have been used recently to estimate upper bounds on rates of heat transfer by natural convection. By modifying the flow domain geometries, boundary conditions, constraints, and numerical methods, this project will identify effective flows in new settings relevant to engineering applications and understand the physical mechanisms underlying their effectiveness. In addition, this project will provide support and research training for graduate students and summer research experiences for undergraduate students, and outreach activities for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>This project will discover improved flows for thermal transport enhancement in four fundamental areas. It will extend the existing steady 2D method to efficiently compute optimal unsteady 2D flows in benchmark geometries such as channel flows and closed and open domains between hot and cold surfaces. It will also develop computational methods for optimal flows in 3D domains that are analogous to the 2D domains we have studied and determine the gains from 3D flows relative to 2D flows in comparable domains. In model heat sink arrays, the heat transferred by Navier-Stokes flows with oscillatory driving to that for the optimal steady and unsteady flows will be compared. In addition, this project will also characterize the optimal flows for ?hot spots,? relevant to processor cooling, by changing the objective function to an approximation of the maximum temperature in the domain.

Mathematically predicting solution behavior provides a mechanism for predicting real-world system behavior, and also for predicting how such behavior will change as system parameters are varied. Stable states are attracting, and thus stable states are those that are mostly likely to be observed. Topological properties related to stability are those that are robust under sufficiently nice deformations, and can therefore be used to make predictions about large classes of systems, possibly without reference to the finer details of the equation under study. Although much is mathematically understood about models with only one space dimension, there are many interesting open questions about higher spatial dimensions, which is particularly relevant for applications. This project is focused on developing theoretical tools for predicting the long-time behavior of solutions to these types of equations. This project will also support efforts to train women PhD students and conduct outreach work, such as a week-long summer math camp for high school students. <br/><br/>This project is focused on developing theoretical tools for analyzing the dynamics associated with a large class of partial differential equations (PDEs), including reaction-diffusion equations and fourth-order systems such as the Swift-Hohenberg equation, in both one and higher spatial dimensions.

There are two primary goals: (i) Investigating topological implications for stability in higher-order PDEs and systems of PDEs; and (ii) Analyzing solutions to PDEs in spatial dimensions greater than one. The first goal is connected with the results of classical Sturm-Liouville theory for scalar, second order eigenvalues problems. However, for fundamental reasons that theory cannot be directly extended to higher-order systems, and so truly new methods must be developed. The second goal will be achieved by developing a useful spatial dynamics, which refers to treating a distinguished spatial variable as a time-like evolution variable,  for systems in multiple spatial dimensions.

While the visible part of medical imaging comprising the imaging devices is based on engineering and physics, the image formation and retrieval of pertinent information relies on sophisticated mathematical models and efficient computational methods. This project will address two specific imaging problems, breast cancer screening and stroke detection and classification. Breast cancer screening by mammography is a standard process. However, it is known that, in particular, when the breast tissue is dense, which is the case in 10-40 percent of US women, the risk that a radiologist misses a cancerous lesion is significant. The project will investigate a novel computational idea of using mammography images at different pressure levels and comparing the tissue displacements to estimate the elastic properties of the tissue that are known to be affected by certain cancer types that often remain undetected. Another medical imaging problem addressed in this project is stroke classification by a portable and inexpensive electrical impedance tomography device. It is known that the prognosis of ischemic stroke depends heavily on how early the therapy can be initiated. About 15 percent of stroke patients who made it to the hospital in time were diagnosed with a brain hemorrhage. The therapy meant for ischemic stroke patients would be fatal. A portable classification method suitable for an ambulance could be crucial for diagnosis to save many lives in an emergency. The idea is not new, but the mathematical and computational problems continue to be challenging. This project will focus on the computational challenges in the problems described above and in other mathematically similar problems that cover medical imaging. The results will also be useful in non-destructive material evaluation and geophysics, including other application areas. The project will also include a strong educational component through the involvement of graduate students who will work on their doctoral dissertations on topics central to the project. <br/><br/> The project will address mathematical and computational questions associated with the inverse problems of distributed parameters in the Bayesian computational framework, a general methodology that integrates the data with other information about the unknown that may be available. Distributed parameters such as electric conductivity of the brain tissue, or elastic properties of the breast tissue, are typically represented by coefficient functions of partial differential equations (PDEs) that relate these properties to the measurements corresponding to boundary values or samples of the corresponding solution. In order to handle the mathematical model numerically, a discretization of the model is necessary. The discretization of a continuous model for computing the numerical solution is an approximation of the exact model. Therefore, it introduces a discrepancy between the ideal and computational models. These problems are sensitive to any perturbation of the data. Thus even a small modeling error may have disastrous effects on the algorithms if not properly addressed. Therefore, controlling the modeling error in inverse problems will be crucial and challenging. In the approach proposed in this research project, discretization of the continuous model will be based on an underlying metric, coupled with the unknown through a hierarchical Bayesian model. The underlying discretization metric itself will be modeled as an unknown, and its estimation will be part of the inverse problem. The two selected medical imaging applications will serve as outstanding test problems for the methodology, and because of their importance, they will justify the theoretical effort of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting framework will greatly expand the applications of OT methods with multiple marginals. The project will also include an important application, estimating the group behavior of a large population with aggregate measurements. The measurements are aggregated in the sense that the individuals in the population/group are indistinguishable from each other. Such measurement may occur due to privacy issues where the identities of the individuals are unrevealed. This study will be potentially applicable to studying the disease spreading in a large population.

Unlike bi-marginal OT, which has been widely used in applications, the use of multi-marginal OT has been hindered by its notorious computational complexity that typically grows exponentially as the number of marginals increases. Still, the complexity of multi-marginal OT can be alleviated by exploiting the structures of its cost function. The project will focus on an important type of cost structure that encodes the marginals as nodes in a graph. Many multi-marginal OT problems such as the Wasserstein barycenter and the incompressible Euler flow problems are associated with such graphical structures. This project will build on two seemly irrelevant subjects: optimal transport and probabilistic graphical models. The investigator will establish the overall framework of graphical OT by merging the two subjects, and systematically investigate the theoretical properties of graphical OT, particularly in the setting with continuous state variables.

Finally, the investigator will apply the framework to a representative application known as inference with aggregate measurements. In this type of inference problem involving a large population of individuals, the observations are aggregated in the form of distributions, and the problem can be formulated as an entropy regularized multi-marginal OT problem whose cost tensor is associated with a hidden Markov model.

This interaction between arterial walls and incompressible blood flow is mathematically realized by a composite (multilayered) FSI PDE precisely of the type under consideration in this project. In addition, this project will focus on those FSI PDE models, generally composed of elastic dynamics coupled to compressible or incompressible Stokes or Navier Stokes fluid flows, that are known to describe a variety of phenomena seen in civil engineering: for instance, the interaction of fluid or gas flows with displacing elastic membranes, and the aerodynamics of structures such as bridges and tall buildings. For such FSI dynamics, the focus of the project research will be the development of a continuous and numerical approximation theory, relevant to cases when the fluid flow PDE component manifests the Navier-Stokes nonlinearity, as well as when nonlinearities emanate from the plate PDE component. This project will also provide research training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. Moreover, to promote study in the STEM fields, this project will include K-12 outreach activities.<br/><br/>This research entails the development of novel methodologies to address issues of existence, uniqueness, longtime behavior, and numerical approximation of solutions to multilayered FSI systems.

This project anticipates that the mixed variational approaches to wellposedness noted in (II.i) will give rise to implementable numerical approximation schemes for the solutions of multilayered FSI systems, with faster convergence rates than those in the existing literature, and with less computational cost. Moreover, the boundary controllability project work noted in (II.ii) is consonant with certain fluid mechanical applications; namely, the intent of the boundary control law is to induce a mixing of the fluid velocity within its 3D chamber, to ultimately attain a nonchaotic or quiescent flow state.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Together with technological innovations, mathematical approaches have been instrumental in advancing these techniques. The project will address mathematical problems arising from two promising tomography techniques: Multi-energy Computed Tomography (MECT) and Compton Camera Imaging (CCI). Both methods are highly useful in imaging applications. MECT is an x-ray transmission imaging method that uses the energy dependence of x-ray attenuation to determine the elemental composition of an object of interest. The conventional single-energy CT uses a simplified (linear) model for x-ray transmission, and thus, produces a grayscale image revealing only the morphology of scanned objects. In contrast, MECT can provide quantitative information and visualization in color, as a result of the more accurate modeling. MECT is regarded as a reinvention of CT imaging and is anticipated to have a significant impact on medical imaging in the coming years. Compton cameras have been used in astronomy as a telescope to detect atmospheric or cosmic gamma-ray sources. Pilot studies have shown that it can be used in a wide range of medical imaging applications, as well as radioactive decontamination. The result will also be useful in homeland security imaging for detecting illicit nuclear materials. Besides its practical benefits, the project will create opportunities for training, research experience, and career development for graduate and undergraduate students. It will also facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations.<br/><br/>Image reconstruction in MECT requires solving a nonlinear inverse problem, for which iterative approaches must be used because an analytical solution has yet to be discovered. Although developing image reconstruction algorithms in MECT has been a very active research area, the studies systematically analyzing the uniqueness and stability of inversion have been limited. In the current practice, the scan protocol yielding unique and stable reconstructions is primarily determined by examining the noise in images obtained from physical phantom experiments. A major goal of the project is to develop a systematic approach for the design of MECT scan parameters based on the stability estimates for the MECT measurement model. A major challenge for using Compton cameras in medical applications will be overcoming the complexity of image reconstruction. The investigator will develop effective and computationally efficient image reconstruction methods for Compton cameras as well as analyses for admissible detector geometries and measurement uncertainties. Numerical techniques for the assessment of the theoretical results of the project will also be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such averaging approach was first used to derive the Boltzmann equation that models the evolution of rarefied gases with predominantly binary interactions, and it has been successfully applied to derive kinetic equations modeling a wide range of applications, from gas and plasma dynamics to high atmosphere aerodynamics and collective behavior in social networks. This project will focus on two types of kinetic equations. The first type is a kinetic model which goes beyond binary interactions via incorporating a sum of higher order interaction terms, and as such serves as a basic model for a non-ideal gas.

The second part considers the long-time behavior, including the rate of convergence to the equilibrium, moment estimates, and propagation of smoothness versus formation of blow up in finite time, of the relativistic Landau equation.

By solving inverse problems, information can be gained about an unknown medium via indirect, incomplete, and often noisy measurements. A common example of this is seismic imaging, which uses seismic waves to probe the subsurface of the Earth, and is heavily utilized in oil and gas exploration as well as critical mineral exploration and subsurface CO2 sequestration. This imaging technique is based on measuring the arrival times of seismic waves and solving the wave speed through the planet.  The seismic wave speed depends on material properties, and thus recovering it provides information about the structure of the Earth. Fermat?s principle in physics states that a wave takes a path between two locations that can be traveled in the shortest time. Thus, the travel time of a wave defines a mathematical model for a distance, in which the distance between two locations is measured using a clock instead of a ruler. This type of physically-motivated mathematical framework is commonly studied in the field of differential geometry. This research further develops the mathematical theory of seismology by posing and solving increasingly realistic and complex inverse problems modeling planetary interiors. Serving as the theoretical foundation underlying applied seismology, the techniques and problems in this study will contribute towards better characterizing the Earth, it?s transmission of seismic events, and its deep interior structure. Additionally, this project will provide training opportunities for students and early career researchers.<br/> <br/>This project focuses on advancing three categories of geometric inverse problems with the common objective of achieving increased physical realism. This is done by fundamentally changing the geometric setting to be non-Riemannian. In the mathematical theory of indirect measurements, the Earth is commonly modeled by a Riemannian manifold with a boundary. Under this assumption, the corresponding inverse problem is to recover a Riemannian metric from the boundary distance function, that is the travel time of a wave between a pair of boundary points. However, Riemannian geometry as a mathematical framework is often an insufficient representation of the geophysical reality. To pursue physical accuracy, Finsler metrics are a good geometric model for the fastest qP-polarized waves in anisotropic elastic media. However, the class of all Finsler metrics is so large that travel time measurements alone cannot determine these metrics uniquely. For this reason, this project will investigate certain sub-classes of Finsler metrics arising from linear elasticity, specifically focusing on the Berwald metrics that have many Riemannian properties. Most importantly, they have a canonical Levi-Civita connection. The three categories of problems solved in this research will include: 1) non-Riemannian travel time problems with complete datasets, 2) travel time problems that consider partial datasets for both the sources and receivers, and 3) integral geometric problems in anisotropic media. These categories of problems are all interconnected and mutually supportive. Ultimately this work will guide the field of inverse problems towards increasingly realistic seismological scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The challenge is to understand how this network structure affects an algorithm?s ability to process and learn from incoming data. The specific machine learning algorithms considered in this project are reservoir computers, which are used to learn and make predictions regarding dynamic processes. Recent discoveries indicate that improving reservoir performance can be achieved by using a network with few internal connections, i.e., a thinned network, which results in reservoir responses that are highly diverse. This is similar to phenomena observed in crowdsourcing where the decisions made by a group improve when group members respond independently and where decisions worsen when group pressure homogenizes individual responses. The goal of this project is to develop a mathematical framework describing how extremely sparse networks can be ideal for processing information and how the aggregation of this processed information results in structures that are ubiquitous in real-world networks. Having an explanation that untangles the impact of structure on learning in reservoirs will give the much broader area of machine learning a mathematical foothold for doing the same, contributing to basic scientific research and advancing the goals of machine learning. The project will also support the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students from different backgrounds to help foster a new generation of applied mathematicians working at the intersection of dynamics, machine learning, and network science. This will be done in a stratified research environment where mathematical scientists and domain experts will mentor both graduate and undergraduate students and graduate students will help mentor undergraduates.<br/> <br/>More concretely, the project will lay the groundwork for building a rigorous framework describing the effect of network structure on reservoir accuracy with the goal of removing as much of the black-box nature of reservoirs as possible.  Taking inspiration from the social dynamics of crowdsourcing, one of the new perspectives the project hopes to infuse into this area of research is that collections of independently or nearly independently acting entities can be highly accurate in recreating the dynamics of complex systems. Towards this end the project aims to understand the distinction between processing data and aggregating data to train systems, which are often conflated in the analysis of machine learning algorithms but are easily separated in reservoir computers. A specific goal is to understand how response diversity is related to prediction accuracy and how to tune this diversity to improve learning in reservoir computers. The expected scientific benefit of the project is to provide new methods to analyze and specifically build reservoirs with decreased cost and increased predictive power using extremely sparse networks and to extend these principles to a larger class of machine learning algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the time-dependent laser-induced photoelectric effect, the investigator will apply a constructive mathematical technique to the photoionization models and the two-frequency models used in experiments, to fine-tune the photoelectric output and, in interdisciplinary work with experimentalists, to predict and optimize the processes. A second aim of the project is to determine the behavior of physical and mathematical models outside the range of perturbation theory, with the highest possible level of accuracy and confidence, when only a limited number of terms of a perturbation expansion can be calculated.

This information is important for designing novel mechanical metamaterials with desired characteristics that enable applications in soft robotics, morphing surfaces, reconfigurable devices, and mechanical logic, among others.

Since the goal of effective filtration is the removal by the filter of particles or impurities carried by the feed solution, fouling of the membrane is unavoidable, leading ultimately to filter failure. Improved understanding of the fouling mechanisms, critical in improving filter designs, is therefore the target of significant research efforts. In addition to considerations of how particles interact with and adhere to the membrane material, pore structure, size and shape are critical factors in determining filter functionality and efficiency. There is considerable industrial interest in designing and manufacturing efficient filters that allow for fine control of particle removal while maintaining a reasonable lifetime. Such filters typically have pore size that decreases in the membrane depth; and may incorporate varying degrees of connectivity between pores. Our work will use theoretical approaches (combined with experimental calibration) to study general networks of pores within filters and identify optimal pore network structures that maximize filter lifetime while meeting a prescribed impurity removal threshold. This project will also provide training and research and industrial experiences for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project addresses issues of flow and fouling in porous membrane filters, where the pore structure may be modeled as a network of connected (sufficiently slender) tubes. Working with industrial collaborators at W.L. Gore & Associates and with a team of students, the PIs will derive new predictive mathematical models to describe situations of practical importance. Our models will be formulated on arbitrary pore networks (where both the length and radius of pores can vary) and will describe fouling both by adsorption of small particulate contaminants at the pore walls, and by sieving of larger particles (with an arbitrary size distribution). We will study networks generated computationally (using a variant of the Random Geometric Graph construction) as well as real pore networks in non-proprietary manufactured membranes. We will also use methods from persistent homology (PH) to study connectivity features of such pore networks and how these evolve in time, to elucidate scaling relationships between geometric/topological features and filtration performance metrics. The work is of significant interest to our industrial collaborators, who will provide us with data and advise on industrial relevance via regular team meetings. This interaction will ensure that the project remains focused and will guarantee that we identify and address questions of real importance to applications. The experimental data provided will also allow us to identify appropriate ranges for unknown parameters in our models, and to test uncertain modeling assumptions. Additionally, we will formulate new modules for our Capstone Course in Applied Mathematics that will involve undergraduate students in the research by means of Monte-Carlo type simulations and persistent homology methods using available software libraries.

To avoid structural failures and predict their mechanical behavior, one needs to understand material mechanical behavior under loading, namely the rigidity, flexibility, buckling, and fracture of structures, and to derive the effective behavior of composites, which broadly speaking amounts to establishing tight bounds on a composite's effective properties.  Existing engineering thin structure theories mostly rely on formal asymptotic expansions and approximations, and while generally they predict the deformation and fracture of thin materials quite accurately, they fail to do so in some cases for reasons not well understood, since often there is not a mathematically rigorous and comprehensive mechanism for verification of the regime of validity, even when the structural geometry is simple. On the other hand, existing mathematical thin structure theories still contain several unsolved or unverified regimes concerning the geometry of the structure and the energy and loading magnitudes. This project aims to tackle these shortcomings in the modeling of deformation, buckling, and fracture of thin structures, by building new tools to obtain mathematically rigorous thin structure theories depending on geometric parameters of the structure, and to study composites and printed materials to derive new bounds on their effective properties.  The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The first part of the project deals with continuum and fracture mechanics. While the mathematical theory of deformation and rigidity for developable shells is well understood, it is less so for constant-sign Gaussian curvature shells and thin domains. At the same time the study of buckling of thin structures is known to be complex and underdeveloped. It is known that the linear geometric rigidity of shells with pinned thin faces depends on the Gaussian curvature of the shell, and this project aims at showing that this is indeed the case in the nonlinear setting too and at improving the theories for constant-sign Gauss curvature thin domains. The project plans also to tackle the modeling of buckling of thin structures by means of a new slender structure buckling theory, and, on the side of fracture mechanics, to derive a mathematically rigorous shell fracture Griffith theory for shells with vanishing or constant-sign Gaussian curvature. The second part of the project intends to derive new bounds on the effective properties of composites and printed materials, known as metamaterials, by means of the so-called extremal quasiconvex quadratic forms.

Nineteenth century researchers including Helmholtz and Kirchhoff wrote down a system of equations describing how point vortices---infinitesimal whirlpools---induce motion in a fluid, which in turn affects the motion of the vortices. A similar system exists that describes the more complex problem of vortex rings.  Both Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC), an exotic phase of matter first produced experimentally in the 1990s, and superfluids including liquid helium, can support point vortices and vortex rings. Recent experimental work has imaged interacting point vortices in a BEC, showing strong agreement with mathematical predictions. This project will mathematically investigate a number of phenomena in the interactions of point vortices, and in the closely-related problem of interacting vortex rings. In particular, there is a motion called the leapfrogging orbit in which a pair of vortex rings propagate along a line, periodically expanding and contracting while moving through each other (this is a well-known trick performed by cigar smokers with smoke rings). This is well understood in the case of two vortex rings, and computer simulations have generalized this phenomenon to three or more rings, but have not performed a full mathematical study. This project will perform the first detailed mathematical study of the generalized problem. It is likely impossible to write down exact formulas for these solutions, so numerical techniques will be essential, especially numerical continuation and bifurcation methods and a recently-developed method called Lagrangian descriptors, which allows us to see structure in otherwise opaque chaotic systems. A second problem will study a phenomenon called chaotic scattering of point vortices: A pair of vortices can be made to propagate at a constant speed along a straight line. Collisions between such pairs can lead to extremely complex dynamics which will be investigated using dynamical systems methods.<br/><br/>This project will apply techniques from dynamical systems to two classes of problems in the classical subject of the dynamics of interacting point vortices or vortex rings. The first is several generalizations of the problem of leapfrogging vortices, in which two pairs of vortices travel along a straight line while repeatedly and periodically widening, then narrowing, with one pair passing through the other, and the lead changing. This has been very well-studied for point vortices, but less well for vortex rings. The study aims to generalize this system to systems of three or more pairs of vortices (or three or more vortex rings), and to leapfrogging orbits in other geometries such as on the surface of a sphere. While limited numerical studies exist of such orbits, they remain unexplored mathematically. Hamiltonian reduction is the technique at the center of our understanding of the four-vortex system, leading two a two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian that is amenable to further analytical simplification. With larger sets of vortices, Hamiltonian reduction does not lead to systems of small enough dimension for the method to provide much insight, and other methods are required, including numerical continuation and bifurcation methods. The project will also make use of the newly-developed method of Lagrangian descriptors, although the size of the system means that choices need to be made about how to find surfaces in initial-condition space that will lead allow insight into the dynamics. The second class of problems is the chaotic scattering of colliding point vortex pairs. This system has some features in common with chaotic scattering studied in earlier NSF-sponsored research: a two degree-of-freedom system consisting of a slow dynamical system with a separatrix coupled to a fast dynamical system. However, the dynamics in this case are far more complex: there is no small parameter. Instead, the separation of time scales arises due to the dynamics but may not hold for all time. In the previous system, a separatrix describes how solutions escape to infinity, while the mechanism of escape here is still unknown.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These examples necessarily involve nonlinearity, which is when the rate of change of a quantity depends on the quantity itself.  A simple illustration of nonlinearity is the so-called Allee effect, where the reproduction rate of certain species is negative below a minimum population size, perhaps due to factors such as cooperative defense or mate limitation. Typically, nonlinearities present serious difficulties in the analysis of the model.  In the context of various scientifically relevant classes of partial differential equations, this project aims to develop an understanding of when a model can be approximated by a (simpler) linear one and, more generally, which essential features are required by a minimal model to faithfully represent the essential behavior of the original phenomenon.

These model systems exhibiting growth (reaction) and spreading (diffusion) in which an interface (front) forms and propagates with a constant speed.  Classically, these systems are divided into two categories based on the underlying mechanism driving the movement of the front: linear behavior far beyond the front ('pulled' fronts) or nonlinear behavior at the front ('pushed' fronts).  Often, the shape and speed of these fronts can depend strongly on intrinsic properties of the system, generally represented by a parameter.  As the parameter changes, the character of the fronts may change from 'pulled' to 'pushed' or vice versa. New advances stemming from the recent introduction of ideas such as relative entropy and quantitative steepness as well as a careful understanding of the regularity of equations have opened the door to a high level of precision in characterizing this pulled-pushed transition.

Physicists use them to model ocean currents, weather patterns and turbulent flows behind a commercial jet or ship. Most physicists and engineers believe that the smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations will not break down without external forcing. On the other hand, a recent study by the PI indicates that the Navier-Stokes equations could develop a catastrophic behavior if one starts with a highly symmetric but perfectly smooth flow. Such scenario corresponds to a ""perfect storm"" in which all things that could potentially go wrong indeed go wrong. Potentially singular behavior of the Navier-Stokes equations could post tremendous damage to our environment, affect the safety of our planes and ships, and our ability to do accurate weather forecasting. The purpose of this project is to investigate under what conditions the Euler and the Navier-Stokes equations may develop singular behavior. The understanding of this question would enable us to avoid catastrophic behavior of the fluid flows in nature. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop effective analytical and computational tools that would enhance our ability to model and predict various complex phenomena in nature so that we can have more confidence in the safety of commercial jets and ships, and weather forecasting.

The interdisciplinary training they receive in this project will be very important for their future careers in mathematics and science.<br/><br/>Whether the 3D incompressible Euler equations develop finite time singularities from smooth initial data has been a longstanding open question. Built upon the results obtained from the prior NSF support, this project aims at providing a rigorous proof of the potential finite time singularity in the 3D Euler equations with smooth initial data and boundary. A major approach of the research is to prove the existence and stability of an approximate self-similar profile with a small residual error for the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations. Numerical computations will first be conducted to construct an approximate self-similar profile with a very small residual error. A crucial step in the analysis is to obtain linear stability for the approximate self-similar profile through a dynamic rescaling formulation. Linear stability will be established by obtaining sharp functional estimates with appropriately chosen singular weights and using space-time estimates with computer assistance. The new techniques and tools developed during this project are likely to have an impact in the neighboring areas of mathematics. Another proposed project is to look for potential singular solutions of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations using specially designed initial data with periodic boundary conditions. The approach relies on using the dynamic rescaling formulation to solve the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations and to avoid the potential numerical instability induced by the frequent changes of the adaptive meshes in recent computations.

While there exist numerous techniques for approximating solutions to many types of PDEs, it is the case that certain problems of practical interest exhibit various types of pathology, which render many standard techniques either highly inefficient or unusable. Such situations often arise in the setting of nonlinear problems which are posed in high dimensions or exhibit singularities, such as in the study of solid-fuel combustion optimization, oil pipeline corrosion predictions, and high-frequency financial trading. This project intends to provide means of circumventing the aforementioned issues through the rigorous study and development of so-called structure-preserving deep neural networks (DNNs). While it has been experimentally observed that DNNs provide highly capable methods of approximating solutions to a large class of problems, it is the case that the theoretical justification of such observations is still in its early stage. To that end, this project will provide a much-needed theory for certain classes of high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs via a two-pronged approach: namely, explicit randomized methods will be constructed which demonstrate desired properties while simultaneously developing theoretical tools representing and studying a large class of objects via DNNs. This approach requires the use of numerous tools from applied mathematics, functional analysis, stochastic analysis, and novel DNN computations. This unique intersection of techniques will serve as the basis for the project's educational and training components, which aim to increase the presence of women, minorities, and other underrepresented groups in mathematical research. This goal will be accomplished through the training and mentoring first-generation and underrepresented students at both graduate and undergraduate levels.<br/><br/>This project aims to address the question of whether or not it can be rigorously proven that there exist DNNs to approximate solutions to a large class of high-dimensional PDEs without suffering from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). The demonstration that DNNs are able to represent solutions to certain classes of high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs with a prescribed accuracy while not suffering from the CoD will fill a gap in the existing theory regarding machine learning algorithms. While the current focus is on studying the expressibility of DNNs with regard to solutions of PDEs, it is the case that this work will also serve as the foundation for extending such studies to other types of problems. This project will extend the existing theory of multilevel Picard (MLP) approximation methods to more general high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs, focusing on preserving inherent qualitative structures. The study of MLP approximations will also result in novel theoretical results regarding various stochastic fixed-point equations. Finally, the proposed work will provide explicit details on how to construct CoD-free DNN representations of various mathematical objects while also exploring theoretical issues related to popular activation functions. These ideas will be utilized in proving DNN-representation results and will provide a deeper understanding of how activation functions affect optimality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Participation in the project will provide good training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project consists of two lines of research on the stochastic dynamical systems with partial observations. The first is concerned with the problem of statistical inference of unknown parameters in partially observed diffusion models. In particular, the PI will investigate the large-sample properties of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for partially observed diffusion models, and will develop approximation methods in the case of degenerate diffusions where the likelihood function cannot be computed directly. This research is motivated by the problem of estimating the unknown parameters in latent price models of market microstructure. The second line of research is concerned with the design of optimal contracts in the presence of information asymmetry between the principal and the agent. The information asymmetry that the PI will consider is different from the classical moral hazard type and stems from the difference in the exogenously given filtrations to which the actions of the principal and of the agent are adapted. Such optimal contract models lead to challenging stochastic control problems with informational constraints. The second line of research is motivated, in particular, by the problem of designing optimal brokerage fees in financial markets. The results of the proposed research will make significant contributions to both theory and applications. The first line of research (concerned with MLEs) is expected to advance the mathematical foundations of Statistics and to develop new computational methods for parameter estimation in partially observed systems. These results will be applied to specific problems in market microstructure (such as the reconstruction of the true unobserved price of an asset and the estimation of price impact) as well as to inference problems in other areas (e.g., Computational Neuroscience). The results of the second line of research (concerned with optimal contracts) will contribute to the theories of stochastic control and optimal contract design. These theoretical results, in particular, can be used to develop better understanding of the effects of intermediaries (brokers) on the financial markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Universality refers to situations in which the same or very similar wave patterns appear despite the waves being set into motion by quite different mechanisms, or even in quite different physical systems.  For instance, rogue waves on the sea surface are frequently characterized as consisting of a large central peak with a distinctive dip on either side.  It does not matter much the conditions under which the rogue wave appears ? the pattern is nearly always the same.  The aim of this research is to determine what patterns should be expected, as this knowledge can be used in applications ranging from device design to disaster mitigation, and why they occur.  Furthermore, because modeling is a process that involves numerous ad-hoc assumptions, it is important to understand which features predicted by a model are independent of those assumptions, and universality gets to the heart of this question.  Graduate students and early-career researchers will join the investigator in this study, which enhances its impact beyond scientific inquiry and into education and training of the next generation of scientists.  <br/><br/>Mathematically, the study of universality is related to asymptotic analysis, specifically involving double-scaling limits to localize the coordinates near a point of interest, while a parameter in the model or solution becomes large.  The investigator will study such double-scaling limits in various asymptotic models for nonlinear waves given by integrable evolution equations.  Broadening the scope slightly, several specific questions involving asymptotic analysis of mathematical models for nonlinear waves will be addressed, including (i) determining the small-dispersion asymptotics of solutions of the defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the intermediate long-wave and Benjamin-Ono equations; (ii) analyzing the features of a new family of transcendental solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation termed ""rogue waves of infinite order""; (iii) studying the degeneration of specific solution families of Painlevé equations.  The investigator will combine and further develop techniques from the fields of integrable systems and asymptotic analysis to address these questions.  Anticipated outcomes include a first proof of universal wave breaking in the defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation, new results on the small-dispersion asymptotic behavior of solutions of the intermediate long-wave equation (a nonlocal model for internal waves in stratified fluids interpolating between the shallow-water Korteweg-de Vries limit and the deep-water Benjamin-Ono limit), development of a new analytical technique for asymptotic analysis of nonlocal Riemann-Hilbert problems, and the discovery of new information about the solution space of Painlevé equations and the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim is to develop flexibility in design from the multitude of ways in which the layers can be placed relative to each other to achieve a desired interaction of optical and electromagnetic waves, ultimately delivering practical options for harnessing light.  The layering process naturally intertwines the geometrical structure of the layers with the mathematical equations for the underlying physics. This project focuses on the interaction of these mathematical objects with the intent of building a foundational theory of layered media. Because the investigation targets the underlying physical phenomena, its results will be applicable across the diverse aspects of society that rely on electromagnetic devices.   Students at the graduate and undergraduate levels will be integrated into a dedicated group of researchers from diverse backgrounds and will be given the opportunity to present their work at scientific conferences to help them broaden their scientific horizons and forge professional connections.<br/><br/>There is a physical and mathematical object that lies at the center of the investigations in this project, called the Fermi surface, which together with the associated Bloch surface contains core information about electromagnetic waves in crystalline or periodic materials, by encoding a relation between two fundamental physical quantities, energy (or frequency) and momentum (or wavenumber).  These objects are analytic or algebraic varieties, depending on the details of the periodic medium, and their structure encodes information about the layering method.  The layered materials can be either two-dimensional, such as multi-layer graphene sheets, or three-dimensional, where the layers are internal to the bulk and provide a sort of hidden degree of freedom.  Specific objectives are to establish connections between the layering method and the Fermi and Bloch varieties, particularly their reducibility and singularities; to analyze the resonant consequences of reducibility of these varieties; to classify internal symmetries that result in reducibility and the persistence of reducibility under symmetry breaking; to create novel bulk media by homogenization of layered graph models; and to apply these investigations to multi-layer graphene and other physically viable layered materials.

One of the defining characteristics of a turbulent fluid is its chaotic, seemingly unpredictable behavior. A widely recognized way to describe this chaotic behavior is by showing extreme exponential sensitivity with respect to initial conditions, commonly referred to as the ""butterfly effect,"" whereby tiny changes in the state of the fluid lead to very big changes after a short amount of time. Despite its fundamental nature, there are very few mathematical tools available for rigorously verifying exponential sensitivity in a given system, particularly in turbulent systems. This project aims to develop mathematical tools to prove this sensitivity for various models in fluid mechanics in the presence of a small amount of noise. Such noise is commonly used to model the effect of unpredictable environmental effects or small-scale fluctuations of particles. The goal of this project is to gain new insights into the unstable nature of fluid motion in the presence of such noise and how this instability manifests as chaotic and turbulent motion observed in nature. The project will provide opportunities to involve undergraduate and graduate students and the results of the research will be widely disseminated.<br/><br/>A rigorous analysis of positive Lyapunov exponents and the numerous unstable phenomena in deterministic fluid models is a daunting task and mostly appears to be out of reach of current mathematical analysis. Recently there has been significant progress in proving instability for stochastic systems related to fluid mechanics, including Galerkin truncations of the 2d stochastic Navier-Stokes equations and the Lagrangian flow associated with stochastic fluid models. This project focuses on several primary related directions: i) a study of instability and positivity of the Lyapunov exponent in Galerkin truncations for the stochastic complex Ginzburg-Landau equations ii) a study of cascading instabilities and bifurcations in the stationary measures for stochastically shear mode forced 2d Galerkin Navier-Stokes iii) a study of the emergence of the Batchelor scale in the advection diffusion equation with random mixing velocities. Each of these investigations requires developing tools from smooth ergodic theory of random dynamical systems to answer questions about instability. Several involve challenging hypoellipticity questions that can be studied using recently developed techniques from computational algebraic geometry. For instance, both the projects i) and ii) involve studying very challenging degeneracies in the hypoelliptic structure unique to the equations and require novel ideas and techniques to overcome these challenges. Project iii) on the other hand aims to give some insight into the limitations of small-scale formation in advection diffusion by smooth ergodic fluid motion. Overall, these projects aim to bring new perspectives and new techniques into the study of fluid instability and mixing in the presence of noise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The physical behavior around singularities is generally highly complex, posing great challenges to the efforts of understanding their formation, structure, and influence on neighboring regions. The knowledge of the nature of singularities is fundamental to predict a system?s behavior or to develop effective applications for a material. This project considers systems in continuum mechanics and materials science that can be described directly or indirectly by a class of partial differential equations (PDE). The main goals include developing novel mathematical methods for analyzing this class of PDE and applying such new methods to better understand the nature of their singularities. This project will offer research and training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students. <br/> <br/>Many nonlinear PDE modeling physical systems and materials can be formulated as differential inclusions. The nature of singularities in these problems is closely related to the rigidity and flexibility properties of the relevant differential inclusions. This project contains two main themes. The first theme aims to extend the general theory for rigidity and flexibility of differential inclusions, and to develop new analytical tools to study the rigidity and flexibility of scalar and systems of conservation laws viewed as differential inclusions. Specifically, the Eikonal equation and a two-by-two system of conservation laws for isentropic elasticity will be investigated as model problems. The investigator will combine methods from differential inclusions and hyperbolic conservation laws to advance the understanding of the structure of entropy solutions for systems and generalized entropy solutions for scalar equations. The second theme seeks to develop novel perspectives and analytical methods incorporating entropies, to study second order scalar and multi-valued problems in the calculus of variations, which are closely related to the Eikonal equation. Such problems arise in various physical settings, including thin films and layered elastic materials, liquid crystals, and self-organized convection patterns.

In fact, many networks vary over time. For example, contact networks change from one shape to another as people move around to meet different people. Friendship networks also vary over time on a longer timescale. Such temporal (i.e., time-varying) network data have been increasingly available, and mathematically founded methods that can efficiently summarize complex temporal network data to help enhance intuitive understanding of the data are desirable. The Principal Investigator (PI) will develop methods to map temporal network data to trajectories in a space. Specifically, the methods will enable representation of the network at a given time point succinctly as a point on the trajectory. This is a drastic reduction, but in this manner aims to capture gross properties of the data and potentially use them for data mining tasks such as visualization, anomaly detection, and discovery of hidden periodicity. The PI will then build mathematical foundations of the proposed methods and apply them to empirical data. The proposed methods are expected to find applications in online social network services, financial transactions, bibliographic citation data, neuroimaging data, and climate temporal networks, to name a few. Furthermore, the project outcomes are expected to encourage researchers in data science and engineering to work on various algorithms related to network embedding (e.g., use of deep learning architecture). In this manner, the project relates to multiple research communities and industries. <br/><br/>The methods to be developed in this project are temporal network embedding (TNE) methods. In contrast with most TNE methods available to date, in which one embeds nodes into a latent space, the class of TNE methods the PI will pursue is a mapping from the space of networks to a low-dimensional latent space. A fundamental challenge to TNE is that empirical data usually come in the form of a set of time-stamped events between pairs of nodes, which would generate an extremely sparse network at any given time, hampering sensible network analyses. To overcome this situation, the PI will combine the modeling framework called tie-decay temporal networks with a Nystrom family of general-purpose dimension reduction methods to establish a family of TNE methods. This particular combination of techniques will allow the PI to narrow down the methodological choice, such as which dimension reduction methods, network distance measures, and tie-decay functions should be used, as well as to facilitate efficient computations and mathematical investigations. The PI will then develop mathematical foundations of the proposed methods such as continuity, responses to Markovian inputs, and sensitivity to perturbation in the input data. Finally, the PI will showcase the methods by applying them to social and financial empirical data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, fast and accurate predictions of weather phenomena (both terrestrial and solar), ocean dynamics, and groundwater flow are vital to economic growth and stability.  These predictions typically incorporate computer simulations of mathematical models; however, to make accurate predictions, these models need to be properly ""initialized""; that is, they need to know the current state of the system very precisely and the models need to be adjusted based on actual observations of the system in question.  For example, in order to accurately predict the weather, models often require the current state of the weather to be known on the scale of a few inches, but weather observation stations are often spaced several miles apart.  Since weather is a highly chaotic phenomenon, small errors in the observations and/or sparsity in the actual observations can lead to significant errors in the predictions.  To address this issue in the past several decades a collection of techniques known as ""data assimilation"" have been developed.  Data assimilation incorporates observational data into the mathematical model of the system of interest in order to drive the prediction to the correct state.  However, the standard data assimilation techniques, known as the Kalman filter and four-dimensional variational (4D-VAR) approaches, are very computationally costly, and major challenges still exist when adapting them to complex systems.  Recently, a new algorithm for data assimilation, known as the Azouani-Olson-Titi (AOT) algorithm has emerged as a fast, robust, highly accurate technique which is easy to adapt to a wide variety of models, and which is computationally inexpensive to add to an already existing computational model.  This project will not only extend and improve the AOT algorithm, but it will also use new ideas and technologies invented by the PIs and coauthors to adapt the AOT framework to learn more about the underlying mathematical model itself, further improving predictive capabilities.  This project fosters mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, interdisciplinary research, and interaction with national labs.  The impacts of this project will be far-reaching and will pave the way for new techniques which will greatly speed up data assimilation in simulations of highly complicated fluid flows, introduce novel techniques for parameter learning and model reconstruction, and provide a computational approach to investigating fundamental mathematical problems. The computational technologies and mathematical tools developed will be useful to scientists and engineers in other fields as well.<br/><br/>This project builds on previous work of the PIs on the AOT algorithm, which showed that this algorithm can be adapted to learn the (unknown) parameters of the system, and even the form of the model itself, while simultaneously recovering the ""true"" state of the system. Extensions of the preliminary work will be carried out, and rigorous justification for convergence of the algorithm will be completed for physically interesting systems, including noisy data and sparse-in-time observations. In addition, several extensions of AOT itself will be numerically tested and rigorously investigated: nudging for intermittent observations, as well as nudging based on moving observers. AOT will also be implemented and tested for a multi-physics large-scale model of the Earth's oceans, for the Richards equation for soil moisture, and for a simplified fluids experiment using real-time collected data. This project will optimize observer requirements for better accuracy, significantly lowering costs. The methods described here have the potential to reduce production and computational cost for experiments, making them more useful to researchers working on real world problems. Moreover, novel proof methods will be developed to prove convergence in the cases of nonlinear AOT algorithms, AOT-based on moving observers, AOT-based model recovery, temperature-based AOT, and extensions of AOT to geophysical settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At a human scale, we encounter them daily in our cups of coffee or on the surface of a pond. Important examples at smaller scales include the flow of blood and air through our cardiovascular and respiratory systems, while examples at larger scales include the Earth's ocean and atmosphere or even the hot plasma on the surface of a star. Since free boundaries are so common and occur at so many scales, it is important to understand the role they play in fluid mechanics. The main scientific goal of this project is to contribute to the understanding of such free boundaries through the mathematical study of the partial differential equations that describe their dynamics. This involves not only the application of existing mathematical tools to these problems, but also the development of new tools and techniques, which in turn may be useful in the study of other problems. The project also aims to contribute to the development of the next generation of researchers at multiple levels: at the undergraduate level through the project's Summer Analysis Program, which will provide undergraduate research opportunities to eight students; and at the graduate level through graduate research and mentoring.<br/><br/>This project aims at studying fundamental questions of well-posedness and stability for two long-standing open problems in interfacial mechanics. The first is the contact line problem, which deals with the dynamics of a triple interface between a viscous fluid, a solid, and a vapor phase. This component of the project aims to verify the soundness of a recently proposed continuum model of contact lines. This has the potential to make a serious impact in the science of triple-phase junctions, to open many new lines of research, and to further the applications of contact line dynamics. From an analytic perspective, it will also create and further develop bridges between energy methods, the functional calculus of differential operators, and elliptic regularity theory, which will be useful in many other contexts. The second problem is the viscous traveling wave problem. While the existence of traveling wave solutions to the free boundary, incompressible Euler equations has been known for nearly a century, progress on the corresponding Navier-Stokes problem only began recently with the work of the PI and collaborators. The proposal aims to build on this work to construct traveling wave solutions in more general contexts and to study their dynamical stability and vanishing viscosity limits. It is important to account for the viscous case because, while many fluids have small viscosity (or more precisely, the fluid configuration has large Reynolds number), small does not mean zero, so all fluids experience some viscous effects. Developing the viscous theory also opens the possibility of connecting the viscous and inviscid cases through vanishing viscosity limits, which could potentially yield insight into the zoo of known inviscid solutions. In particular, it could lead to a selection mechanism for physically relevant inviscid solutions. This work will also contribute fundamental new tools in the theory of function spaces, which will be useful in other traveling wave problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of wave turbulence occur in classical surface water waves and also in quantum dynamical systems involving a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Even though wave fields describing the processes of random wave interactions in nature are enormously diverse, there is a common mathematical framework that models and describes the dynamics of spectral energy transfer through probability densities associated with weakly non-linear interactions in quantum or classical wave systems. The probability densities are solutions of wave kinetic (WK) equations, whose nonlocal interaction operators are of kinetic type. This project aims to tackle open challenges in the theory of nonlinear waves via the study of the associated wave turbulence theory. An integral part of the project is its educational component and the opportunities to involve students from all levels in the research. To this end, the principal investigator will organize summer schools for underrepresented and disabled K-12 students, design graduate courses on Partial Differential Equations, Wave Turbulence and Statistical Physics, and organize an undergraduate and graduate research internship program of excellence and a mathematics-physics conference for young researchers. In addition, the principal investigator will participate in the NSF RTG SMU summer undergraduate research program, with participants from both SMU and Texas Rio Grande Valley University (a Hispanic-serving institution) as well as the SMU Hamilton Undergraduate Research Scholars and the SMU Undergraduate Research Assistant Programs.<br/> <br/>This project concentrates on three main topics in WT theory.

Cryo-EM is a recent technique in biological imaging where a sample (typically a protein) is flash-frozen in a liquid solution and then directed with a low-intensity electron beam. Ptychography is a method of obtaining a high-resolution image by scanning across a sample with a moving mask. It can be applied in a number of contexts, including the imaging of live cells. Ultra-short pulse detection is a key ingredient in time-resolved ultrafast phenomena such as chemical reactions.

Interpreting what these changes mean for the health of our planet requires models that account for complex processes that act interdependently over immense ranges of length and time scales. The accuracy of global-scale climate models depends on the physics at the most fundamental scales, such as how the melting of ice depends on the shape of its interface with liquid water and the local temperature, salinity, and flow conditions. Applied and computational mathematics and mathematical modeling provide many methods that are well suited to addressing these problems. Applying such techniques and developing new ones specifically for ice melting can provide critical information needed to improve climate models. Better understanding the underlying physics and mathematics can also help to explain the diverse shapes and patterning of natural ice, which could allow local environmental conditions to be inferred from observations of ice. Investigating these important issues also provides opportunities to educate students and train researchers, thereby contributing to a workforce that is well prepared to tackle these and related problems.<br/><br/>These projects investigate the melting dynamics of ice through laboratory experiments, numerical simulations, mathematical modeling, and analysis. The general progression of the research program is from idealized settings such as melting of fixed bodies with simple initial forms in fresh water at fixed far-field temperature to increasingly elaborate situations involving changes in geometry, temperature, and salinity. Further extensions address additional couplings such as melting-induced motions of free ice. Experiments will focus on accurate measurement of ice-water interface forms and motions in laboratory settings where the initial geometry, far-field temperature, and salinity profiles can be controlled and systematically varied. Direct numerical computations will employ phase-field methods to simulate the evolution of the temperature, flow, and salt concentration fields that give rise to the interfacial dynamics. Modeling will invoke idealizations based, for example, on boundary layer theory to derive moving-boundary descriptions and stability analyses that relate to pattern formation.

Many critical biological phenomena involve fluid-cell interaction or fluid-like behaviors. For example, fertilization of marine animal eggs relies on the transportation of the ambient fluid stream and sardines form large fluid-like swarms to evade predators. The project's principal focus is to develop novel mathematical tools to analyze the various fluid-related or fluid-like effects in these biological phenomena. There are three main topics in this project. The first topic concerns the interaction between the fluid flow and biological phenomena, which is motivated by two experiments in marine animal fertilization and cell embryology. In the first experiment researchers observed optimal fluid speed to maximize the fertilization rate of abalone. The second experiment confirms that the cellular flow helps organ formation at the early stages of the embryos of Drosophila. Fluid mixing effect and fast-spreading effect play important roles in the analysis. These two effects introduce another 'fast diffusion time scale' into the biological system and significantly change the long-time behavior. The principal investigator (PI) plans to develop new mathematical tools that capture the interplay between these fluid phenomena and the biology involved.  The project will provide research training experience for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>A modified hypocoercivity functional, which was applied in the paper by J. Bedrossian and the PI, and detailed spectral analysis, are crucial to derive the 'fast diffusion time scale' in the nonlinear setting. Applying these tools to the biologically relevant models provides deeper understandings of the experiments. The second topic covers the single and multi-species hydrodynamic models of flocking behavior. In these models, the flock of agents converges to a limiting structural state through sharing information among individuals. However, if the agents only share information with their direct neighbors, the flock's limiting behavior is highly nontrivial. The PI plans to develop new tools and bring ideas from spectral graph theory and random graph theory to analyze it. The third topic concerns the growth/blow-up mechanism in fluid mechanics. The PI will study two non-local models related to the generation of small-scale blowup in the fluid motivated by the singular Hou-Luo scenario for the 3D-Euler equation.

This can be used to detect, for example, the origin of a rumor spread, popular individuals and their influence in a social network, or a source of a disease outbreak. The results are expected to have significant applications in national security and public health. Another key research direction is to develop a systematic understanding of how local interactions in a large network influence its global geometry. This knowledge can be used to increase the overall efficiency of a network of servers through cooperative local interactions, with potential applications in improving routing schemes for airport security, supermarket distribution systems, and distribution of vaccines and other medicines. The project aims to develop a robust toolbox across many disciplines in science and engineering. The project involves significant educational activities and integration of research and education.

The investigators will also integrate the outcomes of this research program into graduate and advanced undergraduate courses offered at their respective institutions. <br/><br/>The project will solve some fundamental and unresolved problems in time-frequency analysis, especially the Heil-Ramanathan-Topiwala (HRT) conjecture (which asserts that every finite collection of time-frequency shifts of a square-integrable function must be linearly independent) and several other related unresolved problems. These problems arise in time-frequency analysis and are at the intersection of many areas of mathematics, applied mathematics, and even engineering. The investigators will attack these problems from a multi-field approach, bringing to bear techniques from abstract, applied computational harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, Lie group, Lie algebra, complex, functional, and real analysis. This research will build on recent successes of applied and pure harmonic analysis, which include the wavelet-based JPEG standard, advances in phaseless reconstruction, and the fundamental role played by Gabor (or Weyl-Heisenberg) systems in the detection of the gravitational waves. A standard paradigm in many of these applications consists of decomposing arbitrary signals into redundant elementary building blocks. While the redundancy of these systems might seem counterintuitive for their use, it is nonetheless responsible for the robustness of certain algorithms for data transmission using unreliable channels. It will play a vital role in noise reduction algorithms. Wavelets and Gabor systems are examples of redundant systems, and such systems can represent many natural signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Describing, analyzing, and computing the dynamics of these self-organized structures is at the center of understanding processes ranging from crystallization, self-assembly, or material hardening, to the emergence of patterns and function in living organisms. The principal investigator (PI) studies the role of coherent structures both in organizing the dynamics of systems through the selection of patterns and shape, but also in their role for validating models through quantitative predictions. The first part of the project is concerned with invasion processes, where a new structure propagates in the system after a sudden change in parameters. This invasion process is poorly understood and computationally challenging. The PI will develop new analytical and computational tools to systematically analyze, predict, and thus validate models. The second part of the project is concerned with point defects that arise in soft matter. Point defects both organize the system dynamics, but also present challenges to macroscopic, homogenized descriptions of large systems. The proposed work further develops analytical and computational methods that aim at a fine description of the shape of the core of point defects and their effect on the medium far away from the core. Graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/>The PI will analyze invasion fronts and point defects. Invasion fronts describe the propagation into an unstable state across many scientific areas, from material science to ecology and epidemiology. Propagation speeds and the novel state created in the wake of the invasion process can often be well predicted from linear analysis at the unstable state, through a marginal pointwise stability analysis. The PI will first develop novel computational tools for the associated linear questions, complemented by a rigorous convergence analysis. In a second step, the PI will addresse the validity of these linear predictions in nonlinear systems, in particular questions associated with the marginal stability conjecture that postulates that critical, only marginally stable fronts are selected in the invasion process. A second part of the proposal studies dislocations in striped phases and creases in elastic media. In both situations, analysis of the existence of these point defects will yield a deeper understanding of the role of the core of the defect in the large-scale deformation of the medium. The interaction between core and farfield is analyzed using analytical, perturbative tools and computational methods that rely on rigorous approximations of unbounded by finite-size domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on a class of mathematical models commonly encountered in practical fluid dynamics applications: free-boundary problems. In such systems, fluid flow is modeled by the solution to a partial differential equation formulated in a domain whose boundary is dynamic and evolves according to couplings with the fluid fields. Free-boundary problems are among the most mathematically challenging in fluid dynamics and more generally in the analysis of partial differential equations due to their notorious complexity, severe nonlocality, and implicit nonlinearity. The broad objective of this project is to develop new methods to advance understanding of this class of models. The project aims to study the long-time existence, regularity, and behavior of generic solutions, as well as the stability of special solutions. The project will also provide opportunities for involvement of graduate students in the research.<br/><br/>The project will study three models of different nature: the Muskat problem, water waves, and the free-boundary incompressible porous medium equation. Regarding the Muskat problem for fluids with constant density in porous media, the aims are to establish global existence and uniqueness and investigate long-time behavior of large solutions for the one-phase problem. Construction of special solutions and their stability will be another focus. For water waves, the project intends to rigorously demonstrate the instability of the classic two-dimensional Stokes waves for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional perturbations with and without surface tension effects. The free-boundary incompressible porous medium equation will be investigated regarding local well-posedness for a large class of density profiles and stability analysis for steady states. All three equations are quasilinear and are either degenerate parabolic or hyperbolic or mixed. A set of tools from harmonic analysis, microlocal analysis, potential theory, spectral theory, and bifurcation theory will be combined and sharpened to tackle these challenging questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will also have an impact on real-world applications in large-scale data centers, manufacturing, telecommunications, healthcare, inventory, and service systems, providing skills and tools to manage them effectively. Such systems can often be modeled as a stochastic network, with multiple jobs and many servers, and complex network topology. The operations and management of these sophisticated networked systems are subject to many risk factors under various random environments. This research will develop advanced methods and algorithms to provide solutions that mitigate the potential operational risks in a large-scale network model system. The model system roughly describes the system dynamics in large-scale parallel server networks. The research will provide approximate optimal scheduling and other operational policies. Risk-sensitive control has the advantage of achieving good performance in the presence of disturbances and uncertainty. It also limits large fluctuations since it penalizes higher moments of the running cost. The investigators will incorporate their findings into the existing graduate courses in stochastic networks and control, and disseminate them through seminars on relevant research topics. The research involves a team of interdisciplinary researchers, including those from underrepresented minority groups, and provides training opportunities for graduate students with new mathematical skills. <br/><br/>The objectives of the research are: (1) To develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of eigenvalues of elliptic systems and integro-differential operators to address the associated problems in infinite-horizon risk sensitive control (IHRS) of regime-switching and jump diffusions. (2) To develop the techniques required to establish asymptotic optimality and study the associated stochastic differential games and large deviation characterizations. (3) To study the large-time asymptotic behavior and relative value iteration algorithms, which form the basis of rolling horizon control and reinforcement learning methods. This research will greatly advance the theory of eigenvalues of integro-differential operators and elliptic systems and produce ground-breaking methodologies for risk-sensitive control of diffusions (with jumps) and regime-switching diffusions. On the analytical side, this research will greatly contribute to the current efforts in the literature concerning nonlinear eigenvalue problems in unbounded domains. A wealth of results on variational characterizations, maximum and large deviation principles, and the associated Feynman-Kac semigroup for nonsymmetric operators are expected to be obtained.  Another important contribution of the proposed research is analyzing large-time asymptotic behavior, which includes the study of relative value iteration algorithms and rolling horizon control. The research will also advance the understanding of the risk-sensitive asymptotically optimal scheduling policies for large-scale parallel server networks, including those in random environments that give rise to jump-diffusion and regime-switching diffusion limits. New methods involving the equivalent stochastic differential game and spatial truncation techniques will be developed to prove lower and upper bounds for asymptotic optimality.

Prototypical of this situation is the addition of viscosity to the Euler equations for an incompressible flow, resulting in the Navier-Stokes equations. The addition of these corrections often have profound consequences, such as making the solutions of the equations better behaved, i.e., regularized, and physically more realistic, but also add further complexities due to the introduction of nonlocal effects and additional spatiotemporal scales and manifested, for example, in the development of boundary layers. This project addresses these issues by investigating the mathematical consequences of various regularization approaches on hydrodynamical models arising in practical applications, such as geophysical fluid dynamics and electrochemistry. The study includes the formulation of effective approximations when the regularization effects are weak, and their use to find new approximation methods to compute the solutions to these problems in those regimes. The project will also provide training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. <br/><br/>The project is aimed at establishing global regularity for critical, non-dissipative Kelvin-Voigt (KV) approximations of hydrodynamic equations. The models considered include the surface quasigeostrophic equation, the inviscid porous medium equation, Darcy-Boussinesq equations, and electroconvection equations in non-Newtonian and porous media. Successful resolution of these problems requires the introduction of novel ideas and analytical tools. The project is to investigate the long-time behavior of solutions of the models and of their KV approximations, including studies of nonlinear stability and instability of specific steady states, and studies of formation of small scales and blow up. The project addresses the validity of the limit of vanishing KV approximation in the equations.

These mechanisms are always present in our ocean and atmosphere, as well as that of other planets. They are collectively responsible for many well-known phenomena that we observe in nature, e.g., jet streams, zonal jets, the El Niño cycle, and Jupiter's Great Red Spot, to name only a few. These mechanisms typically serve to constrain the motion of the fluid in a very particular way. For instance, it is observed that in a rapidly rotating fluid in three-dimensions, particles that are aligned along a common vertical parallel to the axis of rotation move nearly in unison, thus rendering the overall motion of the flow to be essentially two-dimensional. Despite many experimental and computational efforts to understand the precise development of such phenomena, the mathematical justification for them, that is, from directly studying the equations of motion themselves, remains largely open. This project will systematically address such concerns in various geophysical settings. This project will also provide research and mentorship opportunities for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as postdoctoral scholars.<br/><br/>An overarching goal of this project is to understand various manifestations of finite-dimensionality and its interconnections with the mechanisms of dissipation, rotation, and stratification. The main approach will be through the study of the regularity and long-time behavior of solutions to the associated equations of motion that allow one to obtain precise quantitative relations between the parameters representing the strength of these various mechanisms with the smallest relevant length scales of the fluid flow. The main models of interest will be those that arise naturally in geophysics such as the rotating Navier-Stokes equations and the stably stratified Boussinesq equations. In order to properly quantify the effects carried by rotation and stratification, anisotropic dispersive estimates, and careful analyses of resonance structures inherent in such systems will be carried out. A novelty of this project is the interplay between physical space- and frequency space-based approaches. Although both approaches have seen success in studying the regularity of solutions, the frequency space-based approach is well-suited for quantifying the number of degrees of freedom, while the physical space-based approach is well-suited for exploiting information about the spatial analyticity radius. This project attempts to merge these two approaches in ways that allow one to jointly exploit the reductions in dimensionality in both physical-space and frequency-space that is observed in rotating or stratified fluid flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
