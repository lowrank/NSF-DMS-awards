They have found broad applications in medical imaging for tumor detection, in seismic imaging for oil prospecting, and in military scenarios for hidden threat detection. The success of modern non-destructive probing techniques relies in an essential way on the mathematical principles that reveal the hidden connection between the observation and the targets. In-depth understanding of such principles will not just reveal the strengths and limitations of the techniques, but also indicate possible directions for future enhancement and improvement. This project aims to promote understanding of the mathematical principles in non-destructive probing techniques from both theoretical and computational perspectives. The theoretical perspective will develop fundamental mathematical tools and methods that are adaptable to resolve challenges in other mathematical branches. The computational perspective will turn the theory into innovative imaging algorithms that empower non-destructive probing techniques to acquire enhanced visualization. Implementation of the project will be integrated with numerous educational activities to involve K-12, undergraduate and graduate students majoring in STEM disciplines, especially those from underrepresented groups with limited educational resources. Students will receive rigorous scientific research training in mathematical and programming skills to prepare them as the next generation of STEM workforce that can continue advancing science and technology in the next few decades.<br/><br/>The project aims to investigate fundamental mathematical theory and computational methods for inverse problems for wave equations. This will be achieved by developing the computational boundary control method as well as its underlying mathematical theory. A feature of the approach is the synergy between mathematical analysis and wave-based scientific computing. From the theoretical perspective, the interdisciplinary research will enhance the interplay among PDE analysis, wave physics, geometry, and scientific computing. From the computational perspective, the research will inspire novel computational paradigms that utilize the nature of wave propagation to achieve optimal, theoretically justifiable algorithms for non-destructive probing techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At one extreme is chaos and turbulence, wherein the fluid forms complicated fractal-like patterns, the details of which cannot be exactly repeated in experiments due to being very sensitive to small changes in the initial conditions. Turbulence is observed often in fluids, such as in the wakes of aircraft, vehicles, and even obstacles such as buildings and bridges and in the large-scale dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. At the opposite extreme is the motion of vortex filaments, the most notable examples being tornadoes and the wing-tip vortices commonly shed from wings and helicopter blades. Vortex filaments tend to move in a predictable manner and maintain their structural integrity for extended periods of time. The goal of this project is to develop a better mathematical understanding of these opposite phenomena in fluid mechanics. The accurate prediction of vortex filaments and turbulence is crucial in a variety of scientific and industrial applications, including in the design of air, land, and sea vehicles and in the understanding of complex fluid systems such as the climate and weather. Having a firm mathematical foundation could help other applied researchers obtain deeper insights and lead to better modeling. Further, an understanding of these extremes helps pave the way for a better understanding of the interactions and intermediate regimes, where flows have a mix of structure and chaos. Finally, overcoming the mathematical challenges to these questions will require innovations that will be of interest to the wider mathematical community. The research projects are also integrated with the training of graduate students and younger scientists in mathematics and STEM. <br/><br/>The PI will develop a more mathematically rigorous understanding of two behaviors observed in incompressible fluids at high Reynolds numbers: (1) the coherent motion of vortex filaments; (2) turbulence under ""generic"", statistically steady forcing. The fundamental questions motivating the PI are: (A) how accurate are the commonly used geometric evolution models such as the Local Induction Approximation (LIA) for the motion of a vortex filament in a fluid with vorticity concentrated on a smooth curve? (B) can we provide a proof for the experimentally observed positive Lyapunov exponents and anomalous dissipation (e.g., as the celebrated Kolmogorov 4/5 law) from the stochastically forced 3D Navier-Stokes in the high Reynolds number limit? These require a number of unexplored mathematical ideas and currently, there exists no clear way to attack them yet. Instead, the PI has identified several independently interesting problems to build necessary mathematical foundations. For (A), the PI and his collaborators will study vortex filaments in quantum fluids governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The quantum case is expected to be easier than the classical case due to the quantization of vorticity and slightly more amenable linearized operators. First, the PI and collaborators will study the stability of vortex solutions in 2d Gross-Pitaevskii, providing necessary ground for understanding the filament core. Next, the PI and collaborators will show that the LIA accurately describes the motion of nearly-straight, and potentially more general, quantum vortex filaments long enough to make useful predictions. For (B), the PI and his collaborators will: (1) develop novel qualitative theory for Lyapunov exponents in stochastic PDEs inspired by ideas from random dynamical systems; (2) develop better tools for quantitative hypoelliptic regularity and Lyapunov exponent estimation in high dimensional systems; and (3) study quantitative and nonlinear aspects of Lagrangian chaos, that is, how the chaotic dynamics of particles in a fluid can be translated into nonlinear dynamics of the fluid itself.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The task of extracting useful information from vast amounts of data typically leads to solving large-scale optimization problems. The size of such problems poses a variety of challenges for computation and is the bottleneck for further progress in applications. The investigator aims to advance techniques of large-scale optimization, with applications throughout science and engineering. The resulting algorithms will enable discovery of trends and patterns in the observed data and will enable accurate predictions about unobserved data. The technical aspects of the project combine elements from a variety of mathematical and applied disciplines, and an effective mix of numerical experimentation, teaching, and discovery is central to the proposal. Graduate students and postdocs will participate in all aspects of the project.<br/><br/>Statistical estimation, signal processing, and learning from data rely on solving challenging optimization problems that are large-scale, stochastic, nonsmooth, and often nonconvex. Despite such irregularity, the domains of typical optimization problems decompose into ?active manifolds?, which common algorithms ?identify? in finite time, thereby opening the door to second-order acceleration strategies. This project studies the stochastic subgradient method and its common variants, which power modern large-scale optimization, and its numerous applications in data science and engineering. The goal of the project is to investigate how the performance of influential stochastic algorithms benefit from active manifolds and to develop novel algorithms that exploit this structure. The strategy for achieving this goal will be based on a recently discovered family of regularity conditions---originating in stratification theory and semi-algebraic geometry---that have been shown to hold along active manifolds in concrete circumstances. Utilizing such regularity conditions for active manifolds, the investigator will develop new efficiency guarantees for the subgradient method, show that the algorithm converges only to local minimizers while bypassing all extraneous saddle points, and establish the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic gradient iterates.  In parallel, the investigator will explore the use of noise injection to learn the tangent spaces to the active manifold in order to accelerate the algorithm. This approach is highly interdisciplinary, relying on techniques from nonsmooth optimization, statistics, probability, and semialgebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fluids are all around us, and better understanding of fluid motion is of importance in science and engineering. The project aims to advance understanding of small-scale formation in fluid motion, a process that appears in a wide range of applications and is related to development of turbulence. The project will also focus on analysis of chemotaxis, directed motion of cells or other biological agents in response to external chemical stimuli. Here the main goal is to understand and quantify how chemotaxis helps facilitate many biological processes from reproduction to immune system function. Many chemotactic processes take place in fluid, and interaction between the fundamental effects of diffusion, fluid flow and chemotaxis will also be studied. These problems are at the forefront of modern applied analysis and will require development of novel techniques that should be applicable in other settings. The project will also involve the training of junior researchers at a postdoctoral and graduate level.<br/><br/>The first direction of the project is concerned with small scale formation and loss of regularity in patch solutions to the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation. The SQG equation appears in atmospheric science, where it is used to model large scale weather phenomena like temperature fronts. The PI and collaborators have recently discovered an intriguing structure in the evolution equation for curvature of the patch boundary, and plan to use this insight to obtain new results on ill-posedness and possible singularity formation in the bulk of the fluid. The second direction addresses small scale creation in solutions to the 2D Boussinesq system and 3D Euler equation. This direction also seeks to develop models suitable to gain insight into possible singularity formation in solutions of the 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in the bulk, suggested by recent numerical simulations of Tom Hou. The third direction focuses on the coupled Keller-Segel-fluid system and explores the potential singularity suppression by fluid advection. The project aims to establish first rigorous results of this sort in the situation where advection is not passive and is not in a perturbative regime. The final direction is concerned with the development of a new class of models addressing the effect of chemotaxis on biological reactions. The research is intended to go beyond regularity estimates and rigorously derive scaling laws that may be of interest in applications.

Fundamental theoretical questions concern identifying universal pattern-forming mechanisms and predicting the nature and dynamics of the patterns which appear. This project aims to address these questions through the study of pattern-forming instabilities in the setting of partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in models from biology, ecology, and chemical reactions.  In particular, the project focuses on the development of techniques to tackle pattern formation in PDEs which are singularly perturbed; such equations arise naturally in the study of systems where components operate on widely differing length or time scales. Application areas include desertification fronts in dryland ecosystems, as well as wave phenomena in mathematical biology and neuroscience. Included in the project are activities which integrate research and education through the supervision of graduate students as well as outreach programs and summer research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project focuses on three primary research areas, with the goal of providing insight into complex spatiotemporal pattern formation phenomena in singularly perturbed reaction diffusion PDEs. Motivated by the phenomenon of desertification fronts in dryland ecosystems, the first research area concerns pattern-forming instabilities of bistable planar interfaces in multi-component reaction diffusion systems. The second area aims to build a rigorous theory of temporal pulse replication, by which a single traveling pulse (or localized wave) self-replicates, sequentially nucleating additional pulses in a manner resembling a spatiotemporal canard explosion. The third area is concerned with the nature and properties of far-from-onset patterns formed in the wake of pattern-forming invasion processes, whereby a pattern is nucleated when a disturbance invades an unstable steady state. These research areas will grow and advance the theory of far-from-onset pattern-forming mechanisms through the development of geometric singular perturbation methods and spatial dynamical systems tools to be used in the existence, stability, and bifurcation analysis of waves and patterns. Several of the phenomena explored in this project occur in regions where standard singular perturbation methods break down, requiring the development of novel techniques.

In recent times, the mathematical study of collective dynamics has become an active and fast-growing field of research. Many mathematical models of collective behavior rely on partial differential equations with nonlocal interactions to describe the resulting emergent behavior. It turns out that these models are intimately connected to other models traditionally used in fluid dynamics. The goal of this project is to study several models of nonlocal partial differential equations to model collective behavior or fluid flows, and to develop novel and robust analytical techniques to understand the collective behaviors driven by nonlocal structures. The training and professional development of graduate students and young researchers is an integral part of the project.<br/> <br/>This project studies three families of partial differential equations with shared nonlocal structures that can affect the solutions of the equations: existence, uniqueness, regularity, and long-time asymptotic behaviors. The first problem is on the compressible Euler system with nonlinear velocity alignment, which describes the remarkable flocking phenomenon in animal swarms. Global phenomena and asymptotic behaviors of the system will be investigated, with a focus on the nonlinearity in the velocity alignment. The second problem is on the pressureless Euler system, aiming at the long-standing question of the uniqueness of weak solutions. The plan is to approximate the system by the relatively well-studied Euler-alignment system in collective dynamics. The third problem is on the Euler-Monge-Ampère system which is closely related to the incompressible Euler equations in fluid dynamics. The embedded nonlocal geometric structure of the system will be explored, with interesting applications in optimal transport and mean-field games.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In principle, the equations of classical and quantum physics allow complete determination of the behavior of each particle in the system for arbitrary periods of time. In practice, the number of particles, and therefore the complexity of the system, ranges beyond the capabilities of the best computing resources. This project aims to achieve a substantial reduction in computational complexity through a statistical point of view, focused on the probability of finding at a given time a particle in the system at a certain position in space and moving with a certain velocity. The results are expected to be directly applicable to the modeling of states of matter such as Bose-Einstein condensates or plasmas, and of systems with particle-like behavior, as vortices in fluids or superconductors. The project will provide mentoring and training opportunities for a new generation of researchers at the intersection of mathematics and physics.<br/> <br/>The first part of the project concerns the mean-field limit of systems of particles with inverse power potentials, for instance of Coulomb or Riesz type. The investigator aims to determine the minimal regularity assumptions on the limiting equation needed for quantitative convergence, whether convergence is valid in the more realistic setting of noise in the dynamics, the optimal time scales for the mean-field approximation to hold, and the sharp rate of convergence. The second part deals with the supercritical mean-field scaling regime, a singular limit of Newton?s second law or the semiclassical Schrödinger equation leading to a kinetic generalization of Euler?s equation for an ideal fluid. The goal is to identify the optimal range for the validity of this limit through analytical and numerical means by building on progress for the monokinetic case where the limiting equation reduces to the incompressible Euler equation and drawing on a connection to the quasineutral limit in plasma physics. An important quantity for measuring convergence is a modulated energy-entropy or free energy, which is related to renormalized energies appearing in the statistical mechanics of Coulomb and Riesz gasses.

Most of the available displays operate close to physical limits, and the constant demand for faster and more efficient devices has made the search for new materials the focus of the industry. Bent-core liquid crystals differ from the standard materials used in flat panels and portable displays in that the special shape of their molecules allows for ferroelectric behavior and intrinsic bistability at a lower manufacturing cost. That is, they have potential for superior operational speed, resolution, and efficiency at a competitive production cost as well as a wider spectrum of commercial applications which include spatial light modulators (SLMs), optical memories, optical computers and high-resolution microdisplays. To date, a clear description of the configurations (mesophases) of the devices based on bent-core materials has not been established, and many technical difficulties need to be overcome. This project is concerned with the numerical and theoretical modelling of these application-intensive materials and will fill an existing gap between theory and experiments. Its outcome will contribute to the validation and extension of the available models and will add to the understanding of the nature of phase transitions, and of electrical and optical properties, ultimately contributing to the manufacturing of superior liquid crystals-based devices. The graduate students involved will be trained in the interdisciplinary areas of applied mathematics, computational mathematics, and materials science. The main research objective will be in the analysis of electro/magneto optic effects, which will involve the study of materials' defects and their interactions; the refinement of existing models for ferroelectric liquid crystals with layered structures; and the study of a newly discovered phase, where the bent molecules arrange themselves in an heliconical structure, winding about a helical axis with nanoscale pitches. <br/><br/>The investigators will examine the response to applied fields exhibited by a liquid crystal based on the materials' anisotropic optical properties.

The effects of boundary conditions on the morphology of bulk and confined samples in Smectic A phases will also be considered. The studies will be based on generalized unit vectors and smectic order parameter energy models. The investigators will use and advance a diverse collection of mathematical tools for nonlinear problems, including variational methods, asymptotic analysis, and bifurcation and regularity theories for nonlinear partial differential equations. An essential component of the project will be to select, refine, and propose models that contains the relevant physical features of the examined phenomena. Numerical simulations of gradient flows and comparison with available experiments will play an important role in the research approach.

The physical configurations require mixed and higher boundary conditions for 4th-order PDEs on spatial domains with corners. In each configuration, we analyze the qualitative properties of PDE solutions, which requires an understanding of the dynamics as a function of system parameters and geometry.  Via the self-destabilization framework, we investigate limit cycle oscillations (and global attractors) for the dynamical systems generated by these plate systems. Qualitative studies allow us to reflect on our modeling choices, and this work: (i) improves plate modeling to yield better predictions; (ii) develops a rigorous theory for novel models; (iii) addresses a  gap in the literature concerning unstable nonlinear plates with mixed boundary conditions; (iv) represents a synergy of modeling, theory, and computation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through presentations by leading experts in the field, this 4-day workshop will provide a broad but thorough overview of recent technical advances in mathematical topics around stochastic processes, control, and games, as well as many different application areas of these theoretical approaches. Indeed, beyond the historical focus on financial engineering, there are now many new fields of application, including machine learning, fintech, economic, financial policy and regulation, epidemic management, and even climate change. These applications are undeniably at the heart of current social and economic challenges and studying them in a quantitative way can contribute to informing public policy. The objective of this workshop is therefore to strengthen the links between mathematics, especially as it pertains to random processes and its applications to the above-mentioned areas. We expect this meeting to help initiate new interdisciplinary collaborations that will help tackle various issues currently facing the world and anticipate future economical and societal challenges. The award funds will help defray travel and local expenses of the participants, emphasizing the support of a diverse group of junior researchers (Ph.D. candidates, postdoctoral fellows and other early-career researchers). More precisely, the award will allow to sponsor approximately 30 junior researchers, including 10 for oral presentations and a dozen for poster sessions.<br/><br/>The theory of stochastic analysis and control is constantly developing, and recent advances include, among others, rough paths theory, optimal transport, stochastic partial differential equation and more. Considering the interactions between economic and financial agents has also required the development of new mathematical tools, and in particular the implementation of the mean field game theory into the mathematical framework. As an illustration, one of the tools associated with stochastic control, namely the Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDE) theory, has been strongly impacted by the development of stochastic differential games, and we can particularly notice recent results on second-order, mean field or McKean-Vlasov BSDEs. The field is obviously positively impacted by the technological era in which we live, and recent developments in machine learning allow for example to numerically solve many stochastic control problems and games in a very efficient way. But it should be noted that the reverse is also true: stochastic control methods and techniques are key to the investigation and assessment of advanced numerical approaches such as deep or Q?learning and neural networks. Hence, at the theoretical level, the workshop will feature talks and discussions on stochastic PDEs and (McKean?Vlasov, second-order) BSDEs, stochastic approaches to the master equation and to deep learning, as well as pathwise stochastic analysis and signature processes. Furthermore, as the mathematical theory of stochastic control and games is, by nature, application-oriented, this workshop will also have a strong focus on applications to finance (rough volatility models, but also newer models for cryptocurrencies and robot advising) as well as social policy issues such as systemic risk, epidemic management, among others.

Examples of shock waves abound in nature and technology: sonic booms generated by commercial and military airplanes, bow shocks generated by space vehicles upon re-entry through the atmosphere, and bow shocks created when the solar wind hits the planets, to name a few. Although a good theoretical understanding of the formation and subsequent propagation of shock waves exists for one-dimensional (i.e., planar) flows, the corresponding state of affairs in multiple space dimensions is much less satisfactory. The purpose of this project is to develop a  new geometric framework and a new mathematical description of the wave motion that allows for a detailed description of shock formation and the subsequent dynamics of shock waves in multiple space dimensions. This project will also offer research opportunities and collaborative experiences for graduate students and postdocs at the University of California, Davis, and New York University.<br/><br/>This project will develop the analytical and geometric framework for resolving one of the foremost unanswered questions in the fields of hyperbolic PDE and mathematical fluid dynamics: the formation and unique propagation of hydrodynamical shocks from smooth initial data, in multiple space dimensions. The first step is called ""shock formation"". Here the smooth initial data is evolved up to a cusp-like Eulerian spacetime hypersurface of first singularities, where the gradient of the velocity, pressure, density, and energy becomes infinite, but these fields retain Holder 1/3 regularity. The PIs approach to determining the location and the geometry of this cusp-like spacetime hypersurface of first singularities relies upon the construction of a smooth spacetime geometry, together and a new set of hydrodynamic variables in the Arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) description of acoustic wave propagation. The second step is called ""shock development"" wherein one uses the analytical description of the solution on the cusp-like spacetime hypersurface of first singularities as Cauchy data, from which the shock surface of discontinuity instantaneously develops. In conjunction with the shock surface, we shall establish the emergence of so-called weak characteristic discontinuities; these are characteristic surfaces that emerge simultaneously (with the shock) from the pre-shock, and along which, gradients of velocity, density, and entropy exhibit one-sided Holder cusps. This framework enables the study of even more complicated physical models such as the magnetohydrodynamic equations (MHD) of plasma flow. Here, unlike the lone classical compressive shock of gas dynamics, six different types of MHD shocks can be analyzed with our approach: a fast shock, a slow shock, and four different intermediate shocks. The latter were observed by the Voyager spacecraft in Earth?s heliosphere, but their mathematical existence, to date, remains in question.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such observations reveal the presence of differentially rotating fluid atmospheres with embedded features in the form of large-scale eddies and jets that greatly influence the climate on the celestial body. On Earth the impact of the high latitude jet stream on weather and the destructive impact of hurricanes due to climate change is evident. Within the Jovian atmosphere, the recent discovery by the Juno mission of polar vortices illuminates the longevity of vortical structures. Theory, experimentation, and numerical simulations strongly suggest that the generation of large-scale jets and vortices is common in fluid turbulence within thin layers like the Earth?s atmosphere and on rapidly rotating celestial bodies such as Jupiter. Focusing on these paradigms, this project is dedicated to elucidating the basic mechanism behind the formation of such large-scale structures from small-scale turbulent fluctuations and its disruption via the generation of isolated, weakly-interacting, mesoscale shielded vortices, and to extending this understanding to more realistic models that introduce higher level physics such as the effects of water vapor and internal heating via latent heat release. This understanding will inform more detailed studies such as those based on realistic Global Ocean and Atmospheric Circulation Models and offers hope for understanding the conditions favoring the formation of both large-scale structures and of the smaller-scale shielded vortices. The modeling strategy taken provides a foundation upon which greater discipline-specific complexity can be built. The project will support and train one graduate student and one postdoctoral researcher in the physical understanding of energy transfer between scales in systems of geophysical relevance, asymptotic and other modeling techniques, as well as direct numerical simulations of rapidly rotating fluid layers, appropriate for planetary-scale phenomena on and within the Earth.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to classify different regimes of instability-driven turbulence in two dimensions (2D) as a function of the energy input and dissipation parameters, and to explore how these states evolve when three-dimensional (3D) fluctuations become increasingly important as the height of the turbulent layer increases. Particular emphasis will be placed on the recently discovered regime of shielded mesoscale vortices whose generation may disrupt the inverse energy cascade familiar from 2D turbulence with random stirring. Properties of the resulting chiral mesoscale vortex gas will be studied as a function of the layer height, as will the transition to a vortex crystal that takes place at high vortex density in 2D. The Reynolds number will be varied systematically to bridge the gap between these phenomena and related states in bacterial suspensions at low Reynolds numbers. The possibility of an analogous state in rapidly rotating 3D turbulence will be investigated in detail using a new reformulation of the Navier-Stokes fluid equations, extending direct numerical simulations to smaller Rossby numbers, together with a theoretical analysis dissecting the amplitude-phase relationships between large-scale structures and small-scale turbulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While much of the mathematics and science of wave interactions relies upon a basic property of small amplitude waves, known as the law of linear superposition, in which multiple wave shapes add together, in practice many waves are of large amplitude and do not conform to this linear behavior. Some examples of nonlinear waves include surface and internal gravity waves in the near-shore environment, intense laser light in laboratory fiber optic experiments, and quantum mechanical matter waves in experiments with ultracold atomic gases. From multidimensional interacting nonlinear waves to the interaction of nonlinear periodic waves and solitary waves, the investigator will study the mathematics and physics of nonlinear wave interactions using physical experiments and an approximation technique known as modulation theory. This interdisciplinary research will provide a fundamental understanding of nonlinear wave interactions with applications to fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics, and quantum fluids. The project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/> <br/>The investigator will mathematically and experimentally study nonlinear wave interactions.  This will be achieved by constructing exact and numerical soliton-cnoidal (periodic traveling wave) breather solutions, solving generalized Riemann problems for colliding cnoidal waves, obtaining modulation equations and solutions for multidimensional and forced nonlinear waves, and performing fluid experiments.  Methods to be employed include Whitham averaging, integrable system methods (Darboux transformations), conservation law methods, multiscale asymptotics, numerical computation, and experiments in viscous core-annular flows.  To describe the complex interactions of solitons and cnoidal waves, the approach unites techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws and nonlinear dispersive waves.  The equations to be analyzed are models of geophysical and technological significance, ranging from completely integrable, e.g., Korteweg-de Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili, to non-integrable, e.g., Ostrovsky, 2D Benjamin-Ono, and conduit equations.

The investigator will consider extensions of this method to new classes of nonlinear equations, such as fractional nonlinear wave equations and their soliton solutions.

Arguably, it is in the past 25 years of this long and rich history that most progress has been made in the quest for a complete mathematical formulation of fractures. This has been made possible by a pivotal idea, to wit, the casting of the phenomenon of fracture as a competition between energies: the energy required to deform the structure and the energy required to create a crack in the structure. Critically, this progress has been restricted to the elementary case of brittle fracture in elastic solids, that is, materials that respond in one of two ways to mechanical forces: they either deform elastically or create new surface, i.e., they fracture. Yet, while within certain restricted conditions some materials may be safely idealized as brittle elastic solids, as in the case of glass at room temperature, all materials dissipate energy when they deform, primarily by viscous or plastic deformation, or both, as for rubber and aluminum. In this context, based on a universal energy competition recently discovered by the investigator, this project aims to develop a rigorous mathematical formulation to describe fracture in dissipative solids at large. The project will provide interdisciplinary research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>The project has three main objectives: 1) to develop a mathematically well-posed time-discrete formulation of brittle fracture evolution in a large class of dissipative solids subjected to isothermal quasistatic mechanical loading; 2) to develop a phase-field regularization of the time-discrete formulation and establish its convergence to the sharp limit; and 3) to numerically implement the developed phase-field formulation and validate its predictions against representative experiments on different types of solids. From a fundamental standpoint, the project seeks to provide a first step towards a mathematically well-posed universal formulation of fractures in any type of solid subjected to quasistatic mechanical loading. In other words, to provide a first step in establishing that the so-called brittle Griffith fracture is a universal description of fracture in any type of solid. From an applications standpoint, a tractable computational tool will be developed with the capability to describe, explain, and predict the nucleation of a fracture from large pre-existing cracks, as well as the propagation of fractures in structures made of a large class of dissipative solids under arbitrary quasistatic loading. Such a general quantitative tool would provide exceptional insight into a broad spectrum of phenomena dominated by fracture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The equations, widely used by physicists and engineers for real-life applications, were introduced almost two centuries ago. However, some essential questions, such as the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions, are still not answered. Therefore, a notion of weak solutions, whose existence is known, has been extensively used by mathematicians. The project will demonstrate a limitation of this notion by constructing weak solutions with various unphysical properties. On the other hand, the project proposes to prove the existence of physical solutions that are expected to describe turbulent flows. This project will also provide opportunities for the involvement of graduate students in the project. <br/><br/>In the past couple of decades, mathematical fluid dynamics has been highlighted by numerous constructions of solutions to fluid equations that exhibit pathological or wild behavior, such as loss of the energy balance, non-uniqueness, singularity formation, and dissipation anomaly. Interesting from the mathematical point of view, these solutions provide counterexamples to various well-posedness results in supercritical spaces. Moreover, these constructive approaches are becoming more and more relevant from the physical point of view as well. Indeed, a fundamental physical property of turbulent flows is the existence of the energy cascade.

Examples include voice assistants, facial recognition for cellphones, and machine-learning-based financial fraud detection. But many algorithms are applied only heuristically and remain poorly understood, meaning that theoretical guarantees are missing. In fact, recent AI applications indicate that the direct application of these algorithms, without proper validation, may generate artificial, misleading information.  The broad aim of this proposal is to deepen our understanding of classes of statistically-relevant random matrix models that are used to model, analyze and interpret large data sets and to analyze new and classical algorithms as they act on these models.  It is expected that this will produce new insights and statistical tools, paired with theoretical guarantees.  This award will also train junior researchers and help continue to build the community of researchers working in this field.<br/><br/>The proposed problems fit into three main projects.  The first concerns the analysis of random matrix models that extend the classical setting of sample covariance matrices. Then by connecting random matrix models and orthogonal polynomials via Riemann--Hilbert problems, the PIs will obtain new estimates and new conclusions about orthogonal polynomials for natural measures generated by these random matrices.  Armed with the theoretical results, the second project concerns the direct application of the estimates from the first project, and further refinement of previous analyses, to understand the average-case behavior of numerical algorithms.  The focus here is on algorithms from numerical linear algebra.  In the third project, the investigators will use the new random matrix estimates, the new results in the theory of orthogonal polynomials and its associated Riemann--Hilbert theory, for both classical and new random matrix ensembles, to generate new algorithms, ultimately leading to new viable statistical estimators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These models are pervasive in physical and biological phenomena, but their long-time behavior is far from well-understood. Here long-time behavior is a general term used to encompass the notions of global well-posedness, scattering effects, unique continuation of the solutions, and wave turbulence. Understanding the evolutionary behavior of dispersive equations has a broad range of applications in fields, such as, numerical simulations, optics, condensed matter, fluid mechanics, and biology. The aim of this project is to understand the long-time dynamics of dispersive systems while bringing new insights that will establish novel approaches and models in applications. The project includes research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project contains three components. The first component concerns the unique continuation principle, which is believed to play an important part from a numerical point of view. In numerical simulations, a computer often preforms computations on finite approximations of the domain or the data or both, which may result in non-uniqueness or instability issues. A well-developed unique continuation theory will provide better stability and reliability of the computational results. The second considers dispersive models on waveguides, an important model for data transmission. The investigator will also introduce a model with waveguide behaviors that for the first time will connect a probabilistic well-known Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator to dispersive equations and has the potential to build a strong bridge between dispersive partial differential equations and probability. The last component investigates the energy transfer phenomenon, which relates to the wave turbulence theory. Wave turbulence theory has the feature of universally predicting the evolution of the wave action spectral density of interacting wave systems, which will help with forecasting surface gravity waves in the oceans, among others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the disparate physical contexts, similar wave patterns emerge, and their behavior can be modeled by the same nonlinear partial differential equations. In applications and real-world measurements, the nonlinear interactions lead to waves patterns of exceeding complexity and apparent randomness. This project will further the understanding of these waveforms by developing techniques to model them as accumulations of special isolated traveling wave solutions, i.e., solitons. The resulting ensembles of many solitons, known as soliton gases, will be studied directly and statistically, when their properties are allowed to behave randomly. The aim is to precisely describe, and ultimately control, the nonlinear wave dynamics observed in applications, for example in fiber optic transmission.  The project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The project has three main mathematical goals: 1) to build a rigorous analytical description of soliton gases, via characterization of their spectral properties, and use this description to study their statistical properties; 2) to analyze the small dispersion semiclassical limit of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation, as a mechanism for generating integrable turbulence and rogue waves from initial data; 3) to study the long-time behavior of spectrally singular solutions of integrable partial differential equations. The study will involve using and further developing tools from complex and asymptotic analysis, with an emphasis in the Inverse Scattering Transform method. The double scaling limit of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation has the potential to introduce a new class of universality at wave breaking and further the understanding of rogue wave generation. Mathematically, the work on spectrally singular solutions and fat-tailed waves would lead to an extension of Inverse Scattering Transform techniques to broader classes of initial data inaccessible by existing techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project considers energy methods to analyze three types of instability relevant to applications. The first type concerns phase transformations in solids, which underly shape memory effects and other applications of smart materials, with a focus on stability of phase boundaries, to improve the ability of identifying critical strains at the onset of phase transitions. The second is buckling, where the failure of a slender structure occurs abruptly, after the critical stress threshold has been crossed. Slender structures play an increasingly important role in the technological world, delivering light-weight and highly functional devices. However, a full understanding of their extreme sensitivity to imperfections is not yet available in both mechanics and engineering. One specific goal of the project is to shed light on the buckling of axially compressed cylindrical shells, by revealing the mechanisms that allow small imperfections of shape and load to have a dramatic effect on the critical stress. The third instability analyzed is of a numerical type, where the precision of measurements of properties of materials, such as electromagnetic permittivity or electrical impedance spectrum, does not translate to equally precise prediction of their response at much higher or much lower frequencies than in the available data. Inspired by applications to radiology and remote sensing, the aim is to quantify these instabilities to inform the creation of new algorithms that reconstruct the material response characteristics with provable optimality. The project provides research mentoring and training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>Mathematics being developed to study stability of phase boundaries represents a contribution to Calculus of Variations, where the almost intractable concept of quasiconvexity plays a central role. The research project will develop tools needed to gain insight into the structure of quasiconvex envelopes. Notwithstanding the fact that quasiconvexity in general defies any meaningful general attack, the information this research will deliver will be of direct practical importance, permitting exact or approximate relaxations of specific energies, and will provide a provably complete set of practically accessible information. The investigation of buckling of cylindrical shells will create a new set of theoretical predictions to be compared with experiment. The key feature of these predictions is the quantitative description of mechanisms of instability responsible for the discrepancy between the classical buckling load and the experimentally observed ones. Theoretical issues pertaining to more general shells will also be addressed.  Stieltjes functions form a special class of analytic functions virtually ubiquitous in physics. Quantitative understanding of such functions will contribute to practical algorithms for reconstructing material responses, such as complex electromagnetic permittivity of dielectric media and complex impedance of electrical circuits. A new investigation into the properties of completely monotone functions will complement and expand the current scant knowledge about this important class of functions.

More recently, these models are being used to model phenomena on a much smaller scale, including hierarchical materials like ceramic or metallic foams, percolation networks and carbon and graphene nano-tubes, and graphene ribbons. While inverse theory of differential equation networks is important for all aforementioned applications, it has not, however, been sufficiently developed. This project will develop the inverse theory of general differential equation networks, or, quantum graphs, with a focus on inverse spectral and dynamical problems for the wave, heat, Schrodinger, Dirac and other differential equations which are important for applications in physics and engineering. At least two Ph.D. students will take an active part in the project, and a new graduate course on this topic will be developed. <br/><br/>Inverse problems for quantum graphs have previously been studied almost exclusively on trees, that is, graphs without cycles. This project will consider quantum graphs with cycles, targeting more broadly applicable differential equation networks. Along with unknown coefficients of the equations, the topology of the graph and its geometrical parameters will be recovered. The proposed approach to solving inverse problems for quantum graphs with cycles will combine spectral and dynamical methods. It will use the boundary control method in inverse theory, which exploits deep connections between controllability and identifiability of dynamical systems and a recently developed leaf-peeling method for solving inverse problems on trees. Extension of these methods to differential equations on general graphs will require new developments of the boundary control and leaf peeling methods as well as results and methods of combinatorial graph theory, partial differential equations, spectral analysis, and nonharmonic Fourier series. Controllability results for the corresponding partial differential equations on general graphs with cycles will be also obtained. Numerical algorithms for solving control and inverse problems for general differential equation networks will be developed, and extensive numerical experiments will be performed to validate their effectiveness.

The goal of this research is to derive, via asymptotic analysis and singular limits, new effective models of geometric type describing the collective motion. And, to use these simpler models to theoretically and numerically study the long time dynamic of a population of bacteria, predict the behavior of a crowd, or compare the effects of different therapies on tumor growth. The project will offer research training opportunity for students.<br/> <br/>The investigator will primarily study models for which an interface separating regions of high and low aggregation density can be identified (phase separation). So, while the starting point is a system of partial differential equations that describes the evolution of a density function, the resulting collective motion is modeled by a free boundary approximation describing the evolution of an interface. A rigorous mathematical analysis will be developed using tools from the theory of partial differential equations, the calculus of variation, optimal transportation, and geometric measure theory. A key goal is to provide rigorous justification of the fact that nonlocal attractive behavior has the same smoothing effect on the interface as surface tension (at an appropriate scale). An asymptotic analysis will be performed first on macroscopic models (e.g., diffusion-aggregation equations) and then on mesoscopic models, such as kinetic equations. Understanding how congestion effects can be account for in kinetic models is an important aspect of this research. The investigator will also derive and study free boundary approximations modeling cell motility. The rigorous analysis of these models will establish the instability and symmetry breaking properties, which correspond to well documented behaviors of cells (the so-called self-polarization of cells). Finally, many of the models discussed here have a particular structure: They are gradient flows with respect to the Wasserstein distance - which is defined via the theory of optimal transportation. The investigator will pursue the development of a regularity theory for optimal transportation in a discrete setting. This is an important step toward developing effective numerical methods in the field of optimal transportation, with application to the models discussed above.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diffusion dictates important physical properties of materials (e.g., electrical or heat conductivities) and phenomena in complex systems (e.g., human body). By studying the physical origins and mathematical intricacies of anomalous diffusions, the project will enhance the fundamental understanding of diffusion processes in diverse fields, ranging from physics and chemistry to biology and environmental science.

They are found throughout nature, ranging from internal waves in the ocean to spreading contagions in biology and defect patterns in material science. Much is now known about waves that are perturbative in some sense.  For instance, if the interface is not greatly disturbed, its motion can be well predicted using simpler linear or weakly nonlinear models.   However, many important phenomena fall far outside this category.  As one example, following the 2022 volcanic eruption in Tonga, tsunami-like waves were observed moving much faster than linear theory predicts in shallow water and even seemed to amplify in deep water.  This project aims to deepen the mathematical understanding of these and similar non-perturbative waves for which the underlying systems exhibit intrinsically nonlinear dynamics, surface singularities, or resonance phenomena.   Progress in this direction will be benefit the larger mathematics and science communities, and society more broadly as they will bring predictive capabilities improvements and ultimately help mitigate future disasters.  The project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Internal bores are fronts that propagate along pycnoclines in stratified bodies of water.  They play a geophysically significant role in mixing, energy transport, and oceanic circulation.  Using global bifurcation theory and free boundary elliptic regularity theory methods, this project seeks to prove the existence of overhanging internal gravity waves and verify a conjecture of von Karman regarding the existence and form of exact gravity currents.  Another objective concerns the time evolution of interfacial hydrodynamic waves.  As part of this project, the investigator will use techniques from infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems to characterize the spectral stability of multimodal internal capillary-gravity solitary waves, and prove that solitary waves with strong surface tension are orbitally unstable with respect to transverse perturbations.  Understanding meteotsunamis --- atmospherically generated tsunamis --- created by the Tonga eruption is another central objective.  One prominent explanation for their formation is based on three-wave resonance in a two-phase lightly compressible Euler system.  This project will give the first rigorous treatment to this theory by constructing steady axisymmetric three-dimensional solutions as models for the initial atmospheric shockwaves and exact three-dimensional doubly-periodic steady solutions for exhibiting the resonant triad.  The final aim of the project concerns localized vortical structures carried by waves.  A hollow vortex is a bounded region of constant pressure encircled by a vortex sheet and suspended inside a perfect fluid; their existence and stability in the plane have been studied since the 19th century.

In machine learning applications one often needs to build algorithms to model target distributions which are singular, either by their intrinsic nature such as probabilities concentrated on low dimensional structures and/or because they are often only known through data. These new divergences will be combined with deep learning to build gradient flows in a probability space which are capable of transporting any initial distribution to a target data set. These new methods will also be adapted for structure-preserving learning, arising in applications ranging from medicine to the design of new molecules, where data can exhibit symmetries or physical constraints. This additional knowledge will be taken into account in the probability divergence to build structure-preserving generative algorithms in an efficient way.

The applicability of these algorithms will be expanded to handle large and noisy data sets, complex media, and scenarios where sources and receivers are not collocated?a significant limitation in existing reduced model approaches.

Of special interest are two problems that involve complex interactions between surface waves and underlying currents or between surface waves and floating structures. These coupled processes are still not well understood and raise challenging questions in oceanography and engineering. Wave-current interactions play a key role in many circumstances like the generation of rogue waves or the transport of contaminants in the open ocean, as well as the mechanism of sediment transport which drives beach erosion in coastal areas. All these have far-reaching implications for a broad range of human activities related to the shipping, tourism, fishing or oil industries, and coastal infrastructure. An important application of wave-structure interactions is to wave power extraction by floating wave energy converters. Ocean waves have great potential as a source of renewable energy but entail many scientific challenges. Wave farms where arrays of wave energy converters are placed in a geometric configuration over extended maritime areas have been considered as a serious option. Determination of the optimal configuration under various wave conditions is crucial for maximizing power absorption in such a system. This research develops new mathematical models for these coupled phenomena that have so far been poorly represented in operational wave forecasting yet are of great relevance in the context of climate change and energy crisis. This project also provides opportunities for the participation and training of graduate students.<br/><br/>Under consideration are situations where nonlinear wave interactions occur over a wide range of length and time scales in a complex environment, which poses serious difficulties for their asymptotic analysis and numerical simulation. Examples include ocean waves interacting with a vortical current and ocean waves interacting with an array of floating wave energy converters. In both cases, a Hamiltonian formulation can be established to describe the problem and therefore Hamiltonian techniques are ideal to properly analyze it. Such techniques however are still not sufficiently advanced in the context of nonlinear partial differential equations. The investigator constructs building blocks for this Hamiltonian formalism where the presence of multiple scales can be naturally accommodated in the asymptotic analysis while producing approximations that preserve important structural properties such as energy conservation. This research contributes to the development of the theory of weak wave turbulence in complex media. Both deterministic and statistical viewpoints are adopted to obtain reduced nonlinear models for the long-time evolution of the wave amplitude and wave spectrum. Exact equilibrium solutions of these model equations associated with invariants of motion are derived and numerical simulations for more general nonlinear cases are performed to complement the theoretical predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intuitively, metastable behavior includes sudden transitions, separated by long time intervals, between near-equilibrium states of a system. This behavior is exhibited inside a variety of fields, e.g., in molecular dynamics, genetic mutations, certain economic models, etc. The long-term influence of small perturbations is an essential part of the perturbation theory - one of the main methods in applied mathematics. For various time scales, the main states of the perturbed system are investigated and described, along with the transitions between these states. These results enable introducing a measure of stability of the states with respect to the perturbations and considering certain optimal control problems. The project involves several graduate students working along with the principal investigator on related research topics. <br/> <br/>The project approach is based on considering the limiting (in an appropriate time scale) motion on the simplex of invariant probability measures of the unperturbed system. In the case of random perturbations, the hierarchy of cycles and metastable distributions will be calculated using large-deviation-type results. These calculations will be based on a non-linear spectral problem for the corresponding partial differential equations. If the unperturbed system has a first integral, the construction is, in a sense, a generalization of the averaging principle; on the other hand, the limiting slow evolution for this specific case will be considered on a space that is more sophisticated than in the classical case.

Collaborations with industry will ensure the development of numerical methods that are responsive to the realistic, real-world challenges of advanced semiconductor design, while also ensuring that the resulting numerical tools will be broadly disseminated into engineering practice.

Notwithstanding significant progress, a complete understanding of turbulent motion remains one of the grand challenges in science and engineering.  In particular, a precise description of the role the coherent vortex structures (e.g., the wingtip vortices or the current sheets in the solar wind) play in turbulence remains elusive. The fact that the regions of the intense fluid activity self-organize in these coherent structures is also referred to as the 'spatial intermittency' of turbulent flows. The goal of the project is to utilize a novel mathematical framework for the study of spatial intermittency in fluid flows introduced by the principal investigator (PI) to tackle several open problems in the field, including the classical problem of the vortex sheet roll-up. The project will also provide opportunities for the involvement of the students in the research. <br/><br/>The overarching objective of this project is to demonstrate the broader utility of the mathematical framework based on the spatial intermittency of the regions of intense fluid activity that had been developed by the PI and the collaborators in the quest to bridge the scaling gap in the Navier-Stokes (NS) regularity problem. The project branches into three subprojects. The first one is in the context of hyper-diffusion. Here, the goal is to show that?as soon as the power of the Laplacian is strictly greater than one?locality of the nonlinear interactions will imply regularity. In addition to the mathematical interest, this is also intriguing from the standpoint of the physics of turbulence since the locality of the nonlinear transfer is one of the tenets of turbulence phenomenology. The second one will consider the NS flows in several critical spaces in which only the small data regularity results are known. The key idea here is to gain a logarithm (in the case of large data) by reformulating the concept of local one-dimensional sparseness at scale in terms of the local directional maximal function. The third one concerns the classical problem of the vortex sheet roll-up. The main goal here is to investigate a stabilizing effect of the viscosity?considering the full NS system?based on local one-dimensional sparseness of the vorticity super-level sets. More precisely, the framework will naturally identify a family of constraints among viscosity, on one side, and the thickness and the curvature of the sheet on the other.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The underlying mathematical difficulties of the theory are compounded when the time interval for the problem under consideration becomes infinite, and uncertainties, i.e., stochastic effects, need to be accounted for.

Compared with explicit solvent models, which treat both the solute and the solvent as individual molecules, implicit solvent models, which average the effect of solvent phase as continuum media, are much more efficient and thus can handle much larger systems. Central to the construction of implicit solvent models is an interface separating the solute and solvent domains. However, commonly used interface definitions are ad hoc partitions and thus either non-negligibly overestimate or underestimate the solvation free energies.

Since experimentally observed solvation energies are ensemble averages, the primary objective of this research is to develop a diffuse-interface VISM capable of capturing the ensemble average solvation energy (EASE). EASE represents the weighted average of solvation energies computed from all possible microstates of the solute-solvent system. In the routine calculation of EASE, one needs to carry out explicit solvent simulations, such as molecular dynamics (MD), to obtain thousands of solute-solvent configurations (snapshots) and perform energy calculations for each snapshot. Leveraging tools from statistical mechanics and geometric measure theory, this project aims to develop an innovative diffuse-interface VISM that rigorously reproduces EASE by utilizing a single diffuse interface profile instead of thousands of individual snapshots. Furthermore, while diffuse-interface VISMs offer improved accuracy compared to implicit solvent models utilizing predetermined interfaces, the computational cost associated with determining the interface poses a significant challenge. This limitation hampers the application of diffuse-interface VISMs to large molecular systems. Therefore, the second goal of this research is to develop accelerated numerical algorithms for solvation energy computation within the framework of diffuse-interface VISMs. By capitalizing on the structure of the proposed diffuse-interface VISM functional, a novel optimization algorithm will be devised that combines the augmented Lagrangian method with an inexact Newton scheme. This innovative approach will markedly enhance computational efficiency. Lastly, the analysis of the proposed model will provide novel techniques for studying the regularity of solutions to total variation minimization problems.

Since experimentally observed solvation energies are ensemble averages, the primary objective of this research is to develop a diffuse-interface VISM capable of capturing the ensemble average solvation energy (EASE). EASE represents the weighted average of solvation energies computed from all possible microstates of the solute-solvent system. In the routine calculation of EASE, one needs to carry out explicit solvent simulations, such as molecular dynamics (MD), to obtain thousands of solute-solvent configurations (snapshots) and perform energy calculations for each snapshot. Leveraging tools from statistical mechanics and geometric measure theory, this project aims to develop an innovative diffuse-interface VISM that rigorously reproduces EASE by utilizing a single diffuse interface profile instead of thousands of individual snapshots. Furthermore, while diffuse-interface VISMs offer improved accuracy compared to implicit solvent models utilizing predetermined interfaces, the computational cost associated with determining the interface poses a significant challenge. This limitation hampers the application of diffuse-interface VISMs to large molecular systems. Therefore, the second goal of this research is to develop accelerated numerical algorithms for solvation energy computation within the framework of diffuse-interface VISMs. By capitalizing on the structure of the proposed diffuse-interface VISM functional, a novel optimization algorithm will be devised that combines the augmented Lagrangian method with an inexact Newton scheme. This innovative approach will markedly enhance computational efficiency. Lastly, the analysis of the proposed model will provide novel techniques for studying the regularity of solutions to total variation minimization problems. The analytic techniques developed within the scope of this research project may also have broader relevance and applicability within the mathematical community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, understanding how this process works is crucial to predicting the future evolution of the planet's climate.  The basic mechanism is one in which dissolved carbon-dioxide gas from the atmosphere is converted by phytoplankton, through photosynthesis, into solid carbon, which then sinks to the ocean bottom, where it is eventually turned into oil over the eons.  Precisely how this solid sinking carbon forms into large particle clusters is not well understood, and it is a focus of this award.  The PIs have recently experimentally discovered and theoretically explained a novel mechanism for the creation of particle clusters in stratified waters which only relies upon the presence of density stratification and gravitation.  They established that particles suspended in stratified waters can create their own fluid flows,  which draw other nearby particles into forming larger cluster aggregations.  This phenomenon offers a possible mechanism for how the so-called Marine Snow, agglomerates of sedimenting carbon-rich ""flakes,""  may form in ocean waters.  Understanding the details of particle aggregate formation is necessary for predicting how much and how fast the ocean can absorb carbon, and this award seeks to improve our understanding of this fundamental process. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>Recent discoveries by the PIs, involving self-assembly in stratified fluids and ergodic behavior of diffusing solutes advected by random shear layers, have identified many new fundamental questions regarding the underlying mechanisms responsible for these phenomena. For the case of self-assembly, diffusion-induced flows for single and multiple bodies will be studied analytically, computationally, and experimentally with the goal of developing a uniformly valid asymptotic expansion at both low and high Peclet numbers. This will include an in-depth study of the mechanisms and forces at play for the finite time collapse of coupled spheres experimentally observed by the PIs. Our work is the first step in understanding how large-scale aggregates may form in stratified waters.  In the context of the ergodicity, new asymptotic theories using center manifold techniques will be applied to non-flat walls randomly moving in viscous fluids.  We explore how randomness, injected through the wall motion, propagates into the fluid and into dissolved solutes to better understand mixing in physically realizable non-sheared flows.  The study of both mixing and self-assembly by diffusion-induced flows is expected to improve our knowledge of ocean aggregate formation, which ultimately sets the timescales for carbon sinking in the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes advances in cryptography, faster calculations, and better understanding of natural processes taking place at the atomic level. Because of its spanning impact, QIS addresses many areas of national interest, including cybersecurity,  pharmaceuticals, financial services, health care, among others. QIS involves a fundamentally different logic than classical information science, and advances in the field (in areas such as quantum algorithms and quantum cryptography) have often depended on creative mathematical breakthroughs. Furthermore, mathematics is an accessible entry point to QIS for students and mentors from a wide range of backgrounds and skill levels. With these principles in mind, this project strengthens both mathematics and QIS by training mathematicians to enter the world of quantum research. A holistic curriculum guides program participants from learning quantum principles to applying sophisticated mathematical tools to advance QIS, while also exploring the societal impact of their research. This project will support the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoc fellows from the Mathematical Sciences, to be mentored by faculty who are leaders in fields relevant to mathematics and quantum science. By expanding QIS training to Mathematics, this project will contribute to a more robust and diverse QIS workforce.<br/><br/>This project will advance mathematics by tackling cutting-edge theoretical questions within three research themes that are mature enough to allow for mathematical treatment and innovation: Quantum Algorithms, Quantum Cryptography, and Quantum Systems. Each of these themes has rigorous mathematical models (that the community agrees are useful) and these models rise to an abundance of mathematical problems that are yet to be explored and whose solution is likely to have high impact on scientific computing, cybersecurity, and nanotechnology. Fifteen faculty will mentor undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in QIS projects that draw from algebra/representation theory, nonlinear analysis, partial differential equations, scientific computing, and stochastic analysis. Research goals will include: to develop new and enhance existing quantum algorithms, to use the power of mathematics to expand the range and usefulness of quantum cryptography, and to improve Quantum Information Science through advances in quantum systems theory and vice versa. The project is expected to stimulate the research and careers of mathematicians by equipping them to pursue research in Quantum Information Science, both at the University of Maryland, College Park level and at the national level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These methods will be deployed on problems in imaging, biology, and other high-impact domains. They will be implemented in general-purpose codes, to be released for public use.

While there exist numerous techniques for approximating solutions to many types of PDEs, it is the case that certain problems of practical interest exhibit various types of pathology, which render many standard techniques either highly inefficient or unusable. Such situations often arise in the setting of nonlinear problems which are posed in high dimensions or exhibit singularities, such as in the study of solid-fuel combustion optimization, oil pipeline corrosion predictions, and high-frequency financial trading. This project intends to provide means of circumventing the aforementioned issues through the rigorous study and development of so-called structure-preserving deep neural networks (DNNs). While it has been experimentally observed that DNNs provide highly capable methods of approximating solutions to a large class of problems, it is the case that the theoretical justification of such observations is still in its early stage. To that end, this project will provide a much-needed theory for certain classes of high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs via a two-pronged approach: namely, explicit randomized methods will be constructed which demonstrate desired properties while simultaneously developing theoretical tools representing and studying a large class of objects via DNNs. This approach requires the use of numerous tools from applied mathematics, functional analysis, stochastic analysis, and novel DNN computations. This unique intersection of techniques will serve as the basis for the project's educational and training components, which aim to increase the presence of women, minorities, and other underrepresented groups in mathematical research. This goal will be accomplished through the training and mentoring first-generation and underrepresented students at both graduate and undergraduate levels.<br/><br/>This project aims to address the question of whether or not it can be rigorously proven that there exist DNNs to approximate solutions to a large class of high-dimensional PDEs without suffering from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). The demonstration that DNNs are able to represent solutions to certain classes of high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs with a prescribed accuracy while not suffering from the CoD will fill a gap in the existing theory regarding machine learning algorithms. While the current focus is on studying the expressibility of DNNs with regard to solutions of PDEs, it is the case that this work will also serve as the foundation for extending such studies to other types of problems. This project will extend the existing theory of multilevel Picard (MLP) approximation methods to more general high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs, focusing on preserving inherent qualitative structures. The study of MLP approximations will also result in novel theoretical results regarding various stochastic fixed-point equations. Finally, the proposed work will provide explicit details on how to construct CoD-free DNN representations of various mathematical objects while also exploring theoretical issues related to popular activation functions. These ideas will be utilized in proving DNN-representation results and will provide a deeper understanding of how activation functions affect optimality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include voice assistants, facial recognition for cellphones, and machine-learning-based financial fraud detection. But many algorithms are applied only heuristically and remain poorly understood, meaning that theoretical guarantees are missing. In fact, recent AI applications indicate that the direct application of these algorithms, without proper validation, may generate artificial, misleading information.  The broad aim of this proposal is to deepen our understanding of classes of statistically-relevant random matrix models that are used to model, analyze and interpret large data sets and to analyze new and classical algorithms as they act on these models.  It is expected that this will produce new insights and statistical tools, paired with theoretical guarantees.

The first concerns the analysis of random matrix models that extend the classical setting of sample covariance matrices. Then by connecting random matrix models and orthogonal polynomials via Riemann--Hilbert problems, the PIs will obtain new estimates and new conclusions about orthogonal polynomials for natural measures generated by these random matrices.  Armed with the theoretical results, the second project concerns the direct application of the estimates from the first project, and further refinement of previous analyses, to understand the average-case behavior of numerical algorithms.  The focus here is on algorithms from numerical linear algebra.  In the third project, the investigators will use the new random matrix estimates, the new results in the theory of orthogonal polynomials and its associated Riemann--Hilbert theory, for both classical and new random matrix ensembles, to generate new algorithms, ultimately leading to new viable statistical estimators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research is expected to progress the mathematical underpinnings of these DNN-based approaches and enable effective computational algorithms for solving these PDEs in practice. The project also naturally provides research topics to train the next generation of mathematicians and engineers in this interdisciplinary field.  <br/><br/>Geometric flows in the space of probability distributions equipped with the optimal transport metric, the so-called Wasserstein manifold, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Wasserstein gradient and Hamiltonian flows are two of the most prevalent types of such flows. This project develops a novel framework to analyze and compute the Wasserstein gradient and Hamiltonian flows in the space of DNN parameters. The main objectives include (i) establishing parameterized Wasserstein sub-manifolds, via a push-forward map and pullback Wasserstein metric and their mathematical foundations; (ii) developing computationally efficient formulations for the parameterized Wasserstein geometric flows and conducting convergence analysis and error estimates in Wasserstein space; and (iii) connecting the new formulations to several classical PDEs including the Schrödinger and Fokker-Planck equations. The parameterized Wasserstein gradient and Hamiltonian flows are nontraditional, finite dimensional approximations of their counterparts on the Wasserstein manifold. They present new formulations that have approximation guarantees, are versatile, and are amenable to practical computational algorithms. These results can also be extended to other topics in applied mathematics involving density evolutions, such as generative models, mean-field control, and mean-field games.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is essential in enabling neural network models to be widely deployed in sensitive fields across engineering domains. Graduate students will be trained as part of this project, modern tools from data science and deep learning will be incorporated into graduate curricula, and outreach activities are planned to attract undergraduates as well as underrepresented groups in STEM into this research area.<br/><br/>The focus of this work is on the use of neural network models in numerical algorithms used in models based on the calculus of variations, targeting two case studies. The first is related to functionals that exhibit the Lavrentiev gap phenomena, where an energy gap between the lowest energy achievable by shallow neural networks and more general functions is considered. The second is the Allen-Cahn equation, where the solution strategy of physics-inspired neural networks is analyzed. In the second problem, the adaptivity of neural networks to low-dimensional moving interfaces plays a key role when comparing to e.g. fixed mesh finite element methods.

In both natural and experimental settings, spatio-temporal heterogeneities, such as impurities, external forcing, dynamic quenching, and slow evolution of system parameters have been shown to select the type of structure formed in a system and mediate the formation of defects. This project is motivated and organized by three examples: directional quenching in light-sensitive chemical reaction systems, slow spatial ramping in fluid convection rolls, and defect formation in slowly quenched systems. It seeks to rigorously understand the interaction of dynamic heterogeneities with patterns in important and relevant mathematical models, and will focus on how heterogeneities can induce novel behavior not observed in spatially homogeneous settings.  The results of this project will aid in the understanding of pattern formation in many other scientific domains, including animal digit formation, skin patterning, tissue formation, vegetation patterning in semi-arid climates, structure formation in the early universe, and slow cooling of crystalline phases in functional materials.  The results of this project could also aid in the design and assembly of functional materials at various length scales.  The project will foster the development of early career researchers through undergraduate research experiences and graduate research projects. <br/><br/><br/>The project seeks to develop new mathematical tools to rigorously study coherent structures and their interactions with dynamic heterogeneities in prototypical partial differential equation models. It focuses on how such heterogeneities can induce dynamic bifurcations in spatially-extended systems. It will develop and apply novel techniques from finite and infinite dimensional dynamical systems theory, functional analysis, and numerical computation in three project areas, studying patterns and quasi-patterns in quenched systems, fronts and patterns in the presence of slowly-varying spatial ramps, and dynamic bifurcation of patterns via slow temporal quenching. The first area will evidence the use of the moduli space of quenched patterns in an experimentally relevant reaction-diffusion system. It also seeks to extend spatial dynamics techniques to 2- and 3-dimensional domains which do not have a single distinguished unbounded direction. In addition to gaining insight into the effect of quenching and other heterogeneities on patterns in such domains, these techniques will be widely useful in many different settings across the field of nonlinear waves and coherent structures. It will also study how heterogeneities affect the formation of seldom studied super-lattice and quasi-patterns. The second and third project areas will also contribute in several ways to the recently flourishing field of dynamic bifurcation in PDEs. The second area will investigate how slow spatial ramps select and control patterns, while the third will reveal new front, pattern, and defect formation phenomena through such slowly-varying temporal quenches.

The first project focuses on a class of models, known as Kyle models, which describe how information is exchanged among participants in a financial market. These models can be used, for example, to detect insider trading. The second project focuses on a class of equations, known as Backward Stochastic Differential Equations, to better understand strategic behavior of agents in a wide range of competitive environments. Finally, the third project aims to understand the dynamics and the nature of the kinds of random fluctuations one often observes in financial market volatility. Finally, the project will have a significant impact on education and training, not only through the improvement of advising and teaching at the PI's own institution, but also through national and international dissemination of the produced research findings and knowledge.<br/><br/>The first project concerning Kyle modeling focuses on the recent work of the PI and his collaborators, where ""noise trading"" with stochastic volatility was studied. The PI plans to extend these results in various directions, such as the introduction of several assets, the study of the relationship with an intriguing optimization problem, and an investigation of a related nonstandard decomposition problem for stochastic processes. The second project will tackle several problems related to the existence and uniqueness of solutions for systems of nonlinear, fully-coupled, Backward Stochastic Differential Equations. In particular, the PI plans to continue this study and focus on the non-Markovian case using methods based on past results on the so-called ""submartingale"" characterization as well as on linear systems with BMO-coefficients.

The frameworks specifically addressed in this project are models for tumor growth and the robustness of machine learning classification systems to malicious attackers, the latter also known in the literature as adversarial attacks. In the case of tumor growth, the key interface is the boundary separating the cancerous region and the healthy cell region.  Tracking and predicting the shape of this boundary has important implications for disease treatment and prognosis.  The key interfaces for robust machine learning classification are the decision boundaries between different classes.  If a classifier has extremely irregular decision boundaries, then an adversary can produce erroneous results by slightly perturbing the input data.  These attacks are particularly striking in computer vision, where pixel changes that are imperceptible to human vision can fool well-trained models with high confidence.  This project will advance our knowledge in both of these applications by studying the theoretical properties of these interfaces and by developing new computational algorithms and software to simulate these interfaces.

On the theoretical side, the well-posedness of these models and an understanding of how model choice and parameter regimes affect the regularity of the tumor boundary will be established.  In addition, efficient numerical solvers will be developed, paying particular attention to model instances that are too challenging for the current theoretical understanding, including models where even the global-in-time existence of weak solutions is unknown.  In the case of data classification, a better understanding of the regularizing effect that adversarial learning has on class interfaces will be established, and these insights will be used to guide parameter choices.

Each of these might sound completely unrelated, but the main idea behind the project is that similar methods from harmonic analysis and optimization can be applied to each of these problems when viewed through the right lens. A substantial part of the project will be performed in collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs, towards developing theoretical and computational tools, while at the same time maintaining and creating new collaborations with physicists, especially in terms of applications. Special attention will be paid to working with numerical analysts at the forefront of simulating problems in each application domain.<br/><br/><br/>Algorithms for solving complicated problems in physics, fluid mechanics and data analysis will be considered, with a special focus on quantifiable error estimates and rigorous constructions of various fundamental modes or resonances for physically important examples.

This will give enhanced error estimates for numerical solutions to the Helmholtz equation, which play a major role in various applications for inverse problems in medical imaging, sonar detection, and more.  In particular, although numerical simulations are by nature constrained to certain bounded domains, one can understand how to provide damping of a fluid at certain points to allow for a numerical simulation of the way a wave propagates in the open ocean without getting effects from the boundary.  This is done by adding a ?damping term? that could perturb the system in a significant way.  However, upon performing a certain transformation, the essence of this damping lies in computing properties of operators that arise in quantum mechanics with complex potentials. The complex and rich tools that have been recently developed in microlocal analysis, optimization and elliptic theory of partial differential equations allow us to give strong insights and new means of establishing quantitative bounds.  These apply to the efficacy of damped fluid models, as well as to questions related to the behavior of a light wave in a crystalline structure with defects.

The wide area of applications of this phenomenon includes biomedical engineering and design of micro- and nano-technological equipment. The second aspect concerns the effect of flow-induced oscillations on a spring-mounted structure.

To date, this question represents an entirely uncharted territory.  Another and not less important mathematical feature of the proposed research consists in the detailed study of the range of nonlinear elliptic operators (related to Navier-Stokes-like boundary-value problems) that are Fredholm of negative index.

Such observations reveal the presence of differentially rotating fluid atmospheres with embedded features in the form of large-scale eddies and jets that greatly influence the climate on the celestial body. On Earth the impact of the high latitude jet stream on weather and the destructive impact of hurricanes due to climate change is evident. Within the Jovian atmosphere, the recent discovery by the Juno mission of polar vortices illuminates the longevity of vortical structures. Theory, experimentation, and numerical simulations strongly suggest that the generation of large-scale jets and vortices is common in fluid turbulence within thin layers like the Earth?s atmosphere and on rapidly rotating celestial bodies such as Jupiter. Focusing on these paradigms, this project is dedicated to elucidating the basic mechanism behind the formation of such large-scale structures from small-scale turbulent fluctuations and its disruption via the generation of isolated, weakly-interacting, mesoscale shielded vortices, and to extending this understanding to more realistic models that introduce higher level physics such as the effects of water vapor and internal heating via latent heat release. This understanding will inform more detailed studies such as those based on realistic Global Ocean and Atmospheric Circulation Models and offers hope for understanding the conditions favoring the formation of both large-scale structures and of the smaller-scale shielded vortices. The modeling strategy taken provides a foundation upon which greater discipline-specific complexity can be built. The project will support and train one graduate student and one postdoctoral researcher in the physical understanding of energy transfer between scales in systems of geophysical relevance, asymptotic and other modeling techniques, as well as direct numerical simulations of rapidly rotating fluid layers, appropriate for planetary-scale phenomena on and within the Earth.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to classify different regimes of instability-driven turbulence in two dimensions (2D) as a function of the energy input and dissipation parameters, and to explore how these states evolve when three-dimensional (3D) fluctuations become increasingly important as the height of the turbulent layer increases. Particular emphasis will be placed on the recently discovered regime of shielded mesoscale vortices whose generation may disrupt the inverse energy cascade familiar from 2D turbulence with random stirring. Properties of the resulting chiral mesoscale vortex gas will be studied as a function of the layer height, as will the transition to a vortex crystal that takes place at high vortex density in 2D. The Reynolds number will be varied systematically to bridge the gap between these phenomena and related states in bacterial suspensions at low Reynolds numbers. The possibility of an analogous state in rapidly rotating 3D turbulence will be investigated in detail using a new reformulation of the Navier-Stokes fluid equations, extending direct numerical simulations to smaller Rossby numbers, together with a theoretical analysis dissecting the amplitude-phase relationships between large-scale structures and small-scale turbulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An outstanding case is that of power-grid networks, which rely on synchronization among power generators to operate. In the mathematical modeling of such systems, the networks are usually represented by the dynamical entities that define the nodes and the network structure that defines the interactions among nodes. Because contemporary research in network science emphasizes the role of interactions in giving rise to emergent behavior, existing studies have focused mainly on the optimization of the network structure for given nodes. Recent research has shown, however, that in many situations it is more desirable to optimize the node parameters, and this is a problem for which adequate methods do not currently exist. This project will develop and apply mathematical and computational methods to improve synchronization stability of relevance to the U.S. power-grid network by optimizing node parameters. Successful completion of the planned research is expected to lead to design and operation principles that can improve power-grid stability. The project will also provide interdisciplinary research training to one graduate student and several undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The project builds on the recent observation that explicit symmetry breaking can often be used to stabilize synchronization states in network systems. Implementation of this idea requires solving a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem that cannot be satisfactorily addressed by existing linear methods. The project will develop and apply a rigorous nonlinear method tailored to address this class of optimization problems in power-grid networks. The project consists of four parts: 1) the development of a nonlinear, second-order theory, 2) the development of an iterative numerical algorithm implementing the theory, 3) the application of the resulting methods to the U.S. power-grid network, and 4) the application of the methods to study conditions under which explicit symmetry breaking can benefit stability. The expected outcomes will lead to new opportunities for the stabilization of desired synchronous states and an improved understanding of the factors that contribute to stability. The project is interdisciplinary and will provide research training to one Ph.D. student and three summer undergraduate students, including students underrepresented in STEM, thereby advancing workforce development while promoting inclusion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses the need for establishing universal guarantees for sparse recovery of signals that are related to both the mathematical structure of the dictionary as well as the geometric conditions that are used to synthesize the signal. These results will be used for developing requirements and recovery guarantees for accurate machine learning predictions from a sparsely generated signals, detecting emerging hot spots in an epidemic spreading through a network of cities, and detecting symmetries in molecular dynamics to reduce the relevant data when calculating various quantities such as binding energies. The project also involves the training of graduate students in the mathematical, computational, and interdisciplinary aspects of this project.   <br/><br/>The expected outcomes of the project include the following goals with broad relevance in data science. The first is the accurate recovery of signals that are sparsely synthesized in a finite or infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel space from noisy measurements. Sparse recovery is a central part of support vector regression, which will be carried out for radial Gaussian kernels in high-dimensional spaces. These results from sparse recovery are expected to give insight in the choice of model parameters such as the width of the Gaussian depending on the spacing of the samples. Similar recovery guarantees will also be established for functions on graphs, when the dictionary consists of heat kernels that are indexed by the pair of a vertex and a time for the diffusion of the kernel under the heat semigroup, will also be established. These results have relevance for the detection of hot spots when an infectious disease spreads across the globe, driven by local exponential growth and diffusion between population centers. Another goal is to identify group symmetries from noisy observations of the orbit of a collection of vectors.

Examples of shock waves abound in nature and technology: sonic booms generated by commercial and military airplanes, bow shocks generated by space vehicles upon re-entry through the atmosphere, and bow shocks created when the solar wind hits the planets, to name a few. Although a good theoretical understanding of the formation and subsequent propagation of shock waves exists for one-dimensional (i.e., planar) flows, the corresponding state of affairs in multiple space dimensions is much less satisfactory. The purpose of this project is to develop a  new geometric framework and a new mathematical description of the wave motion that allows for a detailed description of shock formation and the subsequent dynamics of shock waves. This project will also offer research opportunities and collaborative experiences for graduate students and postdocs at the University of California, Davis, and New York University.<br/><br/>This project will develop the analytical and geometric framework for resolving one of the foremost unanswered questions in the fields of hyperbolic PDE and mathematical fluid dynamics: the formation and unique propagation of hydrodynamical shocks from smooth initial data, in multiple space dimensions. The first step is called ""shock formation"". Here the smooth initial data is evolved up to a cusp-like Eulerian spacetime hypersurface of first singularities, where the gradient of the velocity, pressure, density, and energy becomes infinite, but these fields retain Holder 1/3 regularity. The PIs approach to determining the location and the geometry of this cusp-like spacetime hypersurface of first singularities relies upon the construction of a smooth spacetime geometry, together and a new set of hydrodynamic variables in the Arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) description of acoustic wave propagation. The second step is called ""shock development"" wherein one uses the analytical description of the solution on the cusp-like spacetime hypersurface of first singularities as Cauchy data, from which the shock surface of discontinuity instantaneously develops. In conjunction with the shock surface, we shall establish the emergence of so-called weak characteristic discontinuities; these are characteristic surfaces that emerge simultaneously (with the shock) from the pre-shock, and along which, gradients of velocity, density, and entropy exhibit one-sided Holder cusps. This framework enables the study of even more complicated physical models such as the magnetohydrodynamic equations (MHD) of plasma flow. Here, unlike the lone classical compressive shock of gas dynamics, six different types of MHD shocks can be analyzed with our approach: a fast shock, a slow shock, and four different intermediate shocks. The latter were observed by the Voyager spacecraft in Earth?s heliosphere, but their mathematical existence, to date, remains in question.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many instances, like in the case of chemical reactions, these structures emerge from the interaction of two competing processes that lead to an instability. Roughly, the first mechanism relates to the intrinsic behavior of the system, while the second one corresponds to a transport, or diffusion process. While in most cases diffusion is the correct mechanism to consider, in many biological applications it does not capture the observed behavior. This is particularly true when modeling dispersion of populations or plant seeds, or when looking at hunting or foraging behavior of certain animals. In this project, the investigator studies how these nonlocal forms of dispersal affect pattern formation in physical and biological applications. The main motivation comes from arid ecosystems, which are known to exhibit patterns of banded vegetation. While most mathematical models use diffusion to represent dispersal of plant seeds, numerical experiments suggest that these equations, although more tractable, ignore critical information. For example, the analysis of these 'local' models shows that changes in the spacing between bands of vegetation due to reduced rainfall often signal a possible irreversible transition to a fully desert state. However, when nonlocal seed dispersal is considered, simulations indicate that the resilience of these ecosystems with respect to such changes is increased. The discrepancy between these two models highlights the need for more in-depth studies of long-range dispersal effects. To study these effects, a nonlocal Gray-Scott model will be used as a test case. This specific set of equations also provides a basis for interesting projects for graduate students and for summer research experiences for undergraduates. <br/><br/><br/>Because nonlocal processes are often modeled using convolution operators, the main obstacle for studying these systems comes from the limited set of mathematical and numerical tools available to analyze these maps. Indeed, most studies represent these operators using convolution kernels that have properties which facilitate their analysis. At the same time, numerical simulations often ignore the fact that convolution maps require information about the unknown outside the computational domain, and thus incorrectly implement boundary constraints. One of the project's goals is to provide methods for proving Fredholm properties for these maps by choosing as their domain a specific class of functions with algebraic decay. This work allows investigators to use the implicit function theorem to prove the existence of patterns. Since the class of functions being considered also provides information about the level of decay of solutions at infinity, this information can then be used to construct numerical schemes with appropriate boundary constraints.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This interest is due to the importance of these media in solid-state physics. Until the 1970s all materials studied consisted of periodic arrays or were amorphous. In the last decades a new class of solid-state matter, called aperiodic crystals, has been found. An aperiodic crystal is a long-range ordered structure but without lattice periodicity. It is found in a wide range of materials: organic and inorganic compounds, minerals (including a substantial portion of the earth's crust), metallic alloys (under various pressures and temperatures), and even some proteins. The 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognizes the discovery of quasicrystals, in which atoms are ordered over long distances but not in the periodically repeating arrangement of traditional crystals. The present research is focused on the investigation of the properties of such quasi-periodic structures using appropriate mathematical models. This study will lead to the understanding of the mechanism of electrical conductivity in modulated crystals, especially, of the phenomenon of the metal-insulator transition.<br/><br/>The proposed activity will lead to research in different classical as well as modern areas of mathematics and theoretical physics.

The proposed activity covers some old and new questions for almost-periodic structures which have a lot of applications in physics and engineering. The methods and constructions are quite intricate and are of great interest to both mathematicians and physicists. The proposed research will lead to a better understanding of some very important questions in quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, the theory of quantum networks, spectral theory, spectral geometry, the theory of photonic crystals, and many others.

In the seminal model by Holmström and Milgrom (1987), a principal (she) is imperfectly informed about the actions of an agent (he) on a random process representing the value of a project over time. To incentivize the agent to act in her best interest, she can offer him a contract, namely a terminal payment indexed on the value of the project. These problems are fundamentally related to the design of optimal incentives and are therefore present in a wide variety of situations, including not only economics but also politics, finance, etc. Although this theory has been extended to allow the principal to contract with many agents, the possibility that agents may be impacted by common hazards and risks is currently mostly neglected. This research focuses on the development of principal-agent problems to incorporate the fact that the agents may live in a common uncertain environment and may interact with each other but also with this environment. This research theme is motivated by several concrete applications, where this common uncertain environment cannot be neglected when looking for the optimal actions or incentives to implement, e.g., optimization of electricity production and consumption, regulation of financial and systemic risks, or design of optimal and sustainable insurance policies. The themes are at the heart of current economical and societal challenges, both nationally and internationally. Studying them in a quantitative way can therefore help inform public policy, and thus contribute to the achievement of societally relevant outcomes. This research will also have an essential mentoring orientation, involving graduate students from the Operations Research & Financial Engineering Graduate Program, who will be partially supported by the funds awarded.<br/><br/>Considering a common random environment induces a wide range of additional mathematical difficulties, which have only been recently addressed, albeit only for pure mean-field games. To address this type of general problem, technical results will be further developed, notably on second order backward stochastic differential equations (2BSDEs), which are typically used to determine the optimal form of contracts in principal-agent problems. To consider general multi-agent problems with Nash or mean-field interactions, it is necessary to develop generalized notions of 2BSDEs, namely multidimensional or mean-field 2BSDEs. Moreover, even in a classical framework, the idea of considering common jumps in a multi-agent or mean-field setting has never been investigated, despite its relevance to model collective accidents such as climatic hazards and will involve the study of (multidimensional or mean-field) 2BSDEs with jumps. Finally, with the idea of ensuring the implementation of realistic contracts, a principal?s problem with constraints on the contract can be reformulated as a stochastic target problem. These theoretical developments will considerably advance knowledge in the field of 2BSDE and more broadly of stochastic control and will allow the study of the various applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second regime is that of  reversed flows. These flows are observed after boundary layer separation. Mathematically, this regime will require the introduction of new techniques from mixed-type problems, free boundary problems, and many other PDE disciplines.

This workshop will bring together researchers in a diversity of fields in and around TQC for the purpose of broadening and deepening the subject, with an eye towards accelerating the realization of scalable technology.<br/><br/>The hurdle of scalable fault-tolerance is insurmountable with the current incremental progress -- while it is possible to engineer systems supporting hundreds of physical qubits, applications beyond mere proof of principle require millions of qubits to implement robust error correction. Topological quantum computation relies upon the preparation of topological phases of matter supporting non-abelian anyons to perform inherently fault-tolerant operations. As errors are corrected at the hardware level through the topological nature of anyons, the problem of scalability is simultaneously overcome. On the other hand, despite years of effort we still do not have unassailable confirmation that non-abelian anyons exist. We will explore new directions beyond the traditional anyon community,  embracing relevant topics such as quantum cellular automata, fractons, categorical symmetries and motion groups in 3-dimensions.

Models of small scale materials like nano magnets or designed meta-materials have fluctuations with spatial dependence that affect their performance.  These systems require the development of tools to account for the interaction of multiple sources of noise and spatially-correlated noise to predict both likely structure and transport, as well as unlikely events that could either help or be catastrophic to the system.  The mathematical advancement of this project includes utilizing these tools to find underlying mathematical mechanisms that can be used along with experimental observations, thus increasing our understanding of the physical world. This project contains a natural interdisciplinary blend of physics, biology and mathematics to train the current generation of applied mathematics students as the research field of applied mathematics grows in diversity. The investigators will continue working to increase participation in mathematics. Students have the opportunity to participate in local camps for high school girls in STEM, build mentoring networks at all levels, create inclusive and emotionally positive spaces, and use outstanding visualizations to promote mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>The applications in this project provide an arena for advancing the mathematical tools for analyzing large and infinite dimensional stochastic systems.  These tools center around bringing a system into the energy landscape framework of Langevin systems and further utilizing this framework to explain the system?s behavior.  Specifically, this project answers open problems regarding stochastic coarse-graining and large deviations.   Rather than standard averaging to remove the noise, investigators provide methods to retain both a deterministic term and a fluctuating term to account for the interaction of multiple sources of noise, as well as derive effective equations for a global variable (energy).  From the coarse-grained equations, the project offers methods to asymptotically approximate transition times between metastable states and show equivalence between different techniques on different limits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project integrates theoretical proofs, numerical analysis, and machine learning for understanding singularities in fluids. Our recent investigations demonstrate that intersection between mathematical proofs and deep learning offers an exciting avenue for understanding how singularity occurs in fluids. Together, the five PIs encompass strengths in several areas such as mathematical analysis, numerical simulation, or computer-assisted proofs. In addition, the project will foster collaborations and increased interactions between the researchers at several leading research universities in the US, utilizing tools developed in one field to advance another, and promote learning and training of students and postdoctoral researchers with a goal of broadening the participation of researchers from underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>The PIs will focus on three specific projects: (1) non-uniqueness of the Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier Stokes equations in 3 dimensions, (2) formation of singularities for solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations, and (3) optimization of physics-informed neural networks (PINN). Students, postdoctoral fellows, and visitors will be actively involved in these collaborations. To promote these exchanges research workshops will be organized once a year at the PIs? institutions. These meetings will have two main objectives: a training objective, involving lectures to disseminate current ideas and progress; and an annual meeting of the PIs to review the progress and plan future steps. The PIs will also organize a summer school at Princeton University, aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. The summer school will have a scientific component, including minicourses on the mathematics of fluids, and a mentorship component, including a round table discussion regarding careers in mathematics and a women in mathematics panel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One major challenge in mathematical fluid dynamics is to study the viability of the basic mathematical models, like the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, on reasonably long intervals of time. Another major challenge is to determine what the models have to say about turbulent phenomena and the behavior of fluid flows in the long-term. These seemingly unrelated areas of study are connected by a core of principles and techniques. One of the main goals of the summer school and conference is to bring together leading experts in the analysis of fluid equations to explore these connections and chart future a course of action, to provide junior researchers with the tools to enter these fields, and to bring the opportunity to disseminate and discuss the latest cutting-edge results in the field. The award funds will help defray travel and local expenses of the participants, emphasizing the support of a diverse group of students, postdocs, and junior researchers.  <br/><br/>The main questions that will be considered at this conference relate to the well-posedness and the long-time and statistical behavior of fluid equations and related physical models. In recent years, the PDE analysis of fluid flows and related equations has seen numerous important advances on all the above fronts. There have been numerous breakthroughs in the study of well-posedness and the short-time behavior of solutions, both weak and smooth. Powerful techniques have been introduced to study many problems related to well-posedness of the fundamental equations and related models. There have also been spectacular advances on the study of the long-time behavior and statistical properties of solutions, where new and seemingly generic relaxation mechanisms have been discovered. The conference we are organizing brings together experts from around the world to present recent advances in these areas of research and gives them a venue to foster collaboration and a healthy exchange of ideas.

Understanding the long-term dynamics of two-dimensional fluids is thus fundamental to weather prediction, climate science, and astrophysics. This project aims to advance our understanding of two-dimensional fluids from the perspectives of both geometry and dynamical systems, as well as to bridge the gap between these disciplines through the training of junior researchers and the organizing of mini-courses and conferences.<br/><br/>The focus of this work will be the study of the prototype of all such systems, the forced two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and their inviscid, unforced counterpart, the Euler equations. We will analyze the physically relevant regimes of long time and weak dissipation/forcing, in various orders of limits. A rather surprising and mysterious feature of this system is that, in one regime (Euler), it captures the birth and permanence of order in the form of large hurricane ? like whirls ? while in another regime (Navier-Stokes) it describes a disorderly, seemingly random, turbulent soup of eddies. That is, an ideal Euler fluid tends towards order over time through a process of vortex mergers and mixing, whereas a Navier-Stokes fluid with very slight viscosity and forcing tends towards disorder through a cascade of instabilities in accord with longstanding conjectures of Kolmogorov. The project aims to advance our understanding of these fundamental aspects of fluid motion by studying the behavior of solutions both near and far from equilibrium through the lens of partial differential equations, geometry, and dynamical systems. Computer experiments will be used to inform rigorous mathematical analysis and frame questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Methods for addressing these prediction or estimation questions frequently rely on suitable mathematical models often combined with measurement data. Here challenging issues arise in the form of unavoidable errors or uncertainties in both model and measurements, as well as a limited understanding of the underlying theoretical properties of the model. All such challenges are severely amplified in complex physical systems due to the presence of a large number of degrees of freedom. This project aims to advance rigorous understanding of these problems and develop new techniques in the context of high-dimensional complex systems, particularly arising in fluid dynamics applications. Specifically, the following topics will be addressed: recovery of missing physical parameters from sparse and noisy observations; long-time behavior of stochastically forced models; and investigation of finite-time singularity formation of certain deterministic hydrodynamic models. The research will be integrated with several educational activities to promote learning and professional development opportunities for students and the organization of a workshop on statistical sampling, with participation from both academia and industry. <br/><br/>The research component of this project is subdivided into the following specific projects: 1) Bayesian inverse PDE problems and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This project will expand on a developing theory of MCMC algorithms on general state spaces, including the development of new algorithms and rigorous convergence results. These will be applied in the recovery of infinite-dimensional physical quantities from sparse and noisy data as described by a Bayesian inverse PDE problem, in the context of various fluid dynamics examples. 2) Mixing rates for stochastic PDEs and weak convergence of associated numerical approximations. The PI will show Wasserstein contraction for the Markovian semigroup associated to several stochastic fluid models, a result that implies exponential mixing rates as well as uniqueness of the associated invariant measure. The PI will also consider suitable numerical discretizations of these models and show uniform in time weak convergence and asymptotic numerical bias estimates. 3) Analysis of locally self-similar singularity scenarios in hydrodynamic models. As a means of investigating reliability of mathematical models, the PI will analyze the possible occurrence of finite-time blowup of locally self-similar type in the context of hydrodynamic models. The PI will consider the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equation as a paradigm and analyze both dissipative and non-dissipative cases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This versatile framework includes a vast array of models in the natural sciences, for example, the dynamics of populations of animals and plants in an ecological system, and the shape and form of a turbulent wake behind a passing ship. The work in this proposal concerns chaotic behavior of dynamical systems, signified, for instance, by sensitive dependence on initial conditions ? a phenomenon also known as ?the butterfly effect,? in which tiny changes to the initial preparation of an experiment lead to drastically different outcomes as time progresses.  Chaos is nearly ubiquitous in systems of practical interest.  An example from everyday life is weather prediction: sensitive dependence explains, for instance, why the predicted path of a hurricane widens as one forecasts further into the future, as small imprecisions in our measurements of the present weather system are ?amplified? as time progresses. This CAREER grant will integrate the PI?s research work into educational programs, including directed reading programs and research opportunities for undergraduate students; the introduction of new undergraduate and graduate courses on the treatment of chaotic dynamical systems using tools from probability theory; and a summer school for graduate students in mathematics helping to bring them to the research front of this compelling and rapidly evolving field.  <br/><br/>Chaos is a nearly ubiquitous feature of dynamical systems of practical interest, from low-dimensional toy models to high-dimensional systems, including a wide variety of infinite-dimensional dynamics proscribed by evolutionary PDE such as the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations governing the motion of a viscous fluid.  The tools of smooth ergodic theory provide an abstract framework for understanding chaotic behavior in dynamical systems through the study of their statistical properties, such as the decay of correlations.  However, it remains a major challenge to apply this collection of abstract tools to many systems of practical interest.  For instance, despite considerable supporting numerical evidence, it remains an open problem to prove that the Chirikov standard map has a positive Lyapunov exponent on a positive-volume subset of phase space.  Recent work of the PI and others has uncovered that a small amount of nondegenerate noise is ?amplified? by the presence of stretching in phase space, rendering tractable the problem of determining whether the dynamics is chaotic.  This principle has been applied by the PI to a variety of dynamical systems relevant to practical applications, such as fluid dynamics.  For instance, it was shown by the PI and collaborators that passive tracer (Lagrangian) flow in an incompressible fluid ? such as the motion traced out by a mote of dust suspended in a fluid ? is chaotic in the above sense. This led to a mathematical proof of Batchelor?s law, a quantitative prediction of the formation of small-scale structures in the concentration profile of a solute, such as the billowing patterns formed by drops of milk poured into a cup of coffee.  This project seeks to build off these successes by applying smooth ergodic theory to more complicated dynamical systems, e.g., the evolution of an incompressible velocity field by the Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of noise (the so-called Eulerian dynamics of a fluid). A long-term goal along these lines is a detailed, mathematically rigorous investigation into the transition from laminar and ordered behavior to chaotic and unpredictable dynamics seen in many fluid systems as Reynolds? number is increased.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For high-dimensional data, an affinity graph can be constructed from the data cloud and the graph geometry will recover the implicit low-dimensional structure of the data.

The overarching goal of this project is to develop a theoretical and computational framework for graph-based data analysis that overcomes the curse of dimensionality of high dimensional data by leveraging the underlying low-dimensional geometric structure in the data. The mathematical results can be applied to data visualization and dimension reduction, generative models, general unsupervised learning, and a wide range of real applications, ranging from single-cell sequencing to sensor networks. The project will provide research opportunities and projects that are suitable for graduate and undergraduate students, and results of the project will produce pedagogical materials to be incorporated into data science courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop theoretical and computational tools for efficient and accurate graph-based analysis of high-dimensional data that captures the intrinsically low-dimensional, non-linear structures in the data. The research work consists of four integrated topics: (1) learning of graph diffusion with a theoretical guarantee, (2) robust graph affinity for graph-based data analysis, (3) graph-based learning of intrinsic optimal transport in high dimension, and (4) generative model of graph data by gradient flow. Using tools from applied harmonic analysis and high dimensional probability, the project will address several open questions in the field. On the theoretical side, the project will model the implicit low-dimensional structure as data lying on or near hidden manifolds embedded in the high-dimensional space and analyze the convergence of the graph operators in the limit of large samples. On the practical side, the project will develop algorithms with sampling and computational complexities only depending on the intrinsic data dimensionality. The mathematical findings will provide computational tools to analyze data in real world applications, including biomedical and network data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
