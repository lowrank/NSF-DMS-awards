While the study of spline functions is a well established subject of investigation, which has become an interdisciplinary research area during the past three or four decades, the subject of wavelets was born only about twenty years ago. However,  the only known  compactly supported functions with analytical formulation that generate a multiresolution approximation are the cardinal B-splines. Furthermore, the B-spline refinement symbols play the central role in the construction of Daubechies' wavelets, by assuring the convergence of certain infinite products that constitute the Fourier transform of the Daubechies scaling functions and the order of smoothness of these functions, as building blocks of the MRA's. This close relationship between splines and wavelets is the root of the need for the interaction between these two interdisciplinary areas of mathematical research. <br/> <br/>This conference on the interaction between wavelets and splines will bring together the leading experts of these two fields to exchange ideas, assess the state-of-the-art, and define the trends of future research problems that benefit both interdisciplinary areas. What is more important is that such a conference will be greatly beneficial to the young reserchers and the under-previleged groups, who would have very limited opportunities, if any at all, to interact with the leading experts of both subjects under the same roof. This proposed concerence will take place in the University of Georgia from 16-19, 2005."

Over the years, practical evidences have been<br/>given that the homotopy method is efficient, reliable and much powerful in<br/>solving polynomial systems. Recently, modeling the sparse structure of a<br/>polynomial system by its Newton polytopes leads to a major computational<br/>breakthrough called the polyhedral homotopy method. Based on it, a source<br/>code HOM4PS, produced by the PI and his students, leads all the other<br/>existing codes for solving polynomial systems in efficiency and storage<br/>requirement by a great margin. Nonetheless, there are numerous models of<br/>large polynomial systems in application still do not have a satisfactory<br/>line of attack. And it has become apparent that the numerical techniques for<br/>following homotopy paths are far from thoroughly developed for large<br/>systems. The essence of the project is the advance development in all<br/>aspects of the solver HOM4PS based on the conduct of further research to<br/>greatly enlarge the scope of its applications, especially applications to<br/>large systems.<br/><br/>The problem of solving polynomial systems arises very frequently in various<br/>fields of science and engineering, such as formula construction, geometric<br/>intersection, inverse kinematics, robotics, power flow problems with<br/>PQ-specified bases, vision and the computation of equilibrium states of<br/>chemical reaction equations, etc. This topic has been an important research<br/>subjectin Europe. In the last decade, a considerable research effort<br/>involving seven countries and twenty universities had been directed to this<br/>problem in two consecutive major projects, PoSSo and FRISCO, supported by<br/>European Commission. As mentioned above, the code HOM4PS developed by the PI<br/>for this problem is far more advanced and the ultimate goal of the current<br/>project is a more complete high-quality block-box software which will<br/>incorporate the best state of the art to provide the general scientific<br/>community a reliable source for solving polynomial systems on a wide variety<br/>of advanced architectures.<br/>"

The weak flux regime identified from the scaling suggests a reduction of the coupled degenerate parabolic system of conservation laws for heat and mass transport with phase change to a sharp interface model, with a linear problem on either side of a slowly moving free interface. A rigorous analysis of this problem, based upon the renormalization group, will yield analytical expressions for vapor and liquid fluxes in terms of prescribed boundary conditions and material parameters. Based upon this reduction, a suite of fast, robust numerical schemes in 1+2 and 1+3D will be developed to investigate control strategies for water management. We estimate a speed up in computational time of 3-4 orders of magnitude over resolution of the full problem. A key application is the development of drying purge cycles, these minimize damage from ice formation after shut-down<br/>by dehydrating the gas di_usion layer and flow fields, while maintaining humidification levels in the membrane. Numerical simulation of drying purges requires fast and accurate capturing of the multiphase fronts, a feature unavailable in existing codes. In addition, a simplified model of the coupled parabolic-elliptic problem for water management in the ionomer membrane will be developed and analyzed. Recent experimental work has shown multiple steady states, hysteresis, and long-time oscillations in membrane hydration levels. At low inlet humidity levels associated with autohumidification the membrane hydration couples strongly to the electric potential through the membrane conductivity, leading to ""dry-cell"" bifurcations and slow moving fronts. Autohumidification criteria which avoid the dry-cell bifurcation will be developed, the inverse problem detecting the dry-cell bifurcation from external voltage measurements will be investigated. A model of the cathode catalyst layer including oxygen and hydronium transport, the overpotential, the electric potential, and build-up of liquid water layers will be developed. The connection between averaged reaction rates and catalyst layer micro-structure will be rigorously established through homogenization theory by solving key cell-problems which elucidate the role of triple junction points and catalyst layer geometry on over-all performance. A connection between micro-structure geometry and the experimental technique of AC impedance spectroscopy will be pursued.<br/><br/>Proton electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells are unique energy conversion devices with a broad range of applications. Powered by hydrogen gas or directly from methanol, they hold promise to revolutionize the automotive industry while at the same time yielding e_cient power generation for cell phones, laptop computers, camcorders, digital cameras, PDAs, and other applications in the 10-100 Watt range. However, optimization is required to achieve targets of cost reduction, unit power density, operational lifetime, and to improve performance for autohumidification regimes. Water management is key not only to e_cient cell operation but also to prolonging cell operational lifetime. The development of the proposed models and high-performance computational tools for water management in PEM fuel cells represent a significant breakthrough in the computational resolution of the delicate free-surface motion required to<br/>understand water management. These novel computational tools will improve resolution while reducing computation time from from weeks to minutes. This dramatic enhancement of computational performance will have substantial impact on the development of new materials and manufacturing processes for the fuel cell industry, including the PI's industrial partners, Ballard Power Systems andW.L. Gore. Moreover, the development of lightweight, durable, low thermal and acoustic signature power sources has been identified by the Intelligence Community as an important ingredient of homeland security.<br/>"

The problems involve: existence of singular solutions to parabolic systems; existence of minimizers with singularities for problems in the calculus of variations; regularity, fine properties, and the asymptotic behavior of singular minimizers; and, the determination of whether known singular solutions to a quasilinear elliptic system are indeed minimizers of the corresponding problem in the calculus of variations.  The motivation for these problems lies in the mechanics of solids.  Mathematical models for elastomers, glass, glassy polymers, thin films, and ductile metals yield singular deformations that are used to predict the failure of such materials under the application of external forces.  The failures of interest are those due to the formation and growth of microscopic holes as well as the subsequent coalescence of such holes to form cracks in a material.  When external forces are applied to an elastomer these holes become visible, grow in size, and then combine to break the material.  Particular problems of interest are: the initiation and dynamic growth of a solitary hole; the manner in which holes combine to form cracks; the optimal location for hole formation; and, the manner in which a change in temperature can cause the formation of such holes.<br/><br/>The research area of this grant is the mathematical analysis of equations that arise in Materials Science.  The focus of the investigation is certain significant material failures in solids.  The goal is the prediction of the formation and growth of voids and holes in materials that are crucial to the automotive and defense industries.  If one wants to understand the reasons that materials fail then one must have recourse to mathematical models of the material.  Experiments on certain rubbery polymers, called elastomers, have shown that when one pulls on an elastomer small holes appear in the material.  These holes then grow in size and combine to form cracks.  A similar phenomenon has been observed in optical fibers.  Catastrophic failure, due to a series of holes that cascade down the core of the fiber, can occur when excessive power is applied.  These holes seriously degrade the ability of the fiber to transmit information.  In this grant, the principal investigator will uncover the mechanisms that cause the creation and growth of holes in polymers and glasses by examining systems of partial differential equations from the theory of elasticity and viscoelasticity.<br/><br/>"

The work will entail relaxation and lower-semicontinuity results, development of higher order theories, multiple scale homogenization of length and time scales, and dimension reduction problems. The questions to be studied by the investigator and her collaborators include: - in micromagnetics, the derivation of a model for large bodies from the small bodies model which exhibits competition between the anisotropic energy and the exchange energy terms, optimal design and multiscale homogenization of poly-magnetic, different grains materials; - in thin films, the identification of the asymptotic energy as the thickness of the sample vanishes as depending on the macroscopic deformation and on the bending moment, and the characterization of Young measures generated by scaled thin film gradients. Instabilities in the heteroepitaxial growth of thin films over substrates (wet and dry wetting), and in particular the formation of islands with zero contact angle, will be studied; - the microphase separation of copolymer melts and the identification via Gamma-convergence techniques of the interfacial energy between pairs of adjacent monomers; - the asymptotic behavior of optimal urban networks as the length of the network goes to infinity, within the Monge-Kantorovich setting; - the stability of foams under the influence of surfactants, and the role of surfactants in the nucleation of Plateau borders.<br/> <br/>The research program outlined above is strongly motivated by the need to develop innovative applied mathematics capable to respond to challenges in high-end technology. Novel man-made materials often exhibit underlying models at the forefront of traditional mathematical theories.  These include shape memory alloys, ferroelectric, electromagnetic and magnetostrictive materials, composites, liquid crystals, foams used in oil recovery, detergents and lightweight structural materials, and thin films. A large range of length and time scales is usually present, and multiscale aspects yield applications from bulk materials to nanostructures. In order to understand and be able to predict the behavior of such materials, and to ultimately put this knowledge to use in industry and technology, it is necessary to bridge this multitude of scales by appropriate schemes of articulated theoretical, numerical, and experimental approaches.

The mesoscale structure of polycrystalline materials, which includes the stereology and orientations of the crystallites, strongly affect their macroscopic mechanical properties (e.g., the formability of sheet metals). A polycrystalline material may also be prestressed. For instance, through surface-enhancement treatments a thin subsurface layer of compressive residual stress is artificially imparted on critical components of aircraft engines to improve their high-cycle fatigue behavior and material damage tolerance. The effects of mesoscale structure on various macroscopic properties of polycrystalline solids are often manifested through some coarsely defined microstructural variables. Identifying such microstructural variables and delineating their effects on mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials are prerequisites for material design and nondestructive characterization. The objectives of this project are threefold: (1) By implementing homogenization only over horizontal planes and letting stress and texture be essentially bounded functions of depth, derive mathematical formulae for the dispersion of Rayleigh waves propagating in various directions along the surface of a textured polycrystalline half-space which carries an inhomogeneous subsurface layer of residual stress. (2) Derive explicit formulae of plastic potentials of sheet metals that include the orientation distribution function (which defines crystallographic texture or the volume fraction of crystallites in each orientation) and the second-order fabric tensor (which gives a rough description of grain size and shape) as independent variables. (3) Develop a mathematical theory for determination of grain shape from measurements of anisotropy in ultrasonic attenuation.<br/><br/>Manufacturers of aircraft engines are very interested in incorporating the beneficial effects of surface-enhancement treatments into life predictions of critical engine components. This can be accomplished only through development of nondestructive measurement methods capable of verifying and quantifying residual stress levels. Part 1 of this project provides the theoretical basis of a possible ultrasound method for nondestructive inspection of the subsurface residual stress layer induced by low plasticity burnishing, an emerging surface-enhancement technique. Parts 2 and 3 are motivated by some technical problems in quality improvement and on-line quality control of continuous cast aluminum alloy sheets, which, as compared with their counterparts made from conventional direct chill cast ingots, provide energy savings of over 25% and economic savings of over 14% but often have inferior formability. Part 2 is devoted to mathematical work that supplements a joint research project between the PI and his colleagues at Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Kentucky; Commonwealth Aluminum Concast, Inc. (CACI) is the industrial partner of the joint project. Part 3 has its ultimate goal to develop an ultrasound technique for on-line monitoring of grain shape in sheet metals.<br/>"

It will also develop black-box implementations for public distributions. In a previous work of PI, a method of this type has been developed for computing some extreme (smallest or largest) eigenvalue of the symmetric problems, which has also been implemented in a library-quality software called EIGIFP. The investigator proposes to develop a generalization of the existing method for computing interior eigenvalues for symmetric and nonsymmetric matrix problems. The resulting algorithms not only inherit desirable characteristics of the existing Krylov subspace methods, but also allow convergence acceleration through the use of a preconditioner (or approximate inverse) rather than the inverse of a shifted matrix.<br/><br/>Computations of interior eigenvalues for large matrices arise in many important applications such as electromagnetic field simulations in cavities for particle accelerator models and the Anderson model of localization in quantum mechanics. In spite of tremendous progresses made in developing iterative methods and software packages for large-scale eigenvalue problems, these applications pose a significant challenge. The proposed work shall advance the theory, algorithms and software toolboxes for the computation of interior eigenvalues.

The goal is to establish a comprehensive geometric singular perturbation theory for such systems.  Singularly perturbed problems typically involve multiple-scale features that result in non-uniform behavior. The presence of turning points causes a loss of stability and creates complications in the dynamical structure.  The investigator will use a dynamical-systems approach to systematically investigate turning-point behavior.

This project focuses on the study of problems arising from many areas of science and engineering--such as fluid dynamics, population dynamics, neural networks, and biochemical processes--and involving multiple time and space scales.  The theoretical study will identify critical parameters responsible for the complicated structure of such systems and examine mathematical forms of interactions in the processes.  As an important component of this proposal, two specific fields of applications will be examined:   (1) relaxation oscillations in biological systems such as predator-prey models and epidemic disease models, and (2) engineered biochemical process of wastewater treatment.  These systems involve vastly different scales, both in space and in time, and demonstrate complicated behaviors.  This project, if successful, will significantly improve our understanding of physical phenomena with multiple scales and provide insight for better engineering designs for control purposes.  The proposed activity will also greatly enhance education and training programs in this important area for students and non-experts because of the intuitive formulation of the approach as well as the results.    <br/><br/><br/>"

The research proceeds at multiple levels of abstraction.

The leading principle of symbolic dynamics is the construction of symbol sequences that encode segments of trajectories. As nearby trajectories of a chaotic system diverge rapidly, even long segments of trajectories will have short symbolic codes. Furthermore, these symbolic codes explicitly indicate various recursive relationships between families of trajectories.  In earlier work, the investigator used symbolic dynamics to obtain explicit plots of the fractal structure of the well-known Lorenz attractor, which was inferred by Lorenz in 1963 but was not exhibited explicitly prior to the investigator's work.  The investigator develops mathematics and computational algorithms to apply the symbolic dynamics method to low dimensional Hamiltonian systems. A particular focus of this project is on physically interesting instances of the three-body problem. In particular, this project studies resonance transitions in the three-body problem with a view towards the motion of celestial bodies and spacecrafts. In collaboration with other researchers, the investigator explores new methods that apply to dissipative partial differential equations with low dimensional attractors. The investigator uses results from this project and related research to transmit the excitement of research to an interdisciplinary audience of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Climactic changes, weather prediction, the motion of planets and other celestial bodies, spacecraft trajectories, and the flow of hydrogen through the channels of a fuel cell, to consider but a few examples, present quite different scientific challenges. Yet all these diverse phenomena are described by the same type of mathematical objects called nonlinear differential equations. The use of mathematics leads to concepts of quite great generality that can illuminate very diverse phenomena. An example is the concept of resonance, which means that the ratio of the period of motion of one part of the system to that of another part is a simple fraction such as 1/2, 2/1, or 1/1.  When two parts of a system are in resonance, the two parts interact much more strongly than otherwise leading to unexpected results, one of these unexpected results being the loss of predictability.  The investigator studies resonances related to the motion of planets, satellites, and spacecrafts. The investigator develops methods that make accurate computations possible in spite of the loss of predictability.  The key to these methods is a concept that utilizes the loss of predictability to give compact descriptions of changing and unpredictable phenomena. This concept is called symbolic dynamics.<br/><br/><br/>"

The project brings together ideas from harmonic analysis (Littlewood-Paley theory, multi-resolution analysis, wavelets) and theoretical physics (renormalization, thermodynamic formalism) to analyze the regularity and scaling properties of critical objects.  The importance of critical functions is due to the fact that they serve as models of critical phenomena like transition to turbulence and phase transitions, provide ""barriers"" between regular and chaotic behavior of physical systems, etc.   The critical objects that the investigator and his collaborators plan to study are conjugacies between (critical) circle maps, critical invariant circles of area-preserving maps, and boundaries of Siegel disks. The objectives of the project are the following:  (A) Mathematical techniques for computation of global regularity of functions developed by the PI and collaborators will be applied to a wide variety of problems of scientific interest.  (B) Recent results in theory of wavelets, as well as existing methods, will be implemented to investigate numerically the local regularity of critical functions, and the scaling properties of the associated invariant measures.  (C) Accurate Fourier and wavelet spectra will be computed, and their structure will be analyzed by utilizing techniques from harmonic analysis and renormalization methods.<br/><br/>The proposed research will supply accurate empirical data that will provide physicists with better understanding of critical phenomena and will pose challenging problems for pure mathematicians.

One of the best illustrations of this<br/>concept is the behavior of fluid flows when the viscous drag is small,<br/>and the fluid behaves in a turbulent and chaotic way.<br/>The primary model under study in this project is the nonlinear<br/>Schrodinger equation, which is a fundamental model for the study of<br/>pulses in optical fibers. The small parameter limit for this<br/>model corresponds to the limit of ultra-short pulse propagation, which<br/>is expected to find many applications to high-speed telecommunications.<br/>This limit is known as the semiclassical limit.<br/>This project constitutes an in-depth study of initial-value problems<br/>for several partial differential equations (PDEs) in the semiclassical<br/>limit. Existing formal theories fail because they lead to model problems that are<br/>ill-posed and thus make no prediction at all for reasonable initial<br/>conditions.

L. Mazzucato will address several questions in the<br/>mathematical investigation of fluid flows and elasticity using methods<br/>from Fourier and micro-local  analysis. Micro-local analysis seeks  to<br/>identify points and directions along which a solution  to partial<br/>differential equations  looses regularity, by localizing it in both space and frequency. Modern techniques in  Fourier analysis consist in<br/>decomposing a signal  by testing it against a given set of waves or<br/>wave-forms at different length scales, so that relevant information can be extracted accurately and efficiently. Turbulent flows, for example, <br/>exhibits a complex behavior at both large and small scales. The coupling between different scales is often due to the non-linearity of the underlying equations.  The investigator will concentrate on the following problems. She will study dissipation of enstrophy, the squared vorticity,  for the two-dimensional Euler equations, which model inviscid fluid flow, by considering  transport by irregular vector fields.  Understanding how<br/>enstrophy is dissipated is important for two-dimensional turbulence. <br/>She will analyze  certain  weak solutions   to the Navier-Stokes<br/>equations, which  describe the motion of viscous fluids, with globally<br/>infinite energy  by using  generalized energy inequalities. Allowing for weaker control  at infinity  could in turn lead to refined estimates on the local behavior of solutions. She will investigate existence of mild solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations by semi-group methods in polyhedral domains,  which are domains of particular interest in numerical simulations.  Finally, the investigator will continue studying the inverse problem of unique identification of  elastic properties by dynamic<br/>surface measurements, exploiting the covariance of the elasticity<br/>equations under coordinate changes. The determination of elastic<br/>parameters has significant applications in medical imaging.<br/><br/>The present project stresses the inter-disciplinary nature of the analysis of partial differential equations, which  mathematically model physical phenomena. Theoretical tools developed to discern subtle properties of these equations have  been successfully employed in real-life problems. Micro-local analysis studies how  singularities are propagated by  differential equations. Changes in material properties cause singularities to form in waves and can hence be determined when direct measurement is not possible, as in seismology, oil exploration,  and medical diagnostics.  Fourier analysis examines the content of a signal at a given frequency  or length scale. Understanding crucial aspects of turbulent flows, for<br/>example concentration and dissipation of energy and vorticity, at<br/>different scales has an impact in disciplines ranging from aerodynamics, to meteorology, to human physiology. The need for numerical simulation and design has underlined the role of complex geometries, where a refined mathematical analysis is often necessary for a qualitative understanding. <br/>With this project the investigator  also aims  at strengthening  her<br/>collaborative effort with other female researchers both in the United<br/>States and abroad.<br/>"

The research combines continuum mechanical modeling with molecular dynamics simulations to develop a multiscale procedure for analyzing bending.  The continuum models are formulated within the framework of nonlinear shell theory. A novel feature is the inclusion of van der Waals interactions between the walls of the nanotube. The resulting systems of nonlocal partial differential equations are studied under various assumptions on the precise form of the nonlocal interactions.  The predictions for the global geometry of full-length multi-walled nanotubes are then used to conduct molecular dynamics simulations of the localized high-strain regions. The simulations, in turn, verify the constitutive assumptions of the continuum model and are used to develop and refine the models for the inclusion of the non-local forces at the continuum level. Upon its completion, this research yields accurate material models of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and techniques for using these models to analyze the response of nanotubes to applied bending loads.  The mostsalient features of the proposed work---namely, the formulation and analysis of equations with terms representing the nonlocal interactions between walls in multi-walled nanotubes and the integration of continuum mechanical modeling with molecular dynamics simulations---represent a significant step in the study of the mechanical properties of nanotubes.Soon after the discovery of carbon nanotubes in the early 1990's, researchers realized that these materials, because of their novel structural, chemical, and electrical properties, could be used to engineer light-weight, high-strength composite materials, chemical andbiochemical sensors, micro-electronic devices, etc.  So far the practical uses of carbon nanotubes remain very limited because the efficient technologies for their mechanical processing and underlying models have not yet been fully developed. Although a great deal ofexperimental data has been collected during the past decade, few mathematical models have been suggested that can predict either the mechanical behavior of multi-walled nanotubes or their physical-chemical properties after mechanical manipulation.  In particular, few models exist to describe the process of bending of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The proposed research addresses this shortcoming by developing mathematical models and computationaltechniques for describing the bending of multi-walled nanotubes. These models focus on incorporating the effect of nonlocal interactions between the individual walls of a multi-walled nanotube. A better understanding of the mechanical properties of nanotubes andof how these tubes bend contributes to the development of techniques for producing composite materials and for manufacturing nano-scale devices incorporating carbon nanotubes. In addition to its scientific impact, the proposed program enhances graduate and undergraduatetraining in the disciplines of mathematics, physics, and engineering. The students participating in the program are exposed to interdisciplinary research involving sophisticated atomic through macroscopic mathematical modeling and are trained in working within a multi-disciplinary environment.<br/>"

Combined experimental and theoretical studies of water waves recently yielded a characterization of the chaotic evolution in perturbed NLS equations that is generic, observable, and physically significant.  Preliminary analysis indicates that similar results hold in fiber optics.  In this project, further experimental, numerical, and theoretical analysis will be carried out.  The latter includes extending the geometric interpretation of the Floquet discriminant and the associated Melnikov integrals for solutions in the full phase space and obtaining criteria for the existence of homoclinic structures for symmetry-breaking perturbations of the NLS equation.  The implication of these results in the context of homoclinic chaos and the likelihood of rogue wave formation will be examined.  The research also involves the development of efficient, stable multi-symplectic integrators for equations of interest in the water wave and optics problems.  A comparison of the multi-symplectic, energy, and momentum errors to the overall performance of the integrators (including accurate capture of qualitative features of the system) will be carried out.  Error bounds on the approximate preservation of the local conservation laws will be sought.  <br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on mathematical and computational issues central to water wave dynamics and nonlinear optics.  Rogue wave events can have a devastating effect on offshore structures and ships.  The results of this project will address fundamental properties of rogue wave generation and potentially have impact on the design and analysis of structures such as offshore oil rigs.  Soliton solutions of the NLS equation are used to model light pulses in high-speed optical telecommunication systems.  The research on multi-symplectic integrators will yield fast, efficient codes that can be used in numerical simulation of high data rate communication systems and rogue wave events.<br/>"

The investigators also find efficient algorithms for computing high-quality sparse representations of data over sophisticated, commonly used dictionaries that provably perform as claimed with respect to both efficiency and correctness of output and are particularly well-suited for massive data set applications.  The research proceeds at multiple levels of abstraction.  It considers general factors of a representation class that guarantee or preclude such algorithms, it considers algorithms for specific common representation classes, and it finds algorithms for representation classes adapted to specific common (and diverse) applications, such as solutions of partial differential equations, image processing, and database query optimization.<br/><br/>Over the past ten years there has been a dramatic increase in data gathering mechanisms, as well as an ever-increasing demand for finer data analysis in applications that rely on scientific and geometric modeling.  Each day, literally millions of large data sets are generated in medical imaging, surveillance, and scientific acquisition. In addition, the internet has become a communication medium with vast capacity, generating massive traffic data sets.  The usefulness of these data sets rests on our ability to process them efficiently, whether it be for storage, transmission, visual display, fast on-line graphical query, correlation, or registration against data from other modalities.  The current state of the art in data processing is far from providing the efficient and faithful representations required in emerging applications.  With few exceptions, previous work has not provided algorithms whose efficiency or output quality, though typically validated experimentally, has been analyzed rigorously and thoroughly.  The investigators carry out fundamental mathematical and algorithmic research to significantly increase our capacity to process and manage large data sets.  The research makes significant mathematical progress in providing rigorous algorithmic results that are of great need in this field.  The research also makes significant improvements through highly efficient algorithms in the sizes of data sets that are analyzable and in the types of data processing tasks that can be carried out.

The classical part is concerned with the rigorous analysis of the classical limit of a new dynamical theory of relativistic electromagnetic fields with topological point defects that represent point electrons.  This theory combines the nonlinear Maxwell-Born-Infeld field equations with a novel Hamilton-Jacobi type law of motion for the point defects.  The most important issue here is the special relativistic radiation reaction problem, which can now be investigated without any a priori regularization or renormalization.  The principal investigator will also develop a general relativistic extension of this theory, which promises progress on the problem of motion of so-called naked singularities of space-time and the gravitational field.  The theory has already been partly quantized; the quantum part of the project now is concerned with the completion of the quantization.  In particular, the implementation of the physically important quantum effects of spin and photon are the primary goals.  So far the theory is free of any of the notorious divergence problems that plague the prevailing electromagnetic theory (QED), and it is expected that the final theory will also be entirely well-behaved.  <br/><br/>Electromagnetism is the most widely applicable part of fundamental physical theory.  It touches everything from atomic physics, chemistry, and condensed matter physics to electronics and electrical engineering.  The orthodox theory has certainly been hugely successful, yet it has also been plagued by infinities that have stood in the way of further progress on a number of issues.  The research in this project involves a new formalism which is designed to overcome the problems of the orthodox electromagnetic theory and which has already overcome some of these.  As a result of the new mathematically well-defined formalism under development, better quantitative, rigorous, computational simulation of electromagnetic phenomena may be expected.  The classical version of the theory covers, for instance, the physics of high temperature plasma, with applications to space and laboratory (thermonuclear fusion) phenomena.  A promising application of the new quantum theory is to positronium physics, which in particular may have medical applications in positron emission tomography.  <br/>"

This is the biannual meeting of the community of physicists, mathematicians, and engineers who practice the methods of symmetry.  It was last held in North America in 1988, so it provides an especially good opportunity for U.S. junior researchers in this broad field.  The purpose of the meeting is to review the principal developments that have occurred in recent years, to present the main results leading to current work in the subject in a coherent form that will be accessible to graduate students and young researchers newly entering the domain, and to point out the most promising directions for future research.  In particular, the meeting's special panel on ""Group theory in the XXI Century,"" is meant to provide guidance to junior researchers, and the Proceedings will be published. <br/><br/>Group theory is the mathematics of symmetry.  Modern physical theories make extensive use of group theoretical ideas to represent the symmetries observed in nature.  The periodic table of the elements, atomic spectral analysis, classification of crystal structure, and theories of elementary particles all involve group-theoretic models.  The concept of what is an explicitly solvable classical or quantum mechanical system is best understood in terms of the symmetry of the system.  Engineering areas such as tomography and signal processing, including wavelets, radar, and sonar, are intimately bound up with harmonic analysis, the expansion and analysis of functions on groups.  This conference explores current developments and open problems in this important, multidisciplinary field.  The principal topics for the meeting are: Lie groups, quantum groups, representation theory, and special functions; Supersymmetry, superstrings, and quantum gravity; Integrability, nonlinear systems, and quantum chaos; Discrete systems and signal analysis; Foundations of quantum mechanics; Semigroups, time asymmetry, and resonances; Quantum computing; Linear and nonlinear optics; Nuclear, atomic, and molecular physics; Elementary particle physics; and Condensed matter and statistical physics.<br/>"

Spirn<br/><br/>Title: Asymptotics of conservative PDEs and instability of vortex patches and filaments<br/><br/>ABSTRACT: The proposed research concerns asymptotics of conservative<br/>partial differential equations (PDE) and instability of the incompressible Euler equations in three specific areas. The first project concerns the long time behavior of vortex solutions in the nonlinear wave equation. Although recent progress has led to greater understanding of how concentrations behave in the nonlinear wave equation, very little is known about how such solutions radiate energy after long times; we will rigorously study this question.  Second, we will study the nonlinear wave equation in asymptotically thin domains. Conventional wisdom holds that most PDE's with an asymptotically large aspect ratio will be well approximated simply by dropping the dimension of the PDE and relying only on the planar direction; this work will examine the precise timescales for which this practice is acceptable. The third project involves the nonlinear instability of various PDE's arising from the incompressible Euler equations, in which the governing dynamics reduce to the behavior of an interface -- such as in two-layer models and vortex patches.<br/><br/>Often, physical phenomena are well modeled via nonlinear PDE's. Such<br/>equations are exceedingly difficult to study, both numerically and<br/>theoretically, yet their understanding is crucial to the further progress of many areas of physics and engineering. Two of the projects outlined above offer rigorous methods for simplifying classes of these equations, not only providing insight into the basic behavior of fluids and quantum field theory, but also greatly reducing the scope of numerical simulations. Such reductions in computational costs should aid physicists, computer scientists, and engineers. The third project endeavors to classify the stable structures in fluid dynamics, helping us to gain a better qualitative understanding of the way fluids behave.<br/><br/>"

In the recent past, ideas dependent on the properties of residues over fields of arbitrary characteristic were employed to study the complexity of solving large systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  These results have applications to robotics, systems engineering, and communications.

This project will explore (i) modeling of a nonlinear and thermoelastic shell based on intrinsic geometry, the equations of which appear analogous to those of the full von Karman system of linear elasticity; (ii) analysis of the resultant wellposedness issues of the uncontrolled (free) model, which is specifically of interest in the context of nonlinear models; (iii) control of the model -- both controllability and stabilizibility issues are of paramount importance; and (iv) numerical analysis as a means to verify the modeling.  These goals will be accomplished through the adaptation of mathematical techniques that have been developed for the corresponding `flat' case.

The adaptations are made possible through the use of the intrinsic geometry to implicitly take advantage of the special form of those coefficients and the known relationships among the geometric objects that appear in the equations.<br/><br/>Modeling and control of shell structures is important in many fields, including design of automobiles, aircraft, and submarines, manufacturing of industrial equipment, and medical research.

A lot of fundamental research has been directed in the past decades towards developing mathematical theories that allow one to `bridge the scales', i.e., to understand analytically the mechanisms that relate microscopic and macroscopic structures, to predict the response of these materials to applied forces, and to design algorithmic strategies that allow an efficient simulation of the system. A successful completion of this program would ultimately allow one to `tailor--make smart materials' for key--technological applications. The principal investigator plans to addresses key questions within this general framework with special emphasis on two particular systems with excellent potential for technological applications. The first system is a special class of elastomers that combine the entropic response of polymer networks with the orientational instabilities of liquid crystals. The other systems are lipid bilayer membranes (bio-membranes), which form the vast majority of all membranes in biological systems. The molecules in each of the layers tend to have a nematic order and are uniformly arranged in domains of macroscopic sizes. Key issues concern the influence of the internal structure of the two layers on the macroscopic shape and elasticity of the membranes, the formation of domains within the layer, and their stability. Potential applications include artificial blood cells and mechanisms for drug delivery. From the point of view of the general mathematical framework, this proposal is concerned with the analysis of variational problems that arise in the modeling of these systems and addresses questions of existence and regularity of solutions which are closely related to structural properties of the variational integrals. An improved understanding of the analytical aspects is also at the heart of efficient algorithms for the numerical simulation of the systems mentioned above, and it is expected that a combined analytical and numerical approach will lead to significant progress in the understanding of the complex physical systems.<br/><br/><br/>Many modern materials have striking elastic properties that allow novel technological applications. Frequently these surprising properties are related to internal degrees of freedom and patterns (so-called microstructures) that form in the materials at a scale much smaller than the size of the sample itself (nanoscale). This proposal aims at developing analytical and numerical tools for the prediction and simulation of these effects, with special emphasis on two particular systems, a class of rubber-type materials (with potential applications as artificial muscles or light guiding devices) and bio-membranes (possible applications include drug delivery mechanisms).<br/><br/>"

Often this balance is maintained by global invariants of the flow.  These include spectral invariants, which in turn lead to critical threshold phenomena, or borderline invariant regularity spaces.  A main focal topic of this project is the study of balance laws governed by Eulerian dynamics.  Such models show up in different contexts dictated by different forcing.  Previous research developed a precise framework for studying the critical threshold phenomena for such Eulerian dynamics.  Here we seek extensions to include more realistic models driven by global and non-isotropic forcing.  In particular, this project investigates global regularity for multidimensional Euler-Poisson equations with sub-critical initial data and persistence of minimal regularity for Euler and Navier-Stokes equations with initial configurations in borderline regularity spaces.<br/><br/>This research project pursues the development of mathematical tools for the understanding of fundamental properties of fluid flow and other dynamical processes.

The proposed Isotropic Multiresolution <br/>Analysis (IMRA) enables decompositions of data structures without <br/>orientational preference that parallel the numerical efficiency of one <br/>dimensional MRA-wavelet constructions. A crucial ingredient of this new theory <br/>is an MRA of radial functions based on an innovative concept of radial <br/>translations. Together with a suitable angular resolution, this allows to <br/>replicate all the beneficial characteristics of classical one-dimensional <br/>MRA-wavelets in higher dimensions. Therefore, IMRA-wavelets are expected to <br/>parallel the success of their one-dimensional predecessors in isolating edges <br/>and separating textures. Compared to previous attempts of MRA-construtions <br/>in higher dimensions, IMRAs combine symmetry properties, smoothness, and <br/>compactness of support of scaling functions and wavelets to an unprecedented <br/>degree. The proposed theory is anticipated to have a significant impact on all <br/>areas of digital signal processing in two or more dimensions, especially in <br/>biomedical image processing. <br/><br/>To date, digital image processing systems commonly handle data in a row <br/>and column fashion. Although this pixelized approach is natural for digital <br/>machines, it is much less natural if the objective is to extract information <br/>from natural images or more general multidimensional data structures. In this <br/>proposal, we create a mathematical theory that mimicks features of retinal <br/>processing by mammalian visual systems. Retinal processing is known to detect <br/>edges and textures at different scales of spatial and temporal resolution, <br/>regardless of their orientation and of the topology of their boundary contours. <br/>The proposed theory of Isotropic Multiresolution Analysis (IMRA) offers a way <br/>of digitizing analog signals and of synthesizing analog signals from digital <br/>data in a manner that is more compatible with the ""digitization"" of natural <br/>images performed by our retina. One particular component of IMRAs is the use of <br/>radial translations, inspired by the evolving wave pattern created when a rock <br/>falls in a pond of calm water. To ensure fast numerical processing <br/>capabilities, we use concepts similar to those in the framework of wavelets, <br/>which have proved computationally efficient in the processing of one- <br/>dimensional signals, e.g. audio.

Taking these facts into account, the objectives of this project are: (i) Investigate computational methods for the solution of real Monge-Ampere equations, relying in particular on mixed finite element approximations. (ii) Investigate efficient iterative methods for the solution of the discrete problems derived from (i); on the basis of preliminary investigations one can expect fast Poisson solvers and properly preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithms to play an important role in the solution process.

Surprisingly, and despite the above mentioned importance of these equations, they have motivated very little numerical work, compared to less fundamental models; the complexity of these equations may be the cause of this paradoxical situation. The main objective of this computationally oriented project is the construction of user friendly efficient numerical methods for the solution of the Monge-Ampere equation and related mathematical problems. There will be a systematic effort to derive a modular methodology, relying as much as possible on ""on the shelf"" existing methods. These investigations should be beneficial to both the theoretical and applied sciences; indeed, they should: (i) Create bridges and foster cooperation between the computational/applied mathematics and the ""more theoretical"" mathematics communities. (ii) Involve students (and faculties) in highly interdisciplinary investigations. (iii) Motivate numerical analysts and computational scientists to look at an important interdisciplinary field, which has been clearly under-investigated. (iv)Lead to the teaching of courses broadening the knowledge basis of students and introducing them to a highly multidisciplinary field. (v) Foster international cooperation, since collaborations on these topics, with European scientists in particular, are taking place already. The results of these investigations will be made available via publications, conferences, and dedicated web sites.  <br/>"

The P.I. examines voting systems in multimember electoral districts, with emphasis on the method of cumulative voting, searching for predictive equilibrium conditions and analyzing their potential to enable a minority population to achieve a fair share of a representative body.  The project requires considerable development of the theory of spatial modeling of at-large elections, in addition to application of measures of inequality and of optimization methods to minimize misrepresentation. The P.I.'s theory will describe and analyze voter tendencies, distributions of voters' policy ideals, and candidate behaviors in multimember electoral districts.  In collaboration with political science colleagues, the P.I. will prepare for subsequent work analyzing data from elections and experiments so as to address the implications of the theory on the empirical data and use the empirical results to inform the theoretical models.  Additionally, the P.I. will guide undergraduates on research projects interrelated with his own work, and he will develop a course, Mathematics and Fairness: Applications to Political and Economic Systems, in which students from mathematics, political science, and economics will examine formal theory and models of political phenomena with respect to measures of fairness and inequity.<br/><br/>This project builds on the body of knowledge about the theory of voting and representation.  The P.I.'s work will help to quantify fairness of election methods to populations and to groups and individuals therein.  Particular attention is devoted to the method of cumulative voting, comparing its potential against other election methods to make fair representation possible, especially to minority populations, who are vulnerable to denial of representation under certain voting methods.  The research will provide some mathematical basis for public discourse about the relative fairness of multimember district election methods. This mathematical basis also can serve policy makers and judicial officials who consider election methodology in resolving disputes, such as alleged violations of the Voting Rights Act.

Milton<br/>Institution: University of Utah<br/>Title:  The Response of Composites and Quasiconvexity<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This work will improve our understanding of creep in composite materials, through establishing bounds on the total creep and identifying microstructures that exhibit the maximum or minimum possible creep. It will also identify microstructures which are best for guiding stress in linear elasticity.  These composites should be useful for distributing or concentrating the force in a structure. Additionally, microstructures will be identified with an anomalous Hall coefficient, which could potentially be useful in reducing stray electric fields in circuit design when there is a magnetic field present. In a second part of the work three fundamental problems will be studied: characterizing the surfaces in tensor space associated with sets of effective tensors of hierarchical laminate geometries; exploring the connection between rank-one convexity and quasiconvexity; and developing new tools for bounding the effective moduli of composites and for bounding the quasiconvexification of a function. These problems are important for making progress on the question of what responses of composites are or are not possible.  Their solution could, in a wide variety of cases, make numerically tractable the search for the possible macroscopic responses of composites.<br/><br/>A better understanding of the macroscopic response of materials is of central technological importance. This importance stretches across the board, from understanding the macroscopic response of engineered materials (of critical importance to the defence, automative, and  aerospace industries), to understanding the macroscopic response of polycrystalline and porous rocks (relevant to earthquake prediction and to the oil industry), to understanding the macroscopic response of sea ice (important to climate modelling), to understanding the macroscopic response of biological materials (such as tissues, bones, shells and tendons). In the past many useful composites were obtained by trial and error, or by mimicking composites found in nature, or by using intuition. In this century we will have greater flexibility to produce designer composites tailor made to meet specific needs. Improving our understanding of the response of composites will facilitate the construction of these designer composites.<br/><br/><br/>"

It has many applications, from ocean waves to magnetohydrodynamics and optics. But it is not only of interest because of applications. It provides a nontrivial tool for examining the long time solution behavior of the underlying Hamiltonian partial di_erential equations. It is extraordinarily rich in that, save for very rare circumstances, the theory is not valid for all scales. We have recently developed an understanding for how to predict the breakdown ranges in which<br/>randomly occurring, robust and fully nonlinear coherent structures occur. These lead to anomalous and intermittent behaviors whose signatures can be seen dramatically in high order moments and sometimes even in low order ones. It also leads to large deviations from Gaussian statistics. Because in several cases it is possible to identify and understand the reasons for the emergence of the randomly occurring structures, wave turbulence provides a nontrivial paradigm for investigating the guiding principles governing turbulent and nonequilibrium systems in general.<br/><br/>Wave turbulence has a wealth of applications and is also a most useful paradigm for the study of nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, it is an excellent training tool for students and young scientists because many solutions and bulk properties are calculable, thus helping those new to the field to gain a concrete understanding of central issues. The two PI's have been linked with formidable stables of young researchers throughout their professional lives and have produced more than 20 Ph.D's who are actively contributing to the field of nonlinear science. Further, we include in this proposal several concrete actions we plan to take in order to facilitate the training of new researchers, to collaborate with teams throughout the world and to disseminate new results.<br/> <br/>"

For the projects being studied in this proposal the PI is principally interested in patterns that arise when a continuous translational symmetry is reduced, at a critical threshold, to a discrete periodic symmetry resulting in what is often referred to as a ""striped"" pattern. Such patterns are for instance generic in Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC) which is a key mechanism in the formation of many weather  patterns. In RBC the striped pattern corresponds to the formation, at a critical<br/>temperature, of periodic ""convection rolls""  of a uniform characteristic width. A major goal of this research is to study not just the patterns that form at a critical threshold but to characterize the types of defects that arise in these patterns when one is far from threshold. The patterns studied here are stationary and, consistent with that, one  may investigate the formation of defects through the minimization of a free energy which depends on a control parameter with a critical value that corresponds to the critical threshold of the physical system. The free energy studied here is known as the ""regularized Cross-Newell energy"" and is expressed<br/>in terms of a phase that locally defines the striped pattern away from defects. From the mathematical point of view the problem is to study the limiting behavior of minimizers to a variational problem as a critical parameter is approached. The determination of such limits is a delicate matter but  the PI is developing geometric and analytical tools that should make this determination tractable.<br/><br/>A second part of this proposal also involves the asymptotic study of variational problems. The general context of these problems is the study of the statistics of eigenvalues of N x N Hermitean matrices as N becomes large. These statistics are taken with respect to a class of probabilistic expectations which are invariant under the symmetries that preserve the eigenvalues. This general area<br/>of study is generally referred to as random matrix theory<br/>which has become prominent because of the insights it provides into a wide range of fields including graph theory, number theory and quantum field theory. Indeed the PIand his collaborators recently extablished the existence of a large N expansion for the random matrix partition function which has played a central role over the last twenty years in discussions within the physics community concerning quantum gravity. The key to this analysis is the study of a variational problem that characterizes the asymptotic expected  density of eigenvalues and the asymptotics of an associated Riemann-Hilbert problem. The current proposal will study the fine sturcture of this expansion<br/>which can provide detailed information about counting functions which enumerate graphs on topologically non-trivial surfaces. These counting functions will be determined as solutions to partial differential equations which are continuum limits of Hamiltonian (in fact completely integrable) sytems of ordinary differential equations which describe how the eigenvalue density changes  as the probabilistic matrix expectations are varied. The PI will also explore<br/>the behavior of the random matrix partition function as a critical threshold in the variation of these expectations is approached. Physicists have conjectured that this phase transition can be used to determine a viable candidate for calculating field theoretic expectations in two-dimensional quantum gravity. <br/>  <br/><br/>Both parts of this proposal have potential relevance for interesting<br/>applications. The work on pattern formation will make definite predictions on defect formation that can be tested in the laboratory. Indeed some of the predictions emerging from this work are currently being tested by experimentalists. The PI envisions applications to the stability analysis  of patterns and some initial studies of the dynamics of wave patterns. In the future one may expect this work to have relevance for modelling defect structure in animal coat patterns (including fingerprints) and the evolution of plant<br/>patterns.<br/><br/>The methods and ideas of random matrix theory are having a broad impact; in number theory, combinatorics, random graph theory (or networks), growth processes and multivariate statistics, to name just a few areas of application. It is important that the underlying methods and results of random matrix theory be established with the highest standards ofrigor so that they can be widely<br/>used in these diverse applications. That is an overarching and fundamental goal of this part of the research proposal. <br/><br/>"

A centerpiece of the project is a new method for constructing singular Euler solutions, starting from a semi-analytic approach using complex space-time and singularities in the complex plane.

Due to its implications in turbulence theory, the question of Euler singularities has received intense attention over the last 20 years.  Successful construction of Euler singularities would solve a major problem of mathematics and would establish a new method for addressing singularity formation.  A fluid dynamic understanding of these singularities could lead to important insights on the structure of turbulence, one of the major open problems of classical physics.

The proposed efforts in these regards will seek to produce an improved theoretical understanding as well significantly more general rigorous solvers than previously available for problems involving three-dimensional fields of misfits in anisotropic and nonlinear materials.  Such solvers should allow significant improvements in our capability to investigate problems such as polycrystalline plasticity and magneto-rheology of elastomers.  Problems of direct and inverse scattering of electromagnetic and acoustic waves by inhomogeneous media will also be investigated as part of this research effort.  The work proposed here will build upon recent contributions by the investigator and his colleagues on fast high-order integral-equation solvers for penetrable and surface scattering problems.  These solvers can deal with complex scattering problems with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency; the proposed work will deal with special emphasis on recently developed O(1) algorithms - which can resolve problems of arbitrarily high frequency (which would usually require increasingly large discretization densities as frequencies increase) with a prescribed accuracy and within a fixed computational time-independent of frequency.<br/><br/>The proposed work impacts upon a variety of areas of societal interest, including the medical field (optical coherence tomography), automotive (magneto-rheological elastomers), materials design (actuators, strength of materials), military (radars); communications (aircraft- and spacecraft-mounted antennas, wireless communications); critical dimension metrology (optical monitoring of silicon wafers); modeling of electromagnetic induction in next-generation processors; etc.  As previous work by this PI, on the other hand, the present effort will result in training of students at both, graduate and undergraduate levels, as well as postdoctoral associates. In particular, over the last five years, fifteen different research efforts have been directed by this PI, each one for a period of ten summer weeks and each one centered around one undergraduate student. The undergraduate students included seven American citizens, three women, two black males, two Hispanic, and two students from a local community college.  These activities have been highly rewarding for all involved, including the graduate students and postdocs that collaborated with the undergraduate students and this PI, as well as some of the industrial and lab researchers who proposed specific engineering applications. As a result of this work, some of the participating graduate students and postdocs discovered a talent for teaching and advising in mathematics.  Most of the participating undergraduate students went on to graduate schools or four-year colleges, as appropriate, and have sought to pursue work on mathematically related fields. The efforts to integrate undergraduate students in research projects will continue as part of the proposed work.<br/><br/>The award is funded jointly by the Applied Mathematics and Computational Mathematics programs of the Division of Mathematical Sciences.<br/><br/><br/>"

The first project deals with the numerical analysis of optimal packing problems for curves with thickness.  The objective is to exploit the concept of global curvature to develop numerical methods for optimizing the energy of a curve in three-dimensional space (or a framed curved if twist is important) subject to an excluded-volume constraint in which the curve is the centerline of a flexible, solid tube of prescribed radius.  The second project deals with the relation between shape and speed in the sedimentation dynamics of thin, rigid (or nearly rigid) filaments.  The objective is to characterize how features of geometry (such as length, curvature, tubular neighborhood size) and topology (knot type) affect the possible speeds at which a filament can sediment in a viscous (Stokes) fluid.<br/><br/>An understanding of how material filaments may be optimally packed in confined geometries and how they may supercoil or wrap around themselves is of great interest in the study of macromolecules such as DNA and other systems in chemistry and biology.  While recent modeling advances have led to concise mathematical formulations of such problems, numerical techniques for studying them have received relatively little attention.  The first research project pursued by the investigator is focused on the development of provably convergent numerical methods for studying these and other related packing problems.  Sedimentation and gel electrophoresis are common laboratory techniques for analyzing DNA and other polymers.  These methods exploit the observation that small, relatively stiff polymer fragments of different shape typically travel at different speeds when forced through a viscous fluid or through a gel.  However, the general relation between shape and speed is at present not well understood.  The second research project pursued by the investigator is focused on the characterization of the shape-speed relation for sedimentation.  Results from this research may lead to improved laboratory techniques, and may enable more detailed structural information about polymers to be deduced from sedimentation data.<br/><br/>"

The typical so-called multi-stage stochastic program <br/>tends to be modeled as an extension of a two-stage problem (often referred <br/>to as a stochastic program with recourse).  This misses some important <br/>features of a problem with many time stages, including a description of the <br/>dynamics inherent to the problem, the structure of information, and the <br/>degree to which one may respond to that information at a given time stage.  <br/>A typical problem from mathematical finance will be framed in a many-<br/>stage stochastic programming setting, allowing for a description of the <br/>dynamics.  The classical pricing results of mathematical finance and <br/>extensions to more complicated problems will be obtained using the new <br/>model.  This model will be generalized to be applicable to a much broader <br/>range of many-stage stochastic optimization problems, highlighting <br/>duality results and their significance.  In conjunction with this will be an <br/>investigation into problems that could be modeled in a continuous time <br/>framework, and problems with infinitely many time stages.  New <br/>stochastic programming models, and approximation techniques using the <br/>tools of variational analysis, will be developed for these respective <br/>problems. Finally, an investigation into the structure of many-stage <br/>problems that include a description of system dynamics will be <br/>undertaken, leading ultimately to the development and implementation of <br/>algorithms for solving them.<br/><br/>Decision making under uncertainty and the theory and techniques of <br/>mathematical programming merged in the 1950's to create the field now <br/>known as stochastic programming.  A stochastic program is a <br/>mathematical program (e.g. a linear program) that includes in its <br/>formulation a probability distribution to describe uncertain parameters.  <br/>Research consists largely of understanding problem structure, deriving <br/>duality results and optimality conditions, developing approximation <br/>techniques, and exploiting the structure and theory in the development of <br/>solution schemes.  The field's development began with a two-stage <br/>recourse model, where the cost of a decision made now (e.g. production) <br/>is affected by an uncertain outcome in the future (e.g. demand), and the <br/>possibility of taking recourse action once the future is revealed (e.g. <br/>overtime).  A typical problem is to determine the present decision that <br/>minimizes expected cost.  While much knowledge has been gained from <br/>the investigation of two-stage models, a limited view of many-stage <br/>stochastic programming has resulted in which multistage problems are <br/>considered as simple extensions of the two-stage case.  This fails to <br/>address the inherently dynamic nature of problems with many time stages. <br/>Additionally, two-stage applications tend to come largely from areas such <br/>as production and manufacturing, whereas the bulk of problems with <br/>many time stages arise from financial, economic, and environmental <br/>planning applications and other problems where dynamics are driving a <br/>system. Thus, much of the new many-stage theory should be geared <br/>toward these sorts of applications.  The proposed research will explore the <br/>additional dynamic structures, theory (duality, approximation), and <br/>questions regarding implementation, of stochastic optimization problems <br/>involving many (possibly even infinitely many, or a continuum of) stages.  <br/>This will be motivated primarily by financial applications.<br/>"

The work is concerned with the propagation of multi-dimensional flame fronts with emphasis on their interaction with the underlying flow.  One set of problems address the propagation of flames in channels and cracks, which is of considerable interest in a number of applications where the penetration of the flame may be favorable, as in miniaturized combustion devices, or detrimental, as in crevice volumes of an internal combustion engine.  The second set of problems is concerned with edge-flames, which are of fundamental importance to the phenomena of flame stabilization and liftoff occurring in many applications such as household burners and furnaces.  Edge-flames play an important role in the evolution of holes created on the flame interface because of high strain or excessive heat loss, and thus are fundamental to the dynamics of turbulent diffusion flames.  Understanding of these complex phenomena will be achieved by constructing models that contain the necessary physical ingredients of the problem at hand, constructing solutions to the mathematical models by means of asymptotic techniques and numerical methods, and comparing the results with experimental observations. <br/> <br/>Combustion provides the majority of the energy that we consume today. It is important to ensure that combustion processes are utilized in the most efficient way and in such a way to minimize their adverse effect on the environment.  This research will provide fundamental understanding of the dynamics of flame fronts, the interaction of a flame with the underlying flow field, inflammability limits, and intrinsic instabilities associated with the burning process.  This knowledge will have an effect on future industrial combustion design and emerging micropropulsion technologies, resulting in improved energy utility and reduction of pollutants.

Our goals cover physical channel modeling, experimental measurements, algorithm design and simulation of wireless communication systems in large delay spread environments.  Physical modeling will help understand large delay spread channels in wireless environments. Experimental measurements will use a new, specially designed by this research group, wireless time reversal sounder to verify theoretical time reversal predictions. Mathematical algorithm design will deal with equalization complexity, working with imperfect channel estimates, pre-coding, etc., that arise in such problems. Systems simulations will help understand overall performance of time reversal communications in different deployment scenarios.<br/><br/>In time reversal, signals transmitted with a time reversed filter back propagate and focus tightly in space-time near the intended receiver. The phenomena rely on large delay spread (rich multipath) channels. The space-time focusing is even more tight and robust when the propagation medium is randomly inhomogeneous. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have firmly established this remarkable effect and have motivated applications to detection, imaging and communications.  We believe that these space-time focusing properties of time reversal can lead to a new class of wireless communications systems with significant advantages over current approaches. This technique converts a problem in wireless posed by multipath (which induces fading) into an opportunity for improved performance.

It took approximately 250  years from Euler's formulation of the partial differential equations governing the flow of compressible fluids to the proof that such flows  with arbitrarily prescribed initial states actually exist. This scientific breakthrough opened a new field in analysis and computation of the problem of multiphase fluid flow. The demonstration that the solutions can exist in weak form which include discontinuous structures poses a great challenge to mathematicians in designing numerical algorithms for the computation of the multiphase flow. The scientific progress in this field has always been an interplay between analysis and computation, by hard work and by mere luck. This conference brings scientists who have made important contribution to the field and those who are striving to find new solutions in more complicated systems and higher dimensions. The speakers will address the proof of existence and uniqueness of  the partial differential equations, numerical algorithms to solve such equations and computational examples emerged from scientific and  engineering problems which are governed by such partial differential equations. <br/><br/>The conference is to foster communication among theoreticians, numerical analysts and computational scientists from universities and national laboratories and between leaders and students in these fields.

The mathematical formulation of scientific problems often involves singular integrals, such as a harmonic potential function due to a layer of sources on a curve or surface.  For points near the source, evaluation is not routine because of large derivatives.  The approach of this work, developed in earlier NSF-funded research, is to regularize the integral in a systematic way, evaluate at grid points as for a standard integral, and then add local correction terms.  The corrections are derived analytically.  For surfaces, overlapping grids are used.  The work will be in several parts: A class of static problems for 3D potentials defined through surface integrals will be treated, extending earlier work.  In order to allow for boundaries that are not smooth, a method will be derived for computing integrals on curves with corners in 2D.  Application to the computation of moving boundaries in viscous, incompressible 2D fluid flow will be tested as a possible improvement in the immersed boundary method or immersed interface method.  Computations will be done for a moving boundary or interface between two different fluids in 3D without viscosity; water waves are one important case, and in other cases regularization will be used to control physical instabilities.<br/><br/>Scientific processes often involve moving boundaries, such as a drop of one fluid moving through another, or the motion of an elastic membrane in living tissue.  Numerical modeling of such phenomena involves special difficulties, and several approaches are in use.  Important quantities, such as a jump in pressure, can often be written as singular integrals like the ones described.  The techniques developed in this work could be used to incorporate integral calculations into numerical methods for viscous fluid flow with moving boundaries.  If this leads to improvement in these methods, they could be more widely useful for predictions of two-fluid systems or biological processes with moving membranes.  The application to flow without viscosity could improve understanding of fully nonlinear water waves and the onset of mixing in an unstable fluid layer.<br/>"

The goal of this project is to furnish a mathematical analysis of some important and still not completely understood aspects of this fascinating subject.  Specifically, the project investigates the motion of homogeneous, symmetric particles sedimenting in Newtonian and viscoelastic liquids.  The work aims to furnish a quantitative and rigorous explanation of the so-called ""tilt-angle phenomenon"" observed in certain viscoelastic liquids, as well as of the oscillatory behavior shown by the particle at moderately large Reynolds number.  The project also investigates the well-posedness of the boundary and initial-boundary value problems associated with the relevant equations of motion.  Navier-Stokes and viscoelastic liquid models such as Oldroyd-B with shear-dependent viscosity will be investigated.  <br/><br/>The orientation of homogeneous long bodies in liquids is a fundamental issue in many problems of practical interest.  In composite materials, the addition of short fiber-like particles to a polymer matrix will to enhance the mechanical properties of the material;  for instance, it could make the material softer or harder, and more durable.  The degree of enhancement depends strongly on the orientation of the fibers, and the fiber orientation is in turn caused by the flow occurring in the mold.  Another important application occurs in separation of macromolecules by electrophoresis, which is employed in weight determination of proteins, DNA sequencing, and diagnosis of genetic disease.  Electrophoresis involves the motion of charged particles (macromolecules) in solution, under the influence of an electric field.  The orientation of the molecules plays an important role, since it is responsible for the loss of separability during steady-field gel electrophoresis.  A final, but not less important, application of particle orientation occurs in blood flow, where the blood cells under certain flow conditions tend to chain themselves along the axis of the artery at certain preferred angles.  This project investigates fundamental mathematical questions underlying the behavior of such particles interacting with the fluids in which they are immersed.<br/>"

A class of models based on chemotherapy with single or multiple killing agents will be formulated and analyzed under evolving drug resistance.  In the case of a single drug this leads to bilinear structures, but for the multiple drug case unconventional formulations arise and new tools need to be applied.  Aside from problems involving drug resistance, attention also will be directed to models representing treatments with angiogenic inhibitors (which slow tumor growth by depriving it from recruiting new blood vessels).  The dynamics in these models is fully nonlinear and its analysis within the framework of geometric methods of optimal control is expected to answer some open questions about this novel therapy.  Drug resistance and other side effects related to chemo-, radio- or antiangiogenic therapy naturally lead to the need for combination treatments.  Mathematically such treatments provide a challenge not only in the formulation of the complex dynamics, but also in the choice of proper objectives which would capture the various and multi-fold aspects reflecting the medical criteria by which to judge these therapies.  All of these efforts will serve the overall goal of finding the optimal control, which could aid in designing improved therapy protocols.<br/><br/>Conventional cancer treatments aim at directly killing tumor cells, be it by means of drugs in chemotherapy or by means of radiation in radiation treatments.

In the project tools of modern optimal control theory will be employed to analyze a variety of mathematical models representing cancer treatments with the focus on the important medical issue of drug resistance.  New models that capture these phenomena will be analyzed in an effort to better reflect the underlying biological situation and goals of the treatment.  The research conducted will provide mathematical insights into an understanding of these important biomedical models aimed at designing more effective therapy protocols which may be difficult, or at least very expensive, if not impossible, to test in a laboratory setting.  It will also contribute to optimal control theory by developing and employing new techniques aimed at significant applications.  Due to its applied and interdisciplinary character the project is of interest to students and consequently will contain a substantial educational component.<br/>"

The goal is to improve the overall speed and accuracy of data transmission.  Next, specific frames for wireless communication systems will be explored with the goal of improving both speed and reliability. The differences in the nature of the error between these systems and packet-based systems requires different constructions.  Also, frames for speech-recognition technology will be constructed with the aim to quickly recognize, distinguish and extract separate voices found in overlapped speech. Speech recognition is heavily dependent upon noise in the phase.  So the specific issues of noisy phase and the loss of phase information will be addressed.  Finally, Grassmannian (i.e. equiangular frames) frames will be derived symbolically and/or numerically for quantum physics, especially quantum information theory.  The goal is to develop optimally distributed frames needed for quantum state tomography, quantum cryptography and foundationalissues in quantum mechanics.  For each of these projects new classes of frames will be discovered, characterized and constructed.<br/><br/>Mathematics necessary to improve the speed and accuracy of the internet will be produced.  This will also allow messages to be delivered accurately even if much of the original information is lost in transmission. In related work, specific problems related to wireless communications systems - such as cell phones will be addressed. Here it is desired to produce cell phones which do not fade and have crisp clear signals.  Also the mathematics needed to separate voices in overlapped speech will be explored.  The goal is to eventually have cars, appliances etc. which respond directly and quickly to voice communications.

The research problems proposed lead to important<br/>applications in connection with completely<br/>integrable nonlinear evolution equations and to applications in<br/>soliton based optical communication systems. The first area is<br/>concerned with inverse spectral problems with emphasis on<br/>characterizing isospectral manifolds for<br/>self-adjoint matrix-valued Schroedinger and Dirac-type operators with<br/>periodic (and certain classes of quasi-periodic) coefficients.<br/>The techniques involved comprise matrix-valued Herglotz functions,<br/>inverse spectral theory, uniqueness theorems of Borg and<br/>Hochstadt-type, and pencils of matrices and their factorizations. The<br/>second area is concerned with spectral theory for a non-self-adjoint<br/>singular boundary value problem associated with a particular<br/>Dirac-type operator. The latter permits the existence of<br/>Weyl-Titchmarsh-type solutions for any point in its resolvent set<br/>under the most general hypothesis of merely local integrability of<br/>the potential coefficient.  This property has not previously been<br/>observed in non-self-adjoint boundary value problems and hence makes<br/>this Dirac-type operator a model operator of particular interest. The<br/>common thread through all the problems proposed is the use of<br/>(matrix-valued) Weyl-Titchmarsh-type functions which encode all<br/>spectral information of the underlying Schroedinger and Dirac-type<br/>systems.<br/><br/>Inverse spectral theory for self-adjoint Schroedinger and Dirac-type<br/>boundary value problems, as proposed in the first part of this<br/>proposal, is one of the pillars of applications of spectral theory to<br/>the applied sciences including theoretical physics (quantum physics),<br/>geophysics (seismology), medicine (tomography), etc. As such, it is<br/>an integral part of modern applied mathematics. In addition, this<br/>first part permits applications to completely integrable systems,<br/>especially to soliton equations such as the nonabelian Korteweg-de<br/>Vries and the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger hierarchies of<br/>evolution equations. Completely integrable systems of this type, a<br/>rapidly developing field in pure and applied mathematics especially<br/>since the second half of the 20th century, have widespread and<br/>multifaceted applications which include shallow water wave modelling,<br/>various aspects of nonlinear optics, and problems in condensed matter<br/>physics. On the other hand, many concrete applications of completely<br/>integrable systems naturally lead to non-self-adjoint boundary value<br/>problems. A prime example would be the area of nonlinear optics as<br/>modelled by the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The latter<br/>is intimately connected with a non-self-adjoint Dirac-type operator,<br/>the principal object of study in the second part of this proposal.<br/>While general spectral theory (and especially inverse spectral<br/>theory) for such non-self-adjoint Dirac operators is still in its<br/>infancy, we propose a new model for a soliton based optical communication<br/>system based upon our proposed study of a special class of soliton<br/>potentials relative to a periodic background potential.<br/><br/>"

One of the best illustrations of this<br/>concept is the behavior of fluid flows when the viscous drag is small,<br/>and the fluid behaves in a turbulent and chaotic way.<br/>The primary model under study in this project is the nonlinear<br/>Schrodinger equation, which is a fundamental model for the study of<br/>pulses in optical fibers. The small parameter limit for this<br/>model corresponds to the limit of ultra-short pulse propagation, which<br/>is expected to find many applications to high-speed telecommunications.<br/>This limit is known as the semiclassical limit.<br/>This project constitutes an in-depth study of initial-value problems<br/>for several partial differential equations (PDEs) in the semiclassical<br/>limit. Existing formal theories fail because they lead to model problems that are<br/>ill-posed and thus make no prediction at all for reasonable initial<br/>conditions.  The goal of this project is to develop asymptotic<br/>theories that are not based on any particular ansatz and do not<br/>require unphysical conditions on the initial data.  Among the problems<br/>under attack is the rigorous semiclassical analysis of the focusing<br/>nonlinear Schroedinger equation for general data, a problem that is<br/>generally considered to be one of the most important open problems in<br/>the field of integrable systems.  The specific aims of the project<br/>include the development of new ansatz-free methods of asymptotic<br/>analysis --- for spectral theory and for Riemann-Hilbert problems of<br/>inverse-scattering theory --- that are insensitive to analyticity<br/>properties of the initial data, and have a ""nonlinear<br/>Riemann-Lebesgue"" character, directly exploiting cancellation due to<br/>oscillations where analytic deformations are impossible.

Because of their novel electronic and optical properties, many technological applications have been proposed for quantum dots. A key requirement for these applications is the ability to predict and control the geometry and material properties of both single dots and arrays of dots. The kinetics pathways to formation and organization of quantum dots are important because the spacing and regularity of a quantum-dot array is largely determined at the early stages of their growth. The most common growth mode for quantum dots is Stranski-Krastanov (SK), in which growth of a wetting layer precedes the three-dimensional islanding that leads to quantum dots. Computations of epitaxial growth have been surprisingly unsuccessful in simulating SK growth, and the reasons for this failure are not well understood. This is a major open question in computational material science; its resolution is the principal aim of this proposal. Strain due to lattice mismatch between the substrate and film is an essential ingredient in SK growth and self-assembly of quantum dots. Inclusion of strain in models for material growth and device properties has proved to be difficult and computationally complex due to the short times scales of atomistic processes and the long-range influence of strain.<br/><br/>This proposal is aimed at modeling and predicting the formation and morphological evolution of quantum dots, which are self-assembled structures proposed for future use in microelectronics (""beyond CMOS""), optics and spintronics applications. This includes both modeling of the microscopic physical processes during thin film growth as well as the development and numerical implementation of new algorithms in applied mathematics. The result will be an effective and robust simulation method for strained epitaxial growth that includes  atomistic strain, anisotropic diffusion, three-dimensionality, alloying, and surface chemistry. The broader impacts of this project include the injection of applied mathematics into materials science and improved methods for design and growth of quantum dot arrays for opto-electronic applications.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Applied Mathematics program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Materials Theory program of the Division of Materials Research under the umbrella of the NSF-wide Mathematical Sciences Priority Area. <br/>"

Each day, literally millions of large data sets are generated in medical imaging, surveillance, and scientific acquisition. In addition, the internet has become a communication medium with vast capacity, generating massive traffic data sets.  The usefulness of these data sets rests on our ability to process them efficiently, whether it be for storage, transmission, visual display, fast on-line graphical query, correlation, or registration against data from other modalities.  The current state of the art in data processing is far from providing the efficient and faithful representations required in emerging applications.  With few exceptions, previous work has not provided algorithms whose efficiency or output quality, though typically validated experimentally, has been analyzed rigorously and thoroughly.  The investigators carry out fundamental mathematical and algorithmic research to significantly increase our capacity to process and manage large data sets.  The research makes significant mathematical progress in providing rigorous algorithmic results that are of great need in this field.  The research also makes significant improvements through highly efficient algorithms in the sizes of data sets that are analyzable and in the types of data processing tasks that can be carried out.  Finally, the investigators create a library of software for massive data processing applications.<br/>"

Healey plans to study various problems from nonlinear elasticity, with applications to multi-phase, shape-memory solids and nonlinearly elastic shells - especially bio-membranes or bio-shells.  For the first class of problems, coming from a field dominated by global-energy minimization techniques, the main goal of the work is provide new tools and results concerning meta-stable equilibria in the presence of loading and interfacial energy.  For shell problems the main goal is to understand non-axisymmetric equilibria of nominally spherical shells, which has recently become an important question for lipid-bilayer membranes or ""bio-shells"", which are ubiquitous in molecular-biological structures.  The nonlinear partial differential equations governing these models are essentially untouched - from the point of view of analysis.  The proposed work is interdisciplinary and challenging, requiring tools and perspectives from several different fields, e.g., nonlinear analysis and partial differential equations, bifurcation theory, nonlinear continuum physics, computational methods, symmetry ideas, materials science and bio-physics.<br/><br/>The proposed work will provide new mathematical models and predictive analysis for two seemingly different physical phenomena - phase transitions in shape-memory solids and in bio-membranes.  Of course the detailed mathematical models for the two phenomena are distinct, but the overall approach and philosophy of the project is the same.  As verified in experiments, there is a ""perfect"" or homogeneous state, which loses stability, after which more exotic patterns emerge.  The goal of the work is to provide new mathematical tools to predict and understand the emergence and persistence of such phenomena from a quantitative point of view.  The work has direct connections to technology:  Shape-memory alloys are important in applications as ""smart materials"" and can potentially provide actuation capabilities on the micro scale; the deformability and mechanical behavior of bio-membranes is closely related to cell function, which is of central importance in biology.<br/>"

Traditional methods become particularly complex when coping with real problems, which may generally be high dimensional, with general noise profiles, and have nonlinear interactions. Directly approximating the action of the stochastic Frobenius-Perron operator offers a practical and accessible tool.  The investigator develops computational methods to model and identify transport activity in both deterministic and stochastically perturbed dynamical systems. The investigator develops an analysis of the transfer operator beyond their usual theoretical use, into a broad and unified suite of computational tools for solving practical problems. The investigator is developing important applications of the computational methods including: 1) mapping the phase space for regions corresponding to high transport flux activity, leading for example to noise-induced bursting in multi-stable systems, 2) developing control of transport algorithms, to either amplify or decrease bursting activity through low-energy control inputs, 3) developing efficient and low-dimensional models of the transfer operator from experimental data, to do system identification and parameter estimation within the global perspective of the transfer operator, 4) developing low-dimensional, nonparametric statistical hypothesis tests to identify nonstationarity and significant system changes, or system ""damage,"" in high dimensional data sets known only through measured data.  <br/> <br/>Even though the complex oscillations seen in the physical world around us have been a subject of intense study in practically every branch of science and engineering, the traditional tools for their analysis remain somewhat technical to learn and apply to practical problems when noise is involved. There are many examples in which the interaction between determinism and a small noise component can give rise to complicated motions that would not occur without the interaction of both mechanisms. Mapping mechanism and timing of noise induced bursting has implications of important social impact.  For example, the investigator is studying population dynamics of disease spread, in which external noise excitation can lead to complicated oscillations, and large bursts corresponding to epidemic.  Understanding the timing and mechanisms behind these epidemics together with control algorithms leads to suggesting a radically new vaccination protocal in which well timed but relatively noninvasive intervention will result in averting the problem.  Similarly, investigations of noise induced transitions of a mechanical beam structure, in nonlinear optics (a noisy lasers), in electronic circuits, in the dynamics of air-pollution, and a reaction diffusion system of a chemical oscillator shows that these developing tools have wide ranging application and importance.  Development of damage detection tests of nonstationarity with global perspective suggests a powerful new way to observe when a system has been radically changed, suggesting algorithms for a new class of better sensors to avert hazards.  <br/><br/>"

It is anticipated that the results of this project will provide the necessary link between failure criteria related to stress fluctuations at the micro-scale and the averaged or macroscopic stress and strain that can be measured using strain gauges placed on the boundary of a composite structural component.  The analysis will be carried out for periodic microstructures, random microstructures, and microstructures associated with G or H convergent sequences of solution operators to linear and nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems. In this project a ladder of increasingly sophisticated continuum models incorporating pre-stress and nonlinear elastic and elastic-plastic behavior will be incorporated into the stress assessment methodology. This is crucial as engineering and naturally occurring bio-composite structures are pre-stressed and often exhibit nonlinear elastic behavior near regions of high stress.<br/><br/><br/>Composite materials are increasingly becoming the materials of choice for structural applications that require materials with high specific strength and stiffness.  Modern design practice increasingly incorporates the use of load bearing components  made up of composite substructures that are connected through bonded or bolted joints. This trend can be seen in the latest aircraft, ships and automobiles. Examples include the Airbus A300-600R and the Boeing 777 that feature a composite vertical tail. Components of the tail are bolted together and secured to the fuselage through clevises. It is of central interest to be able to understand and anticipate the modes of failure initiation in these structures. This requires fundamental understanding of how the mechanical loads are distributed across the hierarchy of scales seen in a typical composite structure.  In this project the investigator and his colleagues will work on new rigorous and systematic methods for accurate stress assessment across length scales. These methods will be employed in novel computational methods for the design of hierarchical composite structures that hedge against failure. Here the opportunity for failure will be minimized through optimal  tailoring of the composite microstructure.<br/><br/><br/>"

The approach relies on methods of nonsmooth analysis, which is an extension of classical calculus that systematically handles derivative-like properties of functions that may not be differentiable in the usual sense.  Its development was largely motivated by problems in optimization, where inequality constraints and min/max operations are ubiquitous, but which do not preserve classical differentiability.  This project investigates four related problem areas.  (1) Fully convex control, which is on the one hand quite special since it requires convexity assumptions in the state and velocity.  But on the other hand, it is a natural generalization of the linear-quadratic regulator, which is the workhorse of optimal control in applications.  Problems with state constraints, impulse trajectories, and infinite horizon will be studied from this viewpoint.  (2) One-sided Lipschitz dynamics, where the data may have non-Lipschitz behavior but only in a dissipative manner.  Such structure in the dynamics is present in the modeling of dry friction.  (3) Time-delay problems.  (4) Impulsive systems, in which the states evolve according to two time scales and can jump over short time intervals.<br/><br/>To reflect the desirability of certain behaviors of engineered systems in preference to others, aspects of optimization are often included in mathematical models, and dynamic optimization problems arise.  Optimal control theory offers deep insight into the nature of these problems.  Because the world appears to have many more nonsmooth characteristics than previously imagined, new theoretical challenges in optimal control have emerged.  The development of nonsmooth analysis was largely motivated by these considerations, and now consists of a substantial body of results that is being increasingly utilized by engineers.  This research project will broaden the range of application of nonsmooth analytic tools, and the results will allow control engineers to employ mathematical models that are more accurate and realistic than those in current use.<br/>"

Jones<br/>Institution: University of North Carolina Chapel Hill<br/>Title:  Permanent Structures across Scales: Assessing Stability and the Effects of Perturbations<br/><br/>ABSTRACT: <br/><br/>The analysis of structures that span scales pose challenges to mathematics that have led in recent years to new ideas and theories. The investigator in this work focuses on issues associated with the stability of permanent structures that have contrasting structure at the different scales. Their presence in a given system is the result of a balance between nonlinearity and a spatio-physical effect such as dispersion (e.g., for a solitary wave in optical communications), diffusion (e.g., propagating waves in biological media) or convection (e.g., shocks in materials or gases). The issue of stability requires a deep analysis that can reveal more intricate features in the inner workings of a given system. The work of this project will address four issues: (1) the determination of the stability for waves that are held together on different scales by different spatio-physical effects; (2) The assessment of the stability of patterns in multi-dimensions that have substructures on different scales; (3) The effects of stability at the macro-scale on controlling variations on a smaller scale; and (4) For complex structures, the best way to measure the manifestations of instability that influence a range of scales.<br/><br/>Critical questions in a physical or biological model often concern the stability of a permanent structure, such as a nonlinear wave or pattern. The work of this project aims at developing techniques for assessing the stability of structures that cross physical scales.<br/>A variety of information may be available at the different scales and the goal is to develop approaches for patching together these contrasting pieces of information to answer the relevant physical questions. Problems in advanced technology and communications routinely exploit the optical properties of materials. The work described in this proposal will supply techniques for key structures of existing and promised technologies, such as high bit-rate communications and Bose-Einstein condensates. At a more general level, the techniques to be developed promise a new viewpoint on stability determinations for higher-dimensional structures and patterns. Another dimension is the training of graduate students and postdocs in interdisciplinary mathematics. This work will both further that effort and systematize some of the key activities in the training of students for interdisciplinary work. In particular, a focused effort will be aimed at teaching problem discernment while working in a team with domain scientists. The involvement of under-represented minorities will also be a goal and it is anticipated that this effort will bring a number of minorities and women to a competitive level in modern interdisciplinary mathematics.<br/>"

This work studies a model for combustion in porous media consisting of three degenerate parabolic equations for temperature, concentration of the deficient reactant, and pressure.  The project investigates the long-time behavior of the combustion fronts, their stability, and bounds on propagation velocity.

The investigate will apply his results to chemical engineering, chemistry, environmental science, electrical engineering, nuclear engineering, and aeronautical engineering. Both phases of the project address a weakness of a conventional implementation of a globalized inexact Newton method, namely the inability to select among multiple solutions. Continuation methods use additional information, such as a physical parameter in the equation or the fact that the nonlinear equation is the steady state equation for a time-dependent problem, to guide the solver, and both improve the solver's robustness and increase the likelihood that the important solution or solutions will be found.

Therefore, algorithms for solving nonlinear equations are fundamental components of many simulators and engineering design tools. The investigator will study solution methods for equations that depend on physical parameters, such as the voltage across a semiconductor device, the load on a mechanical structure, or the temperature of a chemical reaction. As such parameters change, the nature of the solution can vary significantly, and the performance of the simulator can be affected as well. The PI's research is directed at improving the performance of the algorithms and making the solvers more robust.

Solitons as per their structural robustness and quasi-elastic interactions are natural building blocks that have been used for information transmission in optical settings in the past and could naturally be extended as information carriers in this new matter wave setup. Furthermore, these structures can be appropriately manipulated, waveguided or used to construct various patterns at this microscopic (atomic) level. The study will be undertaken at three different levels: (1) The level of creating these solitary waves by taking advantage of instabilities and/or experimentally available mechanisms (such as the Feshbach resonance); (2) The one of manipulating the waves (either dragging them by means of an optical tweezers or waveguiding them through  junctions); (3) And, finally, at the level of combining them to create patterns and to identify their steady states and structural transitions. These steps will be carried through for the two principal types of interactions: a) For attractive interactions between the atoms (e.g., for focusing nonlinearities and negative scattering lengths as in the case of lithium); b) For repulsive interactions  (e.g., for defocusing nonlinearities and positive scattering lengths as in the case of rubidium and sodium). The models that will be examined will be both continuum models of partial differential equations with external potentials (linear or quadratic, or combination thereof), as well as quasi-discrete ones (relevant for periodic external potentials<br/>as in the case of the so-called optical lattice). The techniques that will be used will involve regular and singular perturbation<br/>methods, linear and modulational stability analysis, regular and possibly exponential asymptotics, numerical bifurcation theory as well as direct numerical simulations and also molecular dynamics techniques (to study patterns and their structural transitions). <br/><br/>The main focus of this research project is a detailed study of solitary waves generated in the very controllable, ultra-low temperature, atomic physics context of Bose-Einstein  condensates (BECs). Since their recent experimental realization (for which the 2001 Physics Nobel prize was awarded), BECs have been the center of an intensive and ever growing experimental and theoretical effort in the Mathematics and Physics communities. The examination of BECs has also strong ties with a deeper understanding of the exciting and important fields of superconductivity and superfluidity (which were the theme of the Physics Nobel prize in 2003). From a Mathematical Physics perspective, one of the most interesting and appealing aspects of studying BECs is their rich nonlinear wave phenomenology, the wide variety of possible settings (one to three dimensions) and the detailed experimental control that permits a precise engineering/manipulation of the external conditions under which these waves dynamically evolve.<br/>The main purpose of this research effort is to extend and deepen our <br/>understanding of the fundamental structures and waves and their role<br/>and importance in BECs, but also more generally (due to the similar<br/>mathematical description) in nonlinear optics (optical fibers and<br/>waveguides) as well as wave physics. As an aside, it should be noted that this effort will heavily rely on computational resources and the concomitant use of numerical codes that model these phenomena; it should also be remarked that one of the longer term perspectives of this activity on matter waves is to conceive and construct novel devices that would guide and more generally control the motion of the matter waves and could potentially be used for quantum information processing at the nanoscale. These aspects lead us to expect that significant benefits may result from the implementation of this project in areas of strategic federal interest such as high performance computing and materials and manufacturing.<br/><br/>"

A combined analytical, numerical and experimental approach will be used, which brings together two novel features: (1) a non-contact experimental method of precisely moving, merging, and mixing nanoliter-sized droplets using temperature-induced surface tension gradients, and (2) a convenient theoretical model based on the Stokes equation for the fluid coupled with the advection equation for the solute concentration that is suitable for making quantitative predictions of mixing behaviors observed in the experiments.  The central focus of this research is on fundamental understanding of nonperturbative effects in time-dependent flow, which are most likely to lead to effective mixing in practical applications.  The main idea of our approach is based on using the invariants, or functions preserved along the streamlines of the flow, which arise due to a high symmetry of typical flows in microdroplets.  As streamlines cannot cross the invariant surfaces, destruction of all invariants is the key to achieving good mixing.  The nonperturbative corrections that arise naturally from non-ideal aspects of any experimental implementation are therefore essential ingredients in the mixing process as they change the symmetry of the flow and thus affect the existence and number of invariants.  The obtained results will be used to design an effective procedure for controlling mixing that should be applicable to a broad class of flows involving the mixing of discrete quantities of fluid.<br/><br/>Miniaturization holds great promise for novel applications, such as chemical and biological sensors, drug discovery, and clinical tests, bringing radical improvements in speed, throughput, and sensitivity.  This project focuses on the fundamental problem of fluid mixing, which plays a crucial role in most microfluidic technologies, yet becomes increasingly difficult at small scales.  The study of chaotic mixing in liquid microdroplets is an integral part of a broader study of opto-microfluidics, a novel approach for handling liquids at the microscale using optical methods.  This approach will allow construction of a new generation of microfluidic devices free of many drawbacks of conventional microchannel-based technology.  Such highly integrated dynamically reprogrammable reusable devices could be used to design complete ""labs-on-a-chip"" with a potential to revolutionize the way chemical and biological assays are done.<br/>"

Classical connections are defined only for free actions; the normalization condition would force the Lie algebra-valued connection form to be singular at singular points of the group action. However, if the connection form is regarded simply as a mechanism for specifying an equivariant projection onto the tangent space to the group orbit, the connection form can be replaced with a smooth one form taking values in the dual of the Lie algebra. Several key results from the classical theory of connections on principal bundles are generalized to partial connections. In support of this theoretical work, and as an application of it, a variety of mechanical systems are studied, including models from molecular dynamics, celestial mechanics, and micromagnetism. The primary application is the design and analysis of geometric integration schemes, that is, algorithms for the numerical approximation of trajectories of differential equations that capture some essential features of the exact solutions, independent of the overall accuracy of the approximations. The decomposition of tangent vectors into vertical (rigid) and horizontal (internal) components given by a partial connection form can be used to construct geometric integrators combining Lie group methods with traditional numerical integration schemes. Such decompositions also facilitate the development of geometrically meaningful performance criteria for competing numerical schemes.<br/><br/>A `connection' is, roughly speaking, a consistent way of describing the evolution of a mechanical system as a combination of `rigid' motions determined by the symmetry group and `shape-changing' motions. (In fact, connections can be defined for more general problems using appropriate mathematical analogs of rigid motions and shape.) Such decompositions have long played a central role in mechanics, geometry, and mathematical physics.  For example, connections can be used in engineering applications to efficiently predict the orientation of a flexible system (e.g. a complex space structure), when a detailed simulation of the motion of the system is intractable. Symmetric states (e.g. axisymmetric shapes) are of tremendous practical and theoretical importance; almost all man-made objects have some symmetry and many are highly symmetric. However, connections for systems with symmetric configurations have been introduced only recently, by the investigator and coworkers, and many crucial features remain to be explored. A diverse assortment of applications, relevant to computer design and manufacture, telecommunications, and medicine, motivate and guide the new theory. For example, generalized connections can be used in the design of efficient computer simulations of multibody systems, which are used in satellite design and control, biomechanics, and robotics. The development of geometric algorithms that can be implemented as `after-market' modifications of conventional algorithms facilitates the adoption of innovative methods in industrial and applied research settings by minimizing the costs and risks involved in modifying expensive, trusted, and highly specialized software.<br/>"

Importance sampling is a widely used Monte Carlo simulation technique for the estimation of quantities that are largely determined by rare events. With few exceptions, importance sampling algorithms are based on a change of measure that is not allowed to adapt in the course of generating a sample. Recent studies, however, indicate that these schemes may fail miserably in very common circumstances. These difficulties reflect the absence of a broad theoretical foundation for importance sampling. One contribution of the proposed research is to build such a foundation in a general setting. Roughly speaking, at the heart of any importance sampling problem is a stochastic game, and an understanding of this game is the key to designing and analyzing efficient importance sampling algorithms. This perspective motivates the concept of dynamic importance sampling, where the change of measure is allowed to vary depending on the simulation history. It can be shown that dynamic schemes, properly designed, are optimal in a suitable sense. The second topic, urn occupancy problems, is concerned with the distribution of multiple balls in multiple urns. This classical topic has found applications in many fields. The proposed research concerns large deviation approximations, new techniques for explicitly solving the associated variational problem, and the development of relations between equilibrium distributions for stochastic networks and occupancy problems.<br/><br/>If one were to ask an average person whether unlikely events are important, their first response might be that an event with very little chance of happening could not be significant.  After a moment's reflection, however, they would realize that such events have a profound impact in many circumstances. For example, measuring credit risk is very important to those who manage portfolios of loans, corporate bonds, and other financial instruments that are subject to default risk. Often the problem reduces to estimating the probability of default, which is usually very small, especially for highly rated obligors. However, an accurate estimation is crucial for risk management because these rare defaults can induce significant losses.  Similar considerations apply in many other circumstances, especially when performance standards are stringent.  The dominant technique for estimating small probabilities has been a simulation algorithm called importance sampling. However, the traditional design methodology for importance sampling has very limited applications and has been observed to break down in very common situations. Part of the proposed research is concerned with the most basic question, that is, how to build a broad theoretical foundation for importance sampling, upon which efficient algorithms can be designed for very general problems. A new concept of design is introduced in the proposal and the resulting importance sampling algorithms work well in practice. The other part of the proposal is concerned with a class of urn occupancy models. These models are very useful in the design and analysis of large-scale networks, biological systems, and physics. However, due to the complexity of the models, approximation becomes exceedingly important. The proposed research will develop an asymptotic method that can yield good approximations with only a modest computation effort.   <br/>"

The former is an artificial mathematical<br/>construct; the latter are ubiquitous in the sciences, where they represent conservation of mass, momentum, energy, etc. in many situations.  Building on their earlier work,  Lin and Schecter propose to complete their analysis of the spectrum of the linearized Dafermos operator.  They propose to use this analysis to determine the stability of Riemann solutions as asymptotic states of viscous conservation laws.   They also propose to use it to analyze and improve Dafermos regularization-based numerical methods for computing curves of Riemann solutions.  They propose to investigate issues<br/>in geometric singular perturbation theory raised by the Dafermos<br/>regularization. In addition, Schecter and Lin will continue work with<br/>collaborators on finding traveling wave solutions of viscous conservation laws with reaction terms; subjects under investigation include liquid-vapor phase transitions and methods of oil recovery that use heat.  They will investigate the use of the Dafermos regularization in such problems.<br/><br/>In many areas of science and technology, various situations involving fluid flow, such as oil recovery and flow of thin liquid films used in<br/>manufacturing, can be mathematically modeled by equations called viscous conservation laws.  The models become more tractable when one drops various terms, leaving only a system of conservation laws.  For these equations one can often construct explicit solutions, called Riemann solutions, that frequently involve jumps that move with varying speeds.  An example from oil recovery using injection of water is a moving front that is mostly water on one side and mostly oil on the other; the water pushes the oil toward the<br/>well.  One reason Riemann solutions are important is that it is believed that in many situations, solutions of viscous conservation laws, appropriately rescaled, tend to look more and more like Riemann solutions as time goes on.  However, there are only a few, rather artificial situations is which this behavior is proved.  A related fact is that we do not have good mathematical techniques to check whether Riemann solutions are stable, i.e., are really approached for a significant set of initial configurations<br/>of the viscous conservation laws.  Lin and Schecter have developed a new approach to these issues using a different simplification of the viscous conservation laws, the so-called Dafermos regularization.  This equation admits a smoothed-out version of the Riemann solution as a steady-state.  In principle, one can check its stability by relatively familiar mathematical methods.  Lin and Schecter plan to continue their work on the stability of these smoothed Riemann solutions, and to use this work to approach the physically relevant situation.<br/><br/>"

Campbell will perform research on optimization, numerical methods for constrained differential equations, and constrained optimal control.  This research will result in improved algorithms and new theoretical understanding of numerical methods for differential algebraic equations (DAEs) and the solution of inequality constrained optimal control problems by direct transcription approaches.  More specifically, a DAE is an implicit differential equation.  An integer quantity called the index is one measure of how different a DAE is from being an explicit ordinary differential equation.  Many problems are most naturally initially modeled as a DAE particularly those that are analyzed and simulated using computer generated mathematical models.  DAEs occur in optimization when the original problem is a DAE, because of the activation of constraints, and when partial differential equations are numerically solved using the method of lines.  Because of the importance of DAEs in applications, a variety of numerical techniques have been developed in recent years to simulate and analyze DAEs although most of these methods only work on specific classes of problems with special structure and low index.  The development of more general DAE integrators is one focus of this proposal.  Direct transcription methods are a popular approach for the solution of optimal control problems. Recently it has been shown that the usual theory of DAE integrators needs to be substantially modified when DAEs occur during the numerical solution by direct transcription methods of inequality constrained optimal control problems.  A second primary focus of this proposal is the numerical solution of inequality constrained optimal control problems using direct transcription methods.  <br/><br/>Throughout industry there is a need for the development of more efficient processes and systems.  This is essential for improved performance, conserving of resources, and industrial and military competitiveness.  This increased performance requires working with complex mathematical models of the systems in question.  In many areas it is becoming necessary to utilize larger, more complex, and more complete models of the physical process or system.  Two important parts of systems design are simulation and optimization.  In applications there are many constraints.  These constraints range from mission constraints (such as flying within certain flight corridors or intercepting specific targets) to physical constraints (such as contact between a robotic arm and a tool) to financial or cost constraints.  These constraints pose both theoretical and computational challenges which increase with the model's complexity.  This project is to develop both mathematical theory and numerical algorithms for the numerical simulation and optimal control of complex systems with constraints.  The proposer has ongoing collaborations with developers of software used in a number of industries including the aerospace industry.  The results of this research will both be incorporated into production computer codes as part of collaborations of the Principal Investigator and also shared with others developing numerical software.

This is a tremendously interesting and important problem in the regimes of applied analysis and modeling in materials science. It is due to the fact that phase boundaries, during their formations, will inevitably encounter complicated microstructures coming from the defects and impurities embedded in the environment. The investigator will study the stable and unstable patterns of the phase boundaries. These correspond to the local minimizers and saddle points on the materials energy functionals. The main emphasis of this proposal is to study the time evolution of the phase boundaries on the energy landscape, in particular, the transition from one stable configuration to another and from the pinning and de-pinning phenomena in response to some external forcing. The outcome of the scientific activity will provide a solid mathematical framework for the understanding of the dynamical response of the materials with respect to the underlying spatial environment and external parameters. The mathematical techniques involved in this proposal include variational methods, asymptotic analysis, and bifurcation theory.<br/><br/>The understanding of material properties is becoming more and more instrumental in modern materials science, especially in the current pursuit of small scale (nano-)materials. A crucial factor is to relate the materials properties to their microstructures.

This gives a better understanding of the materials response to the external environment, which in turn gives better design and manufacture of the materials.

From a  modeling and  computational perspective, microscopic simulation methods such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte <br/>Carlo (MC) algorithms   can describe complex, out of equilibrium interactions at  small scales (e.g.  between atoms or molecules). Although there is  substantial progress in improving aspects of these computational methods, they are still limited to short length and time scales, while on the other hand device sizes and morphological features observed in experiments often involve much larger scales; at the same time stochastic <br/>fluctuations--inherited from the microscopics--can be important, for instance  in  self-organization  problems characterized by small coherent structures such as pattern formation in nanotechnology applications. In addition to such challenges posed by the disparity in scales  within the same model, in many instances we are faced with an additional disparity in models: for example  in phenomena with detailed fluid/surface or boundary layer interactions it is necessary to couple microscopic, possibly stochastic models describing the  dynamics of atoms or molecules on a surface, along with continuum PDE for  species, fluid and thermodynamic variables on the overlying to the surface gas phase. It is therefore inevitable that  features of the microscopic model will  essentially enter as a subgrid effect in the coupling with the coarse computational grid of the macroscopic PDE models. In this case,  the proper incorporation and simulation of stochastic effects from the subgrid microscale is a critical element in the modeling and simulations. The proposed projects focus on aspects of the aforementioned   issues by putting forward a combination of interconnected modeling, computational and analysis questions,  roughly divided in two categories: (i) Mathematical strategies for the coarse-graining of microscopic  models and the corresponding<br/> simulators, addressing problems which are currently  intractable with conventional MD/MC  due to scale limitations. Here, it is not   directly attempted to speed up microscopic simulation algorithms; instead, a hierarchy  of new coarse-grained  stochastic models (referred to as Coarse Grained Monte Carlo methods) is derived, ordered by the magnitude of space/time scales. This new set of models involves  a reduced set of observables over the original  microscopic models incorporating microscopic details and noise, as well as<br/>the interaction of the unresolved degrees of freedom. (ii)   Hybrid    stochastic/deterministic systems describing detailed fluid-surface interactions arise in applications that range from deposition process and catalysis to fuel cell design and microreactors, to  biology and  atmosphere and ocean science. Here two such applications are addressed, namely catalytic reactors and stochastic parametrizations of tropical convection.<br/>Due to their inherent complexity it is also necessary to develop simpler,  test bed problems that capture significant features of  the multi-scale nature of the physical models, but  are still amenable to asymptotics, mathematical analysis and  tractable computations.<br/><br/>The modeling and simulation of problems with multiple interrelating length and time scales is one of the preeminent issues in essentially all timely scientific and engineering challenges, ranging from the design of  nanodevices, to biomolecular  dynamics, to the spread of epidemics  and  climate modeling. In spite of  a continuously increasing  computing power many of these problems remain  intractable, at least in realistic conditions, and new modeling and  simulation  strategies  need to be developed. As several paradigms<br/>have recently demonstrated, the critical step in this process is the use of (the limited in number and flexibility) existing multiscale mathematical and statistical tools as well as the development of  new ones, that enable the creation of new algorithms for complex systems. In the proposed work an array of such novel multiscale mathematics and computing methods is developed. The research is motivated by and targeted  to a<br/>number of the aforementioned applications. Two such particular examples  are, (i) the surface processes  in catalytic reactors and fuel cells, and  (ii) the  tropical and open ocean  convection.<br/>"

A second goal is to explore innovative techniques that simulate long-time molecular motions without sequentially stepping through billions of intermediate states, as would be necessary with standard approaches.  New algorithms for both dynamics and sampling are to be constructed using such techniques as modified energy functions that compensate for finite steps, stochastic stabilization, and optimization of method parameters, together with physical insight.  Promising algorithms are tested and compared using mathematical analyses and computer experiments.  Tools for mathematical analysis include the concept of effective accuracy, the method of modified equations, linear analysis, and KAM theory.  Computer experiments are performed on model problems chosen to reveal unambiguously the properties of interest.  Faster algorithms are to be implemented in molecular simulation software developed and distributed for public use in a project at the University of Illinois Beckman Institute.  Many of the techniques will apply not only to molecular simulations but also to simulations in astrophysics, structural mechanics, and fluids.<br/><br/>Computer simulations of atomic detail are heavily employed in physics, chemistry, materials science, and structural biology.  These calculations require the generation of sequences of atomic configurations either for the purpose of modeling actual motion or for the purpose of calculating averaged values and structures from a wide range of representative samples.  The computing time ranges from hours to months, so it can benefit tremendously from faster algorithms.  It is the objective of this research project to do this: to create much more efficient propagators for dynamics and sampling that reliably achieve acceptable levels of accuracy.  The construction of such algorithms employs ideas from mathematics and computer science together with physical insight.  Promising algorithms are tested and compared using mathematical analyses and computer experiments.  The successful ones are implemented in molecular modeling software being developed for widespread use in a project at the University of Illinois Beckman Institute.  These advances in methodology are also to be disseminated in articles targeted to practitioners.  Many of the techniques will apply not only to molecular simulations but also to simulations in astrophysics, structural mechanics, and fluids.  Potentially, the availability of accelerated propagation algorithms will lead to a variety of scientific results that otherwise would not be obtained.  The performance of the research will be a valuable interdisciplinary experience for a graduate student.<br/>"

Pseudoframes are frame-like systems for <br/>the linear analysis and synthesis of a subspace X.  They differ from <br/>frames in that both analysis and synthesis sequences are not necessarily <br/>contained in X.  Theme 1 of the project studies constructions of <br/>biorthogonal wavelets (via PFFS) that incorporate the regularity <br/>requirement and the perfect reconstruction principle with practical <br/>optimal design criteria.

The proposed research will deepen our understanding of and inform analytical and computational approaches to the study of important wave phenomena in physical systems. Three theme areas are considered. (1) Nonlinear scattering and resonant energy transfer: This concerns fundamental questions for infinite dimensional dynamical systems on the interaction of bound states (solitary waves, kinks, vortices) and radiation. (2) Control of soliton-like coherent structures: Motivated by the problem of trapping optical pulses in inhomogeneous media with defects, this work concerns design of propagation media in order to achieve **controlled** energy transfer. The ideas are also of direct relevance in the study of mathematical models of Bose-Einstein condensation. (3) Linear and nonlinear photonic structures and homogenization: This work addresses determination of properties of photonic microstructures, by effective media (e.g. higher order homogenization)  approaches with applications to efficient numerical study of optical microstructures and their optimal design. <br/><br/>Technological advances have made possible the fabrication of novel optical media (photonic microstructures), which have great potential for applications ranging from transmission media and devices in communication networks to the fundamental science of optical and quantum computing.<br/>These media are material structures made up of features which are of <br/> micro- (millionth of a meter) or nano- (billionth of a meter) scales. The shape of individual microfeatures, their spatial arrangement and the material contrasts among them (e.g. refractive index variations)  offer  multiple degrees of freedom, which can now be tuned in order to influence light pulses sent through such media. Devices based on these novel structures can be used to shape, filter and amplify light pulses which encode the bits of information in optical communication networks. Transmission media using such structures can potentially  achieve much lower losses and lower distortion of pulses than in currently used optical fiber. The number of possible designs is so huge that an approach mainly based on direct computer exploration is not<br/>feasible. Rather,  a fundamental mathematical understanding of such phenomena must be joined with computation to achieve rational and  systematic design of optical media.  The goal of this research is to develop fundamental mathematical insights in the fields of partial differential equations and dynamical systems and to apply them to an understanding of light propagation  (linear and nonlinear) in photonic microstructures.<br/><br/>"

The research problems proposed lead to important<br/>applications in connection with completely<br/>integrable nonlinear evolution equations and to applications in<br/>soliton based optical communication systems. The first area is<br/>concerned with inverse spectral problems with emphasis on<br/>characterizing isospectral manifolds for<br/>self-adjoint matrix-valued Schroedinger and Dirac-type operators with<br/>periodic (and certain classes of quasi-periodic) coefficients.<br/>The techniques involved comprise matrix-valued Herglotz functions,<br/>inverse spectral theory, uniqueness theorems of Borg and<br/>Hochstadt-type, and pencils of matrices and their factorizations. The<br/>second area is concerned with spectral theory for a non-self-adjoint<br/>singular boundary value problem associated with a particular<br/>Dirac-type operator. The latter permits the existence of<br/>Weyl-Titchmarsh-type solutions for any point in its resolvent set<br/>under the most general hypothesis of merely local integrability of<br/>the potential coefficient.  This property has not previously been<br/>observed in non-self-adjoint boundary value problems and hence makes<br/>this Dirac-type operator a model operator of particular interest.

In addition, this<br/>first part permits applications to completely integrable systems,<br/>especially to soliton equations such as the nonabelian Korteweg-de<br/>Vries and the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger hierarchies of<br/>evolution equations. Completely integrable systems of this type, a<br/>rapidly developing field in pure and applied mathematics especially<br/>since the second half of the 20th century, have widespread and<br/>multifaceted applications which include shallow water wave modelling,<br/>various aspects of nonlinear optics, and problems in condensed matter<br/>physics.

Schulze<br/>Institution: University of Tennessee Knoxville<br/>Title:  The mushy-zone free-boundary problem<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The research undertaken in this project concerns the solidification of multi-component materials in situations where the solid/liquid interface is morphologically unstable.  Multi-component materials are especially prone to such instability and in typical situations one finds the interface taking the form of a highly convoluted layer of crystal dendrites referred to as a ""mushy zone"".  Such regions can be modeled as reactive porous media and present a number of mathematical challenges involving homogenization, free-boundaries, instability, bifurcation and complex fluid- and thermo-dynamics.  This research is relevant to both materials science and geophysics. Ultimately, most manufactured products are produced by some sort of casting or extrusion process and form complex micro-structures upon solidification. Usually this micro-structure is the result of a mushy zone having developed during solidification.  In geophysics, mushy zones are found in both magma chambers and beneath sea ice, which covers much of the Earth's surface.  The proposal describes five particular avenues for investigation, including the formulation of a time-dependent sharp-interface model; the solution of a class of one-dimensional problems based on this model; comparison of these solutions and other elementary calculations with smeared-interface models; numerical studies of bifurcation and morphology; and the study of cotectic mushy zones, which form in systems with three or more components.<br/><br/>This project aims to study the solidification of liquid materials in situations that lead to the formation of highly convoluted, snow-flake like interfaces between the solid and liquid. This situation is common in both materials manufacturing processes and in natural processes like the formation of sea ice beneath the polar ice caps. In the former case, these regions, referred to as ""mushy zones,"" have a significant impact on the quality of materials, including metallic alloys, silicon for computer chips and crystals for optical equipment.  In the case of sea ice, the mushy zones significantly alter the salt-content of the water and this has a significant but poorly understood impact on global ocean currents and climate.<br/><br/>"

A class of models based on chemotherapy with single or multiple killing agents will be formulated and analyzed under evolving drug resistance.  In the case of a single drug this leads to bilinear structures, but for the multiple drug case unconventional formulations arise and new tools need to be applied.  Aside from problems involving drug resistance, attention also will be directed to models representing treatments with angiogenic inhibitors (which slow tumor growth by depriving it from recruiting new blood vessels).  The dynamics in these models is fully nonlinear and its analysis within the framework of geometric methods of optimal control is expected to answer some open questions about this novel therapy.  Drug resistance and other side effects related to chemo-, radio- or antiangiogenic therapy naturally lead to the need for combination treatments.  Mathematically such treatments provide a challenge not only in the formulation of the complex dynamics, but also in the choice of proper objectives which would capture the various and multi-fold aspects reflecting the medical criteria by which to judge these therapies.  All of these efforts will serve the overall goal of finding the optimal control, which could aid in designing improved therapy protocols.<br/><br/>Conventional cancer treatments aim at directly killing tumor cells, be it by means of drugs in chemotherapy or by means of radiation in radiation treatments.  However, there exist many limiting factors and probably the single most important, and what has been called ""certainly the most frustrating one,"" is drug resistance.  As of today no medical solution exists for this obstacle to developing effective cancer treatments.  In the project tools of modern optimal control theory will be employed to analyze a variety of mathematical models representing cancer treatments with the focus on the important medical issue of drug resistance.  New models that capture these phenomena will be analyzed in an effort to better reflect the underlying biological situation and goals of the treatment.  The research conducted will provide mathematical insights into an understanding of these important biomedical models aimed at designing more effective therapy protocols which may be difficult, or at least very expensive, if not impossible, to test in a laboratory setting.  It will also contribute to optimal control theory by developing and employing new techniques aimed at significant applications.  Due to its applied and interdisciplinary character the project is of interest to students and consequently will contain a substantial educational component.<br/>"

For a nonlinear trap subjected to secondary end-cap excitation and including a buffer gas, the equations of motion are coupled, damped, nonlinear, quasiperiodic Mathieu equations. The attractors for this system are non-trivially ""knotted"" in the 4-D phase space. The investigator and his colleagues have developed tools to characterize them topologically and geometrically, and have identified new bifurcations associated with their changes of type. Important outstanding problems include: how topological equivalence of attractors through torus braids and through surfaces is related; whether chaos is associated with transverse intersections of stable and unstable manifolds of saddle-type knotted tori.<br/>A sequence of the newly identified bifurcations leads to chaotic dynamics through a route observed, but not yet characterized. In some cases, two bifurcations bound extremely sharp resonances which are useful in applications.<br/><br/>The new knowledge being developed about this system can be used to suggest new operating regimes for ion traps used in discrimination of species in mass spectroscopy.  The sharp resonances already observed suggest the use of an ion trap as a tunable electromechanical filter. Two similar ion trap systems may be used for the purpose of masking and unmasking signals for secure communication. Finally, the results suggest that a trapped charged particle or ion can be used as an accelerometer and gyroscope.  These technological innovations or improvements flow directly from a detailed understanding of the underlying mathematics.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Applied Mathematics and Topology programs of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division under the umbrella of the NSF-wide Mathematical Sciences Priority Area. <br/>"

This has been triggered by the need for<br/>knowledge of their long term behavior.  Moreover, a better<br/>understanding of these systems might lead to insights in the<br/>underlying mechanisms, which are usually much more complicated<br/>and less well understood than in the physical sciences.  An<br/>in-depth analysis sometimes reveals unsatisfactory behavior, e.g.<br/>extinction of a certain species or -- at the opposite end of the<br/>spectrum -- persistence of an infectious disease, and require<br/>appropriate modifications.  In this project the investigator uses<br/>control theory in both analysis and possible modification of the<br/>behavior of biological models.  The main idea is to consider these<br/>models from a feedback perspective -- provided this is possible<br/>of course --, which is a central topic of interest in control<br/>theory.  It is argued that certain biological (sub)systems are<br/>actually feedback systems.  Two examples are studied from this<br/>point of view.  The first is the chemostat model with crowding<br/>effects, while the second concerns certain classes of<br/>predator-prey systems.  Stability issues are of primary concern in<br/>this study.  A second part of the work is devoted to control (or<br/>modification) of the behavior of chemostat models with possibly<br/>multiple resources.  The novelty of the approach lies in the way<br/>the control is implemented, by means of feedback control.  The<br/>very principle of this type of control is that the control action<br/>is based on the state of the system.  The usual strategies<br/>appearing in the literature consider constant controls leading to<br/>bifurcation analysis or control signals that depend only on time<br/>-- but not on the state of the system.<br/>     Many biological systems are under close examination these<br/>days.  The human genome project, infectious diseases such as AIDS,<br/>the flu, or even those caused by a bio-terror attack are but few<br/>of the compelling examples.  Usually these systems are very<br/>complex and hard to understand, let alone control.  The aim of<br/>this project is to use the perspective of control theory in<br/>dealing with these problems.  Ideas from control theory have been<br/>very successful in applications in more traditional areas.<br/>Chemical and nuclear plants, airplanes, vehicles and satellites,<br/>robots and audio-visual equipment are nowadays equipped with<br/>computers controlling the smooth operation of the specific<br/>application.  The question is whether control theory can<br/>contribute to rapid developments in the biological sciences.  As<br/>an example, consider a biological system in which a number of<br/>organisms compete against each other.  A basic question is whether<br/>or not the species survive.  Depending on the application one<br/>would like the answer to this question to be yes (for example if<br/>some of the species are endangered) or no (for instance if one of<br/>the species is a malignant virus).  Sometimes the answer turns out<br/>to be no where a yes is desired or vice-versa, and then the issue<br/>becomes whether this can be modified by suitably manipulating the<br/>system.  This type of problem is central in control theory.  The<br/>lessons learned in the areas mentioned above should prove<br/>valuable in a biological setting.<br/>"

The positioning accuracy of the system can be improved by minimizing the effect of the hysteresis.  To reach this goal it is necessary to have an accurate representation of the hysteresis, and a control strategy that provides compensation for the hysteresis.  Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of using the KP operator to model hysteresis.  This work also demonstrated the use of the inverse KP operator to create an open loop control that minimized the positioning error caused by the hysteresis.  The results of that work are restricted to an actuator working under a fixed set of operating conditions.  As these conditions change the performance of the model and the control degrade.  To remedy this situation the proposed three year research program will focus on the modification of the KP operator so that it is capable of modeling hysteresis over a wide range of operating conditions (temperature and load).  As before, the inverse operator will be used as part of a controller designed to minimize positioning error over a range of operating conditions.  The major program tasks are: 1) The determination of the conditions necessary for data that is used to identify the nonnegative measure of the KP operator; 2) The modification of the KP operator to explicitly include variables associated with the temperature of the actuator and the load acting on the actuator; 3) The inversion of the modified KP operator and the development of a control based on this inverse.  Computer simulations and experimental data will be used to evaluate the relative performance of the KP and modified KP operators.  Similarly, the performance of controllers based on the inverses of both operators will be compared to determine if the positioning accuracy of the actuator can be improved by incorporating load and temperature variables into the KP operator.  <br/><br/>A key component of many mechanical systems is the positioning subsystem.  This subsystem typically consists of a controller that uses sensor information to drive an actuator such that a desired position is attained by a system component.  For a satellite-tracking antenna, it may be the system that aims the parabolic antenna dish at the desired point in the sky, or it is the system that is used to position a specimen under the probe tip in a scanning probe microscope (SPM).  Whether it is a system for pointing an antenna or imaging microscopic structure, the accuracy of the positioning directly impacts the overall effectiveness of the system.  For an SPM a piezoceramic type actuator is used for positioning.  A relationship between the actuator input and the resulting position, called hysteresis, limits the accuracy of this type of actuator.  The hysteresis introduces a positioning error that cannot be effectively minimized with conventional control strategies.  However, over the past decade several methods have been developed that are capable of minimizing this error for fixed operating conditions.  The proposed program is directed at extending a method based on the KP operator so that it can be used to reduce the hysteresis error over a range of actuator operating conditions.  The two major benefits of the program are: 1) The results can be used to improve the accuracy of currently installed positioning systems such as those used for microscopic imaging and integrated circuit production and 2) The program will actively engage a diverse undergraduate student population to state of the art research.  The second of these benefits is as significant as the first, for this effort will include the development of an experimental test facility at Ferrum College for both computer simulation work and experimental testing.  Students at the college will be active participants in the design, implementation and execution of experiments directed at the development and evaluation of the hysteresis models and the actuator controllers.  Additionally, they will apply material learned in their undergraduate courses to analyze experimental data and system performance.  The program will provide a rare opportunity for undergraduate students in this region to experience advanced research typically only found at a major research university or industrial research center.  This program will also be an introduction for this region of the state to advanced technology."

The existence of Euler singularities is likely to have substantial implications for physical fluid dynamics, in particular a role in the onset and structure of turbulence.  This research will utilize a combination of numerical and analytical methods to study Euler singularity formation, as well as examine the significance of these singularities for fluid dynamic turbulence.  A centerpiece of the project is a new method for constructing singular Euler solutions, starting from a semi-analytic approach using complex space-time and singularities in the complex plane.  The results should be amenable to rigorous analysis and direct numerical validation.  A full numerical and analytic validation of the singularity construction forms a main component of this proposal.  Several related projects involving singularity formation in interfacial internal waves, and in incompressible nondissipative magnetohydrodynamics will also be undertaken.<br/> <br/>The incompressible Euler equations are a system of partial differential equations that describe the flow of inviscid fluids.  Although these equations have been known for nearly 250 years, basic mathematical questions concerning the nature of solutions are still open.  In particular, it is still not known whether solutions of the three dimensional Euler equations can form a singularity, that is, an infinite value in a flow quantity such as the velocity or vorticity (which measures circulation) in finite time.  Due to its implications in turbulence theory, the question of Euler singularities has received intense attention over the last 20 years.  Successful construction of Euler singularities would solve a major problem of mathematics and would establish a new method for addressing singularity formation.  A fluid dynamic understanding of these singularities could lead to important insights on the structure of turbulence, one of the major open problems of classical physics.  This in turn could lead to important new methods for understanding and simulating turbulent flows, essential in a wide range of engineering applications, including the design of aircraft and watercraft.<br/>"

Our goals cover physical channel modeling, experimental measurements, algorithm design and simulation of wireless communication systems in large delay spread environments.  Physical modeling will help understand large delay spread channels in wireless environments. Experimental measurements will use a new, specially designed by this research group, wireless time reversal sounder to verify theoretical time reversal predictions. Mathematical algorithm design will deal with equalization complexity, working with imperfect channel estimates, pre-coding, etc., that arise in such problems. Systems simulations will help understand overall performance of time reversal communications in different deployment scenarios.<br/><br/>In time reversal, signals transmitted with a time reversed filter back propagate and focus tightly in space-time near the intended receiver. The phenomena rely on large delay spread (rich multipath) channels. The space-time focusing is even more tight and robust when the propagation medium is randomly inhomogeneous. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have firmly established this remarkable effect and have motivated applications to detection, imaging and communications.  We believe that these space-time focusing properties of time reversal can lead to a new class of wireless communications systems with significant advantages over current approaches. This technique converts a problem in wireless posed by multipath (which induces fading) into an opportunity for improved performance.

This research will utilize a combination of numerical and analytical methods to study Euler singularity formation, as well as examine the significance of these singularities for fluid dynamic turbulence.  A centerpiece of the project is a new method for constructing singular Euler solutions, starting from a semi-analytic approach using complex space-time and singularities in the complex plane.  The results should be amenable to rigorous analysis and direct numerical validation.  A full numerical and analytic validation of the singularity construction forms a main component of this proposal.  Several related projects involving singularity formation in interfacial internal waves, and in incompressible nondissipative magnetohydrodynamics will also be undertaken.<br/> <br/>The incompressible Euler equations are a system of partial differential equations that describe the flow of inviscid fluids.  Although these equations have been known for nearly 250 years, basic mathematical questions concerning the nature of solutions are still open.  In particular, it is still not known whether solutions of the three dimensional Euler equations can form a singularity, that is, an infinite value in a flow quantity such as the velocity or vorticity (which measures circulation) in finite time.  Due to its implications in turbulence theory, the question of Euler singularities has received intense attention over the last 20 years.  Successful construction of Euler singularities would solve a major problem of mathematics and would establish a new method for addressing singularity formation.  A fluid dynamic understanding of these singularities could lead to important insights on the structure of turbulence, one of the major open problems of classical physics.  This in turn could lead to important new methods for understanding and simulating turbulent flows, essential in a wide range of engineering applications, including the design of aircraft and watercraft.<br/>"

The approach adopted is four-pronged and consists of modeling, analysis, computations, and comparisons with experiments, and it aims to establish theoretical and physically realistic models that are capable of describing phenomena of technological and strategic interest.  Interfacial flows where surface tension is dominant arise in a plethora of classical and novel applications, including ink-jet printing and related technologies (DNA assays), solder-jet technologies and related advanced manufacturing processes, industrial emulsion processes, coating technologies, microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip technologies, and, micro- and nano-encapsulation techniques with applications to pharmaceutical slow drug release systems.<br/><br/>This project aims to contribute to understanding of such flows and in particular to incorporate, model, and analyze the effects of electric fields on the spatio-temporal interfacial dynamics which can lead to interfacial rupture (this is manifested as a singularity of the mathematical models).

This project is concerned with the mathematical study of complex microstructures that can be observed in fundamental phase-field models for solidification and melting processes. In addition to classical and thermodynamically consistent models, the study considers recent stochastic and nonlocal extensions. The latter incorporate the effects of thermal noise and long-range interactions, thereby addressing two key shortcomings of the classical phase-field models. The PI obtains a detailed mathematical description of the microstructure dynamics, which explains both the formation of the microstructures and key characteristics of their complex geometry. He studies how noise and long-range interactions influence the pattern geometry. Furthermore, in collaboration with a graduate student, the PI develops numerical simulation tools to treat stochastic and nonlocal effects.<br/><br/>In recent years, phase-field modeling has proved to be a valuable tool for simulating and predicting a variety of processes in materials science. The proposed research provides tools that can be used for precisely predicting microstructure changes and therefore is of interest for materials design and the understanding of small-scale biological and physical processes. Since the microstructure geometry of modern materials has direct implications for macroscopic material properties, the results of this project can offer help in the development of new high performance materials, which is vital to economic and other national interests. Especially due to the inclusion of thermal noise and long-range interactions, the study allows for the treatment of more realistic models. While the proposed research is focused on a specific situation, its impact reaches well beyond the materials science application. Immediate applications of the project can be expected in the field of mathematical biology. Both the formation of complicated protein patterns inside bacteria and aspects of neural pattern formation are described by phase-field-type models. In addition, the proposed activities offer an excellent framework for integrating research and education at several levels, including undergraduate and graduate research."

Sample equations to be considered include coupled oscillators and models of oscillatory chemical reactions. A characteristic feature of singularly perturbed equations is the presence of slow/fast dynamics. Slow/fast systems often possess locally invariant slow manifolds, where trajectories evolve on the slow time scale. As trajectories leave locally invariant slow manifolds they typically follow fast directions. Canard solutions are exceptional trajectories that pass from attracting to repelling slow manifolds. It is known that these solutions separate invariant or locally invariant regions of different dynamic behavior. For his reason canard solutions provide the key to understanding certain types of complex oscillatory and/or chaotic dynamics. The goal of the project is to understand the dynamics related to the presence of canard solutions. The methods that will be used in the analysis are based on geometric theory of dynamical systems augmented by a desingularization procedure from algebraic geometry known as the blow-up method. The need for desingularization is explained by the fact that canards pass through regions where the slow dynamics is not hyperbolic. An efficient approach is to break up the analysis into local, near the points of non-hyperbolicity, and global, where standard methods (Fenichel theory) apply.<br/><br/>Slow/fast dynamics are observed in the context of a number of natural phenomena. For example, in the context of the firing of a neuron, the membrane potential is a fast varying variable, while some of the other variables, related to the concentration of some of the ions, like potassium, vary slowly. For a simple oscillator (cell) consisting of one fast variable and one slow variable there are two basic types of oscillations: small oscillations, which correspond to uniformly slow motions small in amplitude, and relaxation oscillations, which are a combination of a slow evolution and fast jumps. Systems with many interacting separate components are often modeled as coupled cells, with each component modeled by a simple cell (oscillator) and the interaction between cells modeled by appropriate coupling terms. Such models arise in a large variety of applications, including biotechnology, chemical engineering, and neurobiology. One of the fundamental issues in the analysis of such systems is to understand the patterns of oscillation. Interesting examples of such patterns are mixed mode oscillations, which correspond to switching between small oscillations and relaxation oscillations, localized solutions, which occur when a cluster of cells performs relaxation oscillations while the remaining cells perform small oscillations, and multi-periodic solutions, for which the frequency of the oscillation of some of the cells is a fraction of the frequency of the oscillation of the other cells. The goal of this project is to obtain a better understanding of the patterns of oscillation and possibly of more complicated dynamics by using the structure provided by the existence of exceptional solutions, called canard solutions, which occur on the boundaries of regions corresponding to different dynamic behaviors."
