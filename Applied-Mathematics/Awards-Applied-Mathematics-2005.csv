Examples of such phenomena are<br/>fluid mechanics, meteorology, reactive flows, multi-component flows, <br/>image processing, financial and biological modeling and others.<br/>Computing the solutions to these equations remains an important and <br/>challenging problem that requires development of fast, reliable and <br/>accurate numerical methods. At the same time, understanding <br/>the analytical properties of their solutions is not only useful <br/>for developing fast solvers, but remains imperative for real world<br/>applications. <br/><br/>On the analytic side, we propose to utilize techniques from approximation <br/>theory and Harmonic Analysis to prove  analytical results for nonlinear <br/>equations and to use these techniques to develop numerical methods.<br/>The   techniques to be employed include Littlewood-Paley theory, wavelet <br/>decompositions, maximal functions, interpolation and K-functionals. <br/>Emphasis will be placed on the understanding the relation between micro- <br/>and macroscopic models for transport, where a main vehicle in moving from <br/>the micro to the macro level are averaging lemmas.<br/>On the numerical side, the project aims to  further develop the Godunov <br/>type central schemes for multidimensional systems of conservation <br/>laws and related problems. These schemes do not employ Riemann problem <br/>solvers and characteristic decomposition. Their high resolution and <br/>simplicity turns them into a universal tool for solving a wide range of <br/>problems. The application of these schemes to multi-phase and multi-fluid <br/>flow models, the Saint-Venant systems of shallow water equations, <br/>multi-layer shallow water systems, shallow water equations on a rotating<br/>sphere, granular material flows is another goal of the proposed <br/>research, which requires further development of central schemes and <br/>incorporation of various adaptive techniques into the central framework.<br/>"

The array of applications ranges from light pulse propagation in <br/>optical fibers and nonlinear waveguides to stabilization of <br/>spatio-temporal solitons, both for deterministic systems and systems <br/>with a stochastic component. Depending on the particular application, <br/>the relevant mathematical models are nonlinear partial <br/>differential equations, integral equations, or discrete equations. <br/>The core mathematical issues are fundamental <br/>understanding of asymptotic theories, both analytically and <br/>numerically, well posedness or blow up for the modeling equations, and <br/>the search for solitary wave solutions via direct methods of calculus <br/>of variations. This project focuses on three major applications in <br/>nonlinear optics: systems with randomness, discrete systems, and <br/>generalized dispersion managed systems. Randomness arises <br/>ubiquitously in nonlinear optics and an important goal of this project <br/>is to study noise models that are physically relevant and analyzable <br/>in a rigorous probabilistic sense. Such models have already yielded <br/>new types of fundamental solitons and their study may help engineers <br/>to design optical devices whose performance is actually enhanced by <br/>small amounts of randomness. Discrete equations arise in many <br/>important contexts, including the study of nonlinear waveguides, <br/>all-optical switches, and Bose-Einstein condensates. Discrete models <br/>have very different properties than those of their continuous <br/>counterparts, and though regularity of solutions in the spatial <br/>variable is no longer an issue, the lack of scaling invariances in <br/>general makes their analysis more difficult. Thus discrete problems <br/>invite the development of new analytical tools which ultimately will <br/>help explain experimental observations. Finally, the P.I. will study <br/>generalized dispersion managed systems. The technique of dispersion <br/>management has been instrumental in enabling higher bit rate <br/>communications and has provided the impetus for many interesting <br/>mathematical investigations. The approximate models that arise have a <br/>nonlocal nonlinearity which presents interesting mathematical and <br/>numerical challenges. Often the nonlocality in the modeling equation <br/>reflects a stabilizing effect in the original physical system, and an <br/>important recurring question is how to exploit the nonlocal structure <br/>in order to help explain the observed stabilization. The P.I. will <br/>examine the application of dispersion management technology in <br/>contexts other than fiber optic communications, such as the search for <br/>spatio-temporal solitons, where the P.I. expects to obtain new <br/>information on it's possible stabilizing effects. <br/><br/>Fundamental mathematical understanding of nonlinear optical <br/>systems is central to the development of technologies that will be able to <br/>support the ever increasing demands of future Internet expansion. Fast, <br/>stable data transmission is critically important to a wide array of <br/>sectors of national interest, ranging from banking, the stock exchange, <br/>and insurance to health services, transportation, and homeland security. <br/>The information gleaned through the proposed research will aid in the <br/>design and implementation of novel optical systems that will help meet the <br/>growing need for bandwidth. <br/><br/>"

This research training grant will facilitate training of a full spectrum of students (undergraduates, graduates, and post-graduates) to work at the interface of experimental and theoretical science in research focused upon discovering new fluid phenomena through laboratory experiments, and the development of mathematical theory for better predicting these new phenomena.  The training provided will prepare future mathematical scientists to engage directly with experimentalists in the area of biological and environmental fluid dynamics crucial to understanding how we interact with our environment on a wide range of spatio-temporal scales.  The trainees will be developed into true interdisciplinary mathematical scientists with expertise in both mathematical technique and experimental laboratory method.  The experimental fluid phenomena studied in the UNC fluid dynamics laboratories housed in the Mathematics and Physics departments will be the focus of a uniformly balanced research approach which will bring together new experiments and new mathematical (theoretical and computational) predictions to better our understanding of fluid phenomena in nature.<br/><br/>The specific focus will be upon two different experimental regimes of micro-fluidic transport phenomena (directly relevant to muco-ciliary transport in the lung), and of laboratory-scale stratified fluid phenomena (directly relevant to mixing in the atmosphere and oceans).  Through a combination of a structured advising system (with 8 mathematics and 1 physics faculty advisors), rotations through the involved laboratories, regular group meetings, and a modified course of study, this RTG grant will develop a new generation of mathematical scientists prepared with the necessary tools to effectively work on truly interdisciplinary science."

In particular, an important basic problem is the determination of how many periodic orbits a dynamical system has, or, equivalently, the ""probability"" that a given initial condition leads to a periodic orbit.  In many classical systems, such as billiards, it is conjectured that the probability that an orbit is periodic is zero.  Surprisingly, this classical mechanics problem is also related to the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues in the corresponding Helmholtz problem.  The structure of the set of periodic orbits also plays important role in the study of quantum chaos and in physics of microcavities.  For example, some special sets of periodic orbits support quasimodes, which have been used in microlasers.<br/><br/>We expect the results of this research to help elucidate the general understanding of the structure of periodic orbits in Hamiltonian systems.  The proposed research will help physicists working on spectral problems and on the physics of microlasers, which have important applications in materials science and medicine.

One goal<br/>is to determine the conditions that enhance the combined effects<br/>of the soft-elasticity modes of elastomers and their ferroelectric<br/>response by application of external electric fields.  In these<br/>studies the investigators combine mathematical analysis, modeling,<br/>computer simulations, physical experiments, and application of the<br/>three-dimensional visualization techniques.  These mathematical<br/>problems are analytically modeled by highly nonlinear elliptic,<br/>parabolic, mixed hyperbolic-parabolic and stochastic systems of<br/>partial differential equations, including the equations of<br/>nonlinear elasticity, viscoelastic flow, and Maxwell's equations<br/>of electrodynamics.  Partial differential equation methods for<br/>phase transitions, modeling, and numerical tools such as spectral<br/>methods and adaptivity to simulate the solutions are among the<br/>techniques employed. <br/><br/>     The project is a comprehensive effort towards modeling and<br/>development of soft matter actuator and sensor devices used in a<br/>vast array of applications, including ultra-fast optic and video<br/>switching, artificial muscles, biological membranes, and<br/>filaments.  Increase of switching speeds and size reduction of the<br/>device are two relevant technological goals at the heart of the<br/>investigation.  One type of materials to investigate, liquid<br/>crystal elastomers, can be thought of as rubber networks that<br/>require very little energy to be deformed along special<br/>directions.  This property, coupled with the efficient response of<br/>the material to electric fields, may offer optimal ingredients for<br/>developing high speed devices able to provide very large<br/>mechanical deformations with the application of electric or<br/>magnetic fields of small magnitude.  These are highly desirable<br/>properties, for instance, in the design of artificial muscles for<br/>robots.  The investigators carry out the studies by combining<br/>mathematical analysis, computer simulations, and physical<br/>experiments.  Use of three-dimensional visualization techniques is<br/>important in both conducting the work and disseminating the<br/>results.  Many of the problems present modeling challenges that<br/>call for a synergistic effort of mathematicians and physicists.  A<br/>central principle in this endeavor is close cross-disciplinary<br/>interaction among the applied and numerical analysts and the<br/>physicists of the group.  A major component of the project is the<br/>interdisciplinary training of post-docs and graduate students,<br/>including the organization of a summer school, development of new<br/>courses, and summer research opportunities for undergraduate<br/>students.  Interdisciplinary conferences, group workshops, and<br/>seminars devoted to the FRG project at each institution are also<br/>planned."

Tight, well-localized spherical frames are a newly discovered tool for dealing with scattered data on spheres, and are similar to frames used in connection with wavelet analysis.

Under these constraints, achieving robustness of global stability is hard because the ship often is underactuated, and is highly non-linear.  The lack of the separation principle, the general nonlinear observer design, and general robustification tools make this problem challenging.  To make advances on this issue, we will use  analytical techniques from ordinary and partial differential equations, together with recent results in nonholonomic mechanics and nonlinear control.

This is a fundamental scientific problem in which both nanoscale and macroscale effects are important.  The resulting film morphology is determined by a complex interaction between thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In addition, epitaxial growth techniques have been used to create novel materials which contain quantum dots (nanometer sized collections of atoms embedded in a matrix of different species of atoms).  The resulting material has unique electronic properties.  For example, solid-state lasers have been made out of such materials. In addition, there is hope that such materials may be useful in quantum computing applications.  Modeling the growth of such a material is still in its infancy.<br/><br/>The purpose of this proposal is to develop efficient algorithms for the simulation of epitaxial growth using a computer. The proposal will focus on atomistic models rather than continuous ones since they naturally include nanoscale physical effects such as nucleation and fluctuations.  In particular, kinetic Monte Carlo models will be used, in which simple rules for atom motion are evolved in stochastic fashion. The proposal aims at devising efficient computational methods to simulate such models. Our computational strategy is based on coarse-graining both in time and space, taking special care to preserve physical fidelity.  Preliminary results indicate that our algorithms are 5 to 10 times faster than the current state-of-the-art.

Here stability generally refers to the ability of a system to return to steady state after receiving an impulse, e.g., the ability of a structure to stop vibrating after an earthquake.  The term ""robust stability"" refers to notions of stability that attempt to balance the transient stability of a system with its asymptotic stability.  The asymptotic stability of a linear system has a well-established relationship to the eigenvalues of the underlying system.  However, it has long been recognized in linear dynamics that when the associated linear transformation is highly non-normal the eigenvalues give little or no information about the transient behavior of the system.  This transient behavior can be quite unacceptable from the perspective of engineering design and control.  This has given rise to the modern focus on transient stability, which generally refers to such properties as bounded transient peaks and/or bounded transient growth/decay rates.  The PI and his collaborators have already established a rich foundation of techniques, results, and numerical tools for further progress in this research.  They propose to continue this work and to provide efficient numerical tools for engineering design and control practitioners."

The initial empirical verification was made for the occurrence of rainfall along the Nile River. Subsequent empirical verifications have been made for economic data (e.g. stock prices), telecommunications (e.g. ATM traffic), and medicine (e.g. the occurrence of epileptic seizures). In this project a stochastic calculus for fractional Brownian motion with H in (1/2, 1) is used to investigate the solutions of stochastic differential equations with a fractional Brownian motion.  Physical phenomena are often modeled by stochastic differential equations. Bilinear stochastic differential equations have been used extensively in modeling so the solutions of finite dimensional bilinear equations with a fractional Brownian motion will be investigated to determine explicit solutions in a variety of cases with noncommuting linear operators appearing in the equations by using a stochastic calculus and some Lie theoretic methods. Furthermore, bilinear stochastic differential equations in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space will be investigated because they serve as models for some important stochastic partial differential equations. Parameter identification for stochastic systems is a basic component of the modeling problem. For linear stochastic differential equations with a fractional Brownian motion, a weighted pseudo least squares method for estimation will be investigated to verify the convergence of the family of estimators. The effect of time discretizations of the continuous time least squares estimation algorithm for the parameters of a linear stochastic system is important because typically the observations of the system state are sampled. This effect will be investigated for linear systems with a fractional Brownian motion to determine if biases persist as the sampling intervals approach zero. The determination and the application of the question of absolute continuity for the measure of a fractional Brownian motion will be addressed by a method of martingales that are obtained as stochastic integrals of a fractional Brownian motion. The Radon-Nikodym derivative for this absolute continuity will be applied to problems of stochastic control, filtering, and the calculation of mutual information.<br/><br/>Stochastic models provide useful descriptions of physical phenomena.

Stochastic differential equations with a fractional Brownian motion that are formally differential equations with an additive fractional Brownian motion, are an important class of stochastic models for physical phenomena. Some collections of these stochastic differential equations will be investigated. The estimation of parameters of a stochastic model will be investigated because of its importance for modeling.

The project contains four components related to these spaces: their geometric analysis, the development of appropriate statistical methods, the required numerical analysis, and the application of the results to medical imaging and computational anatomy. The general framework is addressed by a new approach which in some sense formalizes the mechanics of shapes. Lie groups with right invariant metrics indeed are structures on which classical laws of mechanics can be shown to hold, and in particular the conservation of momentum along paths of minimal energy. It turns out that this momentum is a key to the representation and characterization of deformations in this context. It is albeit difficult to handle, because it is usually singular, as a measure, or a distribution on a singular support. This and the numerical difficulty it creates is probably one of the main challenges that we address in our study. Other important aspects are the study of the geometry such an approach induces on shape spaces, including a study of their curvatures, and the existence and stability of normal coordinates. This will be related to open issues in shape statistics, and applied in particular to biomedical imaging problems. <br/><br/>This approach is therefore designed to provide new tools for describing and analyzing shapes. Although shapes are prevalent in the outside world and in science, this is a difficult problem. For the human mind, there is an intuitive notion of what shapes are, why they differ or look alike, or when they present abnormalities with respect to ordinary observations. Sculpture is the art of rendering existing shapes, or creating new ones, and the fact that artists are still able to provide unambiguous instances of subjects through distorted or schematic representations is a strong indication of the robustness of the human shape recognition engine. However, an analytical description of a shape is much less obvious, and humans are much less efficient for this task, as if the understanding and recognition of forms work without an accurate extraction of their constituting components. We can recognize a squash from an eggplant or a pepper via a simple outline, and even provide a series of discriminative features which distinguish them, but it is much harder to phrase a verbal description of any of them, accurate enough, say for a painter to reproduce it. It is therefore not surprising that, for mathematics, shape description remains mostly a challenge. There are however very important applications which depend on progresses made in this field, one of them being the computerized analysis of biomedical shapes (computational anatomy), which analyzes the impact of diseases on shapes of organs, obtained from modern techniques of non-invasive 3D imagery. The last fifty years of research in computer vision has shown a amazingly large variety of points of view and techniques designed for this purpose: 2D or 3D sets they delineate (via either volume or boundary), moment-based features, medial axes or surfaces, null sets of polynomials, configurations of points of interest (landmarks), to name but a few. Yet, it does not seem that any of these methods has emerged as ideal, neither conceptually nor computationally, for describing shapes. An important aspect of our study will be to describe shapes with an indirect approach, from the way they can be deformed. This is not a new idea, and can be traced back to the seminal works of D'Arcy Thompson at the beginning of the 20th century, but its mathematical formalization and the design of practical algorithms is a comprehensive task, still offering many open problems, that the present group will try to address and convey to the scientific community."

Changes of the genus of this surface correspond to phase transitions in the evolution of our initial data. The pure radiational case was <br/>studied completely in the joint work with Venakides and Zhou. Here we propose to study <br/>phase transitions in the most difficult case that includes both solitons and radiation. <br/>B) It has been recently proved (Tovbis, Pelinovsky) that persistence of homoclinic/heteroclinic <br/>solutions to singularly perturbed 5th Kortveg - de Vries (KdV) equation can be expressed in terms of the Stokes' constants of certain (leading order) rescaled system. The proposed <br/>goal is to develop the corresponding technique to other types of solutions and <br/>systems, including stationary and moving travelling waves on lattices for NLS <br/>and other models. <br/><br/>It is well known that only a tiny portion of nonlinear systems used to model real world problems <br/>allows for explicit form mathematical solutions, leaving approximate methods <br/>and computer simulations to be the most used tools. Asymptotic methods play a prominent <br/>role among approximate methods, as it is often easier to study a system in some <br/>asymptotic limit (say, infinite time) and then to allow some ``small"" corrections for large <br/>but finite values of time. This approach was used for centures, for example, in celestian mechanics. However, ``small"" corrections are not necessarily small if the original and the limiting <br/>systems exibit qualitatively different behavior. For example, a weakly coupled system <br/>of 2nd order nonlinear oscillators generically has a chaotic behavior whereas the limiting system <br/>of uncoupled oscillators has no chaos. Such systems, called singularly perturbed, are the <br/>most difficult subject in the asymptotic analysis. The current proposal is focused on <br/>two still developing methods for singularly perturbed nonlinear problems: the method of <br/>RHP and of asymptotics beyond all orders. The first method will be used to find small dispersion limit of the focusing NLS - the problem that was open for many years. The NLS is the most frequently used model for nonlinear waves phenomena in physics, engineering, etc. The second method will be used to find when travelling waves solutions to KdV, NLS and some other integrable models survive singular perturbations, including discretizations. Solitons and travelling waves on lattices (discretized models) are rapidly becoming a very important topic, for example, in fiber optics (including periodic optical structures), design of computational numerical methods, etc."

In particular, it is to develop new analytical paradigms for solving nonlinear problems.  This research will  develop an Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) for general initial value problems of the Camassa-Holm and related equations.  Current techniques only allow one to treat a limited class of initial value problems.  For the Camassa-Holm Equation, which is an important limit of a class of hydrodynamical problems, only positive potentials can be treated.  However, the prediction of the evolution involving negative potentials are also quite important.  Such potentials are known to model wave-breaking.  This research will expand the power of the IST method to those cases where the potential could be negative and/or positive in any region.  The techniques developed by this research are important because they then could be applied to other important and related, but more complex systems.  One related and important nonlinear optical system is called ""Degenerate Two-Photon Propagation"", which is a very fast nonlinear interaction, by which one can generate intense second harmonic radiation from a laser beam.  The latter system has potential applications to future nonlinear optical systems, including optical logic circuits and switches.  This award will also support nonlinear wave research for finding methods and means for modeling nonintegrable physical systems which do contain solitary waves.  <br/> <br/>This award is to support research to extend our mathematical methods into physical regimes which have remained unsolvable. It will center on a solution method for an equation which describes how the surface of shallow water behaves when disturbed.  The reason for the choice of this equation is not necessarily just for increasing our understanding of surface water waves, although that will occur.  Rather, the choice is made because this equation is relatively simple in its structure, and furthermore, is at the central core of a class of important physical systems.  Developing methods for solving this core system will allow one to immediately apply the same techniques to these other systems.  One of these systems, mentioned above, is from optical physics.  Another such system is also found in optical physics, but also occurs in other areas of physics as well.  It is an interaction whereby a laser beam, propagating in a medium or a plasma, can go unstable, or could stabilize.  As a product of this research, we would then have methods for predicting when and how the above mentioned interaction would produce a stability or an instability.  The results from these proposed research topics will have a broader impact than simply the mathematics that are proposed. They will expand the physical systems that can be studied mathematically, will provide new areas for mathematical research, and will further the understanding of the physics behind the physical systems so studied.  <br/>"

In addition to algorithm development, the PI plans to perform theoretical analysis of the algorithms. As opposed to the Radon transform, inversion of the cone beam transform in the three dimensional Euclidean space is a complicated problem. Not much is known about the properties of exact inversion algorithms. Do they generalize to distributions? What is the stability of reconstruction in the scale of Sobolev spaces? What are possible artifacts in the case of non-perfect data? These are some of the questions that the PI plans to address. <br/><br/>The proposed research is of practical significance, because the cone beam transform is a theoretical foundation of computer tomography (CT). The main principle of CT is based on transmitting a cone beam of x-rays through the patient from various directions. This is achieved by moving the x-ray source along a predetermined trajectory. For each source position a detector measures the intensity of the beam as it exits the patient. Then the data are inverted according to a mathematical algorithm. CT scans can be performed using a gantry or a C-arm. The circle-and-arc trajectory may arise when the scanner is a portable C-arm. There is a significant need for volumetric visualization using portable C-arms. The prime application is for image-guided interventional procedures requiring intraoperative imaging, in which moving the patient is to be avoided. The advantage of portable C-arms is that they can be moved into the room where the patient is undergoing the procedure. Saddle trajectories may be of interest for cardiac imaging. The theoretical component of the proposed research will result in a deeper understanding of cone beam transform inversion for general trajectories. <br/><br/>"

Our results will also impact developments in the area of point-of-care diagnostics, where medical doctors will be able to perform a simple check based on the ""cheek swab"" that can tell them whether to administer an antibiotic (and which one, at that) or not in the matter of minutes.  The broader impact of the proposed project includes interdisciplinary education of the members of the group.  We are planning several educational activities where some of the biotechnology issues that we study will be popularized for K-8 and high-school level students in the region.<br/>"

Cellular phones and compact discs are ubiquitous examples of the need to handle information accurately, efficiently, and robustly.  This research addresses these three criteria by introducing finite frames and coarse quantization ideas (providing redundancy and precision, respectively) so that together they minimize information loss in the case of noisy environments and machine imperfections, as well as ensuring numerical stability.  The combination of frames and coarse quantization, as envisioned in this research, will generally produce small energy error differences between given signals and their quantized versions, which are constructed by higher order Sigma-Delta recursion schemes.  The exceptions to the proposed general theory lead to a host of arithmetic-geometric problems.  The technology for the theory requires a careful study of invariant sets closely connected with delicate tilings of Euclidean space.  The first order Sigma-Delta analysis by the researchers proves its superiority over pulse code modulation methods for many applications.  Further, the error estimates arising in this research will be analyzed in the case of the multidimensional discrete Fourier transform, which is a workhorse in any spectral analysis.  In this setting, number theoretic problems, associated with residue number system processors, arise.<br/> <br/>A major goal of this research is to develop algorithms that provide reliable transmission of data over so-called erasure channels such as the internet.  The methods that we are developing will also be used for multiple antenna code design that will guarantee clear, steady reception of messages in mobile wireless communications.  Further, our proposed finite frame Sigma-Delta quantization methodology is a natural component in the emerging multifunction environment technology associated with the unified treatment of radar and communications.  A natural application is to reduce a ship's signature in a hostile environment.  Other applications of the methods to be developed, especially for the research dealing directly with finite frames, are of a geometric and number theoretic nature.  For example, the vertices of the Platonic solids are finite frames with very desirable properties associated with sphere packing problems and spherical codes.<br/>"

In particular, a method based on<br/>spectral theory and analytic continuation has been developed to<br/>obtain rigorous bounds on the effective complex permittivity in<br/>the quasistatic limit.  More recently, this approach has led to<br/>the finding that the effective transport properties of<br/>two-component media share the same analytic properties as the<br/>order parameters in statistical mechanics, such as the<br/>magnetization in an Ising model.  These powerful relations have<br/>only been exploited in the static case and raise many important<br/>questions, yet the ideas of statistical mechanics form a natural<br/>framework for analyzing critical behavior of wave phenomena as<br/>well.

Until now, simultaneous all-optical regeneration of many wavelength-division multiplexed channels has remained a formidable challenge, because the operation of all-optical regenerators fundamentally relies on strong nonlinear optical effects that lead to debilitating interaction among the channels. In the proposed multi-channel regenerator, we employ a dispersion map that combines sections of high-normal-dispersion nonlinear fiber and dispersion compensators with a spectrally periodic group delay. Such a map reduces the detrimental inter-channel nonlinear interaction while maintaining the intensity of the beneficial intra-channel effects at a proper level. From the mathematical standpoint, the proposed device requires the development of a novel theory of the intense pulse propagation in a modulationally stable fiber with periodic dispersion compensation. This propagation occurs in a parameter regime that is different from the well-researched regimes of both the intense pulse propagation in fibers with small constant dispersion and the dispersion-managed soliton propagation in ransmission systems. Our theoretical results will assist in designing an experimental device prototype.<br/><br/>The realization of the proposed multi-channel 2R regenerator will enable elimination of a large number of expensive optical-to-electrical-to-optical converters employed in modern fiber-optical communication networks.

As such, the rigorous study of these systems is warranted.  Due to their intrinsically nonsmooth characteristics, such a study defies classical dynamical systems theory and requires novel mathematical analysis, computational and design tools.  This proposed project is devoted to the investigation of challenging issues in the analysis and control of complementarity systems.

On the analytical side, we will address several fundamental and critical issues of system behavior, e.g., existence and uniqueness of solutions and Zeno property, which are directly related to numerical computation and system analysis.  Moreover, we aim at studying controllability and observability and developing control algorithms that will be applied to robot motion planning, multi-body systems subject to unilateral constraints, and constrained dynamic optimization problems.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems modeled by ODEs provide a powerful mathematical and computational framework for the study and understanding of a wide range of time-dependent physical phenomena that naturally occur in many engineering applications.  As the application areas expand, researchers and designers are encountering increasingly complex systems subject to various constraints, which arise as a result of the global behavior of the systems and the interactions between them and their complex environment and/or other systems at different levels.  A trivial example of such constraints is a falling object before and after hitting the ground.  At the instant where the object touches the ground, an impact occurs followed by a rebounce of the object that results in a change of direction of the object's motion.  This is a mode transition.  The proposed research aims at treating dynamical systems where mode transition is an unknown but important component of the overall system configuration.  If successful, the results of the research will let us gain a better understanding of many complex engineering systems with mode changes and will provide a solid foundation for the improved design of such systems that in turn will have a significant impact on many practical fields.

These methods have subsequently been<br/>significantly refined and stabilized by Reitich and the PI for the BVP<br/>of computing Dirichlet-Neumann operators, and approximating scattering<br/>configurations.  Among these refinements, the PI & Reitich developed<br/>the method of ""Transformed Field Expansions"" (TFE) which enables the<br/>reliable, high-order, stable perturbative computation of BVP and FBP.<br/>While this method is extremely successful in resolving simulations<br/>well outside the reach of competing methods, it is somewhat<br/>disadvantaged in terms of computational complexity in comparison to<br/>other techniques (e.g. boundary integrals/elements).  A final project<br/>that the PI proposes is the investigation of two refinements of this<br/>TFE approach to increase its efficiency.<br/><br/>Fixed and free boundary problems arise in all areas of engineering and<br/>the sciences.  Two particular instances of relevance in this proposal<br/>are the classic free boundary problem of the motion of surface waves<br/>on a large body of water (e.g. a lake, sea, or ocean), and the fixed<br/>boundary problem of scattering of electromagnetic or acoustic waves<br/>from an irregular surface.  The accurate and reliable simulation of<br/>surface waves is used not only to model the capabilities of open-ocean<br/>structures (e.g. oil platforms), but also in the study of transport of<br/>pollutants and other substances of environmental interest across<br/>lakes, seas, and oceans.  Applications of electromagnetic and acoustic<br/>scattering come in problems of radar, imaging, and sensing to name<br/>just a few.  Many numerical techniques are available for the<br/>simulation of these problems and one of the goals of this proposal is<br/>the utilization and improvement of a class of techniques discovered<br/>and refined by the Principal Investigator (PI) and collaborators.  In<br/>particular, when the problems mentioned above are simulated in full<br/>three dimensions, the computations become quite intensive and the<br/>issues truly become those of high-performance computing.<br/><br/>"

Using recently developed techniques based on geometric mechanics (especially the use of reduction theory and shape space dynamics), together with a detailed knowledge of the dynamics (especially normal form theory and invariant manifold tubes), as well as Monte Carlo sampling methods (for computing volumes of intersecting reaction entrance and exit regions in phase space), this problem will be solved first for relatively simple molecules undergoing isomerization and then progressing to more complex situations. <br/><br/>This research contributes to one of the grand challenges of the mathematical and computational sciences -- namely the ability to accurately compute from first principles (that is, using so-called ab initio calculations) important molecular processes such as chemical reaction rates and the dynamical behavior of biomolecules. The specific advances that make this possible are recent developments in computational techniques for dynamical systems as well as improved understanding of the complex geometry of the exit and entrance channels (or tubes) that govern reactions and conformation changes. These are fundamental advances that, when combined with dimension and model reduction techniques, will provide a powerful tool for the study of more complex molecular systems.<br/>"

The technical <br/>difficulty of using sound or electromagnetic waves in sensing micro- or <br/>nano-structured media is the complexity and fine scale of <br/>the microgeometry. The length of the <br/>applied sound waves is much larger than the variations of the <br/>microstructure, so that only an effective or homogenized response of the  <br/>structure is present in measured data. The proposed ""inverse <br/>homogenization"" method derives microstructural parameters from effective <br/>measurements. The method is based on the Stieltjes analytic representation <br/>of the effective properties of a randomly microstructured medium, and a <br/>possibility to reconstruct the spectral function in this representation <br/>from the effective response of the homogenized material. The approach ties <br/>together properties of the medium<br/>on different scales: Complex permittivity on the coarse scale provides data <br/>for microscale inversion.

The <br/>problem is to find a composite material's structure from its known <br/>response to the applied acoustic or electromagnetic field. When the <br/>wavelength of the applied field is much larger than the microstructural <br/>scale, then fine scale features of the structure cannot be resolved, and <br/>the microgeometry is  homogenized.

Specifically, the problems under consideration are i) utility-indifference valuation of default risk; ii) design of instruments to optimally enhance credit worthiness; iii) asymptotic analysis of stochastic intensity models to study the time-scale content of corporate yield spreads; iv) computational issues related to the analysis of correlation between defaults across firms, modeled as large systems in interaction.  The first part involves stochastic control problems related to random intensity models and infinite dimensional interest rate models. The second also overlaps and involves filtering of partially observed systems.  The third uses singular and regular perturbation techniques for the class of interacting potential partial differential equations arising in this context, and the fourth uses interacting particle systems to compute probabilities which are sensitive to correlation of defaults, as well as Monte Carlo computations designed for the analysis of rare events.  The intellectual merit of this project is in developing applicable scientific tools to address the particular class of optimization, design, calibration and computation issues which are essential for managing default risk.<br/><br/>Defaultable instruments, or credit-linked derivatives, are financial securities that pay their holders amounts that are contingent on the occurrence (or not) of a default event such as the bankruptcy of a firm (or a country or municipality), non-repayment of a loan or missing a mortgage payment.  The market in credit-linked derivative products has grown more than seven-fold in recent years, from $170 billion outstanding notional in 1997, to almost $1400 billion through 2001.  These instruments raise new challenges in modeling, analysis, computation and estimation, some of which we propose to study here by bringing together a Focused Research Group with expertise in applied mathematics, stochastic processes and computational statistics.  The broader impact of the project is in deeper understanding of credit risks, which affect people from large commercial institutions to individuals with pension funds and mortgages, and designing and correctly valuing instruments to control for it.  The project is also strongly geared towards training of five graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, who will benefit enormously from interaction with all parts of the broad-based group through many meetings, and in particular a large international conference on the research area at the end of the three years.  The experience gained by the PI's will be reflected in their teaching of specialist graduate and undergraduate classes, and advising Senior Thesis projects in this field.  As well as the closing conference, the results of the work will be disseminated through academic and industry meetings, classes and articles written for peer-reviewed journals.<br/><br/>"

These mathematical<br/>phenomena are proved to be the reasons behind self-organization<br/>and pattern formation.  The investigator finds effective reduction<br/>methods that accurately simplify the original infinite-dimensional<br/>problems to manageable finite-dimensional ones.  The investigator<br/>also studies the dynamic phenomenon of pattern nucleation in<br/>materials by finding and characterizing some unstable solutions to<br/>the Euler-Lagrange equations of the free energy. The project<br/>expands our knowledge of singularly perturbed variational<br/>problems.  It enhances classical theories such as Gamma<br/>convergence.<br/><br/>     Complex materials, such as block copolymers, are used<br/>everywhere. The polyurethane foams used in upholstery and bedding<br/>are composed of multi-block copolymers known as thermoplastic<br/>elastomers that combine high temperature resilience and low<br/>temperature flexibility. Common box tapes use triblock copolymers<br/>to achieve pressure-sensitive adhesion. Block copolymers are<br/>blended with asphalt in road construction to reduce pavement<br/>cracking and rutting at low and high temperature extremes. This<br/>project seeks to deepen our understanding of the mathematical<br/>theories underlying these systems.  It produces effective methods<br/>that characterize and predict the mechanical, optical, electrical,<br/>ionic, barrier, and other physical properties of these materials. <br/>They help today's synthetic chemistry technologies to produce<br/>exquisitely structured materials to meet an ever rising demand<br/>from civil infrastructure and manufacturing."

The inclusion of random effects can serve a number of distinct purposes. On one hand, randomness can be used to compensate for elements of a system not fully modeled or for insufficiently resolved scales in the system. This research proposal concentrates on the analysis of how randomness spreads through large dimensional, extended dynamical systems.  One of the central questions is how passing through many nonlinear interactions or scales shapes the randomness. Stochastically forced partial differential equations (SPDEs) such as stochastic fluid equations or stochastically forced reaction diffusion equations will be a focus of the proposed work. These systems are often agitated at one scale and it is of both mathematical and modeling interest to understand the effect of this agitation at other scales. In particular, this proposal hopes to shed light on the transfer of randomness between different scales in turbulent fluid flow. In addition to SPDEs, the proposal will study related questions in large chemical networks arising in cell regulation and nutrient flow in forest environments. The emphasis will be on the pathwise dynamics, novel stochastic numerical methods, and estimation problems.<br/><br/>Quantifying and modeling uncertainty is increasingly important in our attempts to understand and predict our complex and changing world.  From the financial markets, to weather prediction, to environmental engendering, to neuroscience, to aeronautics, models including random influences have become central to the physical sciences, to the social sciences and to engineering.  Of particular significance is understanding how pure randomness is shaped into the structures we observe, especially when the randomness is transferred across disparate spatial scales. This understanding is the key to producing effective models with which to predict complex real systems. This proposal specifically addresses questions central to turbulent water flow and complicated biochemical pathways in cells. More broadly, applied mathematicians are on the leading edge of<br/>our scientific and technological future.  Because of their broad training, they are the best equipped to move into new, non-traditional fields as they appear, build the bridges between classical disciplines, and disseminate the understanding gained in purer mathematical studies to larger scientific and social endeavors. America's leadership in science and technology requires us<br/>to continue producing world-class researchers and students in applied mathematics. This proposal includes an undergraduate research component to encourage interested students to choose a science-related career. It includes outreach to local high schools to expose students at an earlier age to modern mathematics and the myriad of career possibilities it presents.<br/>"

Damping can be achieved through various mechanical means, and for each of these, one seeks ways to distribute material properties to optimally stifle vibrations.  Yet optimality can be characterized in several ways, such as the total energy caused by a worst-case vibration, total energy averaged over all vibrations, and the asymptotic rate of energy decay.  Each of these different metrics requires different mathematical tools and computational techniques.  To address these problems, this project will draw upon, and augment, tools from mechanics, functional analysis, and numerical analysis.  The task of finding the best damping is a spectral optimization problem, which is particularly challenging because the mathematical models for these vibrating bodies are non-self-adjoint and have variable coefficients.  As such, they are representative of a broad class of important problems in application areas such as fluid dynamics, and thus insights gained from this work may suggest advances on a broad class of problems.  In addition to design optimization, this project will also develop techniques for characterizing the material properties of a body based on measurements of vibration.  Of particular interest are models comprising several one-dimensional entities vibrating together.  At the macroscopic level, such models describe violin strings composed of an elastic core enclosed in a dissipative sheath below an outer elastic winding, while at the microscopic level, similar models have been proposed to model DNA as two intertwined rods glued together elastically."

What is observed instead are surrogate measures called signals, which are used to characterize the probability distribution of the state variables.  Our project draws upon useful concepts developed for nonlinear filtering and stochastic control to group the problems into two classes.  In the first class, we find a finite-dimensional sufficient statistic whose evolution describes the system behavior completely for the purpose of obtaining an optimal solution.  Such cases occur for inventory models where the information about the inventory level is delayed, and only the conditional distribution of the inventory level, given the inventory level in an earlier period, is known.  In these cases, we show that a reference inventory position can be constructed as a sufficient statistic and that a base-stock policy in terms of this position is optimal.  In other words, there exists an order-up-to level such that it is optimal to order the difference when the reference position is below this level and not to order any when the reference position is above the level.  In the second class, no finite-dimensional statistic exists.  An example of the second class concerns lost sales, where the inventory level is fully observed only when it is zero.  Otherwise all we know is that the inventory level is positive. Thus, the signal at any time reveals whether the inventory is zero or positive.  When positive, only the conditional distribution of the inventory level given that it is positive is known.  Thus, one needs to work with the conditional probability, which in general is an infinite-dimensional entity. In addition, the conditional probability evolves in a highly nonlinear fashion.  We develop a weighting scheme--similar to the Zakai equation in the filtering literature--that converts the conditional probability into an unnormalized probability which evolves linearly.  The resulting linear system facilitates considerably our study of the inventory problem and the associated dynamic programming equations.  It enables us to obtain the existence of an optimal feedback inventory ordering policy and its characterization.  It helps in developing practical and approximate optimal policies as finite-dimensional functions, and procedures to compute them.  We also study inventory problems with important features, such as censored demand (only sales but not the full demand are observed), random spoilage, etc.  <br/><br/>We develop new approaches for the analysis of inventory control problems under partial observations in particular and of applications in broader management and engineering contexts with incomplete information in general.  Our multi-disciplinary project contributes to optimal decision making and risk management in a variety of systems with partial observations, such as those found in manufacturing, supply chains, machine maintenance, quality control and finance.  The partial observations in these systems are often associated with the inventory level, customer demand, machine-tool ware, production yield, and the parameters of the underlying distributions.  We should note that while a substantial literature exists in each of these domains, much of it assumes that the system states are completely observed.  Thus, the policies and procedures obtained in this project have the potential to improve the inventory control methodologies used in the industry, which would result in cost savings and better customer service.  The new understanding and mathematical methods that stem from our project should be valuable contributions to the operations research, management science and finance literatures, and should facilitate the use of such methods for many interesting problems in these areas."

Convection is a major feature of the dynamics of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the interiors of stars and planets.  It is also important in many industrial processes.  Nevertheless, the understanding of convection is fundamentally incomplete due to the extreme complexity of the problem.  Various simplifications are called for in order to make progress.  Here we consider situations that are of great importance in geophysical applications, and we derive and study simplified dynamics of heat convection.  The emergence of large-scale structures, such as the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, is a ubiquitous feature of geophysical fluid problems.  Understanding the mechanism of the emergence and persistence of such structures is one of the most intriguing issues in geophysical fluid dynamics.

Systems of equations based on the fundamental <br/>equations of physics are too complex to serve as a basis for numerical <br/>simulations. Hence the need of simple model systems. This project addresses the <br/>question of the validity of model systems describing laser-matter interactions, <br/>such as the Zakharov and the Davey-Stewartson models. b) Stability issues for reacting flows. The project will provide a simple mathematical description of one-dimensional instabilities occurring in reacting flows by studying bifurcations of simple model systems. Ultimately, the analysis will be carried out to the more complex framework of the reacting Navier-Stokes <br/>equations, where recent techniques using pointwise Green's functions bounds will <br/>have to be used. <br/><br/><br/>The motivation for these projects comes from actual experiments: large-scale <br/>experiments of high-energy lasers show important enerngy losses; detonation <br/>waves are seen to develop longitudinal instabilities. This project will <br/>contribute to a rigorous mathematical analysis of relevant model equations <br/>describing these phenomena.

The main feature of this new class of models is their ability to isolate and detect in natural scenes target objects that are obstructed by noise, textures, or other occluding objects, without generating erroneous or misleading features in the process.  The identification and/or development of false object boundaries has long been a challenge for edge-preserving image processing models; this project seeks to find a universal approach for solving this problem.  These new models are based on variational methods and partial differential equations.  The investigator will establish their mathematical validity, determine properties of their solutions, develop efficient and accurate numerical schemes for their implementation, and directly apply these models to solve critical problems in the sciences and engineering.<br/><br/>Through existing collaborations with researchers in medical imaging, materials science, geology, pharmaceuticals, and optical character recognition, the investigator and undergraduate students will use these new models to solve key issues in science and technology.  These problems include removing noise while isolating key medical features in highly degraded magnetic resonance images, identifying and analyzing the grain structure of nanoscale materials for optimizing high technology metals, and identifying land cover regions that are at high risk for hazards such as wildfires or flooding in remotely sensed images where the boundaries of these regions are obstructed by textures such as roads or topography.  Currently, the only reliable methods for treating each of these problems depend on hand-drawn object boundaries.  This is prohibitively time consuming on large data sets, so automating the boundary detection process will greatly enhance the state of the art.  False object detection can be devastating in any one of these applications, so existing automated methods cannot be directly applied.  This project seeks to find theoretically sound approaches that avoid this drawback while removing obstructions and accurately identifying target objects.<br/>"

The theme of the proposed research is a detailed<br/>examination of vortices generated in dispersive nonlinear media.<br/>The main focus is to extend and deepen the understanding of vortex<br/>structures, their existence and dynamical stability as well as their<br/>interactions and mesoscopic lattices in nonlinear media such as<br/>Bose-Einstein condensates and related fields (such as nonlinear optics).<br/>We propose to follow a step-by-step methodology in studying the<br/>generation, stability and dynamics of vortices in a progression of<br/>scenaria of increasing complexity, extending from single vortices, <br/>to few vortices, to vortex lattices. Specifically, we plan to study:<br/>(1) Vortex generation through dynamical instabilities and external<br/>manipulations such as phase imprinting and via instabilities driven by<br/>rapidly moving impurities (focused laser beams).<br/>(2) Dynamics and stability of single vortices (a.k.a. atoms) in the<br/>presence of external traps and manipulation of vortices by translating the<br/>external traps or by using localized optical ""tweezers"".<br/>(3) Interactions between vortices and formation, stability and dynamics<br/>of vortex dipoles (a.k.a. molecules/dipoles).<br/>(4) Finally, we intend to investigate, by cross-fertilizing ideas from<br/>material science, large arrays of vortices, their crystallization and<br/>structural phase transitions into regular vortex lattices (a.k.a. crystals).<br/><br/>In the 1920's Bose and Einstein predicted that a gas at low density and<br/>ultra-cold temperatures undergoes a transition towards what is nowadays<br/>called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The most important characteristic<br/>of a BEC is that all atoms occupy the same quantum state creating a macroscopic<br/>lump of coherent matter. BECs are to matter what laser is to light. BECs allow<br/>for direct manipulation and observation of quantum effects at the macroscopic<br/>level, providing ultimate control over matter. Since their recent<br/>experimental realization (for which the 2001 Physics Nobel prize was<br/>granted), BECs have been at the focus of an intensive and ever growing<br/>experimental and theoretical effort. Vortices are fundamental coherent,<br/>topologically charged, nonlinear excitations that emerge in BECs; but<br/>which also play a profound role in exciting and important fields such as<br/>superconductivity and superfluidity (which were the theme of the 2003<br/>Physics Nobel prize). Interestingly enough, they also arise in our daily<br/>life in the form of hydrodynamic vortices in water or in air. There are<br/>strong parallels (as well as differences) between such fluid vortices and<br/>these ultra-cold, superfluid vortices that we plan to examine and<br/>delineate. The outcome of this research will shed light into the pattern<br/>formation and interaction of such vortex structures in Bose-Einstein<br/>condensates. Since the underlying equation that describes the BECs also<br/>describes the behavior of coherent light embedded in a nonlinear<br/>material, the research hereby proposed will also be applicable to<br/>problems of optical waveguides and fiber bundles, photonic crystals, and<br/>light storage in optical traps, all of which are active research areas at<br/>the forefront of optical technologies.

Specifically, the problems under consideration are i) utility-indifference valuation of default risk; ii) design of instruments to optimally enhance credit worthiness; iii) asymptotic analysis of stochastic intensity models to study the time-scale content of corporate yield spreads; iv) computational issues related to the analysis of correlation between defaults across firms, modeled as large systems in interaction.  The first part involves stochastic control problems related to random intensity models and infinite dimensional interest rate models. The second also overlaps and involves filtering of partially observed systems.  The third uses singular and regular perturbation techniques for the class of interacting potential partial differential equations arising in this context, and the fourth uses interacting particle systems to compute probabilities which are sensitive to correlation of defaults, as well as Monte Carlo computations designed for the analysis of rare events.  The intellectual merit of this project is in developing applicable scientific tools to address the particular class of optimization, design, calibration and computation issues which are essential for managing default risk.<br/><br/>Defaultable instruments, or credit-linked derivatives, are financial securities that pay their holders amounts that are contingent on the occurrence (or not) of a default event such as the bankruptcy of a firm (or a country or municipality), non-repayment of a loan or missing a mortgage payment.  The market in credit-linked derivative products has grown more than seven-fold in recent years, from $170 billion outstanding notional in 1997, to almost $1400 billion through 2001.  These instruments raise new challenges in modeling, analysis, computation and estimation, some of which we propose to study here by bringing together a Focused Research Group with expertise in applied mathematics, stochastic processes and computational statistics.  The broader impact of the project is in deeper understanding of credit risks, which affect people from large commercial institutions to individuals with pension funds and mortgages, and designing and correctly valuing instruments to control for it.  The project is also strongly geared towards training of five graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, who will benefit enormously from interaction with all parts of the broad-based group through many meetings, and in particular a large international conference on the research area at the end of the three years.  The experience gained by the PI's will be reflected in their teaching of specialist graduate and undergraduate classes, and advising Senior Thesis projects in this field.  As well as the closing conference, the results of the work will be disseminated through academic and industry meetings, classes and articles written for peer-reviewed journals."

In addition an estimate of the time rate of growth<br/>of the maximum vorticity should be accessible.  The approach<br/>utilizes maximization of the growth of vorticity and a variational<br/>construction of an artificial structure (the ""cocoon"") near the<br/>vorticity maximum.   The second project concerns analysis together<br/>with numerical and physical experiments of modes of hovering in<br/>flapping flight.  An oscillating flow facility already in use<br/>provides the starting point for investigations of the vortical<br/>flow in the vicinity of small flapping hoverers.  The investigator<br/>and the research staff of the CIMS Applied Mathematics Laboratory<br/>develop analytical and numerical models for the study of hovering<br/>flight, motivated by the current interest in micro-aerodynamic<br/>vehicles.  <br/><br/>     The project deals with two related problems involving the<br/>difficult problem of analysis of three-dimensional fields of fluid<br/>motion and the complex eddying motions that occur in many<br/>important time-dependent flows.  The first problem that the<br/>investigator and his colleagues study is the theoretical question<br/>of ""blowup"" of solutions of Euler's equations, wherein the flow<br/>develops a rough or singular structure after a finite time. <br/>Although much effort has been devoted to trying to find such<br/>behavior in fluid flows, the question remains open.  The<br/>contention the investigator explores is that in fact for most<br/>flows, especially those for which the ""knottedness"" of the<br/>vorticity is sufficiently simple, blowup does not occur.  This<br/>regularity property of the flows can be established in some simple<br/>cases, and methods under development by the investigator promise<br/>to be applicable to a larger class, whose size needs to be<br/>determined.   The study has important implications for global<br/>analysis of Euler flows, and perhaps also for the numerical<br/>computation of these flows.  The second project is different in<br/>emphasis and brings into play a combination of analysis with<br/>numerical and physical experiments to study the hovering flight of<br/>small flapping flyers of the kind envisioned in the context of<br/>micro-aerodynamic flight.  This work aims to understand the<br/>eddying motions produced by certain kinds of flapping structures,<br/>and the mechanism of lift production in various cases of hovering<br/>flight.

Although there exist proposed solutions of idealized (and unrealistic) spin glass models, the principal investigators' interests center on answering fundamental statistical mechanical questions that bear on the behavior of real laboratory spin glasses.  These questions, many of which remain controversial despite two decades of intensive study, include the nature of ordering in the equilibrium spin glass phase, understanding anomalous behavior, such as slow relaxation and aging arising from nonequilibrium dynamics, and proving the presence or absence of a phase transition in finite dimensions.  The methods used and concepts introduced should be relevant not only for spin glasses but also for other disordered systems, many of which remain poorly understood.  Moreover, the generality of the principal investigators' approach to dynamics should yield progress in certain aspects of nonequilibrium dynamics in both homogeneous and disordered systems.<br/><br/>Our deep physical and mathematical understanding of ordered systems in the solid and liquid state --- for example, crystals, ferromagnets, superconductors, liquid crystals, and many others --- has been both of fundamental scientific importance and has spurred profound technological change throughout the second half of the last century.  However, there exist many systems, both familiar and unfamiliar, in which randomness or disorder plays a key role, and in which our mathematical and physical understanding remains comparatively primitive.  One familiar example is ordinary window glass, where the atoms or molecules are ""stuck"" in random locations (as opposed to a regular crystalline array as would be found, for example, in ice).  Spin glasses are disordered magnetic systems which are thought to be prototypes for this kind of macroscopic ""frozen-in"" disorder. Disordered systems in general present both fundamental scientific challenges and at the same time hold great promise for applications.  The latter includes not only the possibility of new materials and devices but also the creation of new algorithms and applications to the biological and other sciences.  Progress in understanding these systems is therefore greatly desirable.  Spin glasses may be more amenable to mathematical analysis than other materials in this class.  Nevertheless, little fundamental progress has been made even here.  The principal investigators' work is aimed at resolving basic mathematical and physical issues concerning these materials and at providing a general theoretical approach for a wide variety of disordered systems.<br/><br/>"

The proposal covers both the mathematical design, optimization, simulation and the initial experimental testing of the planned system. Mathematically, the proposed device requires a complex study of the evolution of an intense pulse in a ?ber with periodic dispersion compensation. This problem is different from that of pulse propagation in dispersion-managed transmission systems, because in the latter case, the propagation is only weakly nonlinear. We expect that the outcome of the mathematical part of this project will be a theory that will describe both the pulse propagation under the conditions described above and the effect of perturbations on this propagation. No such a theory exists at the present time.<br/><br/>The proposed regenerator can potentially be used for any number of channels and does not require their temporal synchronization or any polarization control.

In particular, an important basic problem is the determination of how many periodic orbits a dynamical system has, or, equivalently, the ""probability"" that a given initial condition leads to a periodic orbit.  In many classical systems, such as billiards, it is conjectured that the probability that an orbit is periodic is zero.  Surprisingly, this classical mechanics problem is also related to the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues in the corresponding Helmholtz problem.  The structure of the set of periodic orbits also plays important role in the study of quantum chaos and in physics of microcavities.  For example, some special sets of periodic orbits support quasimodes, which have been used in microlasers.<br/><br/>We expect the results of this research to help elucidate the general understanding of the structure of periodic orbits in Hamiltonian systems.

In the kinetic limit, the phase space distribution of a solution to this equation converges to a linear Boltzmann equation. Beyond the kinetic scale, one expects that the Boltzmann equation is still correct in dimension three or higher provided that the diffusivity is renormalized. The first project aims to study this renormalization for time scales longer than the kinetic scale. The second project concerns the viscosity of the lattice gas models.

The goal of this project is to extend this result to the dimension one case and to the lattice gas models with the Navier-Stokes equation as the formal limit. <br/> The fundamental question regarding the conductivity of electrons in semiconductors is how conduction occurs. As the technology is reaching the stage that the semi-classical theory no longer applies, the quantum effect will dominate and a mathematical rigorous theory is of fundamental importance. The first project aims to establish the quantum corrections of the standard semi-classical theory based on the Boltzmann equation. This will provide the first rigorous understanding of these quantum dynamical effects. The second project investigates the validity of the lattice gas models for fluids. These models, besides being widely used to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations, are important models for non-equilibrium statistical physics. The goal here is to establish the divergence rate of the viscosity for these models.

Examples abound and range from acoustic wave propagation and noise suppression in large high-speed vehicles to molecular dynamics and protein folding in rational drug design.  The need for greater accuracy leads to inclusion of greater detail in the computer model, with potential coupling to other complex computer models that may require additional simulations that are themselves difficult and expensive.  The resulting computational burden can be overwhelming and can create unmanageably large demands on resources.  <br/><br/>Efficient utilization of the computational model becomes a necessary component of simulations in such large-scale settings.  This is the main motivation for model reduction.  Often, the original system model behaves very nearly as if it were a simpler system -- but unfortunately not one that is explicitly known beforehand.  The goal of model reduction is to extract such a simpler system while mimicking the original full system behavior as closely as possible.  The new simpler system can then be used as an efficient surrogate for the original system.  The research supported here focuses on Krylov-based projection methods to accomplish this task.  These methods have emerged as promising candidates for model reduction in large-scale settings over the last ten years, yet their use still requires improvised elements that are not yet well understood.  We believe that our methods will permit a systematic refinement of these ideas and lead to the efficient construction of high-fidelity, in some cases optimal, reduced-order models for large-scale systems with precise estimates of the level of model fidelity that has been maintained.  Tools for the analysis, approximation, and control of large-scale, complex system models will be produced as well that are anticipated to contribute to scientific research infrastructure."

Specifically, the problems under consideration are i) utility-indifference valuation of default risk; ii) design of instruments to optimally enhance credit worthiness; iii) asymptotic analysis of stochastic intensity models to study the time-scale content of corporate yield spreads; iv) computational issues related to the analysis of correlation between defaults across firms, modeled as large systems in interaction.  The first part involves stochastic control problems related to random intensity models and infinite dimensional interest rate models. The second also overlaps and involves filtering of partially observed systems.  The third uses singular and regular perturbation techniques for the class of interacting potential partial differential equations arising in this context, and the fourth uses interacting particle systems to compute probabilities which are sensitive to correlation of defaults, as well as Monte Carlo computations designed for the analysis of rare events.  The intellectual merit of this project is in developing applicable scientific tools to address the particular class of optimization, design, calibration and computation issues which are essential for managing default risk.<br/><br/>Defaultable instruments, or credit-linked derivatives, are financial securities that pay their holders amounts that are contingent on the occurrence (or not) of a default event such as the bankruptcy of a firm (or a country or municipality), non-repayment of a loan or missing a mortgage payment.  The market in credit-linked derivative products has grown more than seven-fold in recent years, from $170 billion outstanding notional in 1997, to almost $1400 billion through 2001.  These instruments raise new challenges in modeling, analysis, computation and estimation, some of which we propose to study here by bringing together a Focused Research Group with expertise in applied mathematics, stochastic processes and computational statistics.  The broader impact of the project is in deeper understanding of credit risks, which affect people from large commercial institutions to individuals with pension funds and mortgages, and designing and correctly valuing instruments to control for it.  The project is also strongly geared towards training of five graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, who will benefit enormously from interaction with all parts of the broad-based group through many meetings, and in particular a large international conference on the research area at the end of the three years.  The experience gained by the PI's will be reflected in their teaching of specialist graduate and undergraduate classes, and advising Senior Thesis projects in this field.

These mathematical<br/>problems are analytically modeled by highly nonlinear elliptic,<br/>parabolic, mixed hyperbolic-parabolic and stochastic systems of<br/>partial differential equations, including the equations of<br/>nonlinear elasticity, viscoelastic flow, and Maxwell's equations<br/>of electrodynamics.

Specifically, the problems under consideration are i) utility-indifference valuation of default risk; ii) design of instruments to optimally enhance credit worthiness; iii) asymptotic analysis of stochastic intensity models to study the time-scale content of corporate yield spreads; iv) computational issues related to the analysis of correlation between defaults across firms, modeled as large systems in interaction.  The first part involves stochastic control problems related to random intensity models and infinite dimensional interest rate models. The second also overlaps and involves filtering of partially observed systems.  The third uses singular and regular perturbation techniques for the class of interacting potential partial differential equations arising in this context, and the fourth uses interacting particle systems to compute probabilities which are sensitive to correlation of defaults, as well as Monte Carlo computations designed for the analysis of rare events.  The intellectual merit of this project is in developing applicable scientific tools to address the particular class of optimization, design, calibration and computation issues which are essential for managing default risk.<br/><br/>Defaultable instruments, or credit-linked derivatives, are financial securities that pay their holders amounts that are contingent on the occurrence (or not) of a default event such as the bankruptcy of a firm (or a country or municipality), non-repayment of a loan or missing a mortgage payment.  The market in credit-linked derivative products has grown more than seven-fold in recent years, from $170 billion outstanding notional in 1997, to almost $1400 billion through 2001.  These instruments raise new challenges in modeling, analysis, computation and estimation, some of which we propose to study here by bringing together a Focused Research Group with expertise in applied mathematics, stochastic processes and computational statistics.  The broader impact of the project is in deeper understanding of credit risks, which affect people from large commercial institutions to individuals with pension funds and mortgages, and designing and correctly valuing instruments to control for it.  The project is also strongly geared towards training of five graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, who will benefit enormously from interaction with all parts of the broad-based group through many meetings, and in particular a large international conference on the research area at the end of the three years.  The experience gained by the PI's will be reflected in their teaching of specialist graduate and undergraduate classes, and advising Senior Thesis projects in this field.  As well as the closing conference, the results of the work will be disseminated through academic and industry meetings, classes and articles written for peer-reviewed journals."

This is one of the most difficult multi-scale problems in science today because there is an incredible range of strongly interacting anisotropic nonlinear processes over many spatio-temporal scales; contemporary comprehensive computer models, GCM's, are currently incapable of adequately resolving or parametrizing many of these interactions on time scales appropriate for seasonal prediction as well as climate change projections.<br/>     Thus, the multi-scale problems in atmosphere/ocean dynamics serve as important prototypes for developing new systematic multi-scale strategies which are valuable in other scientific disciplines ranging from nanotechnology to macro-molecular dynamics to protein folding, etc.  The societal impacts for these efforts are also large; it has been estimated recently that a one-month increase in lead time for El Nino prediction would save $100 billion worldwide.  <br/>     Basic questions which drive climate research are the prediction of the weather from 1 to 14 days, the prediction of climate variations on seasonal to yearly time scales, and finally, climate-change projections on decadal and centennial time scales as well as quantifying the uncertainty associated with these predictions.<br/>     One of the striking recent observational discoveries is the profound impact of tropical variations on all of these problems.  The primary influence of the tropics occurs through the interaction and organization of clouds into clusters, super-clusters, and planetary-scale dynamics, an inherently fully nonlinear multi-scale process.  For climate change, water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas and the microphysical processes in clouds are a key mechanism for radiative feedback.  In fact, only a 4% change in average cloudiness would overwhelm the effects of CO2 in climate change.  Current evidence suggests that a few global planetary teleconnection patterns, such as the Pacific North America Oscillation, often summarize the weather and climate impact of the tropics for the mid-latitude atmosphere.  Since it will be impossible to run resolved coupled atmosphere/ocean comprehensive numerical models for climate change, reduced models involving these basic large scale patterns are of central importance.<br/>     Majda proposes to continue work on some of the most important issues and stumbling blocks for medium-range climate forecasting through the tools of modern applied mathematics, centering around novel strategies for: 1) multi-scale interaction of clouds, convection, and planetary waves in the tropics; 2) stochastic modeling of unresolved features for both the atmosphere/ocean and for quantifying uncertainty and predictive capability in complex systems through information theory.  This will lead to new strategies for deterministic and stochastic parametrization of unresolved scales for the atmosphere and ocean, potentially significant low-order dynamic stochastic models for these processes, and more rigorous quantification of uncertainty in weather and climate-change predictions.  Such research often has additional potential benefit for other disciplines in science and engineering; also novel issues for applied PDE's and numerical analysis are expected to arise."

The non-equilibrium statistical<br/>physics of wave turbulence is studied from two new perspectives:<br/>  (1) Fluctuation Theorems: These new theorems have provoked much<br/>recent activity for many physical systems.  Here the investigator<br/>considers whether Fluctuation Theorems hold for non-equilibrium<br/>wave turbulence and studies related far-from-equilibrium issues,<br/>such as (i) the universality of Fluctuation Theorems in wave<br/>turbulence, (ii) the relation to large-deviation theory, (iii) the<br/>dynamical consequences of effective temperatures, and (iv) the<br/>implications of Fluctuation Theorems for phase-mixing and<br/>dephasing processes at the onset of wave turbulence. <br/>  (2) The Maximum-Entropy Principle: Previously, wave turbulence<br/>has been examined using this principle for equilibrium states<br/>only.

The first component involves semi-Lagrangian contouring, with fast stable tools for geometric  operations such as contouring, distancing and intersection.  Efficient algorithms convert between explicit and implicit interface representations with fast computational geometry, robust global topology resolution, and high-order Bezier representations, to track complex surfaces evolving under arbitrary dynamics and topology.  The second component requires high-accuracy solution of partial differential systems for material fields, stresses and concentrations, which determine the velocity of the interface.  Fast accurate solvers for algebraically complete first-order formulations split Green functions into singular and global terms, and achieve optimal efficiency for elliptic/parabolic systems with complex interfaces.  The interface motion  and velocity evaluation components connect through new implicit time-stepping schemes which handle sensitive interface velocities stably.  The Frechet  derivatives incurred in the solution of implicit schemes are systematically decomposed into universal components, and computed by efficiently reusable computational modules.<br/><br/>Mathematical models of complex evolving material interfaces dominate technological processes ranging from semiconductor production to surgery planning, from computer animation to computer-controlled machine tooling.

The<br/>broader impacts of the project include the interdisciplinary training<br/>of graduate students in mathematical and computational modeling in<br/>microbiology, the introduction of new graduate courses on stochastic<br/>modeling, the renovation of an undergraduate course on probability<br/>theory  to incorporate modern research<br/>efforts and issues as contexts for the learning of mathematical<br/>techniques, material to be posted on the World Wide Web to disseminate<br/>these pedagogical applications, and broader opportunities for<br/>undergraduate students to gain experience in mathematical modeling."

Basic theorems on qualitative and approximation properties of the underlying systems will be developed, and the long-term behavior analyzed.  Numerically efficient algorithms will be developed.  Reducing memory requirements is a major task, perhaps the most crucial, since such systems typically require memory that is beyond the capabilities of current computers.  There are various data structures, system representations, and dual formulations that are very promising.  In addition, we will develop efficient methods of managing networks of mobiles that operate in an environment where the connecting channels are randomly time varying because of the scattering due to the motions of the mobiles.  The basic technique will be based on the perturbed Liapunov function method, a powerful approach for stability analysis when the system is not Markovian.<br/><br/>Nonlinear stochastic delay equations are ubiquitous in applications.  Of particular interest are applications to high-speed communications.  Such systems are always subject to delays, and are stochastic and nonlinear.  This has been the subject of much interest, but current methods of control try to get around the effects of the delays with various tricks that lead to conservative (and often unstable) systems.  But it is apparent that the use of the full power of optimal stochastic control theory, taking the true delays into account, can greatly improve the operation.

Strong anisotropy in the surface<br/>energy manifests itself physically in the formation of corners on<br/>a crystal.  Traditional mathematical models applied to the<br/>formation of corners are mathematically ill-posed and thus<br/>intractable.  Because the formation of corners during crystal<br/>growth is ubiquitous, the ill-posedness of corner formation is a<br/>problem inherent in simulations of both industrial and naturally<br/>occurring crystal growth.  Moreover, it is of critical importance<br/>to modeling crystal growth of nanoscale materials because of the<br/>dominant role of surface effects at small length scales.  The<br/>investigator characterizes and evaluates different methods<br/>proposed to remove or regularize the ill-posedness.  A widely<br/>employed regularization is a singular perturbation.  A significant<br/>mathematical challenge is to characterize the behavior of the<br/>singularly perturbed corner.  The investigator studies separately<br/>the role of the regularization in three dimensions and its effect<br/>in the presence of elastic stress.  Another important scientific<br/>issue is to determine which of many regularization procedures is<br/>true to the atomic-scale behavior of different materials.  The<br/>investigator also considers this question by studying the dynamic<br/>behavior of regularizations in relation to experimental<br/>observations and the relation of regularizations to atomic-scale<br/>models.  Overall, the project has the potential for significant<br/>impact on the understanding of a key mathematical issue regarding<br/>regularization of ill-posedness in a classic moving boundary<br/>problem, and the impact of the work in a broader scientific<br/>context is that it contributes to the understanding of how to<br/>model the growth of crystalline solids in materials science. <br/><br/>     In the growth of crystals for nanotechnology and other<br/>materials applications, the formation of structures with corners<br/>(as on a grain of salt) is a natural occurrence.  The physical<br/>effects responsible for the existence of a corner are well<br/>understood and a mathematical description of an existing corner<br/>can be accomplished with a classical mathematical model.  However,<br/>the classical model is incapable of describing the actual dynamics<br/>of corner formation.  This problem is present in all mathematical<br/>simulations of crystal growth in which corners form.  Moreover, it<br/>is of magnified importance in the simulation of the growth of<br/>nanoscale structures:  when the crystal decreases in size, corners<br/>become an increasingly dominant part of the overall structure. <br/>Thus, to correctly describe the growth of nanostructured<br/>materials, it is essential to have a correct model for corner<br/>formation.  To obtain tractable models for corner formation,<br/>different ""regularization"" ideas have been proposed to make the<br/>mathematical problem of corner formation solvable, but there are<br/>many different approaches and no universally accepted procedure. <br/>One aspect of this project is a critical comparison of the<br/>different regularization approaches and how they behave in<br/>relation to actual material systems.  A second aspect of the work<br/>relates to the fact that some of these models are ""singular<br/>perturbations,"" which means that the results obtained when the<br/>regularization effect approaches zero can be different than if the<br/>regularization is not present at all.  This type of unexpected<br/>behavior can mean that a small regularization that is added to<br/>allow for corner formation might give a different corner shape in<br/>simulations than should be present from the accepted classical<br/>model.  Thus, understanding such singular perturbation behavior is<br/>an important part of validating such regularization methods to<br/>ensure that they give the correct overall behavior when used in<br/>large-scale crystal growth simulations.  Taken as a whole, the<br/>project has the potential for significant impact as a building<br/>block in our ability to simulate the fabrication of nanomaterials,<br/>and by extension could contribute to the creation of<br/>purpose-specific materials, especially those with nanoscale<br/>features, in electronics and other applications.  In addition, the<br/>project involves the training of a graduate student and includes<br/>two undergraduate students, for whom the experience may serve as<br/>stimulus to pursue graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences."

The ITER tokamak, an international $5 billion project that includes the European Union, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Japan, and the United States, will confine a mixture of ionized isotopes of hydrogen, also known as plasma, at a temperature of around 100 million degrees centigrade, fusing the isotopes of hydrogen into helium and converting some of the matter involved in the reaction into a much larger amount of energy. Control researchers will receive a good general overview of the major objectives of fusion research and obtain a basic understanding of the many control problems that must be solved to achieve those objectives.  Fusion scientists will obtain an improved understanding of available control technologies and expertise with some feeling for how applicable these techniques are to their own control problems.  Both communities will learn what is needed to initiate a collaborative activity. The workshop will consist of two days of presentations and discussion.  Day 1 will provide an overview of tokamak fusion and the associated control problems.  Day 2 will provide a selected cross-section of state-of the art mathematical control theories, which may be beneficial in fusion control problems.  A tour of the DIII-D tokamak and fusion facility will be provided to enhance the learning experience for control researchers.<br/><br/>At the present rate of energy use, and considering the estimate of world population growth, experts predict an energy shortfall in less than fifty years. Although the accuracy of this prediction can be discussed, it is a fact that fossil fuel energy is becoming more expensive and polluting.

As a source of energy, fusion would have many advantages: abundant fuel supply, no risk of nuclear accident, no air pollution, no high-level nuclear waste, and no generation of nuclear weapon materials. There is consensus in the fusion community that active control will be one of the key enabling technologies. With further advancements in reduced-order fusion modeling, advances in control systems for fusion will continue, including vertical and shape control, kinetic and current profile control, MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) stabilization and plasma transport reduction. The visibility that this workshop will give to the problem of fusion plasma control will attract high quality mathematicians and engineers to work on this important topic. As one outcome of this workshop, a large number of challenging problems will become known to graduate students in mathematics, physics, and controls.

The commonly<br/>used descriptive equations for elastic rods dynamics are due to<br/>Kirchhoff.  However, the Kirchhoff model is complex and only few<br/>classes of explicit solutions are known and analyzed.  In a series<br/>of papers, Goriely and coworkers obtained a reduced model<br/>consisting of amplitude equations for the dynamics of a twisted<br/>rod beyond the threshold of its first writhing instability. <br/>Solutions to these equations are known to correspond to fully<br/>three-dimensional deformations of rods.  The goals of this project<br/>are twofold.  Firstly, the investigator studies existence and<br/>stability properties for a large class of explicit solutions of<br/>the amplitude equations.  Secondly, the methods developed to study<br/>the stability of these solutions are extended to partial<br/>differential equations that are completely integrable or have<br/>certain symmetry properties.  More precisely, the first task<br/>involves a systematic study of existence and stability of coherent<br/>structures for amplitude equations.  Existence is studied by means<br/>of symmetry analysis, while stability is addressed using two<br/>different tools: the Evans function and Hamiltonian techniques. <br/>The second task is a general study of the Evans function.  The<br/>investigator examines the relation between the Evans function and<br/>complete integrability and, in particular, is interested in the<br/>connections with a particular notion of integrability, the<br/>Painleve Test.  When integrability is not present, it is still<br/>possible for the equations to admit interesting Lie symmetries. <br/>The goal is to show that important information on the Evans<br/>function can be retrieved from these symmetries.<br/><br/>     Mechanics is a fascinating field of physics.  Its main<br/>purpose is the study of interactions of particles in the presence<br/>of forces such as gravity.  In contrast to the dynamics of<br/>particles, the study of continuous media, such as fluids or<br/>elastic bodies, is challenging and not yet entirely well<br/>understood.  This is due to the fact that continuous media behave<br/>in numerous and complex ways.  For example, it is difficult to<br/>describe mathematically the twisting and bending of elastic rods,<br/>but approximate models do exist.  The study of the dynamics of<br/>elastic rods is a field of research that is interesting in itself<br/>as it gives rise to beautiful and complex mathematical structures. <br/>Furthermore, understanding elastic rods is crucial for<br/>applications in several domains of science.  In biology, rod<br/>models are used to describe the coiling of different structures<br/>such as DNA.  In engineering, elastic rods are used to study the<br/>behavior of submarine cables.  In this project, the investigator<br/>focuses on a model that has been proven to be successful in<br/>describing the dynamics of rods: the Kirchhoff equations.  These<br/>are differential equations, that is they are equations involving<br/>derivatives.  The solutions to these equations represent possible<br/>behaviors for elastic rods.  The main purpose of the project is to<br/>study stability properties of elastic rod models.  Stability is a<br/>fundamental concept in physics: for example, in theory, it is<br/>possible to make a pencil stand on its lead but, in practice,<br/>because that is such an unstable state, it cannot be done.  In the<br/>example just described, the study of stability is very simple and<br/>there is no need for a mathematical analysis to prove or disprove<br/>the stability of the system.  The concept of stability carries<br/>over to solutions of differential equations such as the Kirchhoff<br/>equations.  In this context, stability takes an abstract form and<br/>its study often involves sophisticated mathematical tools.  The<br/>study of stability is of fundamental importance because only<br/>stable solutions can be realized experimentally.  Unstable<br/>solutions, just like in the case of the pencil balancing on its<br/>point, although they exist in theory will not be observed.  Hence,<br/>with stability studies, one can distinguish the solutions that can<br/>be realized experimentally from the ones that cannot.  The<br/>investigator proposes new ways of investigating stability<br/>mathematically.  The methods he develops are applied to elastic<br/>rods and other applications."

Each is designed to develop new analytical and computational techniques in dynamical systems theory, test current techniques on models that are physically well grounded, develop new numerical algorithms that conserve quantities we know should be conserved, and push the models closer towards applications mostly in oceanographic and atmospheric sciences, but also in molecular modeling where some of the same underlying issues pertain (albeit with Hamiltonians of a different form). In many cases, techniques that have been developed for N-body problems in the celestial mechanics context will be exploited and adapted for use on this class of discrete vortex problems.

The data acquisition portion of the project focuses on the understanding of global weather patterns and the connection between these patterns and the transport and mixing of passive and active scalars such as environmental pollutants, oceanographic biota, and atmospheric ozone."

These systems include the fluid equations (for example, Stokes or Navier-Stokes equations) and the equations describing the position of a swimming device (or a living organism) in the fluid. The swimming motion of the latter is the result of the action of ""internal"" forces generated by the device, which also serve as the ""external"" forces for the surrounding fluid. In a typical swimming model the aforementioned internal forces are either the forces, preserving the structure of the device at hand or the ""propulsion"" forces (for example, of rotation or rowing nature), which make it swim. The magnitudes of the latter forces are modeled as coefficients and serve as nontraditional (in the framework of the mathematical controllability theory) multiplicative or bilinear controls.<br/><br/>In this project we will investigate the mathematical nature of the swimming motion of a mechanical device (such as a robotic fish or a robotic eel) or a living organism in a fluid. What makes the latter to swim the way it does? Or more precisely, what kind forces are necessary to employ to achieve the desirable swimming motion? How can we design a mechanical device that can do the same? Answers to these questions are of great interest in biological and medical applications and in engineering applications dealing with propulsion systems in fluids."
