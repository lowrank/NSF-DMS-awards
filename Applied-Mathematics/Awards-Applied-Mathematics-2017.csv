The abbreviation KUMUNU signifies the collaboration of faculty from the Universities of Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. The Conference webpage is http://www.math.unl.edu/events/special/kumunu2017. <br/>Similarly to the two previous KUMUNU Conferences, the KUMUNU Lincoln 2017 Meeting is being organized with a view toward featuring eminent mathematicians who will deliver lectures on their respective research programs to a diverse audience of mathematicians. KUMUNU Lincoln 2017 will serve as a forum for interaction of established scientist with graduate students and early career faculty, as well as with members of smaller regional academic institutions. One of the objectives of the conference is the initiation of collaborations among Partial Differential Equations (PDE) specialists who, but for their respective participation in KUMUNU Lincoln 2017, might not otherwise have occasion to collectively meet in a scientific setting. It is anticipated that these nascent collaborations will involve recent PhDs and facilitate development of their academic careers. <br/><br/>The invited talks will be devoted to the following areas of research: (i) long time behavior of solutions to nonlinear PDE; and (ii) analysis of those PDE systems that describe certain fluid-structure interactions. In particular, the Conference Speakers will address qualitative issues concerning the existence of global attracting sets for corresponding ""trajectories"" (solutions) of given nonlinear evolutionary PDE. Some speakers will address the rigorous and numerical analysis of certain fluid-structure PDE dynamics, and present their latest findings in these research directions. In addition, it is expected that the collaboration between researchers in long time behavior of nonlinear evolutionary PDE and fluid-structure PDE specialists will serve as a departure point from which new inroads will be made towards understanding the asymptotic behavior of solutions to nonlinear fluid-structure PDE dynamics. The projected collaborations arising from KUMUNU Lincoln 2017 could provide new mathematical insights into experimentally and numerically observed fluid-structure phenomena."

At the basic level, the dynamical behavior of fluid flow is described by the Euler or the Navier-Stokes equations. These complex systems of nonlinear partial differential equations are very difficult to study using classical techniques and only a few exact solutions are known to this day. In many applications, an exact solution is not needed and a main goal of this project is to give a qualitative description of solutions to these equations in some limiting cases.  Indeed, when taken in some limiting situations, due to the presence of a small parameter or when considered for large time, these complex sets of equations may be reduced to simpler models.  These simpler models are capable of providing important qualitative descriptions of the behavior of these solutions without having to compute them explicitly.  This general method has applications in the study of the long-time behavior of complex systems, the development of singularities, the formation of special patterns, the transition between stability and instability and the first steps of transition towards turbulence. This project will involve the training of graduate students and postdocs. <br/><br/>The main problem to be addressed in this project is the study of the asymptotic stability of some shear flows for the 2D Euler and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Some important progress was made recently in the study of the inviscid damping around Couette flow in a periodic setting for Gevrey regularity.  A main goal of this project is to expand this study to the case of more general shear flows.  A new difficulty comes from the fact that the linearized problem is more difficult to analyze and some deep ideas from functional analysis will be needed to overcome the lack of a simple explicit description of the solution. The second project is the study of the problem in the whole space (i.e. ,without the assumption of periodicity). The major difficulty here comes from the lack of uniformity of the mixing for low frequencies. The third project is to understand the behavior under rougher perturbations, namely perturbations which are only in Sobolev spaces.  Some new nonlinear cascades should be discovered here. The fourth project is to study the case when damping does not occur, and try to identify special solutions such as cat's eyes flows.  These four projects can also be formulated for the Navier-Stokes evolution and the major problem here is to understand the small viscosity limit."

It is especially important for clinical diagnosis in medicine and for oil prospecting. For medical imaging methods, for example, the success rests primarily on two ingredients: on one hand, the methods should display a large contrast between healthy and unhealthy tissues, on the other hand, they should have a sufficiently high, typically sub-millimeter, resolution. Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Ultrasound Imaging (UI) are typical examples of modalities with such a resolution. These modalities however fail to exhibit a sufficient contrast. Other modalities, for example those based on the optical, elastic, or electrical properties of tissues, do display a high contrast but suffer from low resolution capabilities. A breakthrough has been made on the way to overcoming such limitations by coupling two existing modalities: one with large contrast while the other with high resolution. A combination like this is referred to as a hybrid modality. Various hybrid modalities have been invented and tested in the past few decades. Their effectiveness is justified in experiments, yet the underlying mathematical theory is still incomplete. This project aims to complement the extant mathematical knowledge of several hybrid modalities. Better understanding of the involved mathematics could facilitate further improvement of the modalities, providing potential candidates for the next generation of medical and geophysical imaging methods.<br/><br/>Among other hybrid modalities, Photo-Acoustic Tomography (PAT) and Thermo-Acoustic Tomography (TAT) are typical methods in medical imaging; and Seismo-Electric (SE) and Electro-Seismic (ES) imagings are examples in geophysical imaging. PAT and TAT take advantage of the high resolution of ultrasound waves and high contrast of optical/electromagnetic waves, while SE and ES imagings couple seismic waves and electromagnetic waves. Arising in different areas, their mathematical models consist in common of two stages: an inverse source problem for a hyperbolic system and an inverse problem with internal data. The investigator will study these two stages in each modality as well as the relations between different models. The research concerns primarily recovery of optical, electromagnetic and seismic parameters of the targeted object from the aspects of uniqueness, stability, partial measurement case, and reconstructive algorithms. The main tool to study the inverse hyperbolic problems is microlocal analysis which is a powerful method for tracking propagation of singularities. Consideration of the inverse problems with internal data will be based on properties of the specific equations. The research is also expected to result in reconstructive algorithms which will be numerically implemented and tested."

These are nonlocal models: the model's mathematical description of what happens at any point of the system can depend on what is happening at other points.  This nonlocal dependence complicates the analysis of the models, and the standard analytical tools and results for local models (which are usually systems of partial differential equations, often with derivatives of higher than second order) are not available.  In compensation, the nonlocal models need not require such smoothness of their solutions as differential equation models do.  This can be an advantage in studying fracture and other inherently discontinuous or singular phenomena.  For these applications, the investigators study regularity of solutions, existence and regularity for minimizers of energy functionals (which provide information about the stability of solutions), and asymptotic behavior of the solutions.  These issues are important in local models as well, so advances here help develop a theory for nonlocal models that parallels the theory for classical local models.  Such a theory would have wider consequences, because nonlocal models are being explored in many other applications that involve nonlocal interactions between parts of a system, such as biological aggregation, as well as in applications in manufacturing, energy, and infrastructure that involve fracture, images, or phase transitions.  Graduate students participate in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The investigators conduct a mathematical and computational investigation of nonlocal models that arise in dynamic fracture in plates, in image processing, and in phase transitions.  The advantage of working with low-regularity solutions to integro-differential equations is offset by the scarcity of mathematical tools (such as compactness arguments) when working with these non-smoothing operators.  The investigators study the issues of regularity of solutions throughout the damaged and undamaged domain and near the boundary, existence and regularity of minimizers for nonlocal energy functionals, and asymptotic behavior of solutions.  They develop predictive models for dynamic fracture in plates, and they study low-regularity solutions that show jump discontinuities in phase transitions as given by doubly-nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard systems.  To tackle these problems, they adapt existing techniques (multiplier methods, Fourier transform methods, asymptotic expansions, or DiGiorgi-type arguments) from the local theory to the nonlocal framework, and develop new methods that provide theoretical and methodological foundation for the study of nonlocal models.

The goal is to develop robust nonlinear methods, with ideas borrowed from hypoellipticity in the sense of Hörmander, harmonic analysis and singular integral theory, and probability and stochastic processes."

Many such equations, for example the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for waves in shallow water, have the exciting feature that many of their solutions can be given exactly by an explicit formula. This allows one to develop a precise understanding of the underlying physical processes. However, the range of conditions for which exact solutions are currently known is restrictive, inhibiting the use of such solutions in real-world applications. This project aims to find larger families of exact solutions to soliton equations, and use these solutions to develop statistical theories of the corresponding physical systems. <br/>  <br/>The main goal of the project is to construct and study new families of solutions of soliton equations such as KdV, Nonlinear Schrödinger, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili.

Turbulence is highly chaotic, and therefore modern approaches to predicting its behavior are based on simulations.  A major difficulty in accurately simulating turbulent flows is the problem of determining the initial state of the flow.  For example, weather prediction models typically require the present state of the weather as input.  However, the state of the weather is only measured at certain points, such as at the locations of weather stations or weather satellites.  Data assimilation makes up for the lack of complete knowledge of the initial state.  It incorporates incoming data into the equations, driving the simulation to the correct solution.  The objective of this project is to develop innovative computational and mathematical methods to test, improve, and extend a promising new class of algorithms for data assimilation in turbulent flows.

Secondly, the investigator carries out the first 3D simulations using the new algorithm in the context of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations of fluids, and makes a detailed comparison of the method with cutting-edge data assimilation methods.

Although there is an enormous wealth of knowledge accumulated in the broad area of fluid mechanics, many of the most fundamental and important questions remain poorly understood. Of particular interest is the question whether solutions to equations describing fluid motion can spontaneously form singularities - meaning that some quantity becomes infinite. Understanding singularities is important because they often correspond to dramatic, highly intense fluid motion, can indicate the range of applicability of the model, and are very difficult to resolve computationally. More generally, one can ask a related and broader question of creation of small scales in fluids - coherent structures that vary sharply in space and time, and contribute to phenomena such as turbulence. The project aims to analyze singularity formation process for some key equations of fluid mechanics, and to better understand the mechanisms that generate small scales in fluid motion. Another direction of the project research focuses on mixing in fluid flow. Mixing in fluids plays an important role in a wide range of settings, from marine ecology to internal combustion engines. Here the goal is to find and study fluid flows that are especially efficient mixers, as well as to produce bounds on mixing efficiency given some natural constraints. Such bounds can serve as benchmarks in evaluation of mixing processes.<br/><br/>The research covers three topics. The first topic concerns the Euler equation for incompressible inviscid fluid. It is nonlinear and nonlocal, which makes analysis difficult. Many key questions about behavior of solutions to the Euler equation remain open despite significant research efforts. Recently, the PI jointly with Vladimir Sverak have constructed examples of solutions to the 2D Euler equation which exhibit extremely fast formation of small scales. This work has been stimulated by the new scenario of potential singularity formation in the 3D Euler equation, proposed by Tom Hou and Guo Luo. The project aims to gain further rigorous insight into the possible singularity formation in three dimensions by analyzing a series of model equations.  The second topic concerns properties of solutions to the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) and modified SQG equations. These equations model evolution of temperature on the surface of Earth. Recently, the PI and collaborators have constructed examples of singularity formation in modified SQG patches in presence of boundary for a part of the possible parameter range. These examples are the first available in this class of equations. The project will involve further work on the modified SQG patch solutions, in the absence of boundary. The methods to be deployed in the first two directions of the project involve novel analytic estimates, comparison principles, asymptotic analysis, partial differential equations (PDE) estimates, and Fourier analysis techniques. The third topic concerns mixing in fluid flow. The goal is to improve understanding of flows that are most efficient in speeding up mixing. Quite often, there are constraints on some aspects of mixing flow, and it is important to understand how to produce most effective mixing under these constraints. The problems here are at the interface of applied partial differential equations, dynamical systems, probability theory and functional analysis."

Proposed work supports the construction of a complete algorithm that uses layers of manifold learning kernel methods to represent data in a deep manifold learning infrastructure.

This problem is more pressing now than ever as demographic change has reached a pivotal point. The combined working-age population in developed countries is projected to shrink continuously until 2050, while the retired population will grow rapidly. The tension between the two cohorts, working and retired (or, young and old), is almost certain to exacerbate, as the wealth of the former is used to support the latter, under Social Security or many other pension schemes. Yet, the precise economic consequences are not that apparent. This project aims to elucidate how an evolving demographic structure affects financial planning in a society. This will be done at two different levels: one from the eyes of the competing young and old cohorts, the other from the panoramic perspective of a social planner, such as a government. Graduate students are involved in the project. <br/><br/>The first part of the project investigates the interplay between the young and the old cohorts. It is formulated as a two-player nonzero-sum game in a stochastic Ramsey model, with the dynamics of demographic structure explicitly modeled. The goal is to understand how the two cohorts interact through their consumption and saving decisions, and how an evolving demographic structure affects their decisions, and the resulting welfare. Nash equilibrium strategies of the two cohorts will be found and analyzed through a system of coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with non-Lipschitz coefficients. This demands new developments in stochastic differential games and viscosity solution techniques. The second part of the project handles the social planner's dilemma: a financial planning strategy deemed optimal today by the current society may not be optimal from the view of the society in the future, as the evolving demographics continuously change the overall societal preference. This leads to a new form of time-inconsistent problems, with non-exponential and time-dependent discount functions, which will be treated under an intra-personal game between current and future societies. A new method for time-inconsistency, called the fixed-point approach, is developed in the project. It provides a new machinery for constructing time-consistent strategies, while possessing the potential of less mathematical technicalities."

The realization that drag forces exerted on a body moving through air (or water) take place on a thin layer around the body lead to the development of boundary layer theory. The practical importance of boundary layer theory in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics is immense: computing the drag on an object and the energy dissipation rate nearby, with implications for fuel efficiency; understanding the problem of wing stall, the dependence of the lift on the angle of attack; and even the enhancement of heat transfer near solid walls. Mathematically, these questions concern the behavior of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in the vanishing viscosity limit, and the stability of the ensuing boundary layers.  This project will develop new analytical tools to study the validity of the vanishing viscosity limit, the formation of singularities in boundary layers, and to explore the nonlinear stability mechanisms by which these lead to dynamic boundary layer separation. This theoretical information will lead to more accurate reduced models and finer predictions about real fluid flows. The project will train undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate researchers, in modern research problems in applied mathematics and the tools to study them.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new mathematical tools that will further our understanding of the vanishing viscosity limit: the question whether solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to solutions of the incompressible Euler equations as the viscosity approaches zero, in the presence of a characteristic physical boundary.

The PI and collaborators will address the emergence of singularities in the Prandtl boundary layer equations by establishing more robust finite time blow-up scenarios. The stability of nearly laminar boundary layers will be studied via a hypocoercive analysis of the Prandtl system and of higher order models. Finally, the PI will develop new energy methods that intertwine Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches to prove the vanishing viscosity limit in high regularity regimes. The goal is to develop nonlinear, solution-adapted methods. Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows will be mentored and included in the research activities."

Nonlinearity effects are most prominent for the high-power signals and large-magnitude waves: when one wave is superimposed on the other the waves are not just adding as would be true in the linear case but interact with each other. Such waves form complex wave patterns and have very important applications, including among others propagation of electromagnetic waves for fiber optics and lasers, shock waves in aerodynamics, and rogue waves in the ocean. Mathematical analysis of these phenomena is hampered by the nonlinearity of the governing equations. For nonlinear equations formulating a general theory is often unfeasible, and obtaining solutions requires a case-by-case study. This research effort focuses on solving a number of open problems that will substantially extend the ability of mathematicians to develop deeper understanding and explain the behavior of large-amplitude wave phenomena which arise widely in applications. <br/><br/>The Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) method is one of the few analytical techniques that allows one to analyze and obtain solutions to a number of important equations in mathematical physics. IST will be used to obtain solutions and understand properties of new classes of nonlinear wave equations which exhibit PT (parity-time) symmetry properties.  IST can also be used to describe certain classes of localized solutions, termed lump solutions, which decay in all directions. The key properties of these solutions will be understood and they will be connected to the non-stationary Schrödinger equation. The research effort will also be directed to investigating a class of shock wave phenomena termed dispersive shock waves (DSWs). DSWs are shock waves which are regularized by dispersion, in contrast with standard shock waves which are regularized by dissipation. DSWs arise in many applications including water waves, Bose- Einstein condensates, nonlinear optics, etc. The theory of DSWs will be extended in order to obtain improved approximations to the underlying equations in one dimension, and a detailed multidimensional analysis will be developed."

Duration of these pulses is approaching the timescales of fundamental atomic and molecular processes. They deliver energy so quickly that it allows them to probe living structures without damage and to make material modifications on the micron scale with minimal heat effects. Femtoscale lasers are used, for example, in microsurgery or materials processing. For ultrashort pulses, the traditional mathematical models used for longer optical pulses, the Nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) and Coupled Nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equations, lose their predictive capabilities. This research project is concerned with two novel mathematical models: the Complex Short Pulse (CSP) equation and the Coupled Complex Short Pulse (CCSP) equation. The project is devoted to analysis and computation of solutions of these equations for the description of ultrashort optical pulses.<br/><br/>The models to be investigated are integrable; the project concerns the investigation of the CSP equation, the CCSP equation and their integrable semi-discrete analogues, where the spatial variable takes values in a lattice, while the integrability of the resulting equations is preserved.  In particular, the investigator plans to: (1) construct the semi-discrete CSP equation and derive exact solutions including bright and dark solitons and rogue-wave-like solutions; (2) construct bright-bright, dark-dark and bright-dark (mixed) soliton solutions, as well as rogue wave solutions, of the CCSP equation; (3) utilize the semi-discrete CSP equation as a novel self-adaptive moving mesh numerical method for simulating solutions of the continuous CSP model. Being at the second largest Hispanic-serving institution in the country, the investigator strives to motivate and encourage undergraduate and graduate students to engage in cutting-edge research in applied mathematics."

Contractual, legal, and business relationships among firms may act as a conduit for the transmission and amplification of risks. Under scenarios of financial distress, spillover effects on business counterparties and more broadly on the real economic sectors can be significant. It is thus fundamentally important that financial institutions, holding large portfolios of fixed income securities, can quantify these risks and their systemic implications before making hedging and investment decisions. Equally important for financial stability is to explain the huge volatility spikes of asset prices, periodically observed during flash crash events in markets dominated by high-frequency traders. If these events were happening to a too-big-to-fail institution, the market could be wrecked and government bailout would be necessary, with enormous consequences on taxpayers.<br/><br/>This project will develop stochastic control techniques for solving fixed income portfolio selection problems in the presence of contagion risk, and analyzing intraday liquidity and price dynamics in high-frequency trading markets. In the first part of the project, the investigator will study recursive systems of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations arising in the optimal selection and hedging of fixed income portfolios. In the second part of the project, he will develop new numerical techniques for analyzing second order forward-backward stochastic differential equations with jumps, a class of equations arising naturally in high frequency trading when controlling for the inventory risk. The unique structure of these problems will present new mathematical challenges in stochastic analysis, including the study of fully nonlinear partial integro-differential equations, second order forward-backward stochastic differential equations with jumps, and stochastic games associated with these equations."

The task of extracting useful information from such data sets typically leads to solving a large-scale optimization problem.  The sheer size of such problems poses great challenges for optimization specialists.  The investigator aims to advance the reach of large-scale optimization in such settings, with vital applications throughout science and engineering.  The resulting methodology and algorithms create a systematic approach to discover trends and phenomena underlying the observed data, and lead to a well-grounded mechanism for making predictions about unobserved data.  The project lies firmly at the interface between theory and computation.  Therefore, an effective mix of numerical experimentation, teaching, and discovery is central to the proposal.  Graduate students participate in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The investigator's strategy rests on three interrelated pillars: structure, computational complexity, and conditioning in nonsmooth optimization.  Efficiency of numerical methods is best judged through rigorous rates of convergence.  Convergence guarantees of an algorithm become much more potent, however, if they match best possible guarantees that any algorithm can have within the problem class.  The search for such ""optimal methods"" underpins computational complexity.  Measures of the problem's conditioning -- an indication of its difficulty -- play a central role in the subject and are intimately tied to stability of the underlying problem.  The theory and algorithms, moreover, benefit greatly from exploiting rich underlying structure prevalent in applications, such as separation of smooth and simple nonsmooth functional components, smooth conjugate representations, saddle-point reformulations, etc.  Convex optimization techniques and variational analytic insight guide the investigator's approach.

Its importance is underscored by the huge housing market bubble, which crashed in 2008, and which thereby caused extensive financial suffering.  This proposal aims to continue a study of the mathematical modeling of bubbles in financial markets. The mathematical basis for modeling speculative pricing is that it provides the opportunities to quantify when bubble pricing is occurring and how big (in an appropriate sense) the bubble is, and perhaps even more importantly, to identify when a bubble is occurring, or not.  Early steps in this direction were burdened by rather severe restrictions in the generality of the mathematical models.  In this research, the PI will continue the analysis in a more general setting. The key is to drop the standard restriction of what is known as a ""complete market"" in favor of the more realistic situation involving ""incomplete markets.""<br/><br/>In the study of bubbles in incomplete markets, the role of strict local martingales will continue to be of paramount importance. The PI plans to tackle the issue of identifying models that lead to strict local martingales within incomplete markets, thus abandoning the wonderful but too simple framework first begun with the work of Delbaen and Shirakawa. The plan is to begin with the models of M. Musiela and P.L Lions, but then progress to multidimensional strict local martingales, using the theory of Lyapunov exponents as developed in the work of Narita, Khasminskii, Stroock, and Varadhan. The PI will also tackle some thorny numerical analysis issues created by the lack of linear growth, a problem inherent in the framework of strict local martingale models."

These platforms are provided with massive data on the populations of users, and need to take real-time decisions regarding market clearing, such as imposing surge prices, or suggesting assignments. The goal of this project is to expand the boundaries of a central tool: optimal transport theory, which was initiated in the 18th century but experienced a surge of research activity over the last decade, and which is very relevant for problems in matching, pricing, and data analysis. <br/><br/>The project is divided into three separate projects; the first two are related, and the third one is further apart. The first project will define the framework of equilibrium transportation, which extends optimal transport to equilibrium situations. It will focus on the semi-discrete case, where one of the distributions is continuous and the other one is discrete. In this setting, it will derive analytical properties of the solution such as existence, uniqueness, monotonicity, and lattice structure. This framework is applied to the solution of a problem on the labor market. In another application, it is extended to the case of equilibrium flows on networks. The second project will demonstrate the usefulness of the equilibrium transportation framework for computing equilibrium in markets such as the taxi market, which cannot be modeled as an optimal transport problem since prices are fixed; in this type of markets, demand and supply are balanced by a congestion cost induced by limited availability. The project will derive the properties of the equilibrium, and use the framework to study the surge pricing problem: when demand and supply are uncertain, which price should be set to minimize the expected market inefficiency? The third project will focus on computational challenges brought by the introduction (due to the PI and collaborators) of the notion of vector quantile regression in the statistical literature. The project will focus on iterated projection methods (which have been very successfully applied to classical optimal transport problems) for this new class of problems."

Science and industry are continually searching for composites that are stronger, lighter, and less expensive than their traditional counterparts.  These structured media -- or metamaterials -- may exhibit increased electrical conductivity, enhanced thermal or acoustic insulation properties, more reliable durability, or even seemingly unattainable properties such as invisibility.  Specific examples include lighter wings and fuselage materials for aircraft, body armor for the military, artificial joints used in orthopedic surgery, and professional sporting equipment.  Composites also appear throughout the natural world -- in human and animal bodies, and in most components found within and on the surface of the Earth.  Examples include bone, lungs, porous rocks containing oil and gas, agricultural soils, and sea ice.  The mathematical theory of homogenization for composite materials has been developed to explain observed effective properties of existing composites, which can then be used to predict and discover new composites with less need for costly experimentation.  Recently the investigators discovered an unexpected mathematical parallel between homogenization for composites and the Anderson theory of the metal-insulator transition, for which Anderson shared the Nobel prize.  In this project the investigators develop new methods for studying composites based on this parallel, bringing the powerful ideas of the Anderson transition to bear on a broad range of problems in the theory of composites.  Graduate and undergraduate students participate in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     In this project the spectral theory of homogenization for transport in composite media is investigated through the lens of random matrix theory.  A powerful approach to homogenization problems is the analytic continuation method, which encodes information about the microstructure of the composite through the spectral measure of a self-adjoint random operator governing classical transport in the medium.  Random matrix theory naturally arises by considering finite discrete models of composites, which allows the spectral measure, and thus the macroscopic behavior of the composite, to be computed in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the random matrices.  Surprisingly, as a percolation threshold is approached, these eigenvalues and eigenvectors display strikingly similar behavior to what is observed in Anderson transitions in condensed matter, optics, acoustics, and water waves.  This unexpected connection enables the investigators to develop new methods of analysis and computation for homogenization of two-phase composites and related systems such as polycrystals and advection-diffusion processes.  Moreover, their approach ties together previously unrelated fields of random matrix theory and homogenization, opening up new avenues for investigation and application.

The new computational methods seek to efficiently predict the time-dependent behavior of physical and engineering systems, with application in areas such as medicine, seismology, aerodynamics, and stealth.  A common thread in all of these areas relates to the complexity of the time evolution inherent in these systems.  The flow of blood from a beating heart, the seismic waves arising from an earthquake, the fluid flow around an aircraft, and the behavior of radar technologies all share some of the same elements: the time evolution of the observed phenomena.  It is this complexity in time-dependence that is addressed by this project: the Fourier Continuation (FC) and spectral time methodologies seek to reproduce the outstanding performance of certain spectral solvers, which are unfortunately restricted to simple geometric configurations, for simulations in a much more general realm, with greatly reduced computer memory and processing time -- thus, effectively enabling the solution of previously intractable problems in areas of highly significant engineering and scientific interest.  A graduate student and an undergraduate student participate in the project.<br/><br/>     From a mathematical perspective, the effort seeks to produce solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) in the time domain that can deliver, in fast computing times, nearly dispersionless (spectral) PDE solutions for general complex three-dimensional structures.

The FC and related frequency-domain approaches have already been highly successful in a wide range of important problems in science and engineering.  The extensions studied here seek to bring time-domain solvers to the realm of general applicability, thus extending to the time domain the previous successes in the area of spectral solvers in the frequency domain.  The resulting methods are applied to important problems in the fields of materials science, applied physics, electrical engineering, geophysics, and aerospace engineering.

Despite the wide success of machine learning, the growing size of typical data sets is creating serious computational challenges, partially due to our incomplete understanding of how algorithms work in the big data regime.  The first goal of this project is to address these issues within a branch of machine learning called graph-based semi-supervised learning, which has found applications in problems such as protein sequencing, website classification, and speech recognition.  The investigator analyzes some recently-proposed algorithms for semi-supervised learning.  A deep mathematical understanding of these algorithms explains why they work and, more importantly, when they will fail.  The investigator uses these insights to develop new, fast, and more efficient algorithms for semi-supervised learning.  The second goal of this project is to develop and study new algorithms for curvature motions of curves and surfaces that are stable, efficient, and convergent.  Curvature motion has found many applications in science and engineering, including materials science, computer vision, image processing, and recently in data science and machine learning.  Curvature motion describes, for example, the motion of soap bubbles as well as the evolution of polycrystalline materials (such as metals and ceramic) during the manufacturing process.  Because both machine learning and curvature motions have very broad applications across science and engineering, any improvement in algorithms and in our understanding of them could have broad societal impacts.<br/><br/>The first objective of this project is to study rigorously a recently-proposed algorithm for graph-based semi-supervised learning based on Lp-Laplacian regularization.  In particular, the investigator proves that the learning algorithms have continuum limits that correspond to solving a weighted p-Laplace equation in the viscosity sense.  In the limit of small labeled data and infinite unlabeled data, it has recently been conjectured that Lp-Laplacian regularization is ill-posed when p is smaller than the intrinsic dimension of the data.  The project aims to settle this conjecture rigorously.  The investigator uses these continuum limits to study the relationship between the fraction of labeled data and the performance of the algorithms, and to develop new and more efficient computational algorithms based on these insights.  The second objective of the project is to develop and analyze a new class of monotone finite difference schemes for curvature-driven motions of curves and surfaces, for which rigorous convergence proofs are available.  The investigator has recently discovered a general technique for constructing monotone finite difference schemes for a wide class of curvature motions of curves and surfaces.  He implements the new schemes for a variety of motions, experimentally tests convergence rates, and rigorously proves convergence to the viscosity solution using the Barles-Souganidis framework.  Monotonicity of the new schemes allows for the development of fully implicit and unconditionally monotone time-stepping schemes, and guarantees the approximations are capturing the correct continuum dynamics."

The project includes outreach to local K-12 schools; research experiences for undergraduates, both during the academic year and summer, including partnerships with faculty at institutions that serve many students from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences; summer schools for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows; and a communication seminar. The program especially emphasizes communication, both because of its importance in reaching the wider public, and for its vital role within mathematics itself. Because probability, dynamics, and partial differential equations straddle the divide that often exists between pure and applied mathematics, these subjects provide an excellent training ground for effective communication. <br/><br/>Dynamical systems, probability theory, and partial differential equations have rich interconnections and span the entire spectrum of mathematical activities from theory to applications. However, such interconnections are rarely explored in undergraduate or graduate education. This project aims to highlight these connections, which have proven so fruitful at the research frontier, and thereby to broaden the perspective of the next generation of mathematicians. The research activities will introduce students to problems relevant to societal and environmental issues. The emphasis on communication will enhance the professional development of participants, whether they find themselves working in education, industry, or research. The summer schools and research experiences for undergraduates will attract eligible participants nationwide. The educational modules created as part of the outreach and modeling activities will be available online to schools, universities, and the general public. The outreach activities will invite high school students to join in the excitement of mathematical discovery, while giving graduate students an opportunity to act as mentors."

For example, cardiac bypass surgeries are required for infants born with congenital heart defects; however, approximately 50% of children develop brain injury perioperatively, leading to the damaging complications for survivors of congenital heart disease. Improved cerebral imaging techniques are needed to evaluate the effects of surgical procedures on brain perfusion. One of the most promising techniques for cerebral imaging are multiwave imaging methods such as photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography, which combine properties of different waves to obtain high contrast and resolution unattainable by traditional modalities.  This project is motivated by the possible application of multiwave imaging to monitor cerebral blood perfusion in infants. It aims to incorporate the complexity of media properties in the head (brain, vasculature, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, skull, skin) into these imaging techniques, while making these techniques more robust to noise and uncertainty. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are both theoretical and computational. The first is to identify general assumptions under which the photo-acoustic measurements render the simultaneous recovery of the internal source and the wave speed. This will be accomplished by expanding the mathematical theory concerning the simultaneous recovery of acoustic sources and media properties, which is one of the main open questions regarding photo-, thermo- and magneto- acoustic imaging. Based on preliminary work, the investigators have relaxed a-priori conditions under which simultaneous recovery is possible. The next step is to determine which conditions are essential and which ones can be removed. The second goal is computational and uses the intrinsic property of the photo-acoustic effect, which produces high contrast pressure profiles. The aim is to design novel discontinuous Galerkin methods for accurate, low dispersion simulations of high contrast pressure waves for use in new imaging algorithms. These methods are designed to achieve high performance on GPU architectures in the presence of realistic media and geometries. The third goal is to incorporate these new developments into PDE-constrained optimization algorithms, which, in addition to approximating the unknown wave speed of the medium, will also provide robustness with respect to noise and lack of information."

This conference will bring together researchers in the mathematical and biological sciences to share their latest findings in the use of mathematical models to study problems arising in population, ecological, and evolutionary dynamics, with a focus on the effects of environmental change. The participants will range from internationally recognized senior researchers to early career researchers and students (postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate). Participants will hear the latest research and findings from their colleagues and have opportunities to present their own research, in both formal and informal settings. During the two and one half days of the conference, there will be five plenary talks by senior researchers and approximate 80 other invited and contributed talks by other participants, including early career participants. It will be a time to establish new collaborations and to refresh established collaborations.  <br/><br/>The broad theme of the conference is the analysis of mathematical models for the temporal dynamics of biological populations. A special emphasis will be placed on the effects of environmental/climate change. Specific topics include: population and ecological dynamics; adaptation and evolutionary dynamics; dynamics of infectious diseases and epidemics; dispersal and distribution of populations; invasions and endangered species; management of natural resources. Mathematical models play a central role in population biology where the contribute towards an understanding of the consequences of climate change and of actions that can be taken to mitigate deleterious effects, such as species extinction and loss of biological diversity, habitat disruption and species dispersal, threatened managed systems of renewable natural resources, spread of infectious diseases, evolution of pathogen drug immunity. For this effort to be effective, modelers and biologists need to work in close collaborations. A major contribution of the conference will be to provide a venue for such interdisciplinary collaboration. The PI will invite participants whose research involves model derivation, the mathematical analysis of models, the use of model simulations, and interfacing models with data and observations. The plenary speakers will be encouraged to reach a broader audience, to give surveys of the current state of the research in their field of study, and to suggest new directions of research.

Remote sensing systems are either active or passive. An underwater array of acoustic sensors that seeks to locate a submarine (the source) based on the noise radiated from the submarine's engine is a passive remote sensing system. A mathematical model for passive remote sensing is the Inverse Source Problem. A sonar array that transmits its own (incident) wave to locate the submarine based on the properties of the echo, is an active remote sensing system. In this case, the array, not the submarine, is the primary source and the submarine is referred to as the scatterer because it scatters the sound wave in new directions. A mathematical model for active remote sensing is the Inverse Scattering Problem. Scatterers are also called secondary sources or induced sources because the primary or incident wave causes them to radiate a secondary or scattered wave. This terminology emphasizes the close relationship between the inverse source problem and the inverse scattering problem. Every scattered wave is a wave radiated by an induced source, the source is different for different incident waves, but the support (size and location) is always the same. The principal investigator seeks to elucidate the fundamental limitations that physics places on these technologies, and to develop algorithms to extract all information within these limits.<br/><br/>Rephrasing the uncertainty principle of Donoho and Stark in terms of inequalities for inner products and estimates on an underlying operator has made it possible to look for applications of these principles in new contexts, including the inverse source problem. Although the inverse source problem for the Helmholtz equation does not have a unique solution, the investigator has developed a well-defined notion of support for far fields radiated by unions of well-separated sources. The splitting operator decomposes a far field radiated by such a union of sources into the far fields radiated by each individual source. A major goal is to estimate the condition number of the splitting operator, and to develop algorithms to do the splitting and locate the individual sources. The condition number is estimated in terms of physically meaningful parameters, which are wavelength, diameters, and distance between sources. Another related objective is the development of norms and estimates for partial differential equations related to wave phenomena that, unlike many weighted norms, can be readily interpreted in physical units, and are therefore more easily accessible to the broader scientific community."

It is the goal of the Eighth Western Conference on Mathematical Finance to highlight research in these newly developing areas.  In particular, a special emphasis is given to asymptotics for parabolic partial differential equations, robust hedging, and stochastic portfolio theory.  Cutting-edge developments in asymptotics are required in order to solve challenging nonlinear partial differential equations in various financial applications with market frictions such as trading constraints, transactions costs, and asymmetric borrowing and lending rates.  Robust hedging methods are needed in order for market participants to mitigate risk effectively in the face of model uncertainty.

For example, the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics (which have numerous applications ranging from star formation to aircraft design) are in the form of a system of hyperbolic PDEs expressing physical conservation laws. Solutions of compressible Euler equations often develop discontinuities, which are known as shock waves; the latter are manifested as a sonic boom when an aircraft moves faster than the speed of sound. In general, solutions of quasi-linear hyperbolic PDEs can develop finite-time singularities. In this research, the investigator focuses on the compressible Euler equations and the nonlinear wave equations whose solutions form shock waves and cusp singularities (such as those that occur in liquid crystal equations) in finite time. The project uses both analytical and numerical techniques to enhance basic understanding of these equations. This research on singular behavior of waves is expected to lead to better understanding of fundamental features of hyperbolic PDEs. <br/> <br/>This research project seeks to deepen understanding of the structure of solutions with large data including shock waves. The issues of the variation of solutions and their propagation, the generic regularity of solutions, and understanding of behavior of solution near vacuum will be investigated. The second part of the project focuses on the quasi-linear wave system modeling nematic liquid crystals, where the solution develops a cusp singularity. The research contains a number of new approaches. In the study of Lipschitz continuous dependence, a Finsler type optimal transport metric will be utilized, since the standard Sobolev norms do not yield useful information. To study the generic regularity, the Thom transversality theorem will be used."

At the same time, recent applications in these fields require optimization techniques beyond convexity.  Although convex optimization techniques and numerical algorithms have been the topics of extensive research for more than 50 years, solving large-scale optimization problems without the presence of convexity remains a challenge.  In this project, the principal investigator aims to develop new theoretical results in convex and nonsmooth analysis, and new numerical algorithms, for the optimization of nonconvex functions that are not necessarily differentiable, especially functions that are the difference of convex functions.  Optimization problems of this sort arise in multi-facility location, clustering, machine learning, compressed sensing, and imaging applications.  The investigator and his colleagues develop, implement, and test numerical algorithms for solving such problems.  With no requirement on differentiability and convexity, these numerical algorithms bring new methods for solving complex optimization problems in different fields of application.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new theory of nonsmooth analysis and optimization methods for solving optimization problems without imposing conditions of differentiability or convexity.  Based on a variational geometric approach, the first goal of this project is to develop new results in nonsmooth analysis to deal with optimization problems in which the objective functions are nondifferentiable and nonconvex.  This approach provides a systematic development of nonsmooth analysis, making it accessible to researchers from different fields.  The second goal of the project is to develop numerical algorithms for solving nonconvex optimization problems, especially those whose objective functions are representable as differences of convex functions, and to apply them to problems in multi-facility location, clustering and hierarchical clustering, machine learning, compressed sensing, and imaging.  The investigator and his colleagues particularly focus on problems that involve different norms or constraints, requiring advances in smoothing and initialization techniques.  They address the important issues of existence and uniqueness of optimal solutions of the models, initialization techniques based on global optimization methods, implementation of the algorithms for comparison and testing on artificial and real data sets, and the convergence rate of the algorithms.  The results contribute to the development of nonsmooth analysis and its use in building and analyzing numerical algorithms for nonsmooth optimization problems that are not convex."

If the agents make their decisions dynamically, in an uncertain environment, the outcome of such interactions can be conveniently described by a continuum-player stochastic dynamic game.  The investigator pursues several research directions, unified by the idea of establishing the game-theoretic models, which on the one hand capture the real-world phenomena with sufficient precision, and on the other hand allow for tractable representations of the equilibria.  Such models can be used to establish quantitative results, i.e., to make predictions about the future evolution of a system, or to optimize the rules of interaction in the system.  The study of such classes of games is motivated by various applications.  As particular cases, the investigator considers models arising in market microstructure and systemic risk.  The results of the project can be used for predicting the potential instabilities in financial markets and for designing effective regulatory policies for financial exchanges and banking systems.  In addition, the class of systems analyzed in this project includes other relevant models in economics, neuroscience, and sociology, resulting in a large array of potential applications that may benefit society.  The educational component of the project includes designing teaching materials, for both undergraduate and graduate students, with stronger emphasis on the novel applications of mathematics to problems of finance and economics.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     While there are many abstract mathematical results for constructing equilibria in dynamic stochastic games, these results rely on assumptions that often are incompatible with realistic models.  The investigator considers several classes of large-population games that naturally fail to satisfy the standard assumptions, either due to the presence of stopping times in the agents' strategies, or because of the singular type of interactions between the agents.  In both cases, the standard fixed-point results cannot be applied directly to construct an equilibrium, due to the lack of required continuity or monotonicity properties.  The investigator studies several methods to overcome these difficulties, which lead to mathematical problems interesting in their own right.  This study contributes to the theory of continuum-player games (including, but not limited to, mean field games), optimal stochastic control, and the propagation of chaos.  In particular, this project addresses specific problems in the theory of backward stochastic differential equations with oblique reflection, as well as the questions of limiting behavior of particle systems with singular interaction through hitting times.  The results of this analysis provide new tools for equilibrium-based modeling.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project."

Network theory, which is the subject of this research project, provides a mathematical representation of systems like these which helps us to understand and predict their behavior.  This project focuses on modeling networked systems, using mathematical models and computer models.  Network models have seen impressive successes in recent years, in areas such as computer and information networks and epidemiology, but a fundamental shortcoming of previous work has been an inability to accurately represent network structure at both small and large scales simultaneously.  This project develops new classes of models that achieve this goal, thereby more accurately representing networks as they appear in real life and improving our understanding and ability to predict their behavior.  Specific goals of the project include: development of new multiscale mathematical and computer models of networked systems; testing and validation of models to demonstrate how well they capture the features of the systems they represent; model selection methods for determining how best to represent a particular system; anomaly detection in networks; improved computational methods to allow calculations to run efficiently on current computer hardware; and a range of specific applications, for instance to modeling of network resilience and the spread of disease.   <br/><br/>This project will develop and apply new classes of mathematical models for representing and analyzing networked systems.  Network models find wide uses in methods for the analysis of network data, such as community detection, embedding, and visualization, and as the foundation for simulation and modeling of network processes, such as resilience of systems to failure of their components, the spread of diseases over contact networks, or the design and refinement of network protocols and algorithms.   A fundamental shortcoming of current network models, however, is their inability to capture network structure accurately on both small and large scales.  Models based on local structural motifs, such as the configuration model or subgraph models, capture small-scale structure well, but fail with large-scale structure such as communities, stratification, or core-periphery structure.  Models that capture large-scale structure, such as block models, are normally locally tree-like and hence fail badly to capture the small scale.  This project will develop a new class of random graph models that naturally integrates the large and small, along with methods for analyzing the models' properties and for rapid Monte Carlo sampling.  Maximum-likelihood fitting methods will be developed to fit models to real-world network data, enabling accurate generalization, link prediction, and network reconstruction.  Statistical methods for the models will also be developed, including goodness-of-fit tests and model selection methods, along with specific applications, for instance to anomaly detection, network resilience, and epidemic modeling."

The microscopic structures associated with the materials give rise to many intricate properties and fascinating applications. These include various polymeric materials, viscoelastic fluids and liquid crystalline materials in chemical engineering, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in energy and power industry, electro-kinetic and electrorheological (ER) fluids in soft matter physics, as well as ionic solutions and electrolytes in cellular biology and physiology.  The study of these materials and their specific properties require state-of-art multiscale and multiphysics theories and techniques. For example, biology and physiology have shown that almost all biological activities involve the transport of charged particles and ions. This project aims at transferring some of those conventional empirical and phenomenal descriptions into modern quantitative models. The general framework of energetic variational approaches (EnVarA), motivated by the seminal work of Rayleigh and Onsager, has been proven to be with great advantages in studying the complex fluids,  such as charged ion transport in biological environments. The main theme of the research is to employ the general energetic variational approaches to derive and study the dynamics of various complex fluids with the applications. These real life problems also provide formidable challenges and great motivations for the development of new mathematical theories and techniques. The project will provide many opportunities for students and junior researchers to have multidisciplinary research experiences in mathematics, bioengineering, and physiology.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to make progress in the study of several physical and biological complex fluids. It focuses on the underlying energetic variational structures of the models, which capture and predict specific physical and biological properties. The investigator will continue the study of the coupling and competing effects from different spatial or temporal scales. One focus is on the diffusion dynamics of various materials in different environments, such as particles with size effects and electric Coulomb interactions, solutions with high concentrations in heterogeneous environments. All these are crucial in the study of dynamics of ion channel proteins in neurophysiology. Energetic variational methods have shown promises for the study of such multiscale multiphysics problems. Often the existing analysis and numerical methods are inadequate for these complicated problems of non-ideal materials, especially with couplings between fields and structures. The investigator and his collaborators will work on both the analysis issues arising from these studies, developing corresponding numerical algorithms and verifying with the experimental results. They will work with biologists on the study of several specific projects, such as the sensoring mechanism in voltage-gated channels. Self-consistent dynamic models will be derived, which include the flow field, dielectrics, hydration, and conformational changes in proteins.

The results to be obtained will expand the current theory of evolution problems on domains with moving boundaries. The research will also address new types of stationary problems, somewhat like eigenvalue problems but in a set-valued framework.  For various classes of stratified domains, the Principal Investigator expects to discover families of locally invariant ""morpho-stationary"" configurations, depending on finitely many parameters. These will generate a rich variety of new geometric shapes, that will be studied both analytically and numerically."

The main focus is on generation and use of scalable bases for kernel spaces; this is a new mathematical tool meant to stabilize and accelerate kernel-based algorithms.  Graduate students participate in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The classical kernel approach is prized for its ability to provide accurate solutions to computational problems with complicated geometry; in this sense, it is a meshless method, which does not require sampling at uniformly placed sites or the careful construction of triangulations, meshes, or other apparatus.  However, it can suffer from instability and heavy computational costs when the underlying problems grow in size.  It has been shown that in some cases these drawbacks can be mitigated by construction of scalable bases (as developed by the investigator and collaborators), which can be efficiently generated and lead to stabilization of the underlying calculations.  The primary applications considered are threefold.  First is the development of an adaptive, meshless method for treating elliptic PDEs.  The notion of adaptive refinement of meshes is well understood for classical finite elements; this aspect of the project seeks to use the scalable bases local construction (where basis functions decay at a rate determined by the local density of the scattered centers) to develop an adaptive algorithm where the centers are refined, but no remeshing is needed.  Second, the investigator employs kernel-based quadrature, accelerated by using the scalable basis as a preconditioner, to treat tomographic problems.  The aim here is to develop parameter selection and error analysis for approximate filtered backprojection of tomographic data acquired from a certain class of phantom images.  Third, the investigator develops algorithms for scattered data-fitting that reflect local sampling density of the data.  Graduate students participate in the work of the project."

Examples of this problem occur in speech recognition, quantum state tomography, x-ray crystallography, and electron microscopy.  The frame based phase retrieval problem is to recover a signal from the absolute values of its frame measurement coefficients. The central theme of this project lies in the investigation of the theory of phase-retrievable representation frames and its state-of-the-art applications in signal processing and information theory. The main objective is to establish the theoretical foundations for phase-retrievable representation frames and develop new representation frame based recovering algorithms that will address the computational cost problems in the existed recovering algorithms.<br/> <br/>The project will focus on three main problems in frame based phase retrieval. The first is representation frames and phase-retrieval. Due to their nice algebraic and/or geometric features, well-structured frames are excellent candidates for applications. This part of the project will focus on establishing the theory for finite group projective representation frames that admit phase-retrievable frame vectors. The goal is to completely characterize all such representations, and obtain simple and easily verifiable criterion for all the phase-retrievable frame generators so that they can be easily constructed for applications. The investigation on the representation phase-retrievable frames for ordered product of semi-groups is in line within the scope of representation frames and is directly targeting at applications such as dynamic sampling. The second project will focus on phase-retrieval for signals in the union of lower dimensional spaces. Many applications often face great computational challenges when recovering lower dimensional signals sitting in a very large dimensional Hilbert space. Building the theoretical foundation for the existence of phase-retrievable representation frames with much smaller length for such signals will greatly reduce the encoding frame length and obtain good characterizations for all such frames. The third project is on representation frames in erasure-corrupted signal recovering. Data transmission often causes erasures and other type distortions. In many cases the locations of erased frame coefficients are unknown, and/or the received partial data might be disordered. This project will investigate several practical problems with applications of representation frames in signal recovering from disordered partial frame coefficients and in the frame design problem for encoder-decoder protections."

Simulation solves the mathematical problems thus posed using computers to make quantitative predictions. <br/>Both modeling and simulation will be used to investigate a wide variety of phenomena in physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology, such as how microorganisms swim, how blood flows in the heart, the unusual properties of suspensions of bacteria or active particles, and how to efficiently design new materials. A unique element of the project is an experimental laboratory (Applied Mathematics Laboratory at the Courant Institute) that will provide raw data and motivation for mathematical models and simulations as well as measurements for quantitative validation. The Courant Institute is particularly well-positioned for this enterprise. Since early on, the Institute had a strong emphasis in applied mathematics, with modeling and simulation at its core. This research and training project will increase the number of U.S. citizens, nationals, and permanent residents who are well prepared to undertake careers that require a thorough understanding of applied and computational mathematics, not only in academics, as is the case with many educational mathematics programs, but also in business, industry, and government.<br/> <br/>This RTG program will emphasize the connections among modeling, simulation and experimental observation. The project, coordinated by five Co-PIs, will provide academic-year and summer funding for a growing number of Ph.D. students, starting from three and increasing to six by the end of the project, two postdoctoral scholars per year, as well as a number of undergraduate summer internships, for a duration of five years. The project will support the formation of a vertically-integrated activity which integrates a new research course, a seminar on oral and written presentation, a collaborative research seminar, visitor seminars and undergraduate summer research activities. A unifying theme of the study of passive and active particle suspensions will be used to build collaborations among computational scientists at Courant, the Applied Mathematics Laboratory, and the Soft Condensed Matter physics group at NYU's Physics Department. This research theme and the associated collaborations will serve as a framework for investigating other themes. For all themes, the research activities in this project will train students and postdocs to work in a multidisciplinary environment in which they have access to world leading experts in several disciplines. Furthermore, this research is expected to have substantial scientific impacts and to lead to new discoveries and potential applications.

Dynamical systems theory is devoted to the mathematical study of systems that evolve in time, including the gravitational n-body problem. The research in this project has direct applications to understanding the possible motions of celestial bodies such as planets, moons, and asteroids. But its primary importance lies in the development of new mathematical methods that can be applied in other contexts. From the mathematical point of view, the questions under study involve finding and understanding the solutions of a complex system of differential equations. Such equations are too complicated to solve explicitly, and instead are studied using a combination of computer simulations and theoretical, mathematical reasoning. <br/><br/>The planar three-body problem is a classical dynamical system with a long history that still presents formidable mathematical challenges. Many simple and beautiful periodic motions have been discovered, but only a few have been understood at the level of mathematical proof. The system is formulated as ordinary differential equations in five dimensions. Using Poincare sections, the periodic orbits can be found as fixed points of four-dimensional mappings. One part of this project is devoted to developing new topological methods for finding periodic orbits. One of the characteristic features of celestial mechanics is the presence of singularities. The behavior of orbits near collisions can be chaotic. There are several open questions in this area under investigation as part of the research. The simplest periodic orbits in the n-body problem are relative equilibrium motions that arise from planar central configurations. Understanding central configurations in the plane and their generalization to higher dimensions is another goal of this project. It is a difficult algebraic problem to find or even count the central configurations. The problems of finiteness of the number of central configurations and the question of stability of the resulting periodic solutions will be investigated."

An important class of such coupled systems have components with differing dynamic properties, whose coupling occurs at the interface of the different media in which each component evolves. The role of a control action is to force the system to behave in a desired, pre-assigned way: suppressing flutter, suppressing turbulence, hitting a target, etc. One eloquent illustration is flutter in aero-elasticity, a phenomenon that may occur when a structure is subject to a surrounding gas or fluid flow. It results in a periodic-like instability that can be fatal for structural stability due to fatigue of the material, such as the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940 during strong winds. In such flow-structure interactions, the control action of flutter suppression can be used to avoid structural failure. Another illustration of control is the suppression of turbulence arising in a fluid as part of fluid-structure interaction. Examples include body fluids flowing within arterial walls or veins and motion of a solid vehicle immersed in a fluid, be it an aircraft flying in the air, a ship or a submarine moving in water, etc. Another area of interest is non-linear acoustics, in particular high intensity ultrasound, which has innumerable uses in medical and industrial technology: lithotripsy, thermotherapy, ultrasonic cleansing, detection of cracks, concealed weapon detection, etc. This project aims to extend and deepen the mathematical underpinnings of control systems for these and other important applications.<br/><br/>The research project is focused on the study of control-theoretic issues for systems of strongly coupled partial differential equations (PDE), where the (active, passive) control action is exercised in the transmission conditions at the interface between two media. One example is a hyperbolic-like/hyperbolic interaction: a von Karman plate (displacement of an aircraft wing) sitting in the horizontal plane is immersed in, and interacts with, a 3D-gas flow which occupies the upper-half space and moves over the plate. The flow is mathematically modeled by a modified wave equation in terms of the flow potential, allowing various types of boundary conditions. Couplings occurs in each equation through the trace of the other variable. The normalized constant speed of the passing flow determines regimes: subsonic, transonic and supersonic. Mathematical studies of this system include: (i) well-posedness of various models under various types of boundary conditions; (ii) stability and attractors for the structure, to include control techniques for flutter suppression at both subsonic and supersonic regimes. Another example is the parabolic-hyperbolic interaction, which couples a fluid-gas equation inside the vessel with the full vectorial Karman (shell) dynamical equation, describing the external shell. Here again, mathematical studies of the system include (i) well-posedness and (ii) stabilization by means of stabilizing controls acting on the plate to transmit dissipation on the unstable fluid. In many acoustic applications, only the external boundary is accessible, not the interior. Control theoretic methods can also be applied to the acoustic equation, a third order (in time) PDE with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary controls. Specific topics of study include: (i) optimal regularity from the boundary to the interior and its trace (ii) exact boundary controllability, (iii) boundary stabilization; (iv) optimal control and min-max game theory with quadratic cost functional. The research involves a diverse set of tools including non-linear functional analysis, micro-local analysis, and Riemannian geometry methods."

While pure traveling waves and pure standing waves have been studied extensively in the past, real ocean waves generally contain more than two dominant frequencies and wavelengths. This project will develop mathematical and numerical techniques for studying quasi-periodic water waves. Traveling and standing waves are special cases with one and two quasi-periods, respectively.  The stability of these waves will also be investigated, including stability transitions. Of course, only stable solutions will be seen in the ocean or laboratory, but unstable solutions can be computed numerically, often completing the picture of how the stable solutions fit together. These methods will also be used to compute microseisms, which are geophysical elastic waves in the sea bed generated by nearly coherent standing waves at the ocean surface, and Faraday waves, which are surface waves on water or oil in a wave tank that self-organize into various standing wave patterns when the container is driven to oscillate with a prescribed motion. The numerical results of this project will be compared with wave tank experiments done by Diane Henderson's group at Penn State in the William G. Pritchard Fluid Mechanics Laboratory. Additional broader impacts include course and curriculum development, organization of seminars and minisymposia, advising of graduate students, and development of new computational tools with many applications beyond water waves.<br/><br/>The first technical goal of the project is to devise and implement a generalized shooting method for computing quasi-periodic solutions of differential equations.

Harmonic and subharmonic stability of standing waves and other relative periodic solutions will also be determined, with the goal of studying orbital stability, long-time dynamics, and quasi-periodic perturbations of relative-periodic solutions.  Subharmonic stability will be investigated using Bloch theory in space and Floquet theory in time, with solutions of the linearized Euler equations computed in parallel batches to compute the monodromy operator. Standing-wave analogues of the Benjamin-Feir instability will also be studied. A new approach to computing cyclic steady states and stability transitions of parametrically driven Faraday wave systems will also be developed, along with a new algorithm for computing the Dirichlet-Neumann operator in a cylindrical geometry using tensor products of orthogonal polynomials tailored to the cylindrical geometry and a variant of the Transformed Field Expansion technique. The Arnoldi algorithm will be used to compute the eigenvalues of the monodromy operator for the Faraday wave problem to obtain the largest Floquet multipliers.  The method can track families of solutions through unstable branches to yield a more complete picture of the stability transitions that affect pattern formation. Quasi-periodic forcing of Faraday waves will also be investigated."

The main insight from this theory is that a compressible signal can be acquired with much less effort than a signal with a high information content. However, these results are commonly based on mathematical models for signals that are already digitized and for sensors that measure randomly, which makes them somewhat disconnected from realistic physical signals and apparatuses. This work explores recent trends in narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Instead of digital signals, models for analog signals are used to define compressibility. The signal space includes the possibility of continuous changes without producing artifacts in the signal recovery procedure. This idea will be applied to radar, X-ray crystallography, and other sensing systems. The work is also anticipated to have application to neural networks that form the basis for modern machine learning algorithms. Although the application to machine learning is entirely concerned with digital data, the use of continuous models ensures that encoded information can be retrieved accurately. <br/><br/>Redundant, stable expansions with frames have become central to many applications of mathematics in data science, signal acquisition, and communications, from remote sensing to packet-based, wireless, fiber optical, or quantum communications and recently in compressed sensing and super-resolution. Despite the successes of the frame-based expansion and acquisition of signals, there is often a mismatch between the stylized mathematical signal and measurement models that are assumed and the corresponding physical models in the analog domain. For example, signal acquisition is typically described by specific linear functionals, not randomly chosen, unstructured ones. This research project addresses the need to improve compatibility between continuous and discrete representation spaces on a fundamental level. A typical model for analog signals is given by infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces with a reproducing kernel and an associated expansion with respect to a continuous, highly coherent family of vectors. A natural measure of sparsity of a signal is in this setting the minimal number of kernel functions needed in its expansion. Signal acquisition is usually based on sampling from a group-invariant, discrete family of functionals. The expected outcomes of the project include: (1) accurate recovery for signals that are sparsely synthesized in a finite- or infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel space and measured with physically relevant sensing models, using a sparsity-inducing norm that is stable with respect to continuous deformations; (2) phase retrieval, signal recovery based on magnitudes of frame coefficients, in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces such as multivariate Paley-Wiener spaces, which will be done using sparsity to demonstrate injectivity of measurements, stability, and feasibility of recovery algorithms in a general class of kernel spaces; and (3) a version of Mallat's scattering transform in a redundant representation with approximate invertibility based on phase retrieval and sparsity. The scattering transform extracts nonlinear features from data that are powerful descriptors in classification problems. It is designed from a viewpoint of desirable properties in the analog domain, but its application is mostly to digitized data of limited size, for which the claims need to be properly adapted. The investigators will use phase retrieval and sparsity to demonstrate the approximate invertibility of the transform, which is needed to verify the faithful encoding of data."

Morphological phases are complex geometric structures that form as structured patterns in physical and biological systems.  Examples include morphological phases in block copolymers, animal coats, and skin pigmentation in cell development.

In addition, pattern formation provides a longer ranging confinement of the locally self-enhancing process.  Studying pattern formation reveals the mechanical, optical, electrical, ionic, barrier, and other properties of these systems.  In this project, the investigator studies morphological phases in biological and physical systems having multiple constituents.  Often these phases have been observed in experiments where no current theory or models predict them.

Often, narrow-interface morphological phases can be approximated by their sharp interface limits, where constituents are fully separated by interfaces with no thickness.  In the sharp interface case this project investigates assemblies of tori, Hopf links, double bubbles, and triple bubbles.  Analytical methods are developed to use sharp interface morphological phases as skeletons to reconstruct morphological phases with narrow interfaces.  Through renormalization and an infinite-dimensional reduction technique, where Coulomb forces are treated as long-range interactions, free energies of lower-dimensional structures are derived.  Graduate and undergraduate students participate in the work of the project."

One of the principal subjects of investigation in this project is a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), for which macroscopic quantum phenomena become apparent. A BEC is a new state of matter that was first predicted theoretically by Bose and Einstein in 1924, and was produced experimentally in 1995 by Cornell and Wieman. Particles of a gas, cooled very close to absolute zero, occupy the lowest quantum state; then the gas forms a BEC. This state of matter has very unusual properties: for example, light in a BEC can be stopped entirely or slowed down significantly to the velocity of 17 meters per second. This project investigates dynamical properties of important quantum systems from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint, by using a wide variety of methods from mathematical analysis, applied mathematics, and mathematical physics. One of the phenomena to be studied theoretically is the emergence of quantum friction, when a particle passes through a BEC. The purpose of this work is to advance the understanding of physical phenomena based on first principles, whereby giving theoretical physics a rigorous mathematical foundation.  <br/><br/>The mathematical study of interacting Bose gases is an active research topic at the interface between dispersive nonlinear PDEs and Mathematical Physics. The mean-field description of a BEC is given by the nonlinear Schrödinger or nonlinear Hartree equations. In this project, the dynamics of a quantum mechanical tracer particle in interaction with a BEC will be investigated. Of particular interest in this model is the emergence of quantum friction. Furthermore, the dynamics of thermal fluctuations around a BEC will be examined based on the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equation that is obtained from the quasifree reduction of the original system. Other continuing projects focus on the dynamics of electrons in a weak random potential (describing materials such as semiconductors), and dynamics of a system of infinitely many fermions in the vicinity of a thermal equilibrium. As a new research direction, the well-posedness problem for the Boltzmann equation will be studied in its Wigner-transformed representation. This makes the model accessible to methods developed for the analysis of nonlinear Schrödinger equations and Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchies, such as Strichartz estimates for density matrices. These projects involve collaborations with various leading senior researchers, with a postdoctoral researcher, and with graduate students."

This research is aimed at understanding the formation and evolution of such coherent structures (that in some cases are amenable to mathematical analysis). A first question is their stability, that is, whether they persist even if they experience perturbations. Understanding the mechanisms of instability and stability is fundamental for many applications. An example is the importance in plasma physics and engineering of understanding mechanisms of instability, to enable design of devices able to contain plasma long enough for practical fusion energy production. Another topic is to understand the dynamical roles of coherent structures. For example, how do we explain the appearance of the large-scale structures observed in the atmosphere and oceans? What is the mechanism for an initially unstructured state to approach a final coherent state? Such problems are far from being thoroughly understood. Methods of mathematical analysis are the primary tools employed in this investigation. The rigorous mathematics makes it feasible to do stable numerical computations and to better understand the phenomena found in numerical and experimental studies.<br/><br/>One focus of the project is the stability problem for Hamiltonian partial differential equations with energy functional of infinite Morse index. They include gravity water waves (and many long wave models), nonlinear Dirac equations, ion acoustic wave equations, and Vlasov models for collisionless plasmas. In contrast to the cases with energy functional of finite Morse index, to date there are very few general tools for stability problems with infinite Morse index. Several models, including the regularized Boussinesq equation and two-dimensional Euler equation, will be studied, with the goal to develop some general tools for stability problems of infinite Morse index. Another focus of the project is the metastability of coherent structures and the persistence of invariant structures under small dissipation. They include the metastability of quasi-stationary flows of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation with small viscosity, and the inviscid limit of invariant manifolds of Navier-Stokes equations. Hamiltonian and geometric structures of the fluid equations will be explored in these investigations."

This also will allow the design of an effective algorithm coupling finite and boundary elements. In the case of the high frequency regime, the investigator proposes to (1) use asymptotic expansions of solutions of the Helmholtz equation, namely the normal derivative of the total field, to rigorously develop a O(1) high frequency integral equations solver, (2) analyze the stability and convergence of the resulting algorithms, and (3) suitably combine high performance computing with the new proposed methods to efficiently tackle real-life problems.

Solitons are very special solitary waves that move with constant speed without changing their shape; the most prominent example is a tsunami wave. The first scientific description of a soliton was given in 1834 by Scott Russell. The equation describing what Russel had observed was derived in 1895 by Korteweg and de Vries (KdV), but it was not until 1967 when the KdV equation was solved in closed form. The method of solution, the inverse scattering transform (IST), is regarded as a major achievement of the 20th century mathematics. It gave rise to soliton theory that is dealing with broad classes of physically important differential equations which can be solved by a suitable IST (such equations are also called completely integrable systems). The range of applications is enormous: from hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. Integrable systems have been primarily studied in the connection with propagation of waves initiated by rapidly decaying or periodic initial data (the ""classical"" data). The corresponding solutions have a relatively simple wave structure of traveling solitons accompanied by radiation of decaying waves, or periodic wave-trains and their modulations. However, any deviation from classical data leads to fundamental difficulties; it is the main focus of the project to overcome them. Entirely new types of solutions, with much more complicated wave structure and far-reaching practical applications, are expected to arise. The results could be used for understanding rogue waves, soliton propagation on different backgrounds (including noisy), tidal waves, certain meteorological phenomena (i.e. morning glory), or the study of propagation of coherent structures in noisy media (or in a general wave setting), in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma physics, astrophysics, etc. The project will have a very large educational component. The principal investigator (PI) will continue his research experience for undergraduates program to identify and mentor young scholars in the field of applied mathematics. <br/><br/>In the KdV setting the PI has reformulated the IST in terms of Hankel operators and Weyl m-functions. It lets one extend the IST to a surprisingly broad class of initial data. The PI plans to continue using these powerful tools to identify the broadest possible class of initial data for which a suitable analog of the IST exists. Another objective is asymptotic analysis of the underlying solutions. The most powerful approach is based on the Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem which also breaks down on such initial data in a number of serious ways. The main thrust will be put on understanding how to make the RH problem work far outside of the realm of classical problems. The results are expected to be instrumental for various applications. The accompanying mathematical problems are also very important to the theory of the Schrödinger operator, and the theory of Hankel and Toeplitz operators, fundamental objects of operator theory. Uncovering connections between soliton theory and Hankel operators is of great independent interest and could potentially have a profound influence on both theories."

Climate, weather, and aquatic ecosystems such as streams and lakes are intimately connected to each other.  This is especially true in mountain regions where glaciers as well as permanent and seasonal snowpack have major effects on physical (temperature), chemical (nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus), and biological (microbes, algae, fish) features of streams and lakes.  However, mountain environments are experiencing very rapid changes in climate, even more pronounced than global averages. Since mountain regions are like humanity's ""water towers"", we need a better understanding of what these changing environmental conditions mean for the quantity and quality of our water supply.  To best advance this understanding, scientists in different regions need to compare their findings and share their best practices of analysis and discovery. This project will support an intensive interdisciplinary workshop in which scientists, mathematicians, and engineers from the USA and China will meet to share data, develop collaborations, and make plans for further work to advance our understanding of how a changing alpine environment might affect lakes and streams and thus our water resources.<br/><br/>Ongoing climate variation is having major physical, chemical, and biological impacts on global ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems in mountain regions are especially impacted due to amplified temperature increases observed at high elevation and due to the sensitivity of key cryospheric components (glaciers, snowpack) to changes in temperature and precipitation. The ongoing changes in the cryosphere are widespread, complex, and affect a variety of key parameters for alpine lakes and streams such as temperature, transparency, discharge, and nutrient supply. The roles of natural variability versus external forcing in driving observed changes in snow and glacier distributions, as well as high elevation energy, water, weather, and biogeochemical cycles, need to be investigated. Documenting, understanding, and forecasting these impacts is challenging and requires broad interdisciplinary collaborations.

Tomography algorithms produce images (reconstructions) of the inside of objects from this indirect data.  Important types of tomography include X-ray, sonar, radar, and seismic imaging.  Standard tomographic algorithms work well with complete data--enough data to image the object accurately and stably (for example, X-ray data from views all around the body provides complete X-ray tomography data).  However, many tomographic problems have limited data--some data are missing and standard reconstruction algorithms typically do not image all features of the object and might produce artifacts in the reconstruction.  Added streaks and other artifacts are common in limited data reconstructions, and the results of this project will characterize the artifacts, analyze why they occur, and determine how to suppress them.  This characterization of artifacts will allow researchers to distinguish features of the object from artifacts in the reconstruction.  The research to suppress artifacts will provide algorithms that produce clearer reconstructions in which artifacts are less visible. Direct applications of this research include X-ray tomography, synchrotron imaging, seismic imaging, and radar.  <br/> <br/>This project focuses on inverse problems in tomography, which allows researchers to image the internal structure of an object from indirect data. There are many effective reconstruction algorithms that utilize complete tomographic data (for example, X-ray data from views all around the body); however, many tomographic problems involve limited data, in which some data are missing. The goal of this project is to develop new mathematical methods in micro local analysis to understand and solve limited data tomography problems. Currently, this paradigm is valid only for limited data sets with smooth boundaries that have specific orientations. The resulting reconstruction methods will be tested on industrial synchrotron data. The investigator will also analyze models for seismic imaging and develop the microlocal analysis of the normal operator and generalizations, including calculating its symbol. This calculation will be used to refine the operator so that the reconstruction highlights object boundaries and is uniform throughout the object. The symbol indicates which object singularities will be visible and which will be invisible in the reconstruction. The operator will be implemented using the approximate inverse and tested on data generated from the wave equation and real data. These methods will also be extended to bistatic radar applications, characterized by a transmitter and receiver flying independently in opposite directions."

Nonlinear waves are ubiquitous in nature. Examples include water waves, acoustics, the solar wind, vibrational waves in materials and laser beams, and propagation of nerve impulses, among many others. These disparate types of phenomena can be described by mathematical models that are based on hyperbolic, elliptic and dispersive partial differential equations and that are surprisingly similar to each other. However, the mathematical equations are extremely difficult to solve; in fact the nonlinear waves are considered as one of the most important problems in the analysis of partial differential equations. Although considerable progress has been made in the field over the past few decades, new important and challenging problems have been emerging in physics, engineering, industry, material sciences, biology, and other fields. The goal of the conference is to bring together leading experts in various theoretical and applied aspects of nonlinear waves to promote and enhance unifying techniques, to establish new connections, and to foster cross-fertilization among different fields of application. Relevant world-class experts and specialists will give research talks at the conference. The conference will provide an opportunity for students and junior researchers, including those from underrepresented groups in mathematics groups to get abreast with the latest achievements in the field and present their recent research results. The conference will disseminate research results and promote the research area through talks, webpage, flyers, and posters. The conference web site is www.math.pitt.edu/~dwang/pde2017.html<br/><br/>The conference will discuss the recent breakthrough work and substantial progress achieved in the following directions: water waves, kinetic theory, waves in novel media such as topological insulators and metamaterials, waves in nonlinear optics and condensed matter physics, and so on. Many unexpected connections were discovered linking these problems to each other, and/or to problems in other areas of partial differential equations and to emerging applications which previously appeared unrelated or had little impact on one another. This makes the conference especially timely."

The first concerns the mathematical analysis of the next generation medical imaging methods and contributes to the theoretical foundation of current density based imaging methods. Successful results will allow images with significantly higher quality and accuracy than possible with current medical imaging modalities. Such highly accurate imaging methods are crucial for early detection, diagnoses, and treatment of cancer, and provide alternatives for risky and invasive procedures and reduce the cost of treatment. The methods also apply to the analysis of electrical networks with a prescribed current, and will include the development of random walk models on graphs to describe transitions in conductivity. Random walks on graphs arise in many areas of science and the proposed research has direct impact in the analysis of computer and social networks, cryptography, epidemiology, statistical physics, economics, and biology.<br/><br/>The first part of the project focuses on the inverse problem of recovering the electrical conductivity inside a body from the knowledge of the induced current density vector field in the interior and Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. This hybrid inverse problem combines high resolution of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and high contrast of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) to provide images with high resolutions and high contrast. It is closely related to the weighted least gradient problems and 1-Laplacian equations with variable coefficients, and more study is needed on the existence and uniqueness of solutions of such problems. The second part includes the problem of determining the conductivity matrix of an electrical network from the induced current along the edges. It can be generalized to the inverse problem of determining transition probabilities of random walk models on graphs from the knowledge of the expected net number of times the random walker passes along the edges. The results from these fundamental mathematical questions will contribute to various seemingly unrelated specific real world applications and can be extended to many other areas. This project brings to bear a variety of mathematical tools from partial differential equations, calculus of variations, theory of minimal surfaces, geometric measure theory, and numerical analysis."

This theoretical instrument is a geometric count that describes the degree of instability of traveling waves and other more complicated patterns found in solutions of partial differential equations. It draws upon a broad array of tools, including spectral and perturbation theories, symplectic geometry, and Hamiltonian dynamics. While the Maslov index was originally introduced in an abstract area of mathematics, one of the major objectives of the current project is to demonstrate its fundamental importance in many unresolved and more applied problems. This approach can be used to study equations describing the combustion of solid fuels and the interaction of several chemical reactants evolving in time, as well as the stability of a regularized version of equations describing ideal incompressible fluids that has continued to challenge researches for more than three centuries.<br/><br/>Stability and instability of nonlinear waves and other patterns for multidimensional reaction diffusion and other partial differential equations, and the study of dynamics near these special solutions, are cornerstone issues at the crossroads of contemporary applied dynamical systems, partial differential equations, spectral theory of non-selfadjoint operators, and infinite dimensional symplectic geometry. The aim of this project is to develop and apply new methods in spectral theory of multidimensional differential operators, and address nonlinear stability for models in applied combustion theory, as well as general gradient systems of reaction diffusion equations, and many others. The project is built on a theoretical breakthrough recently achieved in these areas in computing the Morse index via the Maslov index. The Morse index counts the number of unstable eigenvalues of the linearization about the pattern, while the Maslov index is an invariant from symplectic geometry that counts the signed number of intersections of paths in the space of infinite dimensional Lagrangian planes. The principal investigator and his colleagues aim to to further develop the Maslov index approach by proving new Hadamard-type formulas for the derivatives of the eigenvalues and new spectral flow formulas for families of the differential operators obtained by linearizing partial differential equations about the traveling waves. The Maslov index calculations are being utilized in several open problems in applied dynamical systems: the gradient conjecture on Turing's patterns, the computation of spectra of nonlinear pencils, and the periodic problems for nonlinear Schrodinger equations. An important part of the project is the study of the multidimensional nonlinear stability of planar fronts for reaction diffusion systems arising in combustion theory of solid fuels and in modeling of exothermic and endothermic chemical reactions."

Therefore, there is an urgent need to study water resources, especially unfrozen fresh water in terms of surface water and groundwater.  Surface water and groundwater interact with each other.  A prime example is the hyporheic zone, a portion of the bed and bank of a river or stream where surface water and groundwater mix, exchanging solutes and water at various scales.  The hyporheic zone is critical to the ecology of river corridors.  In particular, it is important in controlling the flux and location of water exchange between stream and subsurface; providing a habitat for benthic and interstitial organisms; providing a spawning ground and refuge for certain species of fish; providing a rooting zone for aquatic plants; serving as an important zone for cycling of carbon, energy, and nutrients; providing a natural attenuation zone for certain pollutants by biodegradation, sorption, and mixing; and moderating river water temperature.  The purpose of this project is to develop and analyze better models of flows in the hyporheic zone in order to improve our understanding of the fundamental physical processes associated with hyporheic flows.  Graduate students participate in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The investigator and colleagues study the Navier-Stokes-Darcy-heat system that models coupled surface water-groundwater interaction together with thermal effects.  The mathematical model presents several challenges: the strong nonlinearity associated with the Navier-Stokes flow in the river, the complications arising from including physically and biologically important thermal effects, the substantial disparity of spatial and temporal scales between flows in the river and in surrounding porous media (small Darcy number), the uncertainty associated with the geometric form and the permeability of the riverbed and riverbank, and the different physics in different parts of the physical domain.  Although these difficult issues have been studied separately before for some subsystems of the models under consideration here, the need for a better integration of the physical and biological factors relevant to flow and transport in the hyporheic zone requires a more comprehensive model.  The work of the investigator proceeds in steps.  First is mathematical analysis of the model in terms of asymptotic behavior in the physically important small Darcy number regime.  Second, he designs, analyzes, and implements accurate and efficient decoupled numerical methods for the model so that the results can be compared to experiments performed by collaborators.  Third, he uses the model to assess the validity of various simplifications utilized by the water resources community in hyporheic flow studies.

The sonic surface is attached to the airfoil, and characteristics of the flow, such as drag and lift, change dramatically along the airfoil when the sonic surface is crossed. This causes a serious strain experienced by the airfoil. Mathematical description of this phenomenon is given by partial differential equations (PDE) of mixed type that are the main subject of this project. Other applications of similar equations are found in fluid and quantum mechanics, general relativity, bio-sciences, and plasma physics. Although these equations are widely used and serve as a foundation of some engineering tasks, for example, of the computer-aided design in aerodynamics, among others, and despite recent extensive studies of mixed type PDE, many fundamental mathematical questions concerning the behavior of their solutions are still unresolved. In this project, the Principal Investigator will study simpler, frequently used systems and classes of initial data that play a paramount role in understanding the wave interaction, asymptotic behavior of solutions and their stability. This project will also serve as a training ground for graduate and undergraduate students who will contribute to this research. <br/><br/>Several model systems of PDE will be studied whose solutions involve the so-called singular shocks, where at least one state variable develops an extreme concentration in the form of a weighted Dirac delta function. These can be used as building blocks for gaining a broader knowledge, insight and perspective on global in time existence of large solutions to systems of conservation laws in one spatial dimension. Differential equations in several spatial dimensions will also be considered. Simpler cases of solutions with spherical symmetry are among the principal topics of this project. Diverse tools from dynamical systems, geometry, harmonic and Fourier analysis will be used in this project. The ultimate goal of this research is to find building blocks that provide information on models of compressible fluid flow and can be used in a well-defined construction scheme to approximate solutions for any initial data."

The introduction of ideas from statistical physics in the search for approximate equilibria for sizable dynamic systems created new interest in the study of large populations of competitive individuals with ""mean field"" interactions. The search for equilibria in a mean field game is an attempt to identify and compute global statistics (macroscopic behavior) of large populations of rational individuals who optimize their own cost/reward trade-offs (microscopic behavior). The challenge is to understand and quantify the way the behavior of individuals affects the overall conduct of the population. Propagation of chaos and rational irrationality are terms that have been used to describe the possible macroscopic impact of individual choices at the microscopic level. This broad-brush description has its parallel in the structure of the mathematical models and analytical tools used to describe these phenomena. This project aims at a better understanding of the mathematics underpinning the models.  Special emphasis is put on realistic models characterized by the presence of a small number of major players and a large number of minor players interacting in a mean field manner. These models have important applications in population biology (bee swarming, bird flocking, and crowd motion), biology (circadian rhythm synchronization), sociology, behavioral economics, and finance.<br/><br/>The project focuses on a class of equilibrium problems for which symmetry is broken by the presence of two groups of individuals having conflicting interests. These models can be cast as mean field games with major and minor players. Special attention will be given to potential models that can be solved as the optimal control of McKean-Vlasov stochastic systems. One goal of the project is the development of numerical algorithms for the computation of Nash equilibria, hence the focus on models with finite state spaces. The second part of the project is devoted to the analysis of the recently-introduced mean field games of timing and again, the extension to models with major and minor players is a significant part of the research agenda. Finally, the project will compare the body of work on mean field games with the strand of economic literature concerning games with a continuum of players."

For example, cardiac bypass surgeries are required for infants born with congenital heart defects; however, approximately 50% of children develop brain injury perioperatively, leading to the damaging complications for survivors of congenital heart disease. Improved cerebral imaging techniques are needed to evaluate the effects of surgical procedures on brain perfusion. One of the most promising techniques for cerebral imaging are multiwave imaging methods such as photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography, which combine properties of different waves to obtain high contrast and resolution unattainable by traditional modalities.  This project is motivated by the possible application of multiwave imaging to monitor cerebral blood perfusion in infants. It aims to incorporate the complexity of media properties in the head (brain, vasculature, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, skull, skin) into these imaging techniques, while making these techniques more robust to noise and uncertainty. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are both theoretical and computational. The first is to identify general assumptions under which the photo-acoustic measurements render the simultaneous recovery of the internal source and the wave speed. This will be accomplished by expanding the mathematical theory concerning the simultaneous recovery of acoustic sources and media properties, which is one of the main open questions regarding photo-, thermo- and magneto- acoustic imaging. Based on preliminary work, the investigators have relaxed a-priori conditions under which simultaneous recovery is possible. The next step is to determine which conditions are essential and which ones can be removed. The second goal is computational and uses the intrinsic property of the photo-acoustic effect, which produces high contrast pressure profiles. The aim is to design novel discontinuous Galerkin methods for accurate, low dispersion simulations of high contrast pressure waves for use in new imaging algorithms. These methods are designed to achieve high performance on GPU architectures in the presence of realistic media and geometries. The third goal is to incorporate these new developments into PDE-constrained optimization algorithms, which, in addition to approximating the unknown wave speed of the medium, will also provide robustness with respect to noise and lack of information."

Specifically, the first project studies the time dependent events that underlie fluid turbulence, events that are too fast to have ever been resolved either in experiments or theory. These events underpin the energy cascade in fluid turbulence, and have immense technological importance. Resolving them is a long-standing problem in fluid mechanics, which is highly related to the question of regularity of the Euler equation.  The second topic is a mathematical and computational study of the shape of the nasal cavity, and how it affects the airflow and functionality of the nose. It has long been known that the shape of the nasal cavity changes dramatically across evolution, ranging from dogs with complex labyrinth like internal cavities, to humans who have short internal cavities. This project aims to develop a mathematical framework to understand how the origin of these changes. The third project aims to develop new mathematical methods for aiding drug discovery. Currently there is no efficient way to search the space of small molecules to discover ligands that are relevant for drug targets. Such a search must both find molecules that bind to relevant protein targets and don't bind to unintended targets. Advances in high throughput screening has generated enormous datasets for the interaction between proteins and small molecules.  The PI and his collaborators have shown that a method for associating ligands with protein targets based on random matrix theory has higher accuracy than any other published methods, and this project aims to develop this method further to impact the drug discovery pipeline. The broader impact centers around both personnel development of graduate students, undergraduate students and postdocs, and the development of educational materials for teaching science and mathematics through cooking. The teaching initiatives on science and cooking have reached nearly 250,000 people through an online class.<br/><br/>The study of the events underlying fluid turbulence will focus on the collision of two antiparallel vortex filaments. The PI and his collaborators recently published an analysis suggesting that such a collision could lead to a cascade of structures on ever smaller scales, due to the breakdown of a similarity solution of the Biot Savart equations that asymptotically governs the collision. These solutions will be tested both computationally and experimentally in the experimentally realizable problem of the collision of two vortex rings. The research team will numerically track the development of small scale structure, compare them to parallel experiments, and develop a mathematical description of the smallest scales in fluid turbulence. The study of the fluid mechanics of the nasal cavity begins with CT images of noses from different organisms, together with a CFD code for solving the flow field to generate the flows. The research team then will develop an approximate analytical description of the flow through a tortuous cavity that allows understanding of these results. Scaling laws will be developed based on these solutions to arrive at a mathematical description of the design principles. The study of protein ligand binding is centered around deviations from the BBP threshold of the Marcenko Pastur distribution of random matrix theory. By incorporating more information about the chemistry of ligands into this description the research has the potential to improve predictive power for utility in the drug discovery pipeline."

Fundamentally, the difficulty arises because variations in the material structure are on the same scale as the optical wavelength. Brute-force approaches thus require very fine discretization of the materials and a very large number of parameters, which is frequently computationally infeasible. The investigator and collaborators aim to develop new mathematical techniques that allow extraction of important properties and features of a system without the need for full simulation. In medical imaging, an initial image could thus be reconstructed in real time. Such an initial image can be useful in itself, or used as input to speed up the run time of high-resolution methods. In design of materials, the energy losses of a material can be estimated to provide qualitative insight into the potential suitability of the material and thus accelerate the construction of the next generation of optical devices. Several graduate and undergraduate students will participate in related research projects.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to solve several open problems related to optics and photonics of heterogeneous materials. The project will involve four main components. The first is to find a complete characterization of boundary effects in periodic optical materials. While boundary corrections in homogenization theory are notoriously difficult to understand, they have a large effect on the resulting fields. A large class of periodic optical materials can be studied by new asymptotic techniques that will allow us to fully characterize the role of the boundary.  The second is the derivation of explicit formulae for various spectral properties of periodic scatterers. This includes the transmission eigenvalues, which can be read in the far field and provide information about the medium. The third is to develop a new reduced order model approach to inversion of elliptic operators. The method employs ideas from model reduction theory, and originates from a breakthrough in a previous spectrally matched grid approach that allows application to higher dimensions and general geometries.  The last goal is to derive explicit calculations of the resonance values for multiple linear and nonlinear scatterer interactions. The investigator and collaborators use spectral asymptotic perturbation methods to understand the behavior of multiple-scatterer resonant interactions, both for linear materials and for Kerr effects."

The PI considers the problem on a partial differential equation (PDE) model. Specifically the PI uses a nonlinear Schrodinger equation coupled to the trajectory of a classical particle, obtained after taking the mean field limit on the Bose Einstein condensate. The PI will prove the following three results: (1) if the initial speed of the classical particle is higher than the speed of sound in the Bose Einstein condensate, i.e. supersonic, then the particle will decelerate due to the friction until the speed reaches the speed of sound, (2) if the initial speed of the particle is subsonic, then the particle will travel ballistically as the time goes to infinity, (3) the whole system will converge to some inertial mode. Technically, the PI has to develop a better understanding of integro-differential equations, together with other techniques in nonlinear PDEs, for example Fermi Golden rules. The second problem is the resonance problem. The PI wants to consider the problem in the context of linear and nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Very often the presence of degeneracy, or resonance, in perturbation expansions makes the problem hard. The PI hopes to develop a better understanding of normal form transformations, and then to tackle some of the problems in Schrodinger equations. The third problem is to develop a new method for geometric flows, specifically mean curvature flow and Ricci flow. Different from the previous works, by Huisken for example, the PI mainly uses modulation equations and spectral analysis to perform almost precise estimates, instead of the maximum principle and entropy estimates. Hopefully the PI can solve some open problems here. For example, in the context of mean curvature flow, the evolving surface will collapse in finite time and form a cylinder around the collapsing point. However, whether the cylinder is unique is an open problem. The PI hopes to solve it, also a similar problem in Ricci flow.<br/><br/>Quantum friction has many applications nowadays. One example is to test the speed of particles, for example neutrinos, by shooting the particle to some medium, for example argon. This phenomenon is known as Cerenkov radiation (Noble prize 1958). Despite its importance, the mathematical understanding of Cerenkov radiation is not satisfactory. In a broader context, the problem is in the class of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and quantum fluid, which are popular at the moment. The second problem, the resonance problem, will deepen the understanding of normal form transformations, and help to tackle other problems, for example, in dynamical system (specifically KAM theory), and spin model in quantum mechanics. For the third problem, in the recent years, people have applied mean curvature flow to classify topological structures of different surfaces, and have estimated the amount of mass in general relativity.

Similarly, multiscale processes with built-in uncertainty are common in many large-scale societal phenomena, from stock market behavior to propagation of information through social media. The mathematical subject is partial differential equations (PDE) with random and highly oscillatory coefficients, and the project is aimed at deriving effective models that incorporate the impacts from the randomness and the separation of scales. The project is expected to result in connections to multi-scale algorithms, inverse problems, imaging, and uncertainty quantification, as well as to have applications in subjects such as climate prediction, geophysics, and materials science. <br/><br/>The project involves three investigations, with a focus on questions related to stochastic homogenization, wave in random media and stochastic PDE: (i) study the quantitative aspects, including convergence rates and statistical fluctuations, of stochastic homogenization and macroscopic models of wave propagation in random media; (ii) analyze the effects of different correlation properties of the randomness on both qualitative and quantitative aspects; and (iii) investigate the transition from deterministic to stochastic models, and study the convergence to stochastic PDE beyond the homogenization regime."

The microscopic structures associated with the materials give rise to many intricate properties and fascinating applications. These include various polymeric materials, viscoelastic fluids and liquid crystalline materials in chemical engineering, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in energy and power industry, electro-kinetic and electrorheological (ER) fluids in soft matter physics, as well as ionic solutions and electrolytes in cellular biology and physiology.  The study of these materials and their specific properties require state-of-art multiscale and multiphysics theories and techniques. For example, biology and physiology have shown that almost all biological activities involve the transport of charged particles and ions. This project aims at transferring some of those conventional empirical and phenomenal descriptions into modern quantitative models. The general framework of energetic variational approaches (EnVarA), motivated by the seminal work of Rayleigh and Onsager, has been proven to be with great advantages in studying the complex fluids,  such as charged ion transport in biological environments. The main theme of the research is to employ the general energetic variational approaches to derive and study the dynamics of various complex fluids with the applications. These real life problems also provide formidable challenges and great motivations for the development of new mathematical theories and techniques. The project will provide many opportunities for students and junior researchers to have multidisciplinary research experiences in mathematics, bioengineering, and physiology.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to make progress in the study of several physical and biological complex fluids. It focuses on the underlying energetic variational structures of the models, which capture and predict specific physical and biological properties. The investigator will continue the study of the coupling and competing effects from different spatial or temporal scales. One focus is on the diffusion dynamics of various materials in different environments, such as particles with size effects and electric Coulomb interactions, solutions with high concentrations in heterogeneous environments. All these are crucial in the study of dynamics of ion channel proteins in neurophysiology. Energetic variational methods have shown promises for the study of such multiscale multiphysics problems. Often the existing analysis and numerical methods are inadequate for these complicated problems of non-ideal materials, especially with couplings between fields and structures. The investigator and his collaborators will work on both the analysis issues arising from these studies, developing corresponding numerical algorithms and verifying with the experimental results. They will work with biologists on the study of several specific projects, such as the sensoring mechanism in voltage-gated channels. Self-consistent dynamic models will be derived, which include the flow field, dielectrics, hydration, and conformational changes in proteins. The group will also carry out analytical and numerical studies on projects such as nonlocal diffusion, various dynamic boundary effects, and thermal effects."

Aggregation systems include nanoparticle self-assembly, actin-filament networks in cells, and more. This project investigates aggregation systems with an eye towards insect swarms, bird flocks, fish schools, and other biological groups in which social interactions play a key role. The specific objectives are (1) to discover whether computationally challenging models can be accurately approximated with simpler, more tractable ones; (2) to use this understanding to model environmentally and economically destructive locust swarms; and (3) to classify complicated behavior in large data sets related to aggregations. The locust research impacts agriculture. In particular, it will yield insight on swarm suppression strategies. For instance, it may suggest crop-planting layouts that would avert the gregarious locust outbreaks that devastate farmers. Other key elements of this project, which is based at an undergraduate institution, include: extensive undergraduate student involvement and research training; a network of domestic and foreign colleges and universities; a pipeline from research to the classroom; enhancement of student research lab infrastructure; inclusion in research and advising activities of a female recent Ph.D. seeking a tenure-track position; a focus on the participation of underrepresented groups; and an educational public art exhibition on aggregations produced collaboratively with an undergraduate female artist and biology major.<br/><br/>The investigator and his colleagues study aggregation systems from continuum and discrete perspectives. A common aggregation modeling framework is conservation-type nonlocal PDE, which are analytically and computationally challenging. Degenerate Cahn-Hilliard approximations of a class of canonical models will be investigated with linear analysis, numerical simulation, phase plane analysis of equilibria, and a variational analysis of minimizers in order to evaluate the success of the local model in approximating the nonlocal one. Based on this understanding, the investigator will develop a model of phase polyphenic locusts interacting with the environment and use it to develop strategies that suppress destructive locust swarms. Stability analysis and numerical simulation will reveal environmental conditions likely to suppress a hysteretic bifurcation to a dangerous locust swarm. Finally, the investigator will characterize aggregation dynamics using topological data analysis. Data sets arising from numerical simulations and biological experiments will be analyzed with topological barcodes describing their persistent homology. This work will identify dynamical transitions in aggregation processes."

This symposium particularly seeks to connect women and other underrepresented minorities in similar fields of mathematics or statistics from universities in the New England area, as well as to promote collaboration and share strategies for addressing issues facing these groups. However, the symposium is more broadly inclusive, and hopes to benefit a larger community. The symposium is open to everyone, regardless of gender identity. The symposium will feature two plenary talks, in applied dynamical systems and geometric group theory, three tutorials, including one on public key cryptography, and one in data science, short talks by students (graduate and undergraduate), post-doctoral fellows and faculty, a poster session, and a panel on effective mentoring. A meeting of members of AWM (Association for Women in Mathematics) Student Chapters will also be convened during the symposium. The symposium seeks to have a broad representation from pure, applied and industrial math, and encourages participation from researchers in all areas of mathematics, applied mathematics and statistics.<br/><br/>This pan-New England symposium will serve to build bridges between universities and connect researchers, particularly upcoming and younger researchers, women and underrepresented minorities, in similar mathematical fields. The geographic proximity of these universities makes it more likely that networks formed at the conference can be sustained and strengthened, which in turn should increase the probability that these researchers stay in the field and become highly productive members of the community. The symposium lays a strong emphasis on vertical integration, namely having representation at all levels, from undergraduate students to faculty, as we believe this is particularly beneficial to achieve the objectives of the symposium.<br/><br/>The symposium website is: http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/aah/WINRS/index.html"

In some situations, however, the actual forces depend strongly on the geometry of the cracks themselves.  A classical example is that of mud-crack patterns induced by evaporation, which is itself strongly influenced by the development of new crack surfaces.  Other problems of this class are commonly encountered in hydraulic fracturing, fracture in ferro- and piezoelectric materials, corrosion stress fracture of metals, environmental stress fracture of glass and polymers, fracture of electrodes in lithium-ion batteries, thermal cracks, and ion diffusion in cements.  In this project, the investigator constructs rigorous models for such diffusion-driven fracture problems, develops computer codes for the models on parallel supercomputers, and uses the models and codes to study specific problems of interest in industrial, engineering, and scientific applications.  Graduate students participate in the work of the project.<br/><br/>Variational phase-field models of fracture, originally devised by the investigator and further developed in the applied mathematics community, have seen an explosive growth in the last few years.  Their main strength is their ability to address two of the most critical issues in the quasi-static fracture of brittle materials: crack path identification and crack nucleation.  While mathematicians are typically concerned to find the equilibrium displacement and crack configuration of a solid under a given load, in many situations the loadings must be derived from a secondary problem and may be affected by the fracture geometry.  These include hydraulic fracturing, fracture in ferro- and piezoelectric materials, corrosion stress fracture of metals, environmental stress fracture of glass and polymers, fracture of electrodes in lithium-ion batteries, thermal cracks, and ion diffusion in cements, which have been studied in a largely ad hoc manner.  The goal of this project is to establish a strong theoretical foundation for phase-field models where the fracture is driven by a diffusive process.  The investigator and his students implement these models and release them as open source software.  They use these mathematical and computational tools to study three-dimensional crack nucleation under diffuse loads in two and three dimensions.

One such example is ionic solutions in animals or humans. Biology and physiology has shown that understanding ionic solutions is essential in almost all biological activities. The mechanical and electrical interactions of molecular-scale microstructures with macroscopic flow in complex fluids can give rise to new phenomena not encountered in simple fluids or gases. New mathematical theories and techniques are needed to resolve the ever present fundamental issues such as the ensemble of micro-elements, the intermolecular and distortional elastic interactions, the coupling of hydrodynamic transport and the applied electric or magnetic fields. This project investigates the use of a very general energetic variational framework to derive and study the dynamics of complex fluids, and its applications to general viscoelastic fluids, the hydrodynamics of electrolytes and electro-rheological fluids, and the transport of ionic solutions in ion channels. The proposed research also provides the opportunity for students to have multidisciplinary experiences in mathematics, bioengineering, and neurophysiology.<br/><br/>This project aims at making several distinct mathematical advances and to integrate studies of these physical and biological complex fluids from different fields.

The PI will focus on understanding the coupling and competing effects from different spatial or temporal scales, among them the microstructures and the macroscopic properties of the solutions, the kinetic transport and the induced elastic stresses in viscoelastic materials, the relative drags and interactions between different species in mixtures. Energetic variational methods have shown promise for the study of such multiscale multiphysics problems, for instance the transport of ionic solutions through biological environments. They deal naturally with systems with many components that flow between fixed and moving domains or boundaries, and with different interactions.  We will apply such variational methods to study the transport of biological plasma, ionic solutions of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, and their interaction with different environments and structures."

However, it often happens that observations of consequences are available, and one needs to identify the causes that made the observations possible. The latter type of problems are known as inverse problems. Inverse problems are characterized by their high sensitivity to errors in the measurements and the models used, the existence of not just one but several possible solutions, and their computational complexity. This project focuses on one particular but central aspect in inverse problems: Assume that a very detailed and complex predictive model exists, known to be able to produce predictions that match well with observations. Furthermore, assume that the model is computationally very demanding, and it contains numerous parameters whose values are unknown or poorly known. To solve the inverse problem in the required time frame, it may be that a simplified, or reduced model, needs to be used. Given that inverse problems are sensitive to errors in the model, it typically happens that the model reduction introduces an uncontrolled error, or discrepancy between the model and reality, that may render the solution of the inverse problem completely useless. The investigator and his colleagues have proposed a general methodology to handle the modeling error problem in the statistical framework, and in this project, the aim is to develop the methodology further so that it allows a reliable way to find a useful solution with limited computational resources, and to quantify the reliability of such solution. The main applications in this project are in the field of medicine, including mapping of the brain activity, identification and localization of stroke using a portable equipment, and development of fast and portable computing tools to model blood flow, but the results also have applications beyond medical applications. <br/><br/>The technical difficulty in handling the modeling error in an inverse problem is that it depends on the unknown cause that the inverse problem is seeking. However, the Bayesian statistical paradigm provides a very natural solution to this problem. In the Bayesian context, the unknown of primary interest is described as a random variable that has an a priori probability distribution, and therefore, it is possible to estimate a probability distribution of the modeling error and include it as part of the likelihood model. This basic observation has been shown to lead to algorithms that dramatically improve the estimates compared to results that ignore the modeling error. In this project, the methodology will be developed further, by carefully following how the inclusion of the modeling error distribution affects the Bayesian posterior distribution of the unknown, and conversely, how the modeling error distribution can be updated after the data is used to update the prior density of the unknown. Such tracking will hopefully lead to a computationally efficient way of quantifying uncertainties in the inverse solutions in the presence of modeling errors.  One family of problems the project addresses is multi-scale inverse problems, in which the unknowns of primary interest are describing fine-scale behavior of the system, while the observation represents a macroscopic, coarse scale quantity. These types of problems often appear in biological applications, where the high-fidelity microscopic models are often stochastic in nature, and cannot be handled directly in the standard Bayesian framework."

Mathematically, these phenomena can be modeled by partial differential equations (PDE) with both nonlocal and nonlinear terms. This project is devoted to the study of a variety of nonlocal equations arising in fluid mechanics and biology, such as the two-dimensional Boussinesq equation arising in the study of atmospheric fronts and oceanic circulation; the aggregation equation, which models the collective behavior of animal groups; and a two-species system motivated by coral broadcast spawning. Many fundamental mathematical questions about solutions of the equations under the investigation in this project are unanswered. Nonetheless, the equations and their numerical solutions are widely used for understanding and prediction of natural phenomena. This research aims to enhance confidence in the validity of these equation for modeling natural phenomena and to provide a firm theoretical foundation for applications. The goal of this project is to rigorously study whether solutions to nonlocal equations can form a singularity in finite time, and what is the long-time dynamics if the solutions do exist globally in time. <br/><br/>This project contains three different but related directions of research on the singularity and asymptotics for nonlocal PDEs. The first direction concerns finite-time singularity formation in fluid equations. For some variations of the two-dimensional inviscid Boussinesq equation, the goal is to use the ""hyperbolic flow scenario"" to construct a solution that blows up in finite time at a boundary point. The second subproject is devoted to a nonlocal PDE with a gradient flow structure, where particles/individuals tend to repulse each other in short distance and attract each other in long distance. The question is whether in the long run solutions converge to a global minimizer of a certain energy functional, or dissipate to zero. The third direction deals with a two-species system, where two densities evolve under diffusion, reaction and chemotaxis, and the goal is to investigate how the chemotaxis term would affect the long time dynamics of this system. In each of these directions, the investigator plans to apply and develop various analysis tools such as energy methods, gradient flow theory, and comparison principle methods to analyze the dynamical features of the solutions. This project will advance the mathematical understanding of nonlocal PDEs and related applications, and will also provide education and training to students in this active field."

The investigators examine how eddies in fluids drive surface wave dynamics and how underwater currents that vary with depth affect nonlinear waves.  They also study wind-driven waves and the effects of wind gusts.  The first problem is related to the behavior of shoaling tsunamis in the presence of submerged eddies.  The second leads to better understanding of the heights and velocities of surface waves over underwater currents, and can contribute to understanding how pollutants and micro-organisms propagate along underwater currents.

Examples include power and communication networks in technology, neuronal and genetic networks in biology, as well as social and economic networks, to name a few. Understanding behavior of these systems requires advanced mathematical techniques for studying dynamics in complex networks. This project will use mathematical modeling, analysis, and numerical simulations to elucidate the link between the structure and dynamics in complex networks. In particular, the investigator aims to find new ways for describing network organization in dynamical models and study critical phenomena, such as the onset of synchronization and emergence and bifurcations of spatial patterns in networks of coupled oscillators. The results of this research and the tools that will be developed in its course, will enhance our ability to understand, predict, and control the behavior of real world networks. <br/><br/>The mean field approximation is one of the most effective analytical tools available for studying large ensembles of interacting dynamical systems. Originally developed for problems in statistical physics, this method has been extremely successful for studying collective dynamics in coupled oscillator models of various physical, chemical, biological, and technological systems. The analysis of synchronization in the Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators and the bifurcation analysis of chimera states rely on the mean field equation formally derived in the limit, as the number of oscillators goes to infinity. Despite its spectacular success in applications, the mathematical basis of the mean field approximation of coupled dynamical systems on networks is not well understood.  In this research, the aim is to derive and rigorously justify the mean field description of dynamics of coupled systems on convergent families of graphs. This advances the mean field theory for coupled systems in two ways: first, by extending the main results of this theory to a large class of random networks, including those with small-world and scale free connectivity, and, second, by relaxing the key regularity assumptions, blocking the application of this theory to real world networks. The new theoretical results are used to study the onset of synchronization in systems of coupled phase oscillators with spatially structured interactions, stable dynamical regimes in the Kuramoto model on power law graphs, and pattern formation in neural fields in random media."

Together with the Navier-Stokes equations, which take into account the effect of friction in fluid motion, they are applied in a wide variety of natural and technical situations, for example when modeling the lift of an aircraft wing or the circulation of water in the oceans. Although these equations were first conceived more than two hundred years ago, some of their fundamental mathematical properties are still not well understood. The difficulty lies in the fact that all the equations describing fluids show a strong tendency for ""small scale formation."" This is seen, for example, in the formation of very small vortices and irregularities in the flow that ultimately cause turbulence. In this research project, the investigator and collaborators study the formation of irregularities in fluid flow from a mathematical point of view. The goal is to give a detailed analysis of the mechanisms that lead to small-scale formation.<br/><br/>The projects concern detailed research on geometric singularity formation for certain model equations of fluid dynamics. These model equations are inspired by the Euler equations for three-dimensional, incompressible fluid flow. The overall goal is to gain a better understanding of the complex mechanisms leading to singularity formation in finite time, and also the exact growth rates of quantities like the vorticity and vorticity gradient. The main difficulty comes from the nonlocal and nonlinear nature of the equations. In one of the projects, the investigator considers the hyperbolic flow scenario for the modified surface quasi-geostrophic and Boussinesq equations in two dimensions. The goal is to obtain insight into the hyperbolic flow scenario, which is thought to be a good candidate to ultimately create finite-time blowup for the three-dimensional Euler equations. In the remaining projects, the investigator considers one-dimensional model equations, for which the goal is to describe the singularity formation in as much detail as possible. An important overall theme consists in stabilizing the blowup scenario up to the singular time using barrier functions and a priori estimates that take detailed information about the structure of the solution into account.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the problem can be simplified by focusing on one salient aspect of the phenomenon and ignoring the others. The ""model equations"" that result from this process are generally easier to handle than the original equation. However, model equations are often derived using heuristic arguments, and attempts to confirm the accuracy of the models numerically can be inconclusive. One aim of this research project is to mathematically justify that model equations accurately describe the full equation. In some cases, analysis of solutions to such simplified model equations remains difficult, even to the point where basic facts about the behavior of such model equations (such as whether they can be solved for all times) are not known. A good theoretical understanding of these fundamental properties is important for providing confidence that the model in question is accurate. This project will explore ways in which an equation interacts with its model equations and vice versa, with the goals of a better understanding of both problems. <br/><br/>This project deals with research involving partial differential equations (PDEs), specifically the relationship between evolution PDEs and model equations derived from them by asymptotic expansion methods. The first and most fundamental question of study from a mathematical standpoint is rigorous justification: to give a mathematical proof that a model equation derived from a formal argument provides a good approximation to the original PDE in the appropriate regime. This entails providing quantitative bounds on the errors incurred in approximation. Since such models often involve small parameters, one must have a good understanding of the well-posedness of the underlying problem for large initial data and over long time scales, both of which involve technical challenges. The other aspect of this project is to explore the idea of constructing, for a given equation known to arise from such a modeling procedure, an artificial equation constructed to force existence of the model equation for all time. This provides a new method for demonstrating global existence of solutions to equations which may be lacking structure for applying existing techniques, such as a coercive conserved energy. The first step is to demonstrate that this method applies in the context of nonlinear Schrodinger equations, which is one of the fundamental equations of mathematical physics. This project aims also to generalize the method to analyze other important model equations in which conserved quantities are either absent or otherwise unsuitable for use. A famous example of such an obstacle is the ""super-criticality barrier"" that prevents the establishment of global existence in a wide variety of problems."

In this project, the investigators focus on physical effects that are often approximated or neglected altogether, but that are needed to predict accurately the observed behavior of ocean waves.  Examples include the dissipation of ocean swell during propagation across the deep ocean and subsequently onto the shoreline; the time-dependence of wind in the wave-generation process; and dispersion of waves in shallow water.  The inclusion of dissipation will lead to a better understanding of how wave energy evolves.  The inclusion of time-dependence in the wind that generates waves will allow for a better understanding of the initial period during which energy is transferred from air to water.  The inclusion of dissipation and dispersion in models for shallow-water waves will allow for better predictive capabilities of waves in coastal areas.  The research tools of the investigators include modeling, analysis, computer simulations, and laboratory experiments.  While the emphasis is on water waves, for which they can conduct laboratory experiments, the mathematical analysis is more broadly applicable to other physical systems and is of interest in the study of partial differential equations.<br/><br/>The investigators propose analytic, numerical, and experimental investigations of the following: (A) Deep-water waves.  They consider the frequency downshifting of freely propagating waves and wave generation due to wind.  They are considering two models of frequency downshifting that differ in how the rotational part of the flow is modeled.  To model wind-generated waves, they are allowing for time-dependent shear flows in both the air and water.  The resulting stability problem for waves is non-standard, and understanding how to address it is a central mathematical question.  (B) Shallow-water waves.  They seek accurate models of dispersion and of dissipation due to the bottom, wall, and surface boundary layers.  They will start with a Whitham equation and generalize it to include surface tension effects, dissipative effects, nonhorizontal bathymetry, and bidirectional waves.  They will look, both analytically and numerically, for small- and large-amplitude solutions, and study their stability.  They will further investigate how best to include dissipation that is due to the bottom boundary layer by comparing numerical simulations and experiments.  (C) Three-wave partial differential equations.  The three-wave partial differential equations, which arise in many physical applications, describe the simplest possible nonlinear interactions among dispersive wave trains, without dissipation.  The investigators propose a solution method using a Painleve-analysis to obtain the general solution for arbitrary boundary conditions. There are few examples of general solutions of partial differential equaitons, so their adding one more example would be a mathematical breakthrough."

The capturing of physical phenomena and data structure occurring at various scales requires approximation from locally supported multiscale systems relative to the application domains.  Moreover, these approximation methods should be amenable to fast and accurate computation.  Thus project aims at increasing our fundamental understanding of nonlinear approximation theory and its applications in three main directions.  The first objective is to develop nonlinear approximation theory in various geometric and nonclassical settings from multiscale systems that are well adapted to the targeted applications.  The second aim is to study the approximation of harmonic functions from shifts of the Newtonian potential, with targeted applications to geodesy, geomagnetism, and physics.  The third goal is to approximate functions that are smooth on domains in space separated by smooth curves or surfaces.  Here the idea is to use adaptively anisotropic multiscale dilations of the space, which enable the approximation tool to adjust to curved singularities.<br/><br/>     A core objective of this project is the development of nonlinear n-term approximation from frames and other systems in various geometric and nonclassical settings, such as on the sphere, ball, box, and simplex with weights, as well as in the context of Lie groups and Riemannian manifolds.  All these settings are covered by the general framework of Dirichlet spaces with heat kernel having Gaussian bounds.  The key point of the approach is to give us the freedom of dealing with (a) different geometries, (b) compact and noncompact spaces, and (c) spaces with nontrivial weights, and at the same time to allow for the development and frame decomposition of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces with complete range of indices.  The development of the underlying heat kernel theory and nonlinear n-term approximation from localized systems are basic aspects of this theory.  Another goal of this project is the development of nonlinear approximation of harmonic functions on the d-dimensional ball from linear combinations of shifts of the Newtonian potential.  This includes the complete characterization of the rates of approximation and the development of an effective algorithm that achieves the rates of best approximation.  Anisotropic phenomena appear in various contexts in analysis, partial differential equations, and in applications.  For instance, functions are frequently very smooth on domains in space separated by smooth curves or manifolds.  The project aims at resolving this kind of singularity of functions by using the framework of anisotropic multiscale dilations, which may change rapidly from point to point at any level and in depth.  The main strands of this approach are (i) the development of an algorithm for rapid construction of best or near best dilation matrices leading to optimal sparsity, (ii) the construction of highly localized anisotropic frames and their use in nonlinear approximation of functions."

The project includes an investigation of nonlinear waves, particularly, in shallow water. Because of nonlinearity, when one wave is superimposed on the other the waves are not just ""additive,"" as would be true in the linear case, but interact with each other. Such waves form complex wave patterns and have very important physical applications in the generation of large-amplitude waves, for example, in shallow water near a beach, or tsunamis. Understanding the nature and dynamics of such extreme waves, especially near highly populated areas is a significant and urgent task. The project also aims to investigate a new connection between classical special functions and a class of hydrodynamic systems which describe, for example, shock wave phenomena in gas dynamics. The research activities will involve graduate students who will be trained in the fields of both pure and applied mathematics, and will gain first-hand research experience. It is further anticipated that the results from the proposed work would be useful in the study of similar nonlinear wave phenomena that occur in other physical problems including nonlinear optics, particle physics and plasmas.<br/><br/>The PI will continue his work on geometric and combinatorial aspects of certain two-dimensional integrable systems, particularly, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation. The KP equation admits a large class of solitary wave solutions with complex two-dimensional wave patterns, which are sometimes referred to as the KP web-solitons. This project also aims to give a further investigation of the PI's recent study on a class of integrable hydrodynamic systems in connection with the generalized hypergeometric functions that are defined on the Grassmannian. This project has two main goals, namely, (1) to investigate the detailed structure of the complex two-dimensional patterns of the KP web-solitons using geometric and combinatorial theories, and (2) to construct and classify integrable hydrodynamic systems generated by the generalized hypergeometric functions. Also, the project includes ongoing collaboration with experimentalists in order to compare the obtained theoretical results on the KP solitons with laboratory experiments performed in water wave tanks."

Large-population games have traditionally been difficult to analyze due to the large size of the system and the game nature of the interaction. The theory of mean field games provides a useful way to approximate these complex systems, and the theory helps to improve understanding of the effects of interactions and how populations react to different compensation schemes or public policies. On the other hand, the 2008 financial crisis revealed the fragility of financial models. Since then, the urge to develop financial theories that take into account model risk has grown tremendously. This research project explores mathematical questions in mean field game theory and robust finance.<br/> <br/>The first part of the project analyzes a dynamic competition involving a large number of players, where the interaction among players is through the ranking of the completion time of their respective projects. The model applies to situations where many firms or individuals compete to be the first to achieve a goal. The objective is to understand the equilibrium and design a reward scheme that encourages early project completion given that the organizer has a limited budget, or to minimize the budget given a desired rate of completion. The second part of the project is concerned with the accuracy of the mean field game approximation, when in many applications, the typical size of competition is only modestly large. The objective is to study the fluctuation around the hydrodynamic limit of the mean field game approximation so as to improve accuracy. The third part of the project studies a mean field game of optimal stopping when the interaction among players is neither through the state process nor the cost structure, at least not in a direct way, but through the belief or information revealed from the action of stopping. The last part of the project considers pricing and hedging of contingent claims in a financial market under both transaction costs and model uncertainty, where model uncertainty is described by a collection of probability measures. In general the collection need not have a reference measure that dominates every other measure, and therefore, standard tools from functional analysis cannot be applied, and new techniques are called for."

Projects (a) and (b) provide rigorous results on random geometry. In project (a), turbulence heuristics are used to improve the known critical exponents for the isometric embedding problem in differential geometry.

Project (c) considers a basic model for vitreous systems in materials science. The purpose of project (d) is to quantify the `probability of difficulty' for several widely used algorithms in computer science. Both these projects are unified by the study of glassy behavior.

The first set of questions originates in biotechnology. Fast progress in modern biophysics requires new theoretical results on protein solutions (suspensions), particularly in the studies of protein diffusion and of transitions between globular and diffusive states. Diffusion processes in polymer solutions differ from classical diffusion -- while the diffusion coefficient grows linearly with temperature in the classical setting, it decreases near the critical temperature for proteins. A mathematical model for phase transitions in polymers will be developed, allowing one to explain this fact and to explore other near-critical phenomena. One of the possible applications is the analysis of the diffusion of medications in living tissue. The second part of the project concerns population dynamics. Some of the most important questions in this area concern the description of states that are homogeneous in space and time and the study of their stability with respect to local and random perturbations of the environment.

Three projects, unified by the general idea of instability, are pursued.  One of them deals with understanding instabilities in nonlinear elasticity associated with martensitic phase transitions, whereby sharp phase boundaries are observed experimentally.  Such phase transitions are responsible for shape memory effects in alloys, and for a giant magnetostrictive effect exhibited by some materials, to name just a few examples.  Another project applies new tools to analyze the extreme sensitivity to imperfections of the buckling stress of axially compressed circular cylindrical shells -- an essential structural component in a vast variety of structures, from grain silos to airplanes and space ships.  The third project focuses on quantitative understanding of a well-known confluence of rigidity and flexibility -- a seemingly contradictory combination of properties -- of Herglotz functions that are ubiquitous in applications from materials science to nuclear physics.  For example, the investigator's research quantifies the uncertainty due to experimental errors in the estimates of complex electromagnetic permittivity, which describes how a material interacts with electromagnetic waves of various frequencies from radio waves through visible light to gamma rays.  This project constitutes Ph.D. research of a graduate student working under the investigator's guidance.<br/><br/>     The most salient feature in martensitic shape transformations, which in particular is responsible for shape memory effect, is the presence of phase boundaries -- sharp interfaces separating different martensitic variants.  Stability of such phase boundaries can be completely characterized in terms of the concept of quasiconvexity.  With the understanding that characterization of quasiconvexity is often regarded as unachievable, the investigator and his collaborators focus on eminently computable algebraic conditions of stability of phase boundaries and assess their ""strength"" through specific examples that show how far off algebraic conditions are from true answers, which could be computed either analytically or numerically.  Another project deals with buckling of cylindrical shells -- one of the extensively studied, yet poorly understood problems in mechanics, where the classical formula cannot be used to predict buckling stress observed in experiments due to initial imperfections of load and shape.  This project creates a mathematically rigorous theory of the buckling of slender bodies that is capable of explaining why initial imperfections of shape and load have strong influence on the buckling stress in some structures, while having negligible effect in others.  The third project studies the somewhat paradoxical behavior of Herglotz functions, that are at the same time extremely rigid and surprisingly flexible.  Its understanding contributes to several areas of mathematics and physics and answers many important questions.  The problems of data validation, and extrapolation are addressed.  This project constitutes Ph.D. research of the investigator's graduate student."

Two major sources of these questions are models of rotating stars and galaxies, and models of deep water waves in the ocean. The study of equilibrium shape and density distribution of rotating stars is a classical question in the history of mathematical physics. Early efforts beginning in the eighteenth century were devoted to finding ellipsoidal shapes with constant density. In the twentieth century, major progress was made by solving equations describing compressible fluids, thus allowing a more realistic model of stars with variable gaseous density. The mathematical method used to construct such solutions involves putting the same amount of gas in different shapes and density distributions, and finding one with the least physical energy. However, such a method only provides proof for existence of solutions, without delivering too much information on the shape of the star, or how the solution varies as the rotation speed of the star varies. In this project, the investigator aims to provide new existence proofs using a different method, which involves continuously deforming the shape of a round, non-rotating star to arrive at a rotating star solution. The new method is intended to return information about shape and dependence on rotation speed. For deep water waves, the investigator will study certain important model equations that describe internal waves below the ocean surface as well as spectacular phenomena in the atmosphere, such as the ""Morning Glory"" cloud seen in northeastern Australia. The internal waves described by such models have practical significance; for example, internal waves can interact with surface ocean waves to produce rogue waves that can damage or destroy ocean vessels or fixed structures.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project aims to prove existence of rotating star solutions to the Euler-Poisson and Vlasov-Poisson equations, using an implicit function theorem type perturbation technique. Apart from proving detailed analytical estimates involving spaces adapted to the problem, the investigator will need to study the linearized operator by proving a vanishing theorem about a certain integro-differential equation for functions in the kernel. The research will study continuation of the solution curve to faster rotation speed using topological degree arguments, and discover possible breakdown mechanisms of the solution curve. In addition, the investigator plans to examine the phenomenon of mass bound on rotating white dwarf solutions to the Euler-Poisson equations, using both variational methods and spectral analysis. For models involving deep water waves, the project will explore the completely integrable aspect of the Benjamin-Ono equation. Building on previous work, the investigator will study existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic properties of the Jost solutions proposed in the Fokas-Ablowitz inverse scattering transform. These questions are closely related to the continuous spectrum of certain singular integral perturbations of the derivative operator."

Topological phases of matter, the importance of which has been recognized by scientific awards that include the 2016 Nobel prize in physics, exhibit many-body quantum entanglement. This makes such materials prime candidates for use in a quantum computer.  Topological quantum computation is maturing at the forefront of the second quantum revolution as a primary application of topological phases of matter. The theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution remains under development, but it appears clear that algebras and their representations will play a role analogous to that played by group theory in the first quantum revolution. This focused research group aims to formulate the theoretical foundations of topological quantum computation, leading to an eventual theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution. It is anticipated that the results of the research will guide and accelerate the construction of a topological quantum computer. A working topological quantum computer will fundamentally transform the landscape of information science and technology. The project includes participation by graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The goal of topological quantum computation is the construction of a useful quantum computer based on braiding anyons. The hardware of an anyonic quantum computer will be a topological phase of matter that harbors non-abelian anyons. A physical system is in a topological phase if at low energies some physical quantities are topologically invariant. Topological properties are non-local, yet can manifest themselves through local geometric properties. The success of topological quantum computation hinges on controlling topological phases and understanding their computational power. This research addresses the mathematical, physical, and computational aspects of topological quantum computation. The projects include classification of super-modular categories, vector-valued modular forms for modular categories, extension of modular categories to three dimensions, simulation of conformal field theories, topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries and symmetry defects, and universality of topological computing models. The research has potential impacts ranging from new understanding of vertex operator algebras to the development of useful quantum computers. One specific goal is a structure theory of modular categories analogous to that of finite groups. Such a theory would lead to a structure theory of two-dimensional topological phases of matter."
