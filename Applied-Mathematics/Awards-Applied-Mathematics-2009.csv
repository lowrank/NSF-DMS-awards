The project studies existence, uniqueness, and long-time behavior of large-data solutions in four problem areas:  (1) quasilinear wave equations (the Kuznetsov equation, together with its simplified version, the Westervelt equation) with degeneracy of the differential operator;  (2) problems in nonlinear viscoelasticity;  (3) the damped quasilinear wave equation as a model for unsteady heat conduction; and  (4) development of a new non-local theory in solid mechanics, called peridynamics, an extension of classical continuum mechanics to allow effective modeling of fracture in materials.  Among other methods, the PI proposes an original approach based on physical considerations to study existence of solutions for quasilinear hyperbolic equations. This approach enables one to show existence of solutions with arbitrarily large initial data starting from existence of solutions with small initial data. The ingredients needed (finite speed of propagation, uniqueness, energy identity) are available for many hyperbolic systems, hence the approach has potentially wide applicability.<br/><br/>Nonlinear wave propagation phenomena appear in vibrations of elastic bodies, in theories of acoustic pressure, plasmas, and semiconductors, and in quantum mechanics. The investigation of nonlinear wave equations poses great difficulty since the interaction of waves does not follow the principle of superposition.  Instead, the waves can generate new waves, blow up in  finite time, or vanish at infinity. The project involves developing new mathematical tools to determine the factors that play a dominant role in these interactions and to predict the long time behavior of solutions. <br/><br/>The problems under study model important phenomena in science and medicine: the lithotripsy model appears in shock wave propagation used in breaking up kidney stones; hyperbolic heat conduction is relevant in phase change transitions and superconductivity; and peridynamics is very promising in predicting fractures in material science.  Progress in these areas will benefit both academic research and industrial applications.  The PI has integrated her research efforts into the development of an interdisciplinary course, Math in the City, which attracts undergraduate students to study partial differential equations.  Under this program, students work in collaboration with local businesses and research centers to develop and analyze mathematical models that use real data. The project also involves graduate students and a postdoctoral associate in the research."

The project is particularly focused on interactions between fluid and structural bodies--so-called fluid-structure interactions--which are omnipresent in nature. For these fluid-structure dynamics, as well as for other physically relevant coupled PDE models, a nonlinear theory is generated which will culminate in: (i) The derivation of control laws for these interactive models which can be successfully invoked so as to stabilize or steer both the fluid and structural components; (ii) numerical algorithms so as to approximate the profiles of the fluid-structure variables, for either controlled or uncontrolled regimes. In this part of the project, it is anticipated that a major role will be played by nonstandard implementations of the Babuska-Aziz and Babuska-Brezzi ""inf-sup"" theories. By means of such variational formulations, the coupling between fluid and structure components on the boundary interface will be resolved; resolution of this coupling is at the very heart of fluid-structure analysis.<br/> <br/>The qualitative and quantitative information gleaned from this project will provide a better understanding of the various physical phenomena which can described by interactive PDE models. For example, a fluid-structure PDE can be invoked to model the immersion of red blood cells within the plasma component of blood.  These continuous and numerical approximation studies for modeling PDE dynamics would render it practicable to more accurately predict and simulate such blood flow dynamics. In particular, the project will culminate in the derivation of numerical algorithms which will be based upon the aforesaid Babuska-Brezzi variational formulations. As such, these algorithms would presumably have a higher degree of rigor than current available numerical methods. Moreover, the control laws we intend to consider in the project may lend insight into possible control engineering methodologies for the physical interactions governed by systems of coupled PDE's."

Though the methods under development will be broadly applicable to general conservation laws, the project focuses on three particular models: (1) the reacting Navier-Stokes model of combustion theory; (2) the Cahn-Hilliard equation of phase separation; and (3) a recent model of thin-film dynamics.  For (1) (combustion), the project goal is to identify distinguished solutions corresponding to combustive behavior (such as an explosion), and to categorize each as stable or unstable.  Each such solution corresponds with a particular speed of combustion, and so the rate of combustion can be found by determining which of these solutions is stable.  For (2) (phase separation), the project goal is to determine rates of phase separation.  In practice, the properties (flexibility, hardness, etc.) of a particular compound will depend on the amount of phase separation that has occurred in its development, and so the rate of phase separation is particularly important to industrial manufacturing.  For (3) (thin films), the project goal is to determine when a ""fingering"" instability will occur.  While the practical applications considered are on the scale of silicon chips, the basic idea can be understood on the level of painting a wall.  If a thin layer of paint is brushed across the top of a wall, we expect it to drip down in long vertical lines, or fingers.  The goal of this project is to identify conditions, in certain applications, under which such fingers do not form.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on certain partial differential equations (PDE) that describe conserved quantities such as mass, biomass, energy, or charge.  Such equations are often quite complicated, and generally speaking cannot be solved explicitly for general initial conditions.  Moreover, numerical evaluation of such equations can be extremely time-consuming, and results can be highly dependent on parameter values, which may not be accurately known.  In light of these difficulties, PDE of this type are often studied through consideration of certain distinguished solutions that represent specialized modes of behavior.  Once such a distinguished solution has been identified, a natural and important question regards its stability: roughly speaking, do general conditions exist under which the solution occurs/persists in nature? The primary goal of this project is to categorize distinguished solutions of certain standard PDE models as stable or unstable, and to use this information to understand the dynamics modeled by these equations.  The work will be of use in modeling a variety of important physical processes, including combustion dynamics and thin-film flow.<br/>"

Random dynamical systems arise in the modeling of many phenomena in physics, biology, climatology, economics, etc. when uncertainties or random influences are taken into account. The applications for this project will center on the dynamics of spike states, viewed as defects, for the Allen-Cahn or Cahn-Hilliard equation of materials science, oscillations in membrane potential and ionic concentrations within cells, and the motion of the molecular motor kinesin and its interactions with microtubules, all of which are subject to stochastic fluctuations. From the theoretical standpoint, Infinite-dimensional random dynamical systems may be generated, for example, by stochastic partial differential equations and random partial differential equations. The study of random dynamical systems involves both stochastic analysis and geometrical theory of dynamical systems. The investigator and his collaborators are establishing much of the basic geometric framework for multiscale, stochastic dynamical systems. In particular they are developing (i) The theory of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds for stochastic dynamical systems including the persistence and the existence of random stable and unstable manifolds and foliations; (ii) The stochastic Exchange Lemma for fast-slow systems; (iii) The theory of approximate normally hyperbolic manifolds in a noisy environment. These are linked with concrete analysis of nonlinear partial differential and integral equations of evolutionary type, with particular attention paid to the persistence and dynamics of coherent structures. <br/><br/>While many physical, biological, and financial processes appear to be subject to random or stochastic forces, there are also coherent structures underlying these processes which give some measure of predictability.  This project is laying the groundwork for the determination of these hidden structures and for analyzing specific situations arising in several applications.  Among these is a fundamental transport process within each cell of the body.  Here, molecular motors attached to rod-like fibers carry essential chemicals and waste products to and from active sites within the cell, allowing for growth, rejuvenation, mobility, and communication.  Understanding this process brings understanding of and perhaps therapies for debilitating and chronic diseases.  Likewise, understanding the mechanisms that produce coherent structures in complex materials can lead to the design of advanced materials with particularly useful magnetic, semiconducting, superconducting, or biomechanical properties."

One of the primary goals is to investigate, in the context of these systems, control and energy dissipation mechanisms that are restricted in some sense:  Either geometrically to a portion of the physical domain, and/or in the ""strength"" of the feedback as  in under- and over-damped systems.  The work will also address equations with non-dissipative controls (e.g. sheer force feedbacks for Euler-Bernoulli beams and Kirchhoff plates) which, in some cases, are more suitable for implementation, but whose energy-damping effects are not apparent and can only be studied via specialized techniques. The project is aimed at establishing the conditions on geometry, initial data, and structure of the controls necessary to steer/stabilize the system or, at least, ensure certain properties of the global attractors.<br/><br/>This research is expected to constructively impact engineering design in control of distributed parameter systems (e.g. acoustic and mechanical vibrations, thermal effects, electro-magnetic fields).  Maxwell equations and  stabilization of electromagnetic radiation arise in antenna design, nonlinear optics, semiconductor-superconductor modeling. Structure-acoustic interaction problems show up in a variety of areas ranging from active noise control to design of smart materials. In particular, study of acoustic-magneto-elastic coupling helps understand how to minimize noise from the gradient coils in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices. It is desirable to engineer controls that are minimally invasive and convenient for implementation, thus, prompting investigation of actuators and energy dampers that are restricted in space and their strength. The goal is to establish conditions under which such mechanisms provide sufficient control over the system, or to quantify their deficiencies when full effectiveness is unattainable. This work will also connect with applied numerical analysis both in research and in education:  Supplementary projects for undergraduate and graduate course will be developed offering a lower-level introduction to numerical methods for studying partial differential equations; a longer-term objective will be to augment some aspects of the above research with numerical algorithms in order to facilitate practical applications of these theoretical results."

However, EIT and OT are plagued by instability and low resolution. To overcome these difficulties, novel hybrid methods are being currently developed that combine different types of radiation (e.g., ultrasound and electromagnetic waves). The idea is to combine the advantages of these waves, while alleviating their individual deficiencies. Among these methods, the project will concentrate mostly on the Thermoacoustic Tomography, Ultrasound-Modulated Optical Tomography, and Acousto-Electric Tomography, as well as possibly some newer emerging imaging modalities. It is devoted to developing mathematical analytic and numerical tools needed in these techniques, which are currently in their early (sometimes infant) stages of development.<br/><br/>Computerized tomography is a major method of biomedical imaging, as well as of industrial non-destructive testing, geology, and other areas.  Various modalities have been developed, including for instance the usual X-ray clinical ``CAT scan'', MRI, Optical, Ultrasound, and Electrical Impedance Tomography. All of them have their advantages and deficiencies in terms of resolution, cost, and safety. Thus a quest continues for new safer, cheaper, and reliable methods. In recent years, novel hybrid methods have been emerging, which promise to become cheap, safe and effective medical diagnostics tools. The project addresses the mathematical issues that are central in their development, since images have to be obtained by complex mathematical procedures rather than direct acquisition. Besides the significant impact on the development and implementation of several new inexpensive and safe methods of biomedical imaging, one can also envision a possibility of applications to non-destructive industrial testing and other areas where imaging of non-transparent objects is required.<br/>"

The focus will be on two classes of complex nonlinear systems which, despite their importance and relevance to control applications, have not been extensively studied in the present literature.  The first class of systems to be investigated in the proposal consists of interconnected nonlinear systems described by coupled retarded functional differential-difference equations. Advances on this topic call for the development of new analysis and synthesis tools for this important class of infinite dimensional systems. Previously introduced design tools in the context of finite-dimensional systems are not straightforwardly applicable and extendible. The second class of systems consists of nonlinear and time varying MIMO (multi-input multi-output) systems. Most of the existing tools are targeted originally at nonlinear systems which are time-invariant and SISO (single-input single-output).  The aim is to contribute to the further development of advanced nonlinear control theory for MIMO systems, by introducing a toolkit of nonlinear feedback designs geared towards solving some challenging problems arising from the control of underactuated ships and bioreactors.<br/><br/>The research in nonlinear control systems is driven by the fact that few physical and natural systems in the world are linear and many of them are strongly and genuinely nonlinear. There has been a phenomenal progress in this important field over the recent decades, and more exciting advances are expected in the present and future. In this proposal, the principal investigators will take a step forward toward the further development of new control design tools for complex nonlinear systems arising from emergent control applications. The focus of the proposed research will be on new and important classes of complex interconnected nonlinear systems with special emphasis on applications in bioreactors. The applied mathematics nature of the project, combined with the fact that it involves challenging practical applications, will attract engineers and mathematicians who are not specifically working in the field, thereby stimulating new interactions. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will have a substantial direct impact upon education at both investigators' institutions by bringing students together from several departments.<br/>"

Stationary and time-periodic localized spots and rings, for instance, occur in autocatalytic chemical reactions, ferro-fluids, cavity lasers, and as vegetation patches in deserts. Sources are more complex patterns that can be thought of as defects that actively organize a spatially periodic background medium: they arise as planar spiral waves and as one-dimensional flip-flops in chemical reactions and as surface waves in fluids. This project aims at developing techniques to analyze the existence, nonlinear stability, and parameter dependence of coherent structures for general reaction-diffusion systems and for systems posed on lattices. Example projects that we will carry out are geometric singular perturbation theory for functional differential equations of mixed type, the analysis of planar and three-dimensional localized structures near Turing and Hopf bifurcations, and the nonlinear stability of sources in reaction-diffusion systems using pointwise Green's function estimates.<br/><br/>Coherent structures and nonlinear waves organize the dynamics of many biological, chemical and physical processes. Examples are pulsating combustion fronts, vegetation patches, nerve impulses, spiral waves in cardiac tissue, and localized convection rolls in fluid experiments. We will develop analytical and numerical tools to study under which conditions such structures appear and to determine their spatial extent and their stability properties as functions of system parameters. Among the potential technological applications are semiconductor lasers, which can exhibit localized hexagonal patches that may be used in all-optical storage devices, and fiber lasers whose optimization depends crucially on understanding the effect of design parameters on the power of the generated light wave.<br/>"

Most questions draw inspiration from the use of quantum graphs as models for quantum chaology, a branch of mathematical physics concerned with the properties of quantum systems that in the classical limit exhibit chaotic dynamics. The project addresses several open problems on quantum graphs and related systems that can be tackled within a 3-year time frame. Using graphs as models has already resulted in some notable successes, in particular in studying the universality of spectral statistics and in studying the nodal statistics of graph eigenfunctions. There remain, however, many important unanswered questions and some extremely promising direction that are addressed by the project.  The first is a foundation-type question of whether the spectrum of a generic graph is simple. Further, recent results on the number of nodal domains of graph eigenfunctions hint at the existence of a trace formula, connecting this number with the properties of the periodic orbits of the graph.  The PI studies the dynamics of zeros on an open graph (a graph with infinite leads attached) when the spectral parameter is varied.  The aim is to quantify the events in which the number of zeros changes. The PI also studies the correlations within the set of long periodic orbits (longer than the graph size) using a special type of graphs as a model.  Finally the PI is looking at ways to extend the diagrammatic summation schemes to new applied questions and also searches for algebraic structures unifying several existing diagrammatic schemes.  Possible direct applications to questions in combinatorics and computational molecular biology are considered.<br/><br/>The project addresses several questions of spectral properties of graphs where our current understanding is insufficient.  It also uses graphs as a model to explore questions for which the experimental answer is known but mathematical proofs are lacking and, furthermore, to explore questions for which even experimental answers are yet unknown. Namely, the PI works on a highly promising idea of establishing a ""trace formula"" for the nodal count on graphs.  If successful, this would be a break-through development, a first formula to tie together the structure of the quantum state (microscopic structure) with the structure of the classical closed trajectories on the graph (macroscopic structure).  So far, similar formulae were only available for the quantum energies of a system, and any information about the fine structure of the corresponding quantum state of the system is a great step forward. The PI also builds on his experience in a wide variety of research areas (mathematical physics, graphs and combinatorics) to search for the unifying algebraic structures behind semiclassical evaluation of the quantities related to the quantum transport.  Algebraic structures can help to formalize calculations in future questions and for different physical quantities; right now the calculations are performed in each case starting from the first principles.  The PI uses graphs to achieve deeper mathematical understanding in questions that are pertinent to other, more complicated systems, like quantum cavities.  Thus the questions studied in the project have direct relevance to mesoscopic physics and engineering.  Answering them holds the key to the quantum effects which happen on the scales that are within reach of today's chip manufacturers. Applications to combinatorics and computational molecular biology are also considered in the project. Quantum graphs also serve as a perfect educational medium for new researchers and students. The PI is writing an introductory text on quantum graphs and uses easier tasks within the project as graduate and undergraduate research projects.<br/>"

Examples include epidemic propagation, genetic regulation, synchronization, information propagation, and many more. Often, these dynamical processes have a modifying effect on the network structure. This project will study the bidirectional interaction of network structure and network processes. As an important and representative case, the synchronization of network-coupled dynamical systems will be studied when network links and oscillator parameters adapt in response to node dynamics. Network and parameter adaptation will be investigated numerically and analytically by developing averaged equations that describe the evolution of the network and oscillator parameters. Possible network fixed points, bifurcations, and attractors in low-dimensional subsets of the space of networks will be studied  as a function of various network measures and adaption rules. In a related project, percolation in non-Markovian networks will be studied. The effect of network structure on the percolation threshold has been studied for Markovian networks and for locally tree-like networks. The validity of the Markovian assumption will be tested for various networks arising in applications. Additionally, a way to determine the percolation threshold in non-Markovian networks that are not tree-like will be sought.<br/><br/>Network percolation is related to models of epidemic propagation, the propagation of information in a network, or the robustness of networks under attack or random failures. For example, in the epidemic context, the percolation threshold separates networks in which a disease will die out from those in which it will propagate to infect a significant fraction of the population. Our theoretical understanding of how network structure (for example, how people interact with each other during an epidemic) determines this transition is restricted to networks satisfying specific conditions. One of the goals of this project is to directly test whether or not networks found in practice, such as social networks, satisfy them. In addition, existing theoretical tools will be extended to networks that do not satisfy these conditions. Many processes that can be described in terms of networks, such as communication networks of unmanned aerial vehicles, food-chain networks, and neuron networks, do not take place on a static network, but on a network that changes in response to node dynamics. The other part of the project seeks to increase our understanding of how networks change in response to the processes that they mediate, and how they can be described as dynamical objects."

The conventional analytical methods traditionally used to approach the problems of turbulence are limited to subcritical regularity regimes not consistent with empirical observations.

The principal goal of the project is award developing analytical tools to study such solutions. We will obtain new frequency local estimates on the energy flux through dyadic scales; examine the Onsager-critical smoothness of solutions in the range of Besov spaces; use local energy estimates to study solutions in a variety of intermittency regimes including the classical Kolmogorov and fully intermittent regimes. We will revisit some of the fundamental regularity criteria for Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to improve the known sufficient conditions for the energy equality.<br/><br/><br/>Turbulence is an intricate physical process of complex motion of fluid elements constantly stirred by a mixing force.

The error-correcting quality of these codes<br/>can be measured by a variety of distance parameters that have<br/>been introduced in the engineering-oriented literature.  The main<br/>idea of the project is the investigation of convolutional codes<br/>based on the weight adjacency matrix, a single parameter that<br/>comprises, among other things, all those different distance<br/>measures.  So far two major results have been established by the<br/>investigator: a MacWilliams Identity Theorem stating that the<br/>weight adjacency matrix of a code fully determines that of the<br/>dual code, and a theorem stating that codes without non-zero<br/>constant codewords and sharing the same weight adjacency matrix<br/>are monomially equivalent.  These results open up new directions<br/>in convolutional coding theory.  Firstly, self-dual codes can be<br/>studied theoretically.  Besides the obvious fact that the weight<br/>adjacency matrix of a self-dual code is invariant under the<br/>MacWilliams transformation, the close link between self-dual<br/>convolutional codes and self-dual block codes obtained by<br/>tail-biting plays a crucial role.

While the stable scenarios have received a great deal of attention in the last twenty years or so, the behavior close to unstable solutions has been less well-studied. One reason is that unstable structures present themselves in a more challenging environment in terms of the mathematical techniques that must be used.

Roughly speaking, if one starts close to an unstable configuration, how does one make only small adjustments along the way, in order to stay close to the initial configuration?

In particular, the investigators are interested in the analysis of measurements of such waves if the (multiple) scattering takes place in the interior of a domain and the measurements are taken on its boundary. Milestones include: (1) an analysis framework for the scattering of jointly coherent and incoherent waves in a mixed model consisting of a macro multi-scale component, a random microscale component and coherent conormal singularities (the word ``incoherent'' is used advisedly; many would prefer the term ``diffuse'' if the phase relation between source of ambient seisms and the field that is generated is deterministic); and (2) the design of functionals of cross correlations and beyond, and associated sensitivity maps statistically stably resolving (changes in) the various (random) model parameters. This project develops methods for extracting information from ``noise''. The idea is to look at higher order statistical patterns in noise-generated data. As an example, imagine to estimate the distance to a wall by analyzing noise reflected off the wall rather than by analyzing the delayed echo of a coherent signal. In the project much more complicated situations are considered in which noise generated waves have propagated through a complex (random) medium before they are measured. The investigators will develop new techniques for describing waves that are affected by such a medium, in addition to algorithms that effectively process the mentioned data numerically to extract relevant statistical information and subsequent imaging. These will have applications in remote sensing, medical imaging and seismic imaging using ambient noise sources; the investigators will focus on the latter. <br/><br/>With improved theory the investigators can develop inverse scattering tools that have the potential to revolutionize the characterization of structures and processes (e.g., flow, tremors, seismogenesis) in the subsurface, on spatial scales relevant for regional studies (e.g., structure and microseismic activity of crust and upper mantle lithosphere; hazards) and hydrocarbon production (energy). The results can furthermore be applied to monitoring CO_2 sequestration. Large and dense sensor arrays that have become operative recently provide unprecedented opportunities for exploiting new theoretical insights to unravel, hitherto unexplored, complexities in the subsurface."

This research project is concerned with the analysis of the stability of fronts. The mechanism of the instability of fronts is defined by the competition between the rate of growth of perturbations and the rate of their transport.  In the convective regime perturbations to the front are transported away faster than they grow and thus decay pointwise. Critical information about nonlinear stability of the front is contained in the spectrum of the linearization of the system about the wave, but in many cases the spectral information is not definitive. That happens, for example, when the continuous spectrum of the linearized operator crosses the imaginary axis. Standard bifurcation theory techniques then typically fail. Reducing the domain for the system to some weighted spaces often works on the linear level, but there are serious issues related to the proof of nonlinear stability in the weighted spaces. One of the goals of this project is to develop general criteria for the convective nature of instability for classes of applied problems. An instability caused by the continuous spectrum can also manifest itself in the appearance of new local or global structures. Another goal of this project is to investigate whether the instability caused by the continuous spectrum may be the key point in the explanation of phenomena that are characterized by a sudden transition from one coherent structure to another.<br/><br/>Fronts arise in a variety of applied problems from different fields: optical communication, combustion theory, biomathematics (calcium waves in tissue, nerve conduction, population dynamics), chemistry, ecology, to name a few, therefore their stability is of a great interest. For many models the stability of a front in a full nonlinear equation cannot be simply inferred from the properties of its linear approximation. This project is focused on finding criteria for the convective (or transient) nature of the instability in such cases and investigating the mechanism of the transition between drastically different regimes within the same system, such as a sudden transition from a slow process to a much faster one. Capturing this phenomenon analytically will assist in predicting when the transition happens and exploring ways to control it. Progress in this direction will be of importance for applications in combustion theory, ecology, and biomathematics. The techniques of the analysis will be based on the relation between the geometric structure of the wave and its stability.<br/>"

While the analytic language of differential equations and maps is still the basis for most quantitative descriptions of scientific ideas, current scientific <br/>results are often obtained based on models which are not derived from first principles, for which many of the essential parameters have not been measured, and which often involve stochastic terms. The key objective of this project is to develop scalable computational techniques to provide correct robust information about global dynamics over large ranges of parameter values. Bifurcation theory implies that the cost for robustness is a coarse description. However, the fact that scientists and engineers are using numerical simulations of phenomenologically derived models to further their understanding of dynamic processes indicates that the information these techniques provide must be both quantitative and qualitative. Since the study of systems over broad ranges of possible parameter values produces <br/>considerable information, to be of practical use these methods must organize this information in an efficient, queriable manner.

The global dynamics is stored in the form of a database based on calculations for deterministic systems, but within the framework of these computations we will also explore how to predict the effects of noise on the observable dynamical behavior. These computational techniques will be tested on and applied to a variety of problems from mathematical biology. The biological models <br/>which will be considered are used to address central questions in biology including the role of the spatial environment in ecology and evolution and the robustness of the dynamics of signal transduction/gene regulatory networks. These activities will produce computational tools for global decompositions of dynamical systems, which will be made available to scientists and engineers for potential applications in a wide variety of disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>"

Complex fluids are distinguished from viscous fluids (e.g., water, oil) in that they require resolution of microstructure to resolve behavior in even the simplest of experiments. For single-phase complex fluids, the signature phenomena of shear thinning (viscosity falls with increased shear rate) and normal stress generation in shear (oppositely translating parallel plates experience a force along their mutual normal) are not captured by the Navier-Stokes model for viscous fluids.  Yet, these features are successfully predicted by the kinetic theory of single-phase polymeric liquids.  When combined to form multiphase mixtures, either in Nature (biofilms or lung airway mucosal layers) or synthetically (nano-rods or nano-platelets dispersed in a polymer matrix), the different fluid phases are prone to separate.  Other forces (chemical bonds and weaker attractive potentials) compete with phase separation to sustain the mixture, which are only reasonably understood for equilibrium states.  <br/>Outstanding challenges arise, and predictive tools do not yet exist, in far-from-equilibrium conditions typical of biofilms in streams or pipes, lung airway mucus layers propelled toward the larynx by coordinated cilia and tidal breathing, and flow processing of polymer nano-composites into films or molds.  A mathematically consistent kinetic theory for generic multiphase complex fluids, incorporating the physics and chemistry of individual phases, their mixtures and their hydrodynamics, will be developed in this research project.  A kinetic theory is only useful when accompanied by clear protocols for the derivation of reduced models applicable to benchmark experiments, numerical algorithms for each model reduction, and direct simulations to test the predictive capability of the theory with blind experiments.  These constructs will be developed, along with inference methods so that all physical parameters of a multiphase complex fluid model can be experimentally determined.  The generality and diversity of the theory will be demonstrated by detailed specificity to hydrodynamics of biofilms, mucosal layers, and polymer nano-composites. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Polymer nano-composites are new synthetic materials with extraordinary promise, consisting of a cocktail of a traditional polymer with property-boosting nano-rods or platelets.  Insight into why nano-composites are truly special can be appreciated from a simple fact: one percent volume fraction of nano-platelets in a single raindrop of polymer matrix introduces an entire football field of new surface area!  The novel features of number and size of particles together with new surface contact between the particle phase and the polymer phase overwhelm current experimental and theoretical capabilities.  Flow is impossible to probe experimentally (particles are too small and too numerous to track orientation and position) and there is no predictive theory, and therefore no simulation tools, to guide material design.  This project will develop the requisite theoretical and computational capabilities.  Similar challenges and limitations exist for mixtures of multiphase complex fluids arising in Nature, such as biofilms in streams, ponds, and pipes and mucosal layers between the air and tissue in lung airways. <br/> This research project will develop a mathematical blueprint for theory and simulation of the hydrodynamics of generic multiphase complex fluid mixtures. In this strategy, details of each phase in the mixture and the chemical and physical interactions between phases serve as inputs, together with the necessary experimental data to test the theory. The formalism will produce the theory specific to the multiphase fluid, the approach to derive model reductions for benchmark experiments, and numerical methods and simulations.  The general methods will be brought to bear on three diverse multiphase materials:  biofilms, mucosal layers, and polymer nano-composites.  These mathematical constructs will provide predictive tools for:  the design of novel high performance polymer nano-composite materials for defense and the aerospace industry; remediation strategies for biofilms in industrial pipelines; and, improved pulmonary health through simulations of mucus transport prior to and during drug and physical therapies.<br/>"

The focus will be on two classes of complex nonlinear systems which, despite their importance and relevance to control applications, have not been extensively studied in the present literature.  The first class of systems to be investigated in the proposal consists of interconnected nonlinear systems described by coupled retarded functional differential-difference equations. Advances on this topic call for the development of new analysis and synthesis tools for this important class of infinite dimensional systems. Previously introduced design tools in the context of finite-dimensional systems are not straightforwardly applicable and extendible. The second class of systems consists of nonlinear and time varying MIMO (multi-input multi-output) systems. Most of the existing tools are targeted originally at nonlinear systems which are time-invariant and SISO (single-input single-output).  The aim is to contribute to the further development of advanced nonlinear control theory for MIMO systems, by introducing a toolkit of nonlinear feedback designs geared towards solving some challenging problems arising from the control of underactuated ships and bioreactors.<br/><br/>The research in nonlinear control systems is driven by the fact that few physical and natural systems in the world are linear and many of them are strongly and genuinely nonlinear.

In this proposal, the principal investigators will take a step forward toward the further development of new control design tools for complex nonlinear systems arising from emergent control applications. The focus of the proposed research will be on new and important classes of complex interconnected nonlinear systems with special emphasis on applications in bioreactors. The applied mathematics nature of the project, combined with the fact that it involves challenging practical applications, will attract engineers and mathematicians who are not specifically working in the field, thereby stimulating new interactions.

The project focuses<br/>on two well-known partial differential equations modeling<br/>geophysical fluids: the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation<br/>and the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations.  The major<br/>objective is to develop strategies and effective approaches for<br/>solving the global regularity problem on the classical solutions<br/>of these equations.  The global regularity issue concerning these<br/>equations has recently attracted substantial attention and much<br/>important progress has been made.  However, it remains open in<br/>the cases of the inviscid SQG equation, the SQG equation with<br/>supercritical dissipation, and the inviscid Boussinesq equations. <br/>To deal with the inviscid or supercritical SQG equation, the<br/>investigator combines extensive numerical computations with<br/>analytic and geometric approaches.  The immediate plan is to<br/>study the curvature of the level curves in the spatial regions<br/>where the gradients are comparable to the maximal gradient.  The<br/>boundedness of the curvature in these regions would rule out any<br/>finite-time singularities.  The strategy on the global regularity<br/>issue for the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations is to<br/>gradually reduce the dissipation and thermal diffusion.  The<br/>first aim is at the case when there is only vertical dissipation<br/>or thermal diffusion.  In contrast to the recently resolved case<br/>with horizontal dissipation or thermal diffusion, the situation<br/>now is more sophisticated due to the ""mismatch"" of derivatives. <br/>To handle this case, new tools such as logarithmic type<br/>inequalities involving Sobolev norms of derivatives in different<br/>directions are developed. <br/><br/>     The three-dimensional quasi-geostrophic equations derived by<br/>J. G. Charney in the 1940s have been very successful in modeling<br/>large-scale motions of atmosphere and oceans.  The dynamics of<br/>these three-dimensional equations with uniform potential<br/>vorticity reduces to the SQG equation.  The SQG equation has been<br/>very useful in studying many weather phenomena such as<br/>frontogenesis, the formation of sharp fronts between hot and cold<br/>air.  Mathematically, frontogenesis corresponds to the<br/>fundamental issue of whether classical solutions of this equation<br/>can develop finite-time singularities.  This project helps<br/>improve the understanding of many weather phenomena governed by<br/>this equation.  Boussinesq equations model many flows in nature<br/>such as oceanic circulation, central heating and natural<br/>ventilation.  The study here of the potentially singular behavior<br/>of solutions to the Boussinesq equations not only yields a<br/>significant contribution to the mathematical issue of global<br/>regularity but also has potential environmental applications.

The financial markets provide the necessary liquidity for the rest of the economy to function well, and not understanding the nature of the risk taken, the mispricing of the risk and an inadequate oversight, can have dramatic impacts on the welfare of our society, as the latest crisis demonstrated one more time. Consequently there has been an intense research effort, which is embodied in the field of financial mathematics, to solve the new mathematical challenges. This new field takes its roots in stochastic analysis and also frequently interacts with other fields of mathematics such as the theory of partial differential equations and functional analysis.  This project resolves some fundamental questions concerning the important models of the field that remain unanswered.  Additionally, new models which take into account the discrete, asynchronous and non-stationary nature of the observations will be developed and the mathematical and computational challenges for new problems of interest will be resolved. Optimization problems from a retiree's perspective (with an objective criterion) and an institutional investor perspective (with risk constraints imposed by regulators) are to be analyzed. Developing parsimonious models and analyzing the inverse problems for structured credit products, which were developed to provide insurance against (correlated) default of issuers, is another goal.<br/><br/>More specifically, the first part of the proposed project will settle open problems in the theory of Optimal Stopping and related free boundary problems that arise in Financial Mathematics. The solutions in the second part have direct applications to many practical control problems since the nature of observations in many applications is discrete, asynchronous and non-stationary (i.e. the nature of the source of observation change with time). In the third part utility maximization problems with probability of lifetime ruin, occupation time, or other optimization and/or risk constraints will be considered. Optimal control/stopping problems with non-linear expectations will be discussed. These lead to new mathematical challenges which will lead to new methodological developments. The effects of uncertain investment environment and learning on the optimal investment strategies will also be investigated.  The dramatic losses in the credit derivative markets last year shows that appropriate modeling and pricing of credit derivatives is a challenging open problem. In the fourth path, the investigator will develop effective models, solve the corresponding inverse problems and price over the counter options.<br/>"

The investigator proposes to study the dynamics and control of various mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints, certain optimal control and navigation problems; and problems in quantum control with particular application to ion traps.  In particular the investigator will study nonholonomic systems with symmetries and the relationship of symmetry to dynamics, and nonholonomic integrability and its relationship to measure preservation. The role of the nonholonomic Hamilton-Jacobi equation in integrability will also be studied, as well as the relationship between the inverse theory of Lagrangian systems and nonholonomic systems.  The investigator will also consider he dynamics of nonholonomic systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom with possible applications to the dynamics of elastic rolling solids and sliding flexible blades. He will also study the control of quantum systems, in particular models of coupled oscillator/spin systems which model ion traps. This leads to problems in infinite-dimensional controllability and the study of the control of such systems in the presence of decoherence and dissipation.<br/><br/>The theory of nonholonomic dynamics is the study of mechanical systems subject to constraints imposed on velocities. Such constraints are typical for systems consisting of rigid bodies rolling on surfaces without slipping.  Nonholonomic systems occur frequently in practical mechanical problems including wheeled vehicles such as cars, bicycles and robots. A particular problem of interest is navigating robots around obstacles.  Nonholonomic dynamics is playing an important role in the development of nonlinear control and mechanical systems theory.  Quantum control is closely related to the control of nonholonomic systems because of the type of mathematics involved.  Many interesting new issues arise however such as the role of dissipation, decoherence and measurement.  Quantum control has become very important recently because of applications to quantum computers. We study here a particular system which has been proposed for computing computing: the ion trap.  Quantum control provides a very interesting extension of nonholonomic and nonlinear control and has important mathematical issues associated with it.  It is hoped that this research will lead to advances in engineering. The proposer continues to collaborate with many engineers and physicists.  The proposed program has a strong educational impact. Material related to this research will be used in an advanced dynamics class.  The research will also involve the work of Ph.D students and undergraduates."

However, the passage from microscopic wave equations to large-scale kinetics is a complicated problem in itself.  The goal of the first part of the project is to develop new tools and better understanding of kinetic limits, especially in the regime when random media have long range correlations that lead to multiple temporal and spatial scales for various wave phenomena. The second part of the project investigates the qualitative behavior of solutions of reaction-diffusion-advection equations, with the main focus on the effect of a fluid flow. The interaction of the mixing, dynamic, and geometric properties of the underlying flow and the effects of diffusion and reaction will be investigated.  The problem becomes especially complex in the situations where the feedback from the reaction process on the fluid flow cannot be ignored. The project addresses the quantitative study of the transport of the energy, momentum, and reactants in a Boussinesq reactive system, other reaction-diffusion systems with feedback, and flame-front propagation in random media.<br/><br/>This project carries out mathematical studies of wave propagation in cluttered environments and of reaction-diffusion processes in fluids. These studies are relevant to several branches of science, ranging from biomedical imaging to geophysics, fluid dynamics, and astrophysics. Imaging in a cluttered environment, whether it is a human body, earth interior, or foliage, is inherently unstable because of media complexity. One objective of this project is to develop imaging methods that are less sensitive to unpredictable fluctuations of the clutter.  Another area of this project concerns the mathematical description of the effect of a fluid flow on chemical reactions. Turbulent fluid flow plays an important role in many chemical phenomena: it may drastically enhance the rate of reaction, leading to higher efficiency, or, in some situations, extinguish the chemical process. The project will address these issues in simpler mathematical models to illuminate the mechanisms present in the full problem.<br/>"

The methods developed will be broadly applicable, but the immediate focus is on quantum dot nano-structures. Three different approaches will be used to accomplish this task. One of these will use KMC to deduce various parameters used in continuum models.  Another approach will be based on a new formulation of KMC which can be shown, using statistical mechanics, to be connected with the chemical potential. This will allow a fairly seamless connection between our KMC formulation and continuum mechanics.

The first project concerns mathematical models for granular flow that are based on systems of balance laws.  Results to date concern primarily one spatial dimension, for the case where the PDE system is weakly linearly degenerate.  Further theoretical issues in one space dimension will be addressed, including well-posedness of the system in the space of functions with bounded variation and effects of the source term.  Models in two space dimensions will also be studied, starting with radially-symmetric solutions.  The second project deals with the harvest of marine resources by several competing companies.  Due to the nature of the model, optimal strategies are defined in a space of positive Radon measure.  Research topics include existence of optimal control, necessary conditions and regularity of solutions, uniqueness of optimal control measures, and optimal location of marine parks, for a model in two space dimensions.<br/><br/>Both projects aim at problems that are not well understood.  Results of study of the slow erosion limit for granular flow promises to provide new techniques for analysis of the underlying partial differential equations.  The study of optimal fishery management will yield new results on measure-valued solutions to optimal control problems and differential games in two space dimensions.  <br/><br/>Models of important phenomena in materials science, ecology, and economic systems are naturally formulated in terms of the partial differential equations that are the subject of this research project.  Understanding the dynamic evolution of a snow avalanche (or landslide) and the effects of slow erosion could enhance the ability to plan for or mitigate such natural disasters.  Research on optimal harvest of marine resources will aid in understanding how marine resources can be preserved in a competitive economic environment.  The results of this project will apply to analysis of the equations underlying models of both of these important processes. <br/>"

While the analytic language of differential equations and maps is still the basis for most quantitative descriptions of scientific ideas, current scientific <br/>results are often obtained based on models which are not derived from first principles, for which many of the essential parameters have not been measured, and which often involve stochastic terms. The key objective of this project is to develop scalable computational techniques to provide correct robust information about global dynamics over large ranges of parameter values. Bifurcation theory implies that the cost for robustness is a coarse description. However, the fact that scientists and engineers are using numerical simulations of phenomenologically derived models to further their understanding of dynamic processes indicates that the information these techniques provide must be both quantitative and qualitative. Since the study of systems over broad ranges of possible parameter values produces <br/>considerable information, to be of practical use these methods must organize this information in an efficient, queriable manner. We expect the work proposed in this project will produce (1) reliable computational tools for global decompositions of dynamical systems by constructing a database in <br/>which the global dynamics is encoded in combinatorial and algebraic structures and (2) efficient methods for querying the database to identify dynamical structures and bifurcations of interest. <br/><br/>This work will address the fundamental question of determining global decompositions of dynamical systems over varying parameters. The global dynamics is stored in the form of a database based on calculations for deterministic systems, but within the framework of these computations we will also explore how to predict the effects of noise on the observable dynamical behavior. These computational techniques will be tested on and applied to a variety of problems from mathematical biology. The biological models <br/>which will be considered are used to address central questions in biology including the role of the spatial environment in ecology and evolution and the robustness of the dynamics of signal transduction/gene regulatory networks. These activities will produce computational tools for global decompositions of dynamical systems, which will be made available to scientists and engineers for potential applications in a wide variety of disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>"

The project on liquid crystals focuses on newly<br/>discovered bent core ferroelectric phases that are capable of<br/>sustaining polarization fields of just one order of magnitude<br/>below that of traditional solid ferroelectric compounds.  The<br/>goal of the work on hydrogels is to model a cyclic membrane<br/>appropriate for application to the design of pulsating drug<br/>delivery devices.

Both<br/>problems share distinctive phenomenology and mathematical issues,<br/>such as presenting a first order phase transition behavior<br/>between two distinguished states.  In ferroelectric liquid<br/>crystals, they correspond to the oppositely polarized states with<br/>distinct optical properties; a main goal is to optimize the<br/>switching speed between them.  Understanding and controlling<br/>hysteresis may help achieve optimal switching.  This also<br/>requires a good understanding of the rheology of bent core liquid<br/>crystal flow.  Mathematical issues involve non-convexity,<br/>metastability, and coupling of Maxwell's equations with fluid<br/>flow and elasticity.  Overall, ferroelectricity is an area of<br/>liquid crystals rich in phenomenology, modeling, and mathematical<br/>challenges that remain largely unexplored. <br/><br/>     It is often the case that seemingly disparate problems of<br/>science and technology have common mathematical underpinnings. <br/>In this project, the investigator addresses two of these<br/>problems, with applications in pharmacology and fuel cells as<br/>well as in optical devices, such as video and high speed Internet<br/>switching.

The Helmholtz decomposition divides the velocity into a rotational part and an irrotational part. In general, the rotational and irrotational velocities are both required and they are tightly coupled at the boundary, especially when the no-slip condition is applied. The project's goal is to develop a framework for the analysis of both components in the Helmholtz decomposition. Previous NSF supported studies of this topic by the principal investigator's group showed that the common opinion that potential flows are irrotational motions of inviscid fluids in general is not correct: it is neither necessary nor useful to put the viscosity to zero. There are essentially two irrotational theories: viscous potential flow and the dissipation method. Viscous potential flow works best for gas-liquid flows where the viscous normal stress is computed from the irrotational component. The dissipation method (introduced by Stokes in 1851) is based on the self-equilibration of viscous stresses for irrotational flow which do not give rise to forces in the equations: they do work and give rise to energy and dissipation. Unfortunately, predicting which of these two irrotational theories will give the better result is not known a priori but is one of the main goals of this study. <br/><br/>Viscous potential flow can be used to study a variety of physical phenomena, including cavitation, capillary breakup and rupture, Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (drop and jet breakup), phase change problems involving heat and mass transfer (nuclear reactors), the viscous decay of capillary-gravity waves, waves and rupture of moving thin films, Hele-Shaw flows (oil recovery), etc. It is important to recognize that the theory of potential flows of viscous fluids is a viable topic with a rich physical content."

The first set of questions relates to the<br/>mathematical theory of nonlinear elasticity, which studies large<br/>mechanical deformations of three-dimensional elastic bodies.  The<br/>investigator undertakes a long-term research program, with the<br/>scope of: deriving lower-dimensional shell theories through the<br/>methods of Gamma-convergence and understanding their connections<br/>with the geometry of the mid-surface, analyzing the<br/>(infinitesimal) isometries of surfaces and the effects of<br/>rigidity on the derived theories, studying nonlinear phenomena<br/>such as buckling and blistering for a given shell under<br/>compression (one application is related to plant growth).

A related long-standing<br/>problem in the mathematical theory of elasticity is to rigorously<br/>predict theories of such lower-dimensional objects starting from<br/>the nonlinear theory of full three-dimensional objects.  For<br/>plates, a very recent effort has lead to rigorous justification<br/>of a hierarchy of such theories, depending on the magnitude of<br/>the applied forces and resulting in stretching, crumpling,<br/>bending, or a combination of these.

In contrast to the usual models in the existing literature, the systems are often influenced by random environment as well.  For example, when two or more species live in proximity and share the same basic requirements, they usually compete for resources, food, habitat, or territory. Traditional models use (either random or non-random) differential equations for such scenarios. However, the systems are often subject to additional environmental noise, which cannot be described by the traditional differential equation setup. Other examples include insurance risk models and ion channel (biological nanotubes) dynamics among others.  The proposed project aims to take into such random environment and other uncertain factors into consideration. It presents novel algorithms for optimization tasks, designs numerical procedures for solving systems of equations, carries out identification task for systems with unknown parameters and limited sensor information, and obtains longtime behavior of systems involving both continuous dynamics and discrete events.  The models to be examined, the numerical algorithms to be developed, and the insight to be gained will jointly contribute to the field of stochastic optimization and make impact on the aforementioned applications.

The proposed shearlet approach encompasses the mathematical framework of affine systems and, to date, is the only method able to combine optimal sparsity (few coefficients to compute), fast transforms through the power of multiresolution analysis (fast computation) and full mathematical justification and framework (great flexibility and versatility).  The sparsity of the proposed shearlet representation is a direct consequence of its genuinely multidimensional multiscale character, and its fast implementation a consequence of its affine mathematical structure.  The project is organized into three main directions of investigation, with several specific goals.  First, the mathematical framework underpinning the shearlets is investigated to set the foundation for the construction and analysis of optimally sparse multidimensional representations.  Next these representations are applied to the decomposition of functions spaces and operators.  More specifically, the shearlets are used as building blocks of anisotropic function spaces.  This step has significant implications in approximation theory, in the study of Fourier integral operators, and for various nonstandard regularity spaces associated to partial differential equations.  Third, shearlets are applied to problems from image processing and image analysis.  Specifically, improved algorithmic implementations are developed and applied to image denoising, edge detection and shape recognition.  Tests are conducted on biomedical data to address specific application-driven problems, including geometric reconstruction of neuronal morphology from confocal images and neuronal classification.<br/><br/>Over the past twenty years, multiscale methods and wavelets have revolutionized signal processing and stimulated an impressive amount of research in mathematics and engineering.  In fact, wavelets provide optimally efficient representations of one-dimensional data and have fast numerical implementations.  As a result, wavelets are successfully employed in a number of strategic applications, including the new FBI fingerprint database and JPEG-2000, the new standard for image compression.  In spite of their remarkable success, wavelets are far from being optimal in general.  Even though they outperform other traditional methods, they fail to capture intrinsic geometrical features of multidimensional phenomena.  For instance, they do poorly at dealing with features such as the edges of an image or the boundary surfaces of a solid object, and, as a consequence, they are unable to handle efficiently the ever larger multidimensional data sets which are required by many modern applications.  By contrast, the approach addressed in this project is truly multidimensional and opens the door to a new generation of highly efficient methods for the storage, transmission and processing of data.  The applications arising from this research facilitate technological advances in sensitive applications such as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, data transmission and classifications, video surveillance, and storage of data."

Utilizing novel combinatorial structures such as Zinbiel and dendriform algebras, it unifies and systematizes solution techniques for a number of classical problems that include state-space realization of systems, applications to path planning, control of quantum systems, and geometric integration algorithms in scientific computing.  The second part is motivated by a practical control problem from semiconductor manufacturing and aims to extend proven approaches and methodologies to infinite dimensional systems that are governed by nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws.<br/><br/>This project studies the common mathematical structures underlying a distinguishing feature of many dynamical systems of practical importance: flows that do not commute.  This research has broad applications. These include:  Control designs exploit this feature to steer systems to any desired states by judiciously choosing the order in which control actions are taken.  In splitting methods of scientific computing the lack of commutativity of the pieces is a complication that needs to managed.  For quantum mechanical systems the lack of commutativity is in many ways the very essence of their nature.  Beyond the immediate contributions of theoretical insights, improved control designs and high performance computing algorithms, this project improves the education and technological infrastructure both horizontally and vertically: It connects combinatorics, control, and computation, with each other and with applications in molecular physics, biomedical and manufacturing systems.  It trains graduate students, provide undergraduates with meaningful first-hand research experiences, and it collaborates with existing initiatives to train participants from traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/>"

In particular, a special important class of solutions (self-trapped nonlinear localized states, often called solitons) of the underlying mathematical models will be studied both analytically and numerically. Three inter-related issues will be investigated: (i) determination and classification of all possible types of soliton states admitted by two-dimensional photonic lattices; (ii) determination of linear stability properties of these solitons; (iii) development of more efficient numerical methods for computing these solitons and their linear-stability eigenvalues. The mathematical models appropriate for these physical problems will be two-dimensional nonlinear Schroedinger equations with periodic or quasi-periodic potentials. <br/><br/>Nonlinear optics in periodic and quasi-periodic media is an exciting frontier of optics and applied mathematics these days. With appropriate engineering of micro-scale periodic structures, light propagation can be controlled and steered in various ways.

From a physical viewpoint, this project will lead to a deeper understanding on nonlinear wave phenomena in micro-scale periodic media. From a mathematical viewpoint, these studies will advance the analytical and numerical methodologies for the treatment of nonlinear waves in periodic media. In addition, this research is intimately related to research in areas beyond nonlinear optics, such as Bose-Einstein condensates loaded in optical lattices.

In recent years, the investigator and his collaborators have made considerable progress in identifying simple, descriptive conditions on observable characteristics, such as diversity or sufficient intrinsic volatility, which allow the construction of simple (based solely on observable quantities) portfolios  that can outperform a large equity market.  This project seeks to build on these results in order to understand the nature of optimal, that is, ""least-expensive"", arbitrages of this type, and their connections to stochastic analysis (exit measures for supermartingales, degenerate diffusions), parabolic partial differential equations (propagation of qualitative properties such as convexity), and the fine structure of financial markets (the onset of arbitrage opportunities, or of ""bubbles"", and its implications for pricing and for hedging).  Additionally, the investigator has gained considerable understanding of stochastic control problems with discretionary stopping, when a ""controller"" (a player who affects the dynamics of the game) and a ""stopper"" (a player who decides the duration of the game) cooperate to minimize an expected cost.  This project embarks on an effort to understand non-cooperative versions of such games, both in zero-sum and in non-zero-sum contexts. A rich theory seems to emerge, and we intend fully to pursue its development as described in the proposal. Furthermore, research will focus on such stochastic optimization problems in the presence of unobservable parameters, modeled in a Bayesian framework by means of random variables with known prior distributions and continuous updating. Such problems are notoriously hard to solve explicitly, but we have ambitious plans in this direction and some preliminary results. <br/><br/>Stochastic portfolio theory is a relatively novel mathematical framework for analyzing portfolio behavior and equity market structure; it is descriptive as opposed to normative, is consistent with observable characteristics of actual portfolios and real markets, and provides a theoretical tool (with insights into questions of arbitrage, construction of portfolios with controlled behavior, etc.) which is also useful for practical applications. Optimization problems that involve features of both stochastic control and optimal stopping arise, for instance, in the study of target-tracking models, where one has to stay as close as possible to a certain target by spending fuel, to declare when one has arrived ""sufficiently close"", and then to decide whether to engage the target or not. Problems of combined optimal stochastic control/stopping also arise in Mathematical Finance: in the context of computing the upper- and lower-hedging prices of American contingent claims under portfolio constraints; in portfolio/consumption problems with an embedded ""retirement"" option; in the study of dynamic measures for managing risk; in the context of dynamically consistent utilities; and in stochastic games of the principal/agent type. Stochastic control with partial observations has implications for the adaptive sequential detection of change-points, for signal processing, for finance, and for other fields of application where learning about unknown parameters and dynamic system optimization have to take place simultaneously, and in real time."

However, EIT and OT are plagued by instability and low resolution. To overcome these difficulties, novel hybrid methods are being currently developed that combine different types of radiation (e.g., ultrasound and electromagnetic waves). The idea is to combine the advantages of these waves, while alleviating their individual deficiencies. Among these methods, the project will concentrate mostly on the Thermoacoustic Tomography, Ultrasound-Modulated Optical Tomography, and Acousto-Electric Tomography, as well as possibly some newer emerging imaging modalities. It is devoted to developing mathematical analytic and numerical tools needed in these techniques, which are currently in their early (sometimes infant) stages of development. <br/><br/>Computerized tomography is a major method of biomedical imaging, as well as of industrial non-destructive testing, geology, and other areas. Various modalities have been developed, including for instance the usual X-ray clinical ``CAT scan'', MRI, Optical, Ultrasound, and Electrical Impedance Tomography. All of them have their advantages and deficiencies in terms of resolution, cost, and safety. Thus a quest continues for new safer, cheaper, and reliable methods. In recent years, novel hybrid methods have been emerging, which promise to become cheap, safe and effective medical diagnostics tools. The project addresses the mathematical issues that are central in their development, since images have to be obtained by complex mathematical procedures rather than direct acquisition. Besides the significant impact on the development and implementation of several new inexpensive and safe methods of biomedical imaging, one can also envision a possibility of applications to non-destructive industrial testing and other areas where imaging of non-transparent objects is required."

First, we will attempt to understand more precisely why it is that the patterns seen near the shoot apical meristems of plants so often exhibit Fibonacci sequences, that is, leaves, bracts, and stickers lie on families of spirals enumerated by Fibonacci sequences.  The study will explore both the mechanisms through which the biological structures are initiated and the nature of the patterns themselves.  From work to date, it would seem that Fibonacci patterns are the preferred pattern in annular geometries in circumstances where the pattern gets laid down sequentially, annulus by annulus, so that the pattern forming region is quite narrow and the bias from the previously laid down structures is strong.  Connections with optimal packing will be part of the study.  Second, we will revisit the general description of patterns with the particular aim of understanding better the nature of the point and line singularities which occur when one moves from a microscopic description to a macroscopic description of the system by averaging over the pattern wavelength.  What is intriguing is that the three dimensional line defects of such patterns have naturally defined indices of plus and minus one and two thirds and plus and minus one and that the masses of the former are much larger.  Also, the defects have an additional natural index of one half.  Possible connections with quarks and leptons will be explored.  <br/><br/>Patterns turn up all over the place.  One sees them on desert dunes, on long sandy beaches, in cloud formations, on fingertips and animal coats, on the feathers of birds, and on fish skins.  They are also ubiquitous in laboratory experiments on convection in fluids, on broad laser beams, and on flame fronts.  Many of the patterns arising in different microscopic contexts have textures with much in common, so that by studying patterns in one context one can learn about their behaviors in other systems that share key symmetry properties.  Besides being of interest for their intrinsic beauty, patterns are also worth studying for practical reasons.  They have many potential uses from switches to information storage devices.  They also tend to be the structures which, in certain special circumstances, can optimize such things as heat transfer in fluids and light gathering capacity in plants.  This project will investigate fundamental questions underlying pattern formation, with the goal of providing deeper insight into this important phenomenon.<br/>"

Computational geometric mechanics blends these fields, and uses a self-consistent discretization of geometry and mechanics to systematically construct geometric structure-preserving numerical schemes. The proposed research will combine theoretical and computational tools arising from Dirac mechanics and geometry, noncommutative harmonic analysis, and uncertainty quantification to dramatically extend the applicability of computational geometric mechanics and geometric control to engineering problems that evolve intrinsically on nonlinear spaces, such as Lie groups and homogeneous spaces. This will provide insights into the canonical discretization of Dirac constraints, nonholonomic constraints, and interconnected systems. In addition, the study of uncertainty in the context of geometric control will improve the robustness and reliability of the resulting numerical and computational tools.<br/><br/>This research will improve our ability to control interconnected systems of autonomous vehicles in a robust and efficient fashion, by explicitly taking into account the uncertainty inherent in our knowledge of the surrounding environment.

The first topic is an optimal investment problem where the investor is paying a proportional share of the profit to the fund manager.  The problem involves both modeling and the analysis of the resulting non-standard stochastic control problem, in order to fully characterize the optimal policy.  In addition, an asymptotic analysis for small proportional fees will be performed.  The second topic represents a characterization of semimartingale models of financial markets where Mutual Fund Theorems hold true in the context of expected utility from consumption.  This will provide a tool for the study of mutual fund theorems for markets in equilibrium. The last topic is based on a new definition of admissible strategies for the optimal investment problem for utilities defined on the whole real line and the duality results that derive from it.<br/><br/>Incomplete markets are financial models where contingent claims cannot be replicated by trading, so they are not redundant. While, in practice, most models are incomplete, the mathematical analysis of optimal investment and pricing in these markets is usually very difficult. The present project contributes to both modeling of incompleteness arising from different market frictions, as well as to the mathematical analysis of the new stochastic control problems resulting from such models. The second topic of the project is expected to provide a better understanding of incomplete markets in a very general mathematical framework."

In the first part, the PI proposes to work on the development of renormalization group (RG) methods for the spectral analysis of the weakly disordered Anderson model.  As a concrete application, he plans to study properties of the density of states.  Techniques capable of improving the current knowledge about this problem will almost certainly be important for a variety of other essential questions concerning the Anderson model.  In the second part, the PI proposes to continue his previous research on the mathematical foundations of non-relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).  In various collaborations, he plans to study aspects of infraparticle scattering theory, and to further develop an isospectral renormalization group method for the analysis of spectral problems in quantum field theory.  In the third part, the PI plans to investigate stability questions related to the dynamics of high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems.<br/><br/>The projects presented in this proposal address three types of problems in mathematical physics. The Anderson model is widely used for the study of the quantum dynamics of electrons in random media, such as semiconductors.  Understanding its predictions on transport properties at small disorders in dimensions 2 or larger poses a major open problem, and the proposed project intends to focus on certain key multiscale aspects of it.  Non-relativistic QED describes non-relativistic quantum mechanical matter (electrons, atoms, molecules) interacting with the relativistic quantized electromagnetic radiation field (photons). It models low-energy processes in molecular physics and chemistry with excellent accuracy. Because photons are massless, electrons always bind an infinite number of low energetic (soft) photons, thus forming a bound state referred to as an infraparticle.  Accommodating the latter into the standard framework of quantum field theory is extremely difficult, because of the so-called infrared catastrophe (perturbative computations typically diverge due to the soft photon cloud). Building on previous work of the PI and his collaborators, the proposed projects intend to further develop the scattering theory of infraparticles.  Moreover, the PI proposes to investigate aspects of the dynamics and stability of Hamiltonian systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, which describe, for instance, the lattice vibrations of a classical crystal.<br/>"

The focus is on those problems where the large number of independent state-space variables makes classical approximation methods unfeasible because of their large computation cost.

Like popular Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based methods, this approach associates the condensed variables needed for model reduction with coherent structures and captures nonlinear interactions between these linear modes via Galerkin projection and finite-dimensional truncation.  Unlike empirical POD methods, however, this new method does not require extensive data sets from experiments or direct numerical simulations of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) and thus yields truly predictive reduced models. The theoretical and computational methodology will be developed in the context of a particular physical system, thermal convection in fluid saturated porous media, that is of considerable environmental and technological importance and an ideal testbed for new ideas.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to the development of a general methodology for deriving simplified mathematical models of highly complex dynamical systems arising in diverse areas of science and engineering.  In many applications of interest (e.g., control of various fluid flows to achieve drag reduction for oil pumped in pipelines or for air flowing past commercial jets, or for estimation of carbon dioxide sequestration by porous rock material for reducing global warming), direct numerical simulations based on the complete governing mathematical equations are infeasible using even the world's fastest high-performance supercomputers. This project will address these challenges using novel mathematical techniques to derive simplified equations directly from the governing physical laws that are amenable to practical computation and analysis."

However, the passage from microscopic wave equations to large-scale kinetics is a complicated problem in itself.  The goal of the first part of the project is to develop new tools and better understanding of kinetic limits, especially in the regime when random media have long range correlations that lead to multiple temporal and spatial scales for various wave phenomena. The second part of the project investigates the qualitative behavior of solutions of reaction-diffusion-advection equations, with the main focus on the effect of a fluid flow. The interaction of the mixing, dynamic, and geometric properties of the underlying flow and the effects of diffusion and reaction will be investigated.  The problem becomes especially complex in the situations where the feedback from the reaction process on the fluid flow cannot be ignored. The project addresses the quantitative study of the transport of the energy, momentum, and reactants in a Boussinesq reactive system, other reaction-diffusion systems with feedback, and flame-front propagation in random media.<br/><br/>This project carries out mathematical studies of wave propagation in cluttered environments and of reaction-diffusion processes in fluids. These studies are relevant to several branches of science, ranging from biomedical imaging to geophysics, fluid dynamics, and astrophysics. Imaging in a cluttered environment, whether it is a human body, earth interior, or foliage, is inherently unstable because of media complexity. One objective of this project is to develop imaging methods that are less sensitive to unpredictable fluctuations of the clutter.  Another area of this project concerns the mathematical description of the effect of a fluid flow on chemical reactions. Turbulent fluid flow plays an important role in many chemical phenomena: it may drastically enhance the rate of reaction, leading to higher efficiency, or, in some situations, extinguish the chemical process. The project will address these issues in simpler mathematical models to illuminate the mechanisms present in the full problem."

In contrast, the team will develop robust mathematical models to predict the voltage and current response over the full range of operating conditions. The basis for modeling at the single-crystal level will be Cahn-Hilliard partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, expressing chemical-potential dependent reaction reactions. The goal will be to provide the first mathematical description of emerging high-rate materials, where phase transformations occur via nonlinear intercalation waves, coupling anisotropic diffusion and electrochemical reactions. This effort will also raise basic mathematical questions in linear and nonlinear stability, degenerate wave solutions, and numerical methods.<br/><br/>In spite of extensive engineering over the past few decades, the performance of rechargeable batteries has improved only incrementally.

To meet this need, the project creates a Focused Research Group from mathematics, chemical engineering, and materials science to develop a new theoretical paradigm for Li-ion batteries. The group will guide the engineering of new ultrafast Li-ion batteries, capable of charging and discharging in seconds rather than hours, while opening fruitful directions for applied mathematics.

Much of the current work on data-dependent manifolds is focussed on gaining an understanding of the geometry underlying the data.  The investigator has started to develop tools that don't rely on geometric structure to approximate functions defined on data-dependent manifolds.  This project brings the theory for data-dependent manifolds to the level of completion achieved in the case of the known manifolds.  The approximations are defined universally, and can be based on either spectral or nonlocal, scattered data, i.e., data where one has no control on the location of the points where the target function is sampled.  The error in this globally defined approximation adjusts itself optimally at different points on the manifold according to the smoothness of the target function in the vicinity of those points.  In particular, the project includes (1) the development of approximation theory on certain graphs, (2) a complete characterization of the approximation properties of analogues of radial basis function networks on the manifolds in terms of the smoothness of the target functions, and (3) a study of the local approximation properties of spectral and pseudo-spectral methods to solve pseudo-differential equations on the manifold.  An integral part of this research is to develop efficient algorithms to implement and test the theory. <br/><br/>     Many modern applications involve answering queries based on unstructured data sets.  For example, based on a data set consisting of hand-written digits, scanned as images, one wants to determine which digit a new unseen image represents, if any.

In this project the investigator aims to go beyond geometrical considerations, developing a theory that focusses on modeling of specific queries as function approximation.  The theory helps to develop efficient algorithms and test them.  Potential areas of applications include crystallography, geophysics, biomathematics, semi-supervised learning, document analysis, face recognition, hyperspectral image processing, and cataloguing of galaxies. <br/>"

Here, the focus is on situations when the elastic<br/>bodies exhibit some sort of rigid behavior.  In this manner, the<br/>study of geometric properties of structures, e.g. the properties<br/>of various spaces of isometries and infinitesimal isometries of<br/>2-dimensional surfaces, comes to the fore.

Complex fluids are distinguished from viscous fluids (e.g., water, oil) in that they require resolution of microstructure to resolve behavior in even the simplest of experiments. For single-phase complex fluids, the signature phenomena of shear thinning (viscosity falls with increased shear rate) and normal stress generation in shear (oppositely translating parallel plates experience a force along their mutual normal) are not captured by the Navier-Stokes model for viscous fluids.  Yet, these features are successfully predicted by the kinetic theory of single-phase polymeric liquids.  When combined to form multiphase mixtures, either in Nature (biofilms or lung airway mucosal layers) or synthetically (nano-rods or nano-platelets dispersed in a polymer matrix), the different fluid phases are prone to separate.  Other forces (chemical bonds and weaker attractive potentials) compete with phase separation to sustain the mixture, which are only reasonably understood for equilibrium states.  <br/>Outstanding challenges arise, and predictive tools do not yet exist, in far-from-equilibrium conditions typical of biofilms in streams or pipes, lung airway mucus layers propelled toward the larynx by coordinated cilia and tidal breathing, and flow processing of polymer nano-composites into films or molds.  A mathematically consistent kinetic theory for generic multiphase complex fluids, incorporating the physics and chemistry of individual phases, their mixtures and their hydrodynamics, will be developed in this research project.  A kinetic theory is only useful when accompanied by clear protocols for the derivation of reduced models applicable to benchmark experiments, numerical algorithms for each model reduction, and direct simulations to test the predictive capability of the theory with blind experiments.  These constructs will be developed, along with inference methods so that all physical parameters of a multiphase complex fluid model can be experimentally determined.  The generality and diversity of the theory will be demonstrated by detailed specificity to hydrodynamics of biofilms, mucosal layers, and polymer nano-composites. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Polymer nano-composites are new synthetic materials with extraordinary promise, consisting of a cocktail of a traditional polymer with property-boosting nano-rods or platelets.  Insight into why nano-composites are truly special can be appreciated from a simple fact: one percent volume fraction of nano-platelets in a single raindrop of polymer matrix introduces an entire football field of new surface area!  The novel features of number and size of particles together with new surface contact between the particle phase and the polymer phase overwhelm current experimental and theoretical capabilities.  Flow is impossible to probe experimentally (particles are too small and too numerous to track orientation and position) and there is no predictive theory, and therefore no simulation tools, to guide material design.  This project will develop the requisite theoretical and computational capabilities.  Similar challenges and limitations exist for mixtures of multiphase complex fluids arising in Nature, such as biofilms in streams, ponds, and pipes and mucosal layers between the air and tissue in lung airways. <br/> This research project will develop a mathematical blueprint for theory and simulation of the hydrodynamics of generic multiphase complex fluid mixtures. In this strategy, details of each phase in the mixture and the chemical and physical interactions between phases serve as inputs, together with the necessary experimental data to test the theory. The formalism will produce the theory specific to the multiphase fluid, the approach to derive model reductions for benchmark experiments, and numerical methods and simulations.  The general methods will be brought to bear on three diverse multiphase materials:  biofilms, mucosal layers, and polymer nano-composites.  These mathematical constructs will provide predictive tools for:  the design of novel high performance polymer nano-composite materials for defense and the aerospace industry; remediation strategies for biofilms in industrial pipelines; and, improved pulmonary health through simulations of mucus transport prior to and during drug and physical therapies.<br/>"

The results will be directly compared with experimental data, thus providing viable information on the accuracy of the model and quantitative insight to observations. The asymptotic validity of the model and various perturbative regimes will be examined in order to achieve a comprehensive mathematical understanding. Specifically, we will study localization properties and stability analysis of optical waves propagating in nonlinear multi-dimensional complex PT periodic structures that is modeled by the PT nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Moreover, we will investigate wave localization and dynamic stability in nonlinear three-dimensional random photonic lattices and study the phenomenon known as nonlinear Anderson localization. <br/><br/>The field of optical wave propagation in nonlinear and random photonic structures has the potential for technological applications such as all-optical signal processing, navigation and switching. Photonics hold great promise for building high-speed, nanoscale switches and gates. Control of spatially or temporally localized structures within optical media is a critical issue in fabricating all optical devices.  As such many resources have been put into building innovative experiments utilizing new optical materials that explore the dynamics and control the effects of nonlinearity and randomness in optical materials. To date, much of the research has been in the linear regime.  Recent experimental discoveries such as the optical induction technique to create photonic lattices, have begun to allow researchers addressing many important issues related to wave propagation in periodic media such as optical waveguide arrays which until recently were thought to be impossible.  However, even with the current detailed experimentation, probing optical phenomena at a sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution to gain an improved theoretical understanding remains a challenge. There is thus great demand for companion theoretical investigations capable of accurately describing experiments.  Due to the disparate range of scales involved, the primitive equations for investigating optical phenomena, Maxwell's equations are computationally prohibitive to solve.  Thus there is a need for computationally efficient reduced models that quantitatively capture the essential phenomena, providing clear physical and theoretical insight. The purpose of this project is to address these issues for optical photonic systems by exploring, investigating, and simulating reductions of Maxwell's equations. The emphasis is on the modeling and computational aspects of wave propagation in photonic lattices and waveguide arrays. <br/>"

Random dynamical systems arise in the modeling of many phenomena in physics, biology, climatology, economics, etc. when uncertainties or random influences are taken into account. The applications for this project will center on the dynamics of spike states, viewed as defects, for the Allen-Cahn or Cahn-Hilliard equation of materials science, oscillations in membrane potential and ionic concentrations within cells, and the motion of the molecular motor kinesin and its interactions with microtubules, all of which are subject to stochastic fluctuations.

The study of random dynamical systems involves both stochastic analysis and geometrical theory of dynamical systems. The investigator and his collaborators are establishing much of the basic geometric framework for multiscale, stochastic dynamical systems. In particular they are developing (i) The theory of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds for stochastic dynamical systems including the persistence and the existence of random stable and unstable manifolds and foliations; (ii) The stochastic Exchange Lemma for fast-slow systems; (iii) The theory of approximate normally hyperbolic manifolds in a noisy environment. These are linked with concrete analysis of nonlinear partial differential and integral equations of evolutionary type, with particular attention paid to the persistence and dynamics of coherent structures. <br/><br/>While many physical, biological, and financial processes appear to be subject to random or stochastic forces, there are also coherent structures underlying these processes which give some measure of predictability.  This project is laying the groundwork for the determination of these hidden structures and for analyzing specific situations arising in several applications.  Among these is a fundamental transport process within each cell of the body.  Here, molecular motors attached to rod-like fibers carry essential chemicals and waste products to and from active sites within the cell, allowing for growth, rejuvenation, mobility, and communication.  Understanding this process brings understanding of and perhaps therapies for debilitating and chronic diseases.  Likewise, understanding the mechanisms that produce coherent structures in complex materials can lead to the design of advanced materials with particularly useful magnetic, semiconducting, superconducting, or biomechanical properties."

The dominant feature of solutions is the presence of shock waves, which present both physical and mathematical difficulties.  Two fundamental problems are considered: first is the extension of the Glimm-Lax existence and decay theory to solutions having large amplitude.  This problem necessitates an analysis of multiple wave interactions up to and including the vacuum, where the system is singular.  The second problem concerns the existence of shock-free periodic solutions which do not dissipate energy.  These arise from multiple reflections of nonlinear waves together with a nonlinear superposition principle, and lead to problems of small divisors.<br/><br/>Shock waves are characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in the characteristics of the medium. Across a shock moving, for example in the air there is always an extremely rapid rise in pressure, temperature and of the flow. Shock waves occur naturally in many physical systems, and are closely associated with the decay of solutions and dissipation of energy; a well-known manifestation of a decaying shock wave is a sonic boom. The celebrated Glimm-Lax theory precisely describes this decay for small amplitude solutions of two equations, neglecting higher order effects such as viscosity and heat loss; the theory is routinely assumed to hold in much wider contexts.  The first part of this project extends and confirms the Glimm-Lax theory for waves of arbitrary strength described by systems of two equations.  The second part of the project reveals the surprising conclusion that there are solutions which do not form shock waves and thus do not decay.  In particular, this research indicates that in larger systems multiple wave reflection effects slow down the formation of shocks and the subsequent dissipation of energy. Controllability of these effects would have many consequences, including applications to long-range signaling and airplane design.<br/>"

In the first part, the limit order book of an electronic exchange will be modeled as a queueing system, evolving as a measure-valued process, where the measure in question is the set of order sizes located on the price axis. Like many queueing systems, the evolution of the order book at the level of discrete orders is prohibitively complex. Therefore, the theory of heavy traffic limits for queueing systems will be used to obtain continuous approximations to the discrete systems. In the second part of the proposal, models for asset price volatility will be developed. Local volatility models currently in use describe volatility as a function of time and the underlying asset price. We propose to extend this concept to models in which volatility is a function of time, the underlying asset price, and one or more factors that determine the payoff of derivative securities written on the underlying asset. The third part of the proposal continues work on optimal investment and consumption in the presence of transaction costs. These problems are well understood and there are closed-form solutions in cases where transaction costs are zero, but there are no closed-form solutions in the more realistic case when transaction costs are positive.<br/>It is proposed to develop asymptotic expansions in the small transaction cost parameter of the unknown solution around the zero-transaction-cost known solution.<br/><br/>In overview, it is proposed to build mathematical models designed to reduce risk and increase efficiency in financial markets. Innovations in the financial markets have changed their structure, and analysis needs to keep pace. In particular, the advent of order-driven electronic exchanges has spawned the growth of algorithmic trading, whereby firms trade large quantities of assets quickly. Does this make markets liquid? Does it dampen or amplify volatility? It is difficult to answer these questions because we do not have good mathematical models for these exchanges. Neither can we predict with any accuracy how various order-matching protocols on these exchanges will affect volatility, bid-ask spreads, and general market efficiency. A major part of this proposal is the development of mathematical models for electronic exchanges. A second aspect of this proposal is to improve mathematical models for asset price volatility. The celebrated Black-Scholes model assumes that volatility is constant, but departures from this assumption in financial markets are too significant to ignore. The third part of this proposal is to better understand the effect of transaction costs on problems of optimal investment and consumption. This problem is at the heart of equilibrium analysis of financial markets, but most studies to date make the unrealistic assumption that transaction costs are zero."

The dissipation mechanism endows the configuration space with a geometric structure.  The investigator studies the geometry of configuration spaces and relevant energy landscapes, and their applications to the dynamics of gradient flows.  Gradient flows in Wasserstein metric provide a prime example, given the number of the systems that can be described as such flows and the wealth of results obtained over the last decade.  The investigator continues studying gradient flows in the Wasserstein metric, but also examines gradient flows with respect to other, less studied, metrics that appear naturally in physical and biological systems.  Understanding the geometry of energy landscapes enables one to make conclusions and predictions about dynamics of complex nonlinear systems.  In such systems the detailed dynamics are often practically intractable, but many system-averaged quantities, such as energy, follow precise scaling laws.  The investigator studies scaling laws in several energy-driven systems that display coarsening behavior. <br/><br/>     The investigator studies complex nonlinear systems relevant to applications in materials science, physics, and population biology.  Being able to accurately predict the large-scale features of these systems is important for designing better man-made materials, controlling processes involving phase separation, achieving controlled self-assembly of nano-particles, and understanding (and potentially controlling) the behavior of large-scale animal groups (such as insect swarms).

The Navier-Stokes equations can be elegantly formulated in the above framework using the inviscid Webber formula, which essentially represents the Navier-Stokes equations as the average of the Euler equations plus Brownian motion. We have a wide variety of applications in mind: A numerical (stochastic) method to compute solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, a study of the effect of obstacles and boundaries on viscous fluid flows, turbulence models for incompressible fluids, analytical estimates and weak solutions, and front propagation in the Boussinesq equations.<br/><br/>This research is based on the framework in which a viscous incompressible fluid can be explicitly represented as the average of an inviscid fluid plus Brownian motion.

A related application is to use this method to find a ""turbulence model"" for fluid flows: namely, the velocity field of the fluid is expressed as a slowly varying ""mean field"" (which is easy and inexpensive to compute), plus a rapid fluctuating ""noisy"" part, which is modeled using stochastic methods. Another application is to study boundary layer effects on the interior flow in the inviscid limit. A study of burning and flame propagation is also proposed.<br/>"

Research will be conducted on the stability and instability of solitary waves in nonlinear dispersive equations; wave breaking phenomena for such equations will also be investigated.  In particular, the Degasperis-Procesi (DP) equation, the Ostrovsky (OS) equation and the Boussinesq (BQ) equations will be considered. At the heart of this field of inquiry are nonlinear wave interactions. These occur when waves, moving possibly with different speeds and in different directions, intersect. If the interaction is strong enough, then it may create new waves or even lead to wave breaking. Various methods of mathematical analysis will be employed in these investigations. The project will provide specific analysis and numerical simulations of the stability of solitary waves in the OS equations, the strong instability of solitary wave in the BQ equations, and global weak solutions, shock waves, and wave breaking phenomena as well as blow-up structures of the DP equation.  The techniques developed in carrying out this project are expected to be useful for other nonlinear dispersive wave equations. <br/><br/>Waves are ubiquitous in many different physical contexts, for example, in the ocean, the atmosphere, acoustics, telecommunications, and so on. The most complicated ones are nonlinear waves whose evolution is difficult to predict without performing very complex computations and modeling. In particular, it is known that some of nonlinear waves are not stable; that is, a small change will produce a large disturbance.  On the other hand, wave breaking (the wave plunging or surging in short time) is another physical phenomenon of critical importance, especially for water waves. The study of stability of nonlinear waves is necessary for applications such as fusion energy research and fiber-optic communications.  The objectives of this project are to develop a better mathematical understanding  of which waves are stable and which are unstable, as well as how and when these waves form and break. Research will be focused on certain kinds of nonlinear waves that are well described by mathematical models, but quite difficult to solve. The analysis of these special solutions to the equations has potential impact on the fundamental understanding of ocean waves and currents.  Although the equations which are the primary focus of this research are related to water waves and ocean dynamics, the new methods of analysis of special waves and wave breaking developed here could be extended to other areas of fluid mechanics, plasma physics, and other applications.

Complex fluids are distinguished from viscous fluids (e.g., water, oil) in that they require resolution of microstructure to resolve behavior in even the simplest of experiments. For single-phase complex fluids, the signature phenomena of shear thinning (viscosity falls with increased shear rate) and normal stress generation in shear (oppositely translating parallel plates experience a force along their mutual normal) are not captured by the Navier-Stokes model for viscous fluids.  Yet, these features are successfully predicted by the kinetic theory of single-phase polymeric liquids.  When combined to form multiphase mixtures, either in Nature (biofilms or lung airway mucosal layers) or synthetically (nano-rods or nano-platelets dispersed in a polymer matrix), the different fluid phases are prone to separate.  Other forces (chemical bonds and weaker attractive potentials) compete with phase separation to sustain the mixture, which are only reasonably understood for equilibrium states.  <br/>Outstanding challenges arise, and predictive tools do not yet exist, in far-from-equilibrium conditions typical of biofilms in streams or pipes, lung airway mucus layers propelled toward the larynx by coordinated cilia and tidal breathing, and flow processing of polymer nano-composites into films or molds.  A mathematically consistent kinetic theory for generic multiphase complex fluids, incorporating the physics and chemistry of individual phases, their mixtures and their hydrodynamics, will be developed in this research project.  A kinetic theory is only useful when accompanied by clear protocols for the derivation of reduced models applicable to benchmark experiments, numerical algorithms for each model reduction, and direct simulations to test the predictive capability of the theory with blind experiments.  These constructs will be developed, along with inference methods so that all physical parameters of a multiphase complex fluid model can be experimentally determined.  The generality and diversity of the theory will be demonstrated by detailed specificity to hydrodynamics of biofilms, mucosal layers, and polymer nano-composites. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Polymer nano-composites are new synthetic materials with extraordinary promise, consisting of a cocktail of a traditional polymer with property-boosting nano-rods or platelets.  Insight into why nano-composites are truly special can be appreciated from a simple fact: one percent volume fraction of nano-platelets in a single raindrop of polymer matrix introduces an entire football field of new surface area!  The novel features of number and size of particles together with new surface contact between the particle phase and the polymer phase overwhelm current experimental and theoretical capabilities.  Flow is impossible to probe experimentally (particles are too small and too numerous to track orientation and position) and there is no predictive theory, and therefore no simulation tools, to guide material design.  This project will develop the requisite theoretical and computational capabilities.  Similar challenges and limitations exist for mixtures of multiphase complex fluids arising in Nature, such as biofilms in streams, ponds, and pipes and mucosal layers between the air and tissue in lung airways. <br/> This research project will develop a mathematical blueprint for theory and simulation of the hydrodynamics of generic multiphase complex fluid mixtures. In this strategy, details of each phase in the mixture and the chemical and physical interactions between phases serve as inputs, together with the necessary experimental data to test the theory. The formalism will produce the theory specific to the multiphase fluid, the approach to derive model reductions for benchmark experiments, and numerical methods and simulations.  The general methods will be brought to bear on three diverse multiphase materials:  biofilms, mucosal layers, and polymer nano-composites.  These mathematical constructs will provide predictive tools for:  the design of novel high performance polymer nano-composite materials for defense and the aerospace industry; remediation strategies for biofilms in industrial pipelines; and, improved pulmonary health through simulations of mucus transport prior to and during drug and physical therapies.<br/>"

One of the biggest challenges of contemporary applied mathematics is high-dimensional problems.  High-dimensional problems with dimensions of hundreds, and even thousands, arise naturally in finance, quantum chemistry, biology, medicine, and other areas.  Typical problems of this kind are numerical integration and statistical estimation.  The fundamental question is how to construct good methods of numerical integration (cubature formulas) and statistical estimation.  Recent investigations show that greedy type approximation methods are good for different high-dimensional problems, including problems from numerical integration and learning theory.  The investigator and his colleagues study application of greedy approximations in numerical integration and learning theory.  Preliminary investigations show that greedy type approximation methods work well in high dimensions and can be considered as a constructive deterministic alternative to some powerful probabilistic methods.  The greedy approximation has potential to become a transformative concept of numerical integration andlearning theory. <br/><br/>     Understanding intelligence and how it learns and assimilates information is one of the great scientific challenges of this decade.  It is key to designing systems to efficiently analyze data and extract essential information.  The scientific discipline that studies this aspect of intelligence is called learning theory.  It has a myriad of existing and potential applications in both the defense and civilian sectors.  For instance, managing large data bases such as security data bases obtained through surveillance requires classification of the data sets in order to speed up extraction of significant features or specific information.  Learning theory discovers rules that allow the classification of new data from past data that have already been classified.  A prototypical application is the search through a large data base (for example emails) to determine which of these have possible links to terrorist activities.  It is the goal of this project to utilize fundamental concepts in approximation and statistics to clearly define and quantify the learning challenge and design new, more efficient techniques (greedy algorithms). <br/>"

The physical regime of interest is when the waves have wavelength of a few cm; both gravity and capillary effects then become important, and the wave speed attains a minimum value which defines a critical forcing speed: the linear response to external forcing traveling with speed equal to this minimum grows unbounded with time and, apart from damping, nonlinear effects can become important near this resonance. Theoretical models will be used to study the interplay of forcing, nonlinear and damping effects on the wave response under resonant conditions. The theoretical predictions will be compared with laboratory experimental observations reported in the literature.<br/><br/>Resonant forcing of gravity-capillary waves is relevant to the generation of ripples by wind, that appear as small-scale roughness on the ocean surface, and to the wave drag associated with the motion of small bodies on a free surface. More generally, this problem is prototypical of resonantly forced wave systems with a phase-speed minimum at finite wavelength, and other potential applications include the response of floating ice sheets to surface vehicles.  <br/>"

In particular, the investigators are interested in the analysis of measurements of such waves if the (multiple) scattering takes place in the interior of a domain and the measurements are taken on its boundary. Milestones include: (1) an analysis framework for the scattering of jointly coherent and incoherent waves in a mixed model consisting of a macro multi-scale component, a random microscale component and coherent conormal singularities (the word ``incoherent'' is used advisedly; many would prefer the term ``diffuse'' if the phase relation between source of ambient seisms and the field that is generated is deterministic); and (2) the design of functionals of cross correlations and beyond, and associated sensitivity maps statistically stably resolving (changes in) the various (random) model parameters.  This project develops methods for extracting information from ``noise''. The idea is to look at higher order statistical patterns in noise-generated data. As an example, imagine to estimate the distance to a wall by analyzing noise reflected off the wall rather than by analyzing the delayed echo of a coherent signal. In the project much more complicated situations are considered in which noise generated waves have propagated through a complex (random) medium before they are measured. The investigators will develop new techniques for describing waves that are affected by such a medium, in addition to algorithms that effectively process the mentioned data numerically to extract relevant statistical information and subsequent imaging. These will have applications in remote sensing, medical imaging and seismic imaging using ambient noise sources; the investigators will focus on the latter.<br/><br/>With improved theory the investigators can develop inverse scattering tools that have the potential to revolutionize the characterization of structures and processes (e.g., flow, tremors, seismogenesis) in the subsurface, on spatial scales relevant for regional studies (e.g., structure and microseismic activity of crust and upper mantle lithosphere; hazards) and hydrocarbon production (energy). The results can furthermore be applied to monitoring CO_2 sequestration. Large and dense sensor arrays that have become operative recently provide unprecedented opportunities for exploiting new theoretical insights to unravel, hitherto unexplored, complexities in the subsurface."

The motion of a high temperature, low density collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a nonlinear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this setting collisions are neglected while the charge and current densities (which drive the Maxwell system) are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity moments of solutions to the Vlasov equation. The major question to be studied is this: are there shocks in a collisionless plasma? That is, could a singularity develop from smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses? In some cases, such as in lower dimensional, relativistic formulations (e.g., one space and two velocity variables), smooth global solutions are known to exist.  Another problem to be investigated concerns the long-time behavior of the charge and current densities and electromagnetic fields in the system.  More specifically, do dispersive effects in the equations cause these quantities to decay over time, or is there sufficient interaction so as to sustain their strength even as time approaches infinity?<br/><br/>Kinetic Theory includes the study of the motion and properties of plasma. Plasmas are often referred to as the fourth state of matter (after solids, liquids and gases) and account for 99.99% of all material in the universe. They are of great practical interest because they are charged gases and thus serve as excellent conductors of electricity. For example, ""plasma engines"" have been developed by a number of space agencies and recently used to power some NASA spacecraft. Additionally, the use of plasmas through nuclear fusion as a source of clean energy is currently of immense scientific interest.  Notable examples of collisionless plasmas include the solar wind, the Earth's ionosphere, galactic nebulae, low-density fusion reactors, and comet tails. The motion of a plasma is described by a number of complicated equations dictated by physics. Among the mathematician's goals are to show that these equations possess solutions (under appropriate conditions), determine their qualitative behavior, and approximate them numerically (so that one can predict behavior in future situations with certainty). A proof that the Vlasov-Maxwell system has a ""nice"" solution would also confirm that the system of equations is the ""right"" one to describe plasma-related phenomena. <br/>"

The majority of the effort is focused on the following four themes: (i) Differential constitutive models for viscoelastic liquids such as the Giesekus model will be used to study drops suspended in a matrix liquid and deformed by simple shear, cessation of shear, and large strain jumps. (ii) The recent development of microscale apparatuses has spawned new modeling and simulation challenges for droplet evolution in physical devices that are as small as the droplet itself. The project will investigate the effect of walls closing in on viscoelastic systems, for which novel breakup scenarios have been discovered experimentally. (iii) The motion of contact lines in liquid-liquid-solid systems will be investigated. A combination of the phase-field formulation and the volume-of-fluid height function method will be pursued. The former is more suited for resolving the physics of the contact line, but too resource intensive for use in the entire flow field. A challenge in contact line problems is how to obtain mesh independent results. Recent work has suggested the existence of a 'master curve' which can be used to determine a mesh dependent 'imposed' contact angle as a function of the desired 'macroscopic' contact angle. A specific computational application is electrowetting, which is perhaps the most widely used technique for drop actuation because of lower power consumption and because an applied voltage moves the drop without the need for pumps and valves. In this context, moving contact lines for the coupled system of hydrodynamic and Maxwell equations will be studied. (iv) Magnetic drug targeting involves using a ferrofluid drop as a drug carrier, which is guided through biological tissue to a specific location. An important quantity for feasibility is the transit time.  Direct numerical simulations will be carried out for the motion of ferrofluid drops in viscous media under non-uniform magnetic fields. This project involves the mentoring of a postdoctoral research associate and the training of graduate students. Results will be disseminated at national and international conferences on mathematics, physics and engineering, and through journal publications. Cross-disciplinary and international partnerships will take place with scientists who obtain experimental data for comparison with numerical results.<br/><br/>The advantages in combining the desired properties of two different liquids to produce a new blended mixture are well known. The quality of the blend is strongly dependent on its microstructure, such as the size of the dispersed droplets and their distribution in the final product. Therefore, it is of practical importance to understand how a droplet evolves in the surrounding liquid and to predict how this is influenced by the rheological properties of each constituent fluid. This will be accomplished by performing direct numerical simulations with in-house state-of-the-art parallelized algorithms that are optimized for scalability and computational cost. The topics in this project contribute to the understanding of complex multi-scale systems that arise in recycling plastics, environmental sustainability, biomedical drug delivery, and droplet manipulation in microfluidic devices. Intensive use of computational infrastructures such as the TeraGrid will allow for quantitative comparison of mathematical models with raw experimental data."

This necessitates the use of various approximate macroscopic models, of which kinetic equations constitute an important class. However, the passage from microscopic wave equations to large-scale kinetics is a complicated problem in itself.  The goal of the first part of the project is to develop new tools and better understanding of kinetic limits, especially in the regime when random media have long range correlations that lead to multiple temporal and spatial scales for various wave phenomena. The second part of the project investigates the qualitative behavior of solutions of reaction-diffusion-advection equations, with the main focus on the effect of a fluid flow. The interaction of the mixing, dynamic, and geometric properties of the underlying flow and the effects of diffusion and reaction will be investigated.  The problem becomes especially complex in the situations where the feedback from the reaction process on the fluid flow cannot be ignored. The project addresses the quantitative study of the transport of the energy, momentum, and reactants in a Boussinesq reactive system, other reaction-diffusion systems with feedback, and flame-front propagation in random media.<br/><br/>This project carries out mathematical studies of wave propagation in cluttered environments and of reaction-diffusion processes in fluids. These studies are relevant to several branches of science, ranging from biomedical imaging to geophysics, fluid dynamics, and astrophysics. Imaging in a cluttered environment, whether it is a human body, earth interior, or foliage, is inherently unstable because of media complexity. One objective of this project is to develop imaging methods that are less sensitive to unpredictable fluctuations of the clutter.  Another area of this project concerns the mathematical description of the effect of a fluid flow on chemical reactions. Turbulent fluid flow plays an important role in many chemical phenomena: it may drastically enhance the rate of reaction, leading to higher efficiency, or, in some situations, extinguish the chemical process. The project will address these issues in simpler mathematical models to illuminate the mechanisms present in the full problem."

Due to the current world-wide market turbulence, and taking into account the known causes that triggered the credit crunch, particular emphasis will be put on dynamic valuation and hedging of credit derivatives, with focus on credit default swaps and basket credit derivatives, as well as other complex financial instruments such as inflation-indexed swaps. This research will frame the following two main research areas: mathematical modeling for the purpose of financial risk management, with applications, among others, to hedging, valuation, and management of portfolio credit risk, and applications of stochastic analysis to studying of dependence between stochastic processes. Although the forthcoming research will yield fundamental advances within the areas of stochastic analysis and financial mathematics, it is anticipated that it will lead to new and practical tools that eventually become widely used in the financial industry and other applied disciplines, so to mitigate and to appropriately control the involved risks.<br/><br/>This research will be of fundamental importance for several reasons. First, the troubled credit derivative industry will benefit directly from it, as new methods and techniques based on solid mathematical and financial advances will be developed for the purpose of valuing and managing basket credit derivatives, such as basket swaps, cash collateral debt obligations, asset backed securities, etc.  This industry suffered great losses since the spring of 2007 mainly because the nature of such complex hybrid derivatives as structured credit derivatives was not really well understood, especially on the level of risk management (hedging of risk exposure). The research to be done will result in developing new robust dynamic models for these securities and provide reliable dynamic hedging strategies associated to these models, which consequently will give a better and broader understanding of an important part of the modern financial markets. Second, new applications of stochastic analysis will be developed, in particular with regard to dynamic acceptability indices.  Dynamic acceptability indices are unitless measures of performances of a given cashflow, which will be studied from abstract probability point of view. The obtained results will be beneficiary for all market participants including regulators and government agencies, and will lead to a better understanding of market efficiency. Third, valuation and hedging of credit default swaps (CDS) as well as valuation and hedging of credit default swaptions, which are essential for the financial industry, will be specifically emphasized and new analytical tools will be developed for this purpose. Fourth, if true, then an analog of Sklar's theorem for probability measures on canonical spaces of stochastic processes will be an important extension of the classical Sklar's theorem. Perhaps, an analog of Sklar's theorem for probability measures on some general vector spaces (such as Polish spaces) will be derived in the process. Fifth, the researchers will study the dynamic ""copula"" problem with regard to Markov processes: for a given multidimensional Markov process, with each coordinate being also Markovian, what conditions need to be satisfied by the pseudo-differential operator corresponding to the (extended) infinitesimal generator of the multidimensional process, given that the pseudo-differential operator corresponding to the (extended) infinitesimal generator of each coordinate are known. Sixth, there will be a practical importance of studying of the above problems in view of potential applications, such as valuation and hedging of basket derivatives (basket equity options, basket credit derivatives, etc.).<br/>"

The variation of density enables the propagation of internal waves - waves in the interior of the fluid - not on its surface. These waves, as they propagate, can deform and break and, when they do, they mix fluid of different densities, changing the medium in which they propagate. A competing effect is mixing engendered by shear instabilities. This project will develop a mathematical methodology for the study of the evolution of fully nonlinear sheared, stratified flows, with the goal to understand and model the dynamics leading to fluid mixing. The wave and shear-generated mixing will be addressed with tools in the theory of systems of finite and infinitely many conservation laws. We shall calculate and study exact nonlinear solutions that break - especially simple waves of the system, general criteria for the nonlinear stability of systems of mixed type, and the statistical description of incomplete systems, based on the maximization of a coarse-grained mixing entropy.<br/><br/>This research is concerned with the propagation of waves and the dynamics of shear in atmospheric and oceanic flows and how these phenomena mix the fluid in which they exist. Mixing in geophysical flows is a crucial component of climate dynamics. The rate of mixing of ocean waters, for instance, determines the temperature at the surface, which communicates directly with the atmosphere, affecting our weather and climate. The dispersion and mixing of chemicals, carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere, on the other hand, has a profound effect on the radiative balance leading to predictions for climate change.  Waves are also an element of atmospheric teleconnection: they can have long range effects since they carry energy over long distances without transporting the fluid itself. Since the length scales in which the waves and the mixing processes occur are too small and fast to be computed together with planetary scale flows, they are nowadays represented by a low number of aggregate parameters  (parameterized) using simple criteria. A better understanding of the dynamics and mixing processes will improve these parameterizations and the reliability of the climate models that use them."

Stability of a variety of coherent structures including steady galaxies, periodic and solitary water waves, and electromagnetic plasma equilibria will be further explored. Some of these structures are unstable, which means that a small perturbation creates a large disturbance. The goal is to determine which structures are stable and which are unstable. Another focus is to understand what role these steady structures play in the long time dynamics. The invariant structures near unstable steady states, including unstable (stable) manifolds and heteroclinic orbits, will be investigated. Particular emphasis will be on the inviscid limit of these dynamical structures, which is important for understanding the transition to turbulence and the observed structures. Nonlinear damping near certain stable equilibria of non-dissipative fluids and plasmas will also be studied.<br/><br/>The general goal of this research is to develop new and effective mathematical methods for the analysis of dynamic behavior in fluids and plasmas. Mathematical advances here will improve our understanding of the basic physical mechanisms, and also can lead to better numerical methods for simulations of these complex phenomena. Plasma is a gas composed of particles, each carrying a positive or negative electrical charge. Most of the universe is plasma; examples include the solar wind, the ionosphere, galactic nebulae, and comet tails. Plasmas also arise in physics and engineering, for instance in nuclear fusion. The stability and dynamical structures of fluids, plasmas and water waves are relevant for such diverse applications as fusion energy research, satellite and radio communications in space, wave motion in the atmosphere and oceans, and turbulent behavior of fluids. The mechanisms of nonlinear damping in the non-dissipative models are important for understanding how the large scale coherent structures (such as galaxies) in the fluid and plasma turbulence develop and evolve.<br/>"

Primary examples of such PDE are equations of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-type (HJB) that are associated with optimal control of deterministic and stochastic PDE. The theory of PDE in infinite dimensional spaces has been studied from the point of view of mild, regular, weak, and viscosity solutions and has established itself over the last two decades as one of the modern tools of infinite dimensional analysis. In particular, in addition to optimal control of PDE, the theory of viscosity solutions of such equations has found applications in areas such as the study of large deviations of infinite dimensional diffusions, the theory of bond markets and other aspects of mathematical finance, and stochastic invariance. In this project the principal investigator focuses on two emerging areas of infinite dimensional PDE that are wide open. The first is integro-PDE in Hilbert spaces. The goal is to develop a viscosity solution theory for fully nonlinear first- and second-order integro-PDE in Hilbert spaces and study its various applications. The interest in such equations comes primarily from their association with infinite dimensional jump-diffusion processes, in particular with stochastic PDE driven by Levy processes. Regarding applications, the theory will be used to develop a PDE approach to large deviations for solutions of stochastic PDE with small Levy noise intensity and to study infinite dimensional Black-Scholes and Black-Scholes-Barenblatt integro-PDE coming from the theory of bond markets driven by impulsive noise. A second area of emphasis is PDE in the space of probability measures, which finally seems open for development owing to recent advances in the theory of mass transport and abstract gradient and Hamiltonian flows. This new area is extremely interesting and important, and the project will concentrate on its applications to large deviations and statistical mechanics. Other problems contained in the project include the use of HJB equations to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality for optimal control of PDE and investigations into maximum principles.<br/><br/>The project contains a pioneering program of research that is aimed at the development of new tools in partial differential equations and infinite dimensional analysis. The proposed research spans areas as diverse as nonlinear partial differential equations, functional analysis, probability, stochastic processes, stochastic partial differential equations, mathematical finance, optimal control, game theory, statistical mechanics, mass transport, and calculus of variations. In particular, it will provide analytical techniques for the study of infinite dimensional jump diffusion processes that are used in stochastic modeling of various phenomena in which random and violent events can occur. Beyond mathematics, the project should have impact and stimulate research in fields such as engineering, physics, finance, and economics. The broader impacts of the project will also include attracting and training graduate students and postdoctoral scholars."

The existence of Stokes waves of extremal form and their geometric properties will be established.  The second aspect is the Cauchy problem for water waves.  This problem will be viewed as a system of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations, and a priori estimates for long-time behavior of solutions will be obtained.

A key objective of the proposed research is to develop new methodologies and mathematical theories in the rigorous analysis of the mathematical problem which models free-surface water waves. Results from the proposed project will enhance our understanding of the dynamics of the ocean wave currents, and they will help engineering designs and numerical simulations.

Success of inversion typically hinges on the practicality of solving wave or hyperbolic equations, or proper approximations thereof, on a massive computational scale. To this end, the PIs propose to revisit computational wave propagation in smooth media, in two and three space dimensions, in order to bring the complexity down to asymptotically linear in the size of the initial data, up to log factors and reasonable constants. In this low-complexity regime, precomputations involving the Green's function become the main focus of the numerical effort. To this end, the PIs propose to design, implement, test and analyze the following numerical methods: (1) an efficient algorithm for Fourier Integral Operators (FIO), using techniques such as phase-space partitionings, geometric downsamplings, directional interpolation, and low rank matrix approximations via random sampling, (2) an efficient algorithm for linear hyperbolic PDE with smooth coefficients, based on the above algorithm for FIO, and also using techniques such as the phase-flow method for travel times, separation and random samplings of pseudodifferential symbols, and special<br/>quadratures that exploit the microlocal geometry of wave propagation, and (3) an efficient algorithm for Kirchhoff migration in seismic imaging, based on the above algorithm for FIO, and also on a high-dimensional compression technique for the kinematics of the imaging operator. In a separate effort, the PIs will explore more general situations of physical interest such as phase blowups and multipathing, for which new ideas will be required.<br/><br/>The proposed research is directly motivated by the need for new, efficient inversion methods in reflection seismology. In turn, improved seismic imaging techniques (1) could help discover new physics and settle existing debates in geophysics (for instance concerning convection phenomena in the Earth's mantle), and (2) could provide a better map of the Earth's upper crust, for industrial exploration purposes. The PIs plan on working closely with seismologists in the later phases of the project, to deliver operational codes and disseminate ideas in the geophysics community. Alternatively, transmission electron microscopy is another curvilinear tomography imaging problem for which the proposed algorithms will provide a fresh outlook towards novel, accurate inversion methods, with applications in biology and medical imaging.<br/><br/><br/>"

In fact, modern society's need for analysis of temporal evolution of complex spatial systems far outpaces the technological, engineering and mathematical advances made so far. Spatial structures encountered in actual practice are often nontrivial due to long memory, or due to presence of ""rough"" geometrical constraints, and the existing analytical tools fail to describe spatio-temporal evolution of such systems, making solution of necessary parameter estimation and prediction problems very challenging. This project addresses some of these challenges and focuses on the analysis of continuous stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures. More specifically, the research will deal with the following major areas: 1. Analysis of multiparameter Volterra random fields (this includes construction of strong/weak martingale transforms generating the same natural filtration as the Volterra field, study of integrated Volterra kernels with respect to non-Gaussian martingales, analysis of Volterra random fields with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces, development of efficient simulation techniques for Volterra multiparameter fields); 2. Development of stochastic calculus with respect to Volterra random fields and the study of local time for Volterra processes; 3. <br/>Analysis of stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields (including the study of parabolic SPDEs perturbed by Volterra-type noise, analysis of stochastic evolution equations arising in nonlinear filtering of random fields when the observation noise has Volterra structure, representations and construction of suboptimal filters in that setting, development of numerical techniques for ``denoising"" of images with long-memory spatial structure. Stochastic evolution equations arising from systems of interacting randomly moving particles, which are subject to Volterra-type noises, will also be studied. 4. Inference for evolution equations driven by Volterra fields (estimation of coefficients when the Volterra kernel is known, plus estimation of parameters of the Volterra kernel itself). The results are expected to be useful in a wide variety of complex spatial systems, as they evolve in time. The project has a substantial nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of settings where image/video ``denoising"" is important. These range from tracking hurricanes via satellites to medical procedures involving analysis of spatial data streams that are recorded and transmitted by various devices.<br/><br/>Everyday we are surrounded by complex systems and are awash in spatial data. The importance of analysis and modelling of spatial phenomena is growing with the increasing use of remote-sensing images and video-streams arising in such diverse areas as geological and astrophysical sciences, climatology, biomedical applications and studies of population dynamics. Specific applications include Mobile-commerce industry (location based services), NASA's study of climatological effects of El Nino, land-use classification and global warming using satellite imagery, analysis of evolution of stars and galaxies via remote and Earth-based telescopes, studies by National Institute of Health on predicting spread of disease and epidemic control, not to mention ``routine"" analysis of traffic and infrastructure trends on the basis of specialized maps, which represent noisy ``snapshots"" of the state of complex spatial dynamical system taken at particular points in time. The use of random fields, which allow to take into account spatial interactions among variables in complex systems, is an increasingly important tool used in numerous problems of statistical mechanics, spatial statistics, neural network modelling, and others. At the same time many of the above real-life applications lack mathematically convenient Markov and martingale (spatial) structures, making the majority of available analytical tools inadequate. This project aims to address these challenges and to develop a theory of stochastic evolution equations driven by a large class of random fields, called Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures and allow for a wide range of (both, long and short) memory and pathwise properties. The project also has a significant nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of scientific and commercial settings where spatial filtering and image and video denoising are important. The research results emanating from this grant aim to advance the current state-of-the-art in stochastic analysis and will promote use of probabilistic methods among scientists in other areas. This encourages interaction between researchers with varying backgrounds and ultimately leads to new ideas, techniques and conclusions in each of those fields. For example, complex media, with its important applications and underlying microscopic processes, is typically linked to long-term memory, long-range interactions and non-Markovian kinetics. Some of the examples of the latter include processes in systems of many coupled elements, colloidal aggregates and chemical reaction medium, porous media, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, plasma physics, magnetosphere and many other fields. The project also has a substantial educational component."

An integer quantity called the index is one measure of how different a DAE is from being an explicit ordinary differential equation (ODE). Many problems are most naturally initially modeled as a DAE particularly those that are analyzed and simulated using computer generated mathematical models. DAEs occur in optimization when the original problem is a DAE or because of the activation of constraints. Because of DAEs importance, a variety of numerical techniques have been developed in recent years to simulate and analyze DAEs although most of these methods only work on specific classes of problems with special structure and low index. Unfortunately many widely used software packages cannot accept DAE models, or if they can accept them, the models must be index one or have special structure. One way to address both the problem of general DAE integrators and wider use of DAE models in current software, is to embed the DAE into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) called a completion of the DAE. The idea of embedding the DAE solutions into an ODE has been around for some time. However, traditional approaches either left the new additional dynamics under determined or again only worked for special classes of systems. A more general and automated type of embedding, such as that to be investigated in the proposed project, would greatly extend the applicability of many current software packages. In this project the investigators and his colleagues and students  will work on the analysis, computation, and application of completions of general DAEs.  Analysis backed algorithms will be constructed to generate completions with desired extra dynamics. The proposed research represents a major extension and modification of this idea to general nonlinear DAEs and the development of new results on controlling the nature of these additional dynamics. The obtained results will be of considerable independent interest but the proposal will focus on first applying the new results to simulation and control. The proposed research will result in improved algorithms and new theoretical understanding of numerical methods for differential algebraic equations and their use in control and simulation.<br/><br/>Increasingly in many problems in science and industry the process or machine is described in terms of what are called differential equations.  This  mathematical model is then used to simulate the process on a computer and to predict what the real system would do, to design more efficient processes, and to improve performance.  However, the problems of interest in science and engineering today  are becoming increasingly complex so that today mathematical models are often formed by  combining together several different mathematical models.  A mathematical model of a biotechnological  system, for example, might include equations describing fluid flow, chemical reactions, and mechanics.  These composite mathematical models are often very complex and are sometimes not in a form that is ready to be solved with current computer software.  It can then take considerable human effort, and sometimes a loss of accuracy, to convert these complex mathematical models to a form that can be readily used.  The conversion process not only takes time but can lead to errors.  The investigators of this project will develop theory backed mathematical procedures and algorithms that will facilitate and automate the conversion of the original complex mathematical models to models that can be used with existing software and algorithms.  This will reduce the time between model development and being able to use the model, improve the accuracy of the models, reduce the introduction of errors, and thereby speed up the design of industrial processes, and the analysis of many physical systems.  While the differential equations studied in this project occur widely, in the testing of the algorithms the investigators will initially  draw primarily on problems from the mechanical engineering and aerospace communities and the development of more efficient and reliable  manufacturing processes."

Specifically, the proposal addresses the appearance of period-doubling cascades in bifurcation diagrams as well as the occurrence of equilibrium clusters in extended systems, and aims at the development of rigorous computational tools for establishing heteroclinic connections.  The developed methodology will be applied to the study of transitional states in Cahn-Morral systems for phase separation in multicomponent alloys, and the study of complicated transition patterns in the Ohta Kawasaki diblock copolymer model. The methods developed for these examples are of general interest. They will serve as prototypes for solving similar intractable computational problems. In addition, the numerical tools developed for rigorous computation are general purpose and widely applicable.<br/><br/>This work is focused at the boundary between theory and computation, such that each method fails individually, but theory and computation together yield successful results.  Several of the examples focus on answering specific questions in materials science, including models for soft materials in synthetic chemistry such as block copolymers used as additive in adhesives, and phase separation for binary and multicomponent metal alloys. The research enables the better understanding and development of new materials.  One of the studied models is immediately relevant in atmospheric science, as it is used to study the creation of raindrops within a cloud.  In the longer term, there will be additional applications of these methods to a variety of pattern formation problems arising in chemistry and biology.  Students will be incorporated into this project from within an already existing research group of undergraduate and graduate students.

In this project the asymmetric simple exclusion process will be studied for a variety of different initial conditions.  The methods use ideas from Bethe Ansatz, Yang-Baxter equations as well as techniques from operator theory and combinatorics.  Generalizations of the model to more than one species will also be part of the project.  It is expected that these limit laws will have a ""universal"" behavior; and will, in fact, describe the fluctuations in a much larger class of growth models.<br/><br/>This project involves the study of current fluctuations in the asymmetric simple exclusion process for a variety of initial configurations.  This is a model of interacting particles on a one-dimensional lattice.  The model has attracted wide attention from both mathematicians and physicists since it is one of the simplest models to incorporate far from equilibrium behavior with nonclassical fluctuations.  These fluctuations are expected to have a new universal behavior similar in their applicability to the famous bell-shaped curve (the Gaussian distribution) of classical probability.  A long-term goal of research in this area is the establishment of new limit laws similar in nature to the classical central limit theorem.  Already these new universal distributions are being applied to various problems in growth processes, population genetics, and finance.  This project will extend our knowledge of fluctuations to a much wider class of growth models."

The variation of density enables the propagation of internal waves - waves in the interior of the fluid - not on its surface. These waves, as they propagate, can deform and break and, when they do, they mix fluid of different densities, changing the medium in which they propagate. A competing effect is mixing engendered by shear instabilities. This project will develop a mathematical methodology for the study of the evolution of fully nonlinear sheared, stratified flows, with the goal to understand and model the dynamics leading to fluid mixing. The wave and shear-generated mixing will be addressed with tools in the theory of systems of finite and infinitely many conservation laws. We shall calculate and study exact nonlinear solutions that break - especially simple waves of the system, general criteria for the nonlinear stability of systems of mixed type, and the statistical description of incomplete systems, based on the maximization of a coarse-grained mixing entropy.<br/><br/>This research is concerned with the propagation of waves and the dynamics of shear in atmospheric and oceanic flows and how these phenomena mix the fluid in which they exist. Mixing in geophysical flows is a crucial component of climate dynamics. The rate of mixing of ocean waters, for instance, determines the temperature at the surface, which communicates directly with the atmosphere, affecting our weather and climate. The dispersion and mixing of chemicals, carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere, on the other hand, has a profound effect on the radiative balance leading to predictions for climate change.  Waves are also an element of atmospheric teleconnection: they can have long range effects since they carry energy over long distances without transporting the fluid itself. Since the length scales in which the waves and the mixing processes occur are too small and fast to be computed together with planetary scale flows, they are nowadays represented by a low number of aggregate parameters  (parameterized) using simple criteria. A better understanding of the dynamics and mixing processes will improve these parameterizations and the reliability of the climate models that use them."

Examples are the phase separation of lipids in giant vesicles, the time evolution of liquid crystalline order, and the distribution of defects that determine the shapes of vesicles.  The goal of this project is to develop a simple and effective scheme for the numerical description of nonlinear diffusion on a sphere.  The first specific problem to be considered is the solution of the Cahn-Hilliard equation on the unit sphere.  The investigators solve the Cahn-Hilliard and related equations numerically, using real space discretization.  Numerical simulations are sensitive to details of the underlying lattice.  Because it is not possible to construct a regular lattice on a sphere (if the number of points >20), they plan to use a random lattice, obtained by placing points randomly on the surface of the sphere.  In devising a strategy towards this goal, three fascinating topics emerge: Voronoi tessellation of the sphere to identity the nearest neighbors of each lattice site; stable and efficient scheme to approximate differential operators; and regularizing the grid. <br/><br/>     This project provides a new algorithm to identify nearest neighbors among random points on a sphere.  This is useful for solving a wide variety of problems, ranging from dominance regions of military bases around the world and the locating of fuel depots to modeling the behavior of vesicles and related biological objects.  In addition, it gives insights into numerical stability associated with the approximants of differential operators on random lattices, and regularization strategies for improving random grids.  It enables the effective numerical solution of nonlinear diffusion equations on a sphere, and thereby makes possible numerical descriptions of a wide variety of problems in soft condensed matter physics.  An important aspect of the project is to get students and postdocs from underrepresented groups actively involved in this exciting research. <br/><br/>"

These diverse systems have two things in common: (i) they are dissipative systems driven by homogeneous forcing, and (ii) there is range of forcing within which the application of different finite<br/>amplitude perturbations can lead to distinct localized states. This proposal seeks to extend existing theory, partly developed by the PI and coworkers, to higher dimensions and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of finite domain size, anisotropy and loss of translation invariance on the origin and properties of these structures. The techniques used include bifurcation theory for reversible and near-reversible systems, coupled with numerical branch-following and direct numerical simulations of realistic systems.<br/><br/>Many systems respond to spatially uniform forcing by producing a spatial pattern. These patterns may take the form of a periodic array of cells or spots, or in particular cases by producing a single spot or group of spots. This proposal seeks to understand the relation between these two types of response, and to predict the conditions under which the latter response may be expected. There are many potential applications of a spot-like response. In optics individual spots may be ""written"" and ""erased"" using a laser beam, a procedure that may be used to store information. Mechanical structures often buckle in a localized way. Thin liquid films may break up into drops. A chemical process that uses catalysis may be degraded because the chemical conversion fails to proceed uniformly in space. These are all examples of spatially localized structures of the type that will be studied as part of this project. These spot-like structures may also move and interact. Such moving structures are involved, for example, in signaling along nerve fibers. The project seeks to predict the formation of these structures and to understand their basic properties."

The analysis of hyperbolic systems has traditionally been focused on systems without non-linear source terms, as the nonlinearities in the hyperbolic operators themselves are rather intricate, and play an important role in the nature of the solutions. Significantly less attention has been paid to the role of nonlinear source terms such as those arising in the shallow-water equations and in the reactive Euler equations. Such source terms are responsible for a rich variety of phenomena, including the complex dynamical features of detonation shock fronts. In this project, we investigate the role of the nonlinear wave interactions arising from source terms in the shallow-water system, which may be responsible for the formation of polygonal hydraulic jumps.<br/><br/>This project concerns the dynamics of peculiar flow structures that may emerge from the circular hydraulic jump. When a vertical jet impinges on a flat solid surface, the jet fluid spreads radially in a thinning film until reaching a critical radius at which the film thickness increases dramatically in what is termed a `hydraulic jump'. In certain parameter regimes, despite the axisymmetric source conditions, striking asymmetric flows emerge, including polygonal hydraulic jumps, the explanation for which remains elusive. Our combined theoretical, numerical and experimental project will be focused towards rationalizing these subtle flows by developing the mathematical analogy between hydraulic jumps and detonation shock fronts.

Because of the many physical effects present and the vastly different timescales involved, however, making quantitative predictions about the behavior of these systems and their fundamental performance limits is a challenging task.  This project will address these challenges by developing new mathematical models aimed at describing these lasers' behavior and an accompanying set of analytical and computational tools.  The new models, which will explicitly take into account the inherent complexity of these systems and the multiple time scales present, will then be used to analyze the mode-locking and nonlinear dynamics of pulses in the laser cavity.  Moreover, these new models will guide the development of statistical computational algorithms that can accurately quantify the impact of noise and calculate the probability of the rare events that limit the accuracy and ultimate reliability of these systems.<br/><br/>Femtosecond lasers have a wide range of applicability.

This activity centers on the Wyoming Applied Analysis & Computing Group, a team consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, University of Wyoming faculty, and faculty from Wyoming's network of community colleges. <br/><br/>Nonlinear partial differential equations arise generically in mathematical models of physical phenomena.  However, a broad understanding of their properties remains a fundamental challenge in pure and applied mathematics. The differential equations that are the focus of this research are physically motivated, and their features (nonlinearity, multiple space dimensions, multiple scales) represent some of the central challenges in the analysis of such equations.  The research agenda includes investigation of a recent conjecture about the formation of violent oscillations in the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation; this conjecture is part of an emerging belief that the formation of these oscillations may have a universal character.  The validation of the appearance of such universal behavior in differential equations is certain to drive a wave of new developments in the analysis of nonlinear phenomena.  On a mathematical level, the plan of attack is based on a broad array of analytical techniques, including Evans functions, singular perturbations, dynamical systems, spectral theory for linear operators, complex analysis, and numerical analysis.  The anticipated results, if achieved, have the potential to make an impact on applications and other areas of mathematics.  One of the research projects aims to extend the asymptotic analysis of Riemann-Hilbert problems arising in the analysis of integrable partial differential equations; such extensions are expected to be useful in the seemingly unrelated analysis of orthogonal polynomials and random matrices.<br/><br/>The breadth of mathematical tools required by the research agenda ensures that the Wyoming Applied Analysis & Computing Group will serve as an ideal training ground in applied analysis and computation for the next generation of researchers and students.  In addition to collective work on the research agenda, the group will host an annual two-week immersion into research activities for select community-college faculty.  Additionally, the group's activities will include participation in the annual ""articulation conferences"" that are held to connect the math and science departments at the University of Wyoming with those at Wyoming's seven community colleges.  These activities will strengthen the mathematical network across the state.  The group's recruitment and training strategy is partially based on the development of a novel calculus course that treats numerical methods as an intrinsic part of calculus.  The course prepares students to participate in the group at an early stage of their careers. <br/>"

The<br/>workshop is conceived specifically to identify new challenges for<br/>theory, modeling and simulation of soft materials, and to<br/>investigate the growing role of applied and computational<br/>mathematics in meeting those challenges.  The goal of the<br/>workshop is to attract researchers at all levels, from graduate<br/>students and junior researchers to leaders in the field, with<br/>focus on breadth and diversity of the participants.  Particular<br/>emphasis is placed on the training of young participants.  The<br/>results are disseminated in a format useful to students,<br/>scientists and engineers, through graduate courses with<br/>interdisciplinary audience at Colorado State University, and<br/>through the publication of a refereed Collected Lectures volume<br/>of the invited and contributed talks. <br/><br/>     From blood and lipid complexes, detergents, paints,<br/>plastics, personal care products, to liquid crystals and<br/>bio-materials, we are made of and surrounded by soft matter in<br/>all aspects of our lives.  While many properties of hard matter<br/>are now understood, we are still on the learning curve with soft<br/>matter, and the study of the salient features and complex<br/>behavior of soft materials is one of the 21st century's<br/>challenges, requiring the development of new tools, new<br/>understanding, and an unprecedented level of interdisciplinary<br/>collaboration.  Progress in materials science achieved in the<br/>last decades, as well as the rapid development of computer<br/>technology, have brought scientists to a better understanding of<br/>soft matter behavior and phenomena.  Although much progress in<br/>this area has been made in recent years, fundamental challenges<br/>remain, such as the development of a unified scientific approach<br/>to soft materials, and the conversion of the important scientific<br/>discoveries into useful technological solutions.  The workshop<br/>brings together experts in mathematics, physics and engineering<br/>to explore and develop the potential in this rich<br/>interdisciplinary area, and generates a diverse,<br/>cross-disciplinary, but highly cooperative research environment<br/>that increases the accessibility of this interdisciplinary field<br/>to both students entering the field and non-specialists.  The<br/>workshop presents a broad spectrum of current research and<br/>prospects for future directions that provides young researchers<br/>with an intensive learning experience and a larger perspective<br/>beyond their individual PhD thesis topics. <br/>"

The value of derivative securities naturally depends on how risks are managed, as well as the investor?s preferences between risk and return. This project will systematically investigate some recent problems that involve incorporating the investor's risk preferences into the valuation of derivatives, with a focus on employee stock options (ESOs) and credit derivatives. The project objective is to design efficient and robust valuation models that can be calibrated given market data and applied to construct the optimal risk management strategies consistent with the investor?s risk preferences. The research involves developing applicable mathematical tools to model, estimate, and analyze the complex risk structures of these derivatives, which have a significant bearing on their values. Moreover, the project includes the analytical and numerical studies of a number of stochastic control and optimal stopping problems that naturally arise in these valuation problems. By quantifying their risks and returns, the research will also shed light on some optimal contract design problems for these derivatives.<br/><br/>Employee stock options are an important component of compensation in the US. Concerned about their cost to shareholders, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board since 2004 has required firms to estimate and report the granting cost of ESOs. The central challenge of ESO valuation lies in the uncertain timing of option exercises, which depends on the employee's risk aversion and various contractual restrictions of the options. On the other hand, credit derivatives are financial instruments whose payoffs are contingent on the occurrence of default event(s), such as the bankruptcy of a firm. The trading volume of credit derivatives has grown dramatically in the past decade, but the valuation and risk management technologies have not kept up. The recent crisis in the credit markets reflects ineffective risk management of complex credit derivatives by major financial institutions. Hence, this research aims to develop a valuation framework that explicitly accounts for the investor's risk preferences, contractual features and market conditions, so as to accurately quantify the risks of these derivatives. These valuation problems are important not only for individual or institutional investors, but also for regulators."

The research is focused on the vortex filament equation (VFE) that describes the motion of the vortex filament, assuming that the motion of a vortex filament in an incompressible, inviscid fluid is due to its own induction. The VFE is related to the nonlinear Schroedinger equation via a Hasimoto map. The project will take advantage of this relation to investigate stability of special solutions (Hasimoto solitons) for VFE, and to extend the analysis to the models that incorporate physical effects initially neglected by the idealized VFE model. <br/><br/>Hasimoto solitons take the form of localized loops traveling along the vortex filament. Solitary waves of vortices in turbulent fluids have been observed both in laboratory and numerical experiments. While the most commonly encountered phenomena involving vortex filaments are waterspouts and tornadoes, the study of vortex filaments has fascinating applications to other aspects of science such as in superfluidity and superconductivity. In specific applications, Hasimoto solitons occur, for example, in the context of superconductivity, of tornadoes, of particle transport in a fluid by solitons, and of laser-matter interaction. Although they have been studied abundantly in the literature not much is known about their stability. The main purpose of this project is studying solutions' stability properties, which is of fundamental importance, since only stable solutions can be realized and observed experimentally. The project involves a broad participation of undergraduate and graduate students. In the process of doing research the students will learn sophisticated numerical and mathematical methods needed to carry this research through."

The widespread use of these materials is due to their ability to retain information in the form of distinct magnetization states, without the need of being powered, and the possibility to read and write information in a fast and reliable way.  Magnetization reversal in thin ferromagnetic films is often mediated by appearance and motion of domain walls, which can be considered as line defects separating different magnetic domains.  This project studies one particular type of magnetic domain wall, which is of intrinsically topological nature -- winding domain walls.  The simplest winding domain wall is a 360-degree wall, in which the magnetization vector rotates by a 360-degree angle in the film plane across the wall.  The investigator undertakes a systematic study of existence, stability, and motion of winding domain walls and investigates their role in magnetization reversal processes.  This problem presents many mathematical challenges, because existence and properties of winding domain walls are determined by a delicate balance of different nonlinear and nonlocal forces.  The investigator develops new analytical, asymptotic, numerical and stochastic tools to tackle these challenges.<br/><br/>     This project is strongly motivated by the efforts to develop a new, universal computer memory based on thin film ferromagnetic materials: MRAM (Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory).  Therefore, the potential impact of the results of the project on the computer industry and society, in general, is high.  To this end, the investigator addresses the questions of feasibility and reliability of the designs that utilize ferromagnetic nanorings as storage elements.  A key component of the project is the involvement of a new generation of applied mathematicians into this highly interdisciplinary area of research.  As part of this process, the investigator develops courses in applied sciences and takes part in interdisciplinary training of mathematics and engineering graduate and undergraduate students.  The aim of these efforts is to help foster better interactions between researchers in applied mathematics and experimental scientists.  The tools developed by the investigator are also expected to be useful for  many other problems of energy-driven pattern formation.<br/>"

Recent numerical simulations have presented evidence of unexpectedly singular behavior at the formation points of Mach stems.  These studies call for analytical confirmation, and insight will be gained from simple prototype examples.  In the self-similar approach, the systems change type -- hyperbolic far from the origin (""supersonic flow"") and of mixed hyperbolic-elliptic type near the origin (""subsonic region"").  Analysis of the subsonic solution gives rise to free boundary problems in mixed-type partial differential equations with mixed boundary conditions (Dirichlet and oblique derivative).  Earlier work solved such free boundary problems locally near shock reflection points, but only for one simple interaction (regular reflection) and only for simplified systems (where the elliptic equation decoupled from the hyperbolic system).  The current project will develop new techniques for the more complicated problems that arise when the boundary condition is not uniformly oblique, and when the equations in the subsonic system do not decouple.  Finally, study of a prototype example of diverging rarefactions problems will shed light on singular Mach stem formation points.  <br/><br/>Conservation laws model fundamental problems in aerodynamics and continuum mechanics.  Better understanding has consequences in real world applications.  For example, the large-scale numerical simulations that form the basis of weather and climate prediction and of nuclear reactor safety analysis are based on partial differential equations in the form of conservation laws.  Theoretical advances, particularly in the analysis of singular behavior, will find their way into making numerical codes more efficient and more reliable.  In carrying out this research, the investigators will build on success in introducing beginning researchers, including members of groups underrepresented in mathematics, to the theory of conservation laws, and in expanding their career horizons.<br/>"
