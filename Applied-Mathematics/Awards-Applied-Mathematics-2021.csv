The key components of the project are the improved understanding of turbulent energy transfers between large and small scales in the fluid.  This involves vigorous interactions between current systems like the Gulf Stream and fast wave motions that cannot be seen by current global ocean computer models. Overall, the proposed work has broad impacts within fluid mechanics, physical oceanography, and its training aspects include both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The fluid dynamics of these complex systems is characterized by a nonlinear jigsaw puzzle of intermingling turbulent waves and vortices, especially at small scales, such as those relevant to submesoscale oceanography, for instance. Here classical wave-mean interaction theory fails, direct numerical simulation of the fluid motion with global computational models is not possible, and theoretical innovations for diagnostic and predictive models are needed. In this connection the present proposal seeks to break new ground with a multi-pronged approach that combines theory and numerical modelling. First, the long term evolution of turbulent internal wave spectra under refraction by the balanced mean flow is studied using a novel wave action advection-diffusion theory. Second, vigorous two-way interactions between internal waves and the balanced mean flow are studied using new wave-mean interaction equations derived from generalized Lagrangian-mean theory. These equations allow for strong interactions that cut both ways: the waves feel the mean flow and vice versa.  This is an important but understudied regime for submesoscale oceanography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite a growing body of experimental evidence in favor of peridynamic modeling, there remain several mathematical and computational challenges that may hinder its potential widespread use in applications. On the computational side, standard numerical methods can be prohibitively expensive due to the need to handle longer range interactions, while on the theoretical side, progress is needed in understanding the sources and evolution of discontinuities and in identifying the local limiting behavior and the connection to nonlinear elastodynamics. Furthermore, while for practical engineering usage, precise application of boundary conditions is essential, nonlocal boundary conditions are still poorly understood. This project addresses these challenges by developing new mathematical and computational strategies which advance peridynamic modeling and increase its appeal for engineering applications. The project provides training opportunities in applied and computational mathematics for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/> <br/>This project introduces a unified and systematic approach based on Fourier spectral analysis for studying linear and nonlinear peridynamic models and their applications. The approach is built on a foundation of analytical and computational methods for linear peridynamics, which are then lifted to nonlinear peridynamics. The investigators will study the Fourier multipliers of peridynamic operators and develop efficient algorithms to compute them. This Fourier multipliers analysis will be used to develop regularity results, spectral solvers in periodic setups, and a Fourier Continuation method for boundary value conditions. The spectral methods introduced are efficient and well-suited to study peridynamics as they decouple the nonlocality parameter and the grid size, in contrast to finite difference or finite element methods in which the nonlocality scales with grid size. From the applications point of view, the Fourier analysis approach will be utilized in the context of peridynamics to study nonlocal boundary conditions, to investigate the sources and evolution of discontinuities, and to better understand the connection between nonlocal equations and their local classical counterparts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The agents may be investors, drivers, or viruses, and the large systems may be financial markets, highways, or epidemics, for example. The most widely used framework for modeling competition between many interacting agents, known as ""mean field game theory,"" is fundamentally limited in scope to symmetric models, in which each agent interacts equally with each of the others. Many important phenomena, on the other hand, are governed by networks---such as those formed by social ties or financial obligations ? that determine which agents interact with each other. Network structures have important implications that the standard theory cannot capture. This project tackles this limitation by developing new mathematical frameworks to handle large-scale models of competition with heterogeneous interactions governed by networks. Both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in the research activities, and local K-12 outreach efforts are designed to foster an interest in applied mathematics and continued education.<br/><br/>This project builds a rigorous foundation for a new era of network-based mean field game theory and applications. The first goal is to identify the range of network structures for which the standard mean field approximation is valid, in order to substantially extend the scope of the mean field paradigm. For those network structures for which the standard mean field approximation fails, the second goal is to identify and analyze tractable alternatives. Certain important features of mean field approximations, such as asymptotic independence, fail in sparse (as opposed to dense) networks, and the third goal of the research is to identify precise sparsity thresholds for this and other phenomena. This project adapts and extends recent methodologies of graph limit theories and large deviations, which have a strong track record of solving network-based problems in statistical physics. New mathematical challenges arise in the game-theoretic setting due to the long-range dependencies induced by competitive equilibrium, and new techniques must be developed to address these challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These algorithms are increasingly entrusted with decision-making tasks, from discarding emails as spam to recommending routes when one drives to work, to the future decisions made by self-driving cars and medical images produced for diagnostic purposes. These applications give rise to noisy data resulting from measurement errors and variability in the experimental setup or environment.  Despite this, almost all current theoretical results focus on the accurate estimation of underlying parameters. However, it is crucial to pay attention to confidence intervals that quantify the variability of the learned parameters, which allows one to make decisions with confidence.

This project will also help train graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in uncertainty estimation for large-scale learning problems, thus making them better prepared for careers in both industry and academia.<br/> <br/>The investigators will establish central limit theorems and consistent online bootstrap procedures for fundamental stochastic iterative learning algorithms, incorporate these algorithms in software packages, and develop a framework for assessing confidence in point estimate predictions in a broad range of applications.

The increase in computing power and the development of powerful algorithms have made it possible to apply the techniques of inverse problems to real-world problems of growing complexity. This research will focus on inverse problems with applications that include a number of medical techniques as well as other problems in imaging, such as locating oil and mineral deposits in the Earth's substructure, creating of astrophysical images from telescope data, finding cracks and interfaces within materials, shape optimization, and many others. The familiar medical imaging technologies of computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are examples where inverse problems have played a fundamental role and have helped to save lives.<br/><br/>This research will develop the mathematical theory of several fundamental inverse problems. The first project deals with a relatively new medical imaging technique called electrical impedance tomography. In EIT, one attempts to determine an object's electrical properties by making voltage and current measurements at the boundary of the object. One potential application is in medical imaging, particularly in detecting pulmonary edema or a cancerous tumor since such anomalies have very different electrical properties in normal situations. The second project is travel time tomography. In this imaging technique, the Principal Investigator (PI) will probe the object with different types of waves, like electromagnetic waves or sound waves.  By measuring the travel times of the waves going through the medium, the PI will attempt to determine the properties of the medium. The third project is an inverse problem arising in nonlinear acoustics. It has applications in ultrasound, particularly in a medical imaging technique called tissue harmonic imaging (THI).

This phenomenon of pattern formation occurs in many natural and physical systems, for example the organization of vegetation into patches in semiarid ecosystems, stripes and spots which appear on animal coats, or the rippling of stretched thin films. This project will advance the theory of patterns through the analysis of model partial differential equations (PDEs) describing patterns in applications. A particular focus will be the stability of patterns, or their resilience to perturbations or environmental changes, as well as the formation and control of defects, or imperfections, in pattern forming systems. In terms of application areas, this project will contribute to our understanding of vegetation patterns and the phenomenon of desertification and will explore the effect of environmental conditions on pattern selection. Additionally, the project will advance knowledge concerning the structure and control of wrinkling patterns in stressed materials, as well as the formation and stability of various morphologies in amphiphilic systems. Undergraduate students will participate in the project through summer REU (research experience for undergraduates) opportunities.<br/><br/>This project is organized around three primary topics: (i) stripes and spots in reaction-diffusion-advection equations describing vegetation patterns, (ii) defects and wrinkling patterns in (an)isotropic Swift?Hohenberg systems, (iii) existence and stability of amphiphilic structures in density functional models. These research topics will inform specific applications as well as develop and advance the theory of planar (and higher dimensional) patterns; further, they will examine the effect of anisotropy in pattern selection, stability, and defect formation in example systems. This research builds on the existence and stability theory of planar and higher-dimensional far-from-onset patterns through the development and use of singular perturbation methods; these methods will have broad applicability in reaction-diffusion-advection systems, and singularly perturbed PDEs more generally. Specifically, tools will be developed to analyze the appearance and stability of striped patterns, as well as radially symmetric patterns such as spots and rings in the context of vegetation, and cylindrical/spherical micelles and vesicles in amphiphilic systems. Spatial dynamics and functional analytic methods will also be developed to construct far-from-onset radial lattice patterns.

This project is an exploration of the fundamental problem of analyzing the configurations observed in phase transitions in liquid crystals.  Principally, the project will elucidate how the shape of the interface between different phases is determined by a balance of elastic forces and surface tension. The results will be of importance in mathematics, physics, and materials science since development of various morphologies in coexisting phases is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon. The acquired knowledge will bring about new and powerful tools to experimentally control these morphologies, leading to new and exciting applications. This interdisciplinary program further provides opportunities to educate students in the mathematics and physics of liquid crystals. <br/><br/>The project will focus on the characterization and description of the overall shape and internal structure of soft condensates representing nuclei of the orientationally ordered phases shaped by bulk elasticity with disparate elastic moduli and anisotropic surface tension. The proposed work will consider a broad spectrum of liquid crystals, embracing nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals that are described by non-orientable director line fields and experience transitions into partially positionally ordered phases, and newly discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals that are described by the director and a vector-valued electric polarization. The mathematical emphasis is on the analysis of stationary variational problems for energies defined over vector- and tensor-valued fields in two and three dimensions and associated gradient flows, so as to describe the equilibrium configurations of liquid crystals and dynamics of interfaces in a plethora of their phase transitions. The principal novelty of the proposed work is that it will consider singular limits of liquid crystal energies that impose severe geometric rigidity on admissible classes of functions. The primary challenges to the analysis arise due to high dimensionality of a target space and the need to consider singular asymptotic limits that result in highly nonlinear constraints. The combined analytical/experimental approach will be essential in that it will provide a clear check of success for the analytical predictions; these predictions, in turn, will guide the experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research advances a vast array of applications in technology and science where entropic methods are used and leads to a transfer of knowledge between optimal transport, mathematical finance and probability theory.

Moreover, it studies the stability of EOT with respect to the marginal distributions, as well as the so-called Schrödinger potentials that solve an associated dual problem. The second part of this proposal studies the calibration of option pricing models in finance.  Starting with a reference model, such as a standard stochastic volatility model, and option price data given by the market, a calibrated model is chosen by minimizing the relative entropy with respect to the reference among all martingales fitting the data. This nonparametric approach is data-driven and flexible while retaining desirable qualities of the reference model.

The aims of this project differ from those of other work because the focus is non-Markov DPs and the hurdles that come from path dependence.  Issues that are explored in depth include the level of accuracy needed in the training set generated by a Monte Carlo particle method, and the role that implicit regularization plays in the TensorFlow algorithms.  The project also considers more conventional theoretical concepts that may provide proof of this method's general effectiveness, such as the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation for continuous functions and the types of sigmoidal functions used in neural networks.

The goal of this part of the work is to guide the design of isolators with improved performance under large displacements. Other parts of the project concern composite materials and metamaterials. Composite materials are important in applications throughout modern technology and manufacturing. Metamaterials, which are engineered composite materials where dissimilar materials are combined to produce a structure with properties unlike those of the components, can have properties not found in naturally occurring materials and among other uses can serve important functions in guiding waves. The goals of these parts of the project are to guide the design of dynamic metamaterials and to enhance understanding of the mathematical underpinnings for composite materials, as well as understanding inherent limits on their properties and behavior. Parts of this work have potential application to medical imaging and other noninvasive testing. The project includes the interdisciplinary training of a postdoctoral research associate.<br/><br/>The research consists of five parts: (1) work on earthquake isolators utilizes mechanisms of plate-hinge linkages to develop a new conceptional approach to the construction of structural units that insulate a building from horizontal or vertical movement of the ground during seismic events; (2) design of space-time metamaterial microstructures in which energy is locally conserved, eliminating the need of current space-time microstructures to couple with outside systems, or employ supplementary pumping waves, to generate or absorb energy as demanded; (3) search for fundamental understanding of exact relations and links in the theory of composites, which could help in the discovery of new relations applicable to media where the local tensor field of material moduli take values on a manifold that is not rotationally invariant; (4) obtaining estimates of the range of possible behaviors in the time domain for viscoelastic two-phase composites or bodies, which could help in design of materials with desired temporal responses and in estimation of the volume fractions occupied by the phases; and (5) work on determining the range that the complex dielectric tensor can take in an anisotropic composite of two anisotropic phases, which could facilitate design of structures that absorb a maximum amount of electromagnetic energy or that guide electric and electric displacement fields in desired ways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their complexity, these models often see manifestations of the second law of thermodynamics, which push the gas or fluid towards a state of maximum entropy, which is, statistically, easier to predict. This project explores the finer details that determine whether such models remain in a chaotic regime, manifesting as turbulence, shocks, and plasma echoes, or thermalize, becoming smoother and converging to an equilibrium. These phenomena are explored in two main contexts: in the regularity properties, continuation criteria, potential shock formation of the Boltzmann and Landau equations, and versions with large-scale electromagnetic interactions; and in the enhanced diffusivity of fluid equations where effective viscosity grows with local turbulence, a family of models originated by Kolmogorov and used in oceanography. The project also provides training and research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.<br/><br/>This research examines the construction and implementation of novel regularizing mechanisms in two important contexts. First, the investigator will apply their recent discoveries in kinetic mass spreading to probe the current frontier of the regularity program for the Boltzmann and Landau equations. For these models of high-energy gases and plasmas, the collision interaction is known to behave roughly like a fractional Laplacian operator with highly nonlocal and possibly degenerate coefficients. These intricacies are major impediments to the well-posedness theory. Nevertheless, the current state-of-the-art grants that smooth unique solutions exist for as long as certain macroscopic quantities remain under control a priori. The investigator's recent work establishes that half of these quantities are in fact controlled dynamically, yielding more precise estimates for the solution. This project extends these results to wider scopes, domains with boundary, rotationally symmetric configurations, and settings with electromagnetic interactions, and pairs them with existing estimates from the regularity theory for fluid equations. Second, the project will investigate novel a priori bounds that can be derived from non-isothermal fluid equations where the local temperature influences the viscosity. The investigator's prior work has demonstrated a unique mechanism for enhanced dissipation arising from thermal viscosity and in developing maximum principles for coupled non-isothermal models. These effects are examined in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system and in models of porous media type and of turbulent dissipation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop new algorithms for fast and accurate reconstructions that will be able to determine interior features.

The project will focus on electrical impedance tomography, where the theory will be extended for an operator mapping a Hilbert space into the dual space. The goal is to develop the analytical framework for a new algorithm for shape reconstruction.

At one extreme is chaos and turbulence, wherein the fluid forms complicated fractal-like patterns, the details of which cannot be exactly repeated in experiments due to being very sensitive to small changes in the initial conditions. Turbulence is observed often in fluids, such as in the wakes of aircraft, vehicles, and even obstacles such as buildings and bridges and in the large-scale dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. At the opposite extreme is the motion of vortex filaments, the most notable examples being tornadoes and the wing-tip vortices commonly shed from wings and helicopter blades. Vortex filaments tend to move in a predictable manner and maintain their structural integrity for extended periods of time. The goal of this project is to develop a better mathematical understanding of these opposite phenomena in fluid mechanics. The accurate prediction of vortex filaments and turbulence is crucial in a variety of scientific and industrial applications, including in the design of air, land, and sea vehicles and in the understanding of complex fluid systems such as the climate and weather. Having a firm mathematical foundation could help other applied researchers obtain deeper insights and lead to better modeling. Further, an understanding of these extremes helps pave the way for a better understanding of the interactions and intermediate regimes, where flows have a mix of structure and chaos. Finally, overcoming the mathematical challenges to these questions will require innovations that will be of interest to the wider mathematical community. The research projects are also integrated with the training of graduate students and younger scientists in mathematics and STEM. <br/><br/>The PI will develop a more mathematically rigorous understanding of two behaviors observed in incompressible fluids at high Reynolds numbers: (1) the coherent motion of vortex filaments; (2) turbulence under ""generic"", statistically steady forcing. The fundamental questions motivating the PI are: (A) how accurate are the commonly used geometric evolution models such as the Local Induction Approximation (LIA) for the motion of a vortex filament in a fluid with vorticity concentrated on a smooth curve? (B) can we provide a proof for the experimentally observed positive Lyapunov exponents and anomalous dissipation (e.g., as the celebrated Kolmogorov 4/5 law) from the stochastically forced 3D Navier-Stokes in the high Reynolds number limit? These require a number of unexplored mathematical ideas and currently, there exists no clear way to attack them yet. Instead, the PI has identified several independently interesting problems to build necessary mathematical foundations. For (A), the PI and his collaborators will study vortex filaments in quantum fluids governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The quantum case is expected to be easier than the classical case due to the quantization of vorticity and slightly more amenable linearized operators. First, the PI and collaborators will study the stability of vortex solutions in 2d Gross-Pitaevskii, providing necessary ground for understanding the filament core. Next, the PI and collaborators will show that the LIA accurately describes the motion of nearly-straight, and potentially more general, quantum vortex filaments long enough to make useful predictions. For (B), the PI and his collaborators will: (1) develop novel qualitative theory for Lyapunov exponents in stochastic PDEs inspired by ideas from random dynamical systems; (2) develop better tools for quantitative hypoelliptic regularity and Lyapunov exponent estimation in high dimensional systems; and (3) study quantitative and nonlinear aspects of Lagrangian chaos, that is, how the chaotic dynamics of particles in a fluid can be translated into nonlinear dynamics of the fluid itself.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, the research will develop new nonlinear bi-Lipchitz extensions of linear modewise JL-maps for tensor data capable of preserving distances between all low rank tensors in a given database and all other lower rank tensors, even outside of the database. These new nonlinear embeddings techniques will allow improved theoretical guarantees for space-constrained learning and classification with polynomial kernels. Finally, these embeddings will also be applied to address data-intensive problems in quantum many-body theory and nuclear physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proposed by Einstein in 1915, it has been overwhelmingly confirmed by experiments and is today an essential part of the toolbox employed by physicists studying astrophysics and cosmology. Mathematically, the theory is rich, and the topic of mathematical general relativity is now an exciting and active field of research among mathematicians. This project deals with mathematical properties of relativistic fluids, and in particular with the mathematical structure of theories describing the motion of fluids under conditions in which the laws of relativity cannot be neglected. Examples include accretion disks near black holes, the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma that forms in collisions of heavy-ions in particle accelerators, and the study of fine properties of star evolution. The mathematical advances and techniques brought about by this project will be important for applications, particularly for the study of viscous effects on mergers of neutron stars. In terms of broader impact, the research has a strong interdisciplinary component and will continue a fruitful interaction between mathematics and physics. This project will also contribute to the education of young scientists, continuing the PI's efforts to disseminate some of the most recent findings in relativistic fluid dynamics to graduate students and post-docs.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will investigate: (a) local well-posedness of the Einstein-Euler system with a physical vacuum boundary; (b) shock formation for the relativistic Euler equations; (c) causality and local well-posedness of theories of relativistic viscous fluids; and (d) formulations of the equations of relativistic viscous fluids coupled to the Einstein equations that are suitable for the numerical simulations of neutron star mergers. A unifying feature of all the partial differential equations (PDEs) studied in this project is that they form a system with multiple characteristic speeds. Understanding systems of this type in more than one spatial dimension is currently one of the main challenges in hyperbolic PDEs. All problems will be studied under realistic physical assumptions. This involves, in particular, considering relativistic fluids in three spatial dimensions, with vorticity, and without symmetry assumptions. Not only is such treatment essential for applications, but it also involves a great deal of rich mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The development of a mathematical theory of nonlocal interactions plays a significant role in the understanding of complex structures, with rich applications in physics, biology, and social sciences. One example of the effects of nonlocal behavior found in nature is the collective dynamics in animal swarms, where small-scale interactions emerge into intriguing global phenomena. This project develops novel and robust analytical techniques for models that share similar nonlocality. These tools help to advance the understanding of the hidden structures of the models, and ultimately have an impact in applications, such as in traffic flow, where they can be used to study how to integrate nonlocal communications into a smart traffic network to improve efficiency and avoid traffic congestions. The training and professional development of graduate students is an integral part of the project.<br/> <br/>The project studies three families of nonlocal transport equations. The first family includes the Euler-alignment system describing the flocking phenomenon for animal swarms. The goal is to establish a global well-posedness theory for the system in multi-dimensions, starting from imposing radial symmetry, and to apply the methodology to other models, such as the Euler-Poisson equations and more.  The second includes a nonlocal transport equation which describes the evolution of the distribution of polynomial roots under repeated differentiation, the aim is to find a rigorous connection between this equation and the differentiation process.

A typical example arises when cream is stirred into morning coffee; the cream folds and filaments into ever decreasing scales, while the motion of the coffee itself appears to form, out of these filaments, one large swirl. In geophysical and astrophysical systems, spontaneous self-organization into large-scale jets (e.g., gulf stream, Jovian jets) and vortices (e.g., oceanic gyres, hurricanes) is commonly observed. The prediction of the amplitude, internal structure, and long-term behavior of these coherent structures is of fundamental importance for weather prediction, climate science, and astrophysics, among other fields. The main objective of the project is to advance understanding of how such coarse and fine-scale features emerge in fluid motion. The ultimate aim of this research is to give a first-principles picture of the persistent structures and behaviors that emerge at long times in inviscid and slightly viscous flows. The project will also provide opportunities for involvement of graduate students in the research.<br/><br/>Fluid structures can be significantly larger than the scale of forcing and often coexist as ""laminar states"" embedded in a sea of small-scale fluctuations. The detailed form and behavior of these features depends in a highly nonlinear fashion on the full range of scales of motion in the flow. The project will quantitatively study the emergence of small and large-scale structures in slightly viscous incompressible 2D fluids governed by the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations.  Regarding large-scale formation, branches of stationary Navier-Stokes solutions that are sustained by (viscosity independent) forces and connect to inviscid Euler states will be constructed.  The forcing considered will either be through the bulk (the Kolmogorov problem) or through a moving boundary. The issue of selecting ""correct"" inviscid Euler solutions, in the sense that they can be attained as viscosity vanishes, will be addressed.  Concerning small-scale creation, the project will study the direct cascade of enstrophy and, in particular, how vorticity perturbations near stationary states tend to get filamented by background large-scale shearing. Nonlinear instability of steady states in strong norms and singularity formation at infinite time will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the challenges facing applied mathematics and probability is to obtain accurate and provably efficient methods to approximate and simulate a range of complex systems using probabilistic models. The primary purpose of this research is to rigorously investigate problems related to multiscale systems, rare events, and related simulation methods. The principal investigator (PI) is interested in studying stochastic dynamical systems that may have different time scales and quantifying related events that may be rare on a given time scale but can have important consequences for the system itself. The questions of interest in this project are motivated both by fundamental mathematical questions and by a broad array of questions in other branches of science.  Examples range from estimation of rare event probabilities in chemical physics, hydrodynamics, coupled chemical reactions with spatially-dependent diffusion, to population genetics and opinion dynamics. This research project is integrated with an educational program that is designed to help in the training of undergraduate and graduate students in applied mathematics, physics, engineering, and chemistry in the exploration of rare events, multiscale processes and their analysis and simulation.<br/><br/>The PI is interested in the large deviations regime (tail events) as well as in the moderate deviations regime (the gap between the typical center and the tail of the distribution). Due to the lack of explicit solutions, one has to rely on approximation and simulation methods and for this reason rigorous development of provably efficient approximation methods and simulation Monte Carlo methods is essential. In a closely related direction, the PI develops a rigorous theory of metastability for infinite dimensional dynamical systems that may have multiple scales, interacting with the rare events of interest. Moreover, the PI is interested in the effect of multiple scales on tail events associated to interacting particle systems. Systems of interacting diffusions arise in many areas of science, theory of random matrices, mathematical biology, neural networks in machine learning and optimization, construction of Kahler-Einstein metrics, opinion dynamics, finance, and engineering. The proposed work leads to the development of a rigorous mathematical framework that allows to design provably efficient algorithms associated to modeling of rare events. It will crystalize concepts and methods that are not well understood such as the effect of metastability on Monte Carlo methods and of multiple scales on large deviations and Monte Carlo methods for stochastic dynamical systems in infinite dimensions and for interacting particle systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scale separation occurs ubiquitously in nature and is tied to a variety of phenomena; important examples from mathematical ecology and biology include the formation of vegetation patterns in water-limited ecosystems, the propagation of impulses along nerve fibers, and periodic bursting rhythms in neurons.  Mathematically, these systems are frequently modeled by dynamical systems in the form of singularly perturbed ordinary, partial, or lattice differential equations.  This project contributes to the theory of singular perturbations through the development of broadly applicable techniques to study these phenomena, their robustness under variation in model parameters, and their stability to perturbation.  Part of the project includes research experience opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The specific research goals are organized into three parts inspired by the different application areas.  The common thread through these applications is that they are conceptually described by singularly perturbed differential equations where a delicate interplay occurs between local singular bifurcation phenomena and the global behavior of solutions.  The first part concerns the formation and resilience of vegetation stripe patterns on sloped terrain in semiarid regions.  This process is modeled by reaction-diffusion-advection equations, and the focus is on existence and stability analysis of patterns in the limit when the advection dominates.  The second part is concerned with periodic traveling waves in lattice differential equations that model impulse propagation in myelinated nerve fibers, of which the spatially discrete FitzHugh-Nagumo equation is a prototypical example.  This necessitates the extension of techniques used in the study of ordinary differential equations where loss of normal hyperbolicity occurs to the infinite dimensional setting of lattice differential equations.  The third part is concerned with spike-adding transitions between bursting solutions in models of neuroendocrine cells.  The construction of these transitions involves accounting for both hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic dynamics and linking local and global behavior of solutions, providing a framework in which complex bifurcations can be understood in other systems.  The project goals require extensions to existing theoretical methods in the areas of geometric singular perturbation theory, geometric desingularization, and homoclinic/heteroclinic bifurcation theory.

These lasers are configured to produce periodically stationary pulses by propagating light many times around a loop. Although different physical effects change the shape of the pulse as it traverses the loop, the pulse returns to the same shape once each period (round trip). A significant challenge for the modeling of these lasers is that from one generation to the next there has been a dramatic increase in the amount by which the pulse breathes, necessitating novel mathematical approaches. This project will develop theoretical and computational methods to determine periodically stationary pulse solutions of nonlinear wave equations modeling laser systems and to analyze their stability (robustness in the presence of random noise and other system perturbations). The project will provide computational tools to aid in the design of high energy lasers for medical applications, and of frequency combs for highly accurate measurements of time and frequency, with applications to geo-location systems, time and frequency standards, the calibration of astronomical instruments, and trace gas sensing. The project will provide broad training in applied mathematics for doctoral students and mentoring for junior faculty. In addition, the project will support complementary activity focused on pedagogical innovations. <br/> <br/>The laser models to be studied in this project are based on variants of the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Classically, the spectrum of a stationary nonlinear wave is given by the zero set of the Evans function of the linearized differential operator. The stability of periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of fiber lasers will be characterized in terms of the spectrum of the monodromy operator of the linearization about the pulse. Since the stability problem for time-periodic solutions is formulated on a cylinder, rather than on the real line, any generalization of the Evans function will involve Fredholm determinants of operators on infinite-dimensional function spaces rather than classical determinants of matrices. To avoid the extreme stiffness of the differential equations used to compute the Evans function in this infinite dimensional context, the point spectrum of the monodromy operator will be identified with the zero set of an infinite-dimensional Fredholm determinant of a Birman-Schwinger operator on an infinite cylinder. Numerical methods will be developed to compute Fredholm determinants of such Birman-Schwinger operators. These methods will then be employed to determine stability regions in design parameter space for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of experimental fiber laser systems. The generic instability of stationary solutions of reaction diffusion equations has recently been established by applying a related topological invariant called the Maslov index to the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators. A novel version of the Maslov index will be used to establish general stability results for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program studies various metrics and Lipschitz embeddings of these metric spaces. Preliminary results show a rich and complex collection of metrics on this semi-algebraic variety.

Topic 1 explores a new method to resolving time inconsistency in optimization. For example, long-term financial planning in a society must confront time inconsistency (as different generations may not agree on an optimal financial planning strategy). The fixed-point approach to be developed will provide a convenient technical tool for policymakers to find equilibria between generations, or strategies acceptable to all generations. Topic 2 integrates economic analysis into traditional epidemic modeling. It will capture how an epidemic alters individuals' behaviors and how this change of behaviors ultimately influences the epidemic's evolution. The aim is to facilitate policymaking that anticipates people's reactions to an epidemic. Topic 3 approaches student loans from two complementary angles: how the debt accumulates over a student's years of study and how to repay the debt in a cost-efficient way. This study aims to provide individual borrowers with real savings and policymakers with concrete quantitative tools. Topic 4 devises new types of gradient flows to strengthen techniques in machine learning. It will provide rigorous mathematical foundations for the design of algorithms and more flexibility to accommodate unknown dynamics. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in this project. <br/><br/>The project will develop the fixed-point approach (Topic 1) by merging theory for stochastic flows of diffeomorphisms with convergence theory for stochastic processes. Such a link will give new convergence results for functionals of controlled diffusions and would allow equilibrium controls to be characterized as fixed points of an operator and conveniently found via fixed-point iterations. Behavioral models for epidemics (Topic 2) rely on a three-population model of consumption behaviors of the susceptible, infected, and recovered. The associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation involves unusual nonlinearity due to controllable jumps, which will be approached by a combination of viscosity solutions techniques. A student's debt accumulation and optimal repayment (Topic 3) will be investigated through a mean field game whose Hamiltonian may not admit a maximizer and a random-horizon control problem with a stochastically evolving constraint. Resolving them will demand a vanishing viscosity method based on generalized solutions to a mean field game system and a random-horizon stochastic Pontryagin maximum principle. New types of gradient flows (Topic 4) will be driven by (i) a Langevin-type McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE) or (ii) a coupled system of a Langevin SDE and a controlled diffusion. Interconnections among SDEs, nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations, and HJB equations will be investigated to uncover the gradient flows' invariant distributions. This will facilitate new stochastic gradient descent approaches to both static and dynamic optimization in the space of probability measures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These lasers are configured to produce periodically stationary pulses by propagating light many times around a loop. Although different physical effects change the shape of the pulse as it traverses the loop, the pulse returns to the same shape once each period (round trip). A significant challenge for the modeling of these lasers is that from one generation to the next there has been a dramatic increase in the amount by which the pulse breathes, necessitating novel mathematical approaches. This project will develop theoretical and computational methods to determine periodically stationary pulse solutions of nonlinear wave equations modeling laser systems and to analyze their stability (robustness in the presence of random noise and other system perturbations). The project will provide computational tools to aid in the design of high energy lasers for medical applications, and of frequency combs for highly accurate measurements of time and frequency, with applications to geo-location systems, time and frequency standards, the calibration of astronomical instruments, and trace gas sensing. The project will provide broad training in applied mathematics for doctoral students and mentoring for junior faculty. In addition, the project will support complementary activity focused on pedagogical innovations. <br/> <br/>The laser models to be studied in this project are based on variants of the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Classically, the spectrum of a stationary nonlinear wave is given by the zero set of the Evans function of the linearized differential operator. The stability of periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of fiber lasers will be characterized in terms of the spectrum of the monodromy operator of the linearization about the pulse. Since the stability problem for time-periodic solutions is formulated on a cylinder, rather than on the real line, any generalization of the Evans function will involve Fredholm determinants of operators on infinite-dimensional function spaces rather than classical determinants of matrices. To avoid the extreme stiffness of the differential equations used to compute the Evans function in this infinite dimensional context, the point spectrum of the monodromy operator will be identified with the zero set of an infinite-dimensional Fredholm determinant of a Birman-Schwinger operator on an infinite cylinder. Numerical methods will be developed to compute Fredholm determinants of such Birman-Schwinger operators. These methods will then be employed to determine stability regions in design parameter space for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and of models of experimental fiber laser systems. The generic instability of stationary solutions of reaction diffusion equations has recently been established by applying a related topological invariant called the Maslov index to the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators. A novel version of the Maslov index will be used to establish general stability results for periodically stationary solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will improve our mathematical understanding of optimality principles and dynamics in several models of substantial current interest to researchers in a number of disciplines. These range from fluid dynamics and network routing to statistical sampling and data science to aerosol physics and animal ecology.  Optimal transport theory will be used in a novel way to model fluid mixture dynamics and understand how fluid surface singularities can form.

Classic examples include explosions in confined areas, gases compressed in a piston chamber, or breaking of water reservoir dams. Important applications include design of impact absorbers, which are important in protecting civil infrastructure and passengers in automobile accidents. They also play a crucial role in the deployment and landing of spacecraft. This project studies a class of systems modeled by nonlinear lattices, mathematical models of chains of particles that interact with each other in a nonlinear fashion. Models of origami-based materials will be the primary nonlinear lattices considered in this project since such materials exhibit desirable properties for applications. For example, the harder an origami lattice is hit, the slower a wave will travel through it. The project aims to improve understanding of wave propagation in nonlinear lattices through mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and experimentation. Results are expected to aid in the design of impact-mitigating devices. Students who belong to groups underrepresented in the sciences will be trained and recruited to participate in summer research experiences via a work-study program. <br/><br/>In some systems subjected to a sudden change in state, an oscillating wave is formed that connects (local) states of different amplitude. Such oscillating waves are called dispersive shock waves (DSWs). The standard approach to analyze a DSW is based on Whitham modulation theory. In the case of nonlinear lattices, the Whitham modulation equations are prohibitively complex. In this project, a low-dimensional differential equation that accurately describes the waves that make up a DSW in a lattice will be sought using data-driven methodologies. This low-dimensional differential equation will be exploited to obtain a simple analytical description of a DSW. A quasi-continuum approach will also be employed to analytically identify the underlying low-dimensional differential equation. A systematic study of two-dimensional DSWs will also be conducted. Numerical simulations, small-amplitude approximations, modulation theory, and experimentation will be employed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples also arise in technology, such as the coordinated fight of an escort of unmanned aerial vehicles or satellite navigation.  All of these large systems are governed by models similar to those we use to study motion of a liquid, like water or gas.

Such interactions enrich the models with a possibility of more diverse collective outcomes and, from theoretical perspective, endow them with a fractional parabolic structure. The regularity theory exploiting this parabolic structure will be developed in the context of unidirectional flocks.

These systems model physical phenomena in diverse fields such as deep-water waves, plasma physics, nonlinear optical fibers, low temperature physics and Bose-Einstein condensates, and magneto-static spin waves. Some of the equations studied belong to the class of the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation and its various generalizations, which constitute universal models for weakly dispersive nonlinear wave trains. Others belong to the complex short-pulse equation and its generalizations, which describe the propagation in nonlinear media of ultra-short optical pulses. These have applications to laser material processing, laser microscopy, optical clocks and measurements, medicine (e.g., eye surgery and vision correction), and telecommunication. A distinguishing feature of these systems is that, in addition to standard solitons, localized traveling waves that preserve their shape and velocity, they also admit so-called loop solitons, which are not single-valued solitons, as well as solutions that oscillate between the two. Another phenomenon that this research aims at elucidating is the formation of rogue waves. These extreme events are unusually large surface waves with wave crests up to four times the mean level that appear from nowhere and disappear without a trace and can therefore cause significant damage to ships, and offshore drilling units. This research addresses the role of solitons and modulational instability as possible concurrent mechanisms for the formation of rogue waves. Rogue waves have also been recently observed experimentally in optical fibers. The training of graduate students at the University at Buffalo, and outreach activities aiming at promoting the growth of women in applied mathematics will be integral components of this project.  <br/><br/>At a more technical level, the investigation deals with certain integrable systems in situations in which the boundary conditions play a key role, as well as various kinds of singular limits.

The probability densities are solutions of wave kinetic (WK) equations, whose nonlocal interaction operators are of kinetic type.

Many living and non-living objects propel themselves by moving a set of propulsors (wings, fins, or a tail) that are attached to a main body. While there has been substantial progress in understanding how microscopic objects (such as bacteria) interact through slow fluid flows, little is known about how macroscopic objects (like fish) are affected by the relatively fast flows they generate. The new mathematical models constructed in this project will be used to assess how fluid flows affect the speed, energy consumption and stability of a collection of flapping wings traveling in different formations. The insights gained from this research have the potential to impact the biology and engineering communities. Specifically, recent experiments have suggested that fish and birds may travel in orderly formations in order to save energy, but the role of fluid flows in mediating schooling and flocking remains poorly understood. On the engineering side, the design of autonomous underwater vehicles is often inspired by the flapping mechanics of fish, and this project could inform new design and control principles. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students in mathematical modeling and physical applied mathematics, giving them tools that can be broadly applied to problems arising in the natural sciences and engineering.  Moreover, the beautiful displays exhibited by animal collectives can readily be appreciated by the public, making the project suitable for outreach initiatives conducted by the university.<br/><br/>Mathematical models of varying degrees of fidelity and complexity will be constructed and analyzed to probe different aspects of the wings' behavior. A key challenge is that flapping wings generate long-lived fluid flows in the form of complex vortical structures. This leads to temporally nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions between the constituents, wherein the forces between wings at a given time depend on their past positions and velocities. A nonlinear discrete-time delay-difference map, which explicitly models the wings' shed vortices, has been validated against recent experiments and will be used to assess the dependence of a formation?s speed, energy consumption and stability on geometric parameters. Conformal mapping and integral equation techniques will be used to represent two- and three-dimensional flows, respectively, and to assess the influence of wing shape. Furthermore, a continuum PDE theory for a dense collective of wings in a high Reynolds number flow will be systematically derived from the aforementioned models. Traveling wave solutions of the continuum theory will be characterized through numerical simulations, and the emergence of positional and orientational order will be assessed. The goals are to determine the extent to which hydrodynamic interactions alone can account for the spatiotemporally complex formations observed in dense collectives of flapping objects, and to uncover novel emergent phenomena that have been conjectured to arise in systems influenced by inertial fluid flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project deals with questions in quantum resource theory, in particular a theory of entanglement. Quantum devices use quantum systems to encode and process information. These systems make it possible to harness the effects of purely quantum phenomena such as superposition (the ability of being in ""two places"" at once) and entanglement (strong connections between two parts of the system) to drastically increase the security and the speed of computational devices.  Because of entanglement two spatially separated particles can affect each other instantaneously, a phenomenon which was initially considered to be paradoxical, even by Einstein. One of the best-known protocols - quantum teleportation - relies on entanglement to destroy a quantum state in one place and perfectly recreate it in another distant location. While entanglement became one of the most valuable resources in quantum theory, many attributes of its behavior remain unknown. The broader impact of this award is to promote progress, diversity, and access to science on all levels of society and to broaden participation from underrepresented communities in STEM. The major broader impact goals are: 1) to enhance training of graduate students in quantum information at the University of Houston; 2) to improve educational opportunities in STEM for students in local middle-schools in the economically challenged neighborhoods; 3) to increase public education in STEM and quantum information science.<br/><br/>Entanglement is only one quantifier of ""quantumness"" in a system. Other measures include coherence, discord, and mutual information. Entanglement theory has gained its strong mathematical footing in the 1990's, but a closely related coherence theory started only recently. This project will establish proper mathematical limits on and relations between these measures, unify them, and classify them. It is well-known that under certain parameters, entanglement and coherence are dual to each other, in a sense that coherence can be converted to entanglement via incoherent operations, and vice versa in the asymptotic limit. This project will investigate this relation for different entanglement and coherence measures. Moreover, the Principal Investigator will develop and investigate properties of newly proposed correlation measures. A closely related question is the distinguishability between two quantum states. How well we can distinguish different physical states determines how much information we can encode into a certain system and how quickly we can manipulate it. One of the main problems that this project will focus on is the continuity of these quantifiers, which is a natural property of any quantum system. In other words, if the states are close when measured by one of these distances, how close are they when measured by another? Or how well can these states be distinguished? Or what is the structure of states that are close to each other?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, there has been great effort to assemble colloids into new functional materials with designer architecture using electric and magnetic fields. Of particular interest are colloids that spin (rotors), because in such systems the flows stirred by the rotating particles add to the electrostatic interactions thereby vastly expanding the possible structures. This project will study the theory of dynamics of colloids placed between two planar electrodes in order to understand the mechanisms of the field-driven particle assembly. The project integrates knowledge across the fields of applied math, fluid mechanics and soft matter, which will be very beneficial for the training of the students associated with the project. Visually appealing experiments will help educate the public about mathematics and fluid dynamics.  <br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with a theoretical investigation of the dynamics of rotating colloids powered by the Quincke effect, which is the spontaneous spinning of a dielectric sphere in an applied uniform electric field. The Quincke rotor dynamics in free space is described by the Lorenz equations and the system has gathered attention as one of the physical realizations of Lorenz chaos: at high electric fields the sphere spins irregularly around a fixed axis. However, the dynamics of Quincke rotors in confinement is strikingly different than that in free space. An individual rotor displays three-dimensional motion with periodic reorientation of the axis of rotation. Collectives of hovering Quincke rotors are found to self-organize into stable clusters or snaking chains. This project will investigate the electrohydrodynamics of particles placed between two planar electrodes. The novel mathematical challenges are many and include analytical solutions of single particle dynamics near boundaries, careful consideration of pair-wise hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions in confinement, and integration of these analytical results into a Stokesian-dynamics-based algorithm for a very large numbers of particles. Benchmark experiments to complement the mathematical research are proposed to justify and validate the mathematical models and to ensure that the research has impact both in and beyond the applied mathematics community. Educational impact includes bringing direct experimental experience in fluid dynamics and soft matter research to applied mathematics undergraduate and graduate students at Northwestern University. The emergent behavior of the Quincke rotors will likely open new research directions across various fields, e.g., non-equilibrium soft matter, materials engineering, and fluid dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inverse problems arise in numerous medical and seismic imaging applications as well as in exploration geophysics and non-destructive evaluation, where one is interested in producing images of an inaccessible interior of a medium from measurements performed in the exterior. Typically, in order to reveal the internal structure, one measures the response of the medium when probed with different kinds of waves, ranging from electromagnetic waves to X-rays. Recently, it has been observed that nonlinear seismic responses may give additional information concerning the interior structure of the Earth. Similarly, nonlinear ultrasound techniques in medical imaging may provide better images since the contrast in nonlinear media parameters is usually larger than that in the linear parameters. The project strives to develop significantly prominent mathematical methods where the nonlinear interaction of waves is used to bear on challenging inverse problems coming from applications. These novel mathematical techniques may lead to significant advances, in particular in medical and seismic imaging. One of the specific focuses of the project is the Electrical Impedance Tomography problem for nonlinear anisotropic media, an imaging modality with applications in biomedical imaging and non-destructive testing of mechanical parts. An integral part of the project is concerned with the educational training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The project consists of four research topics. The first topic deals with partial data inverse problems for nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations (PDE), where nonlinear parameters of an unknown medium are to be determined from measurements performed along a small portion of the boundary. Despite the great significance of such inverse problems and their ubiquity in applications, they are among some of the most fundamental open questions in the field. The goal here is to solve such problems for important nonlinear PDE, including the quasilinear anisotropic conductivity equation, building upon the recent advances by the investigator and collaborators, and to work towards the solution of these open problems in the linear setting. The second topic is devoted to the geometric version of the anisotropic Calderon problem, where one seeks to determine potential in the Schrodinger equation on a compact Riemannian manifold from boundary measurements. By introducing a nonlinearity, the goal is to solve the anisotropic Calderon problem for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation in geometric settings for which the corresponding inverse problem in the linear case is still open. The third topic deals with inverse problems for the fundamental systems in physics and geometry, such as the anisotropic Maxwell and Yang-Mill?s systems. The fourth topic is concerned with inverse problems for nonlinear hyperbolic PDE on manifolds with boundary, aiming to exploit the nonlinearity as a tool to solve some of them in cases when the linear counterpart is open.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the first part, the investigator will study optimal control problems involving non-Markovian piecewise deterministic processes and the associated non-local Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.

Mathematicians use the term manifold to formalize the notion of a curved space built by piecing together patches of more familiar Euclidean space. This idea dates to the work of Riemann in the mid-1800s, yet several questions about manifolds remain poorly understood. In the 1950s, Nash proved striking embedding theorems identifying two distinct ways of thinking about manifolds, intrinsic and extrinsic. One can imagine for example, the measurement of lengths on earth by an ant crawling around (intrinsic) and the measurement of lengths on earth by an observer on the moon (extrinsic). The main purpose of this project is to revisit Nash's embedding theorems from a modern perspective, expanding their range of applications to problems in science and technology. Approaches of this project have applications to the description of disordered systems in physics (such as turbulent fluid flows) and the design of algorithms for artificial intelligence (such as manifold learning). The project contributes to the development of the scientific workforce through the mentoring of graduate students in PhD projects that include both rigorous mathematics and numerical computations. A particular goal of the project is to visualize the embedded manifolds in order to communicate Nash?s vision to a broad scientific audience and the public at large.<br/><br/>The main technical goal of this project is to develop a new method to construct Gibbs measures for nonlinear partial differential equations. The method relies on lifting the PDE into a space of Gaussian measures and designing new heat flows, termed renormalization group flows, that improve subsolutions of the PDE into solutions through band-limited approximations at increasingly fine scales. Both numerical and analytical approaches will be pursued. The analytical method has its roots in Nash?s techniques, but its conceptual foundation is a Bayesian description of the measurement of length, not the nature of the underlying space. This shift in emphasis provides a framework that unifies the embedding problem for Riemannian manifolds with that of metric spaces and graphs. It identifies the problem of critical exponents for embeddings with the study of critical exponents in statistical physics. The numerical counterpart to these analytical methods is a new class of stochastic interior point methods for the solution of nonlinear PDE. The primary goal here is to explore the idea that PDE may be solved by optimization techniques, such as relaxation, semidefinite programming, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, rather than the traditional methods based on spatial discretizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Frames have natural connections with the mathematical theory of quantum communications. For example, phase-retrievability of a frame is an important property that allows the recovery of a signal from the magnitudes of its frame coefficient measurements. This appears in many applications including speech recognition, x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy. In quantum information theory, this is a necessary property for a quantum system to have to distinguish pure states from their quantum measurements. This project addresses several fundamental issues in the area. The principal investigator (PI) will investigate frame applications to problems involving quantum communication capability and information transmission security. By bringing a new circle of ideas to attack these practical problems, this investigation will advance scientific understanding in quantum information theory as well as in applied functional/harmonic analysis. Additionally, this project will promote teaching, training, and learning as several graduate and undergraduate students will be directly involved in this research project.<br/><br/>One direction of this investigation is to establish quantified measurements of (mostly, operator-valued) frame phase-retrievability, and then use them to tackle problems of designing (or characterizing) quantum communication channels with prescribed levels of zero-error communication capacity and information transmission security. Special attention will be given to the structured channels, which are usually induced by different kinds of representation frames. Here, the interplay between operator-valued frames and projective group representations will play a key role. A second direction of this project is in the area of signal/state recovering (or channel detection) from a source of unidentified channels. The PI will establish its theoretical connections with the theory of disjoint frames and quantum channels. A key ingredient is to use disjoint frames as building blocks to produce a large class of candidates, where any subclass of this set can be used as a source of unidentified channels for a target set of signals or states in the quantum setting. Such an approach requires developing a disjoint frame theory (or multiplexing) for bounded linear maps on von Neumann algebras. A third direction involves quantum measures. Dilation problems for quantum measures are not only in the scope of aforementioned areas of investigation but also in line with the PI?s long-term goal of establishing a general dilation theory for operator-valued measures in both commutative and non-commutative settings. Such a general dilation theory may lead to a possible classification theory for quantum measures as well as for their associated quantum channels. The main objective is to establish a dilation theory for quantum measures that can tell us which, when, and how certain important information of a quantum measure can be preserved through dilations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plasmas are charged gases, often referred to as the fourth state of matter, that account for more than 99% of all material in the universe and are of significant practical interest since they serve as excellent conductors of electricity. Plasma engines have been developed by space agencies around the world and were recently employed to power selected spacecraft. The use of plasmas within nuclear fusion reactors is also being explored as a source of clean energy. Other notable examples of plasmas occurring in natural phenomena are the solar wind, the Earth's ionosphere, galactic nebulae, and the tails of comets. A full understanding of the dynamics of the solar wind is of practical importance, as it dictates the intensity of space weather, which is often responsible for expensive damage to satellites orbiting the Earth. The motion of a plasma can be modeled by a system of partial differential equations, and among the goals of this project are to demonstrate that these equations possess realistic solutions, to determine their qualitative behavior, to compute their sensitivity with respect to model parameters, such as masses, charges, and temperature, and to approximate them computationally to predict future behavior with precision. The project provides graduate research training opportunities.<br/> <br/>A plasma is a fully ionized gas in which electromagnetic forces are often strong enough to dominate collisional effects. The motion of a high temperature, low density collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a nonlinear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this setting, collisions are neglected while the charge and current densities, which drive the Maxwell system, are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity averages of the distribution of ions in the system, which satisfies the Vlasov equation. A major question this project addresses is if there are shocks in a collisionless plasma, that is, if a singularity can develop from smooth initial data as time progresses. In some cases, such as in lower dimensional relativistic formulations, smooth global solutions are known to exist. Additional questions concern the large time limiting behavior of the particle positions and momenta, charge and current densities, electromagnetic fields, and particle distribution functions within the system.  More specifically, the project determines whether dispersive effects in the equations cause these quantities to decay over time, or if there is sufficient interaction to sustain their strength even in the time asymptotic limit. Finally, the sensitivity of the fields and densities with respect to model input parameters are computed using global sensitivity metrics, corresponding dispersion relations, and particle-in-cell simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improving the understanding of how they interact has both direct and indirect consequences in scientific areas, such as the study of chemotaxis, of phase separation of binary mixtures including alloys, and of the earth's magnetic field.

In classical mechanics, such systems can be described under different scales. In the microscopic scale, Newton's laws track the position and velocity of each particle. In the macroscopic scale, fluid mechanics and thermodynamics provide effective tools to predict the behaviors of averaged statistical properties like pressure and temperature. Kinetic theory forms a bridge between these two approaches and utilizes probabilistic tools in the position-velocity space, the so-called phase space, to obtain a mesoscopic description. The probability density of particles present in the phase space satisfies the Boltzmann equation or the Landau equation, which are evolutionary partial differential equations. This project focuses on the kinetic equations in bounded domains, where the particles may be reflected or absorbed by the physical boundary. The purpose is to develop novel mathematical tools to characterize the multi-scale behaviors of these particle systems in applications such as medical imaging, fluid mechanics, and nuclear fusion. The project provides opportunities for research training of graduate students.<br/><br/>This project concentrates on the theory of hydrodynamic limits, a key step to tackle the so-called ""Hilbert's sixth Problem"" to treat physics in an axiomatic manner. The aim is to study the asymptotic behavior of kinetic equations when the Knudsen number, which measures the relative distance a particle can travel between two collisions, shrinks to zero. The focus is in justifying the validity of asymptotic approximations of kinetic equations in the presence of boundary layer effects, where the geometric correction of the boundary is non-negligible.

This means that while these media look very different from each other, waves propagating in each of them tend to display similar, characteristic behaviors.  This includes the development of rapid oscillations known as dispersive shock waves, long-lasting propagating pulses known as solitons, and isolated, high-amplitude disturbances known as rogue waves.  The mathematical models used to understand and describe these phenomena are similar, regardless of the media being studied.  It is a major challenge to construct a cohesive mathematical framework general enough to capture common features across different models yet flexible enough to reveal details in specific situations.  Drawing on the most up-to-date analytical, asymptotic, and numerical methods, the project will develop enhanced models of dispersive phenomena including shock waves, solitons, and rogue waves, with applications to areas including hydrodynamics, meteorology, and optical communications.  The training and professional development of graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral researchers will be integral to all aspects of the work.<br/><br/>The three major objectives of the project are as follows.  (1) Derive a mathematical description of the basic dispersive structure, the oscillatory shock, that is robust enough to handle both shocks that decay and those that break up into trains of solitons in the KdV equation and related models.  (2) Develop computationally feasible methods for computing, with error estimates, global phenomena such as the interaction of multiple dispersive shock waves in the NLS equation and related models.

The first models of this kind, so-called free boundary problems, were proposed as early as 1831 and became ubiquitous across science and engineering in the second half of the 20th century. Despite the considerable attention devoted to free boundary problems, the understanding of the solutions they generate is still very limited. In this project, the investigator will use a novel approach on free boundary problems, grounded in modern probability theory to advance the understanding of this important class of mathematical models. A particular focus of the project will be on the desirable irregularities present in these models capturing, for example, the rapid growth of a crystal or neural synchronization, as well as the non-smooth nature of the surface of a tumor or between the components of an alloy. Integral parts of the project are supervision of graduate and undergraduate research, and graduate and undergraduate training in probability theory and stochastic analysis.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems provide a universal mathematical framework for many phenomena in the natural and social sciences as well as engineering. While the mathematical formulation of free boundary problems dates back to the 19th century and their analysis has received much attention in the 20th century, the understanding of their solutions is still limited. This is largely due to the singularities oftentimes exhibited by the solutions, either in time, capturing for example the rapid growth of a crystal or neural synchronization, or in space, encapsulating for example the non-smooth nature of the surface of a tumor or between the components of an alloy. This project builds on the analysis for the one phase supercooled Stefan problem in one space dimension, a prototypical example of a singular free boundary problem. The aim is to expand the scope of the novel probabilistic solution concept they introduced to include a large set of singular free boundary problems, such as the one phase supercooled Stefan problem for the nonlinear heat equation and its two-phase analogue in one space dimension, the supercooled Stefan problem in multiple space dimensions, possibly with kinetic undercooling and/or surface tension, and the Hele-Shaw problem in multiple space dimensions. In addition, the investigator intends to identify these solutions with large scale limits of random growth models defined by means of interacting particle systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Principally, the project will elucidate how the shape of the interface between different phases is determined by a balance of elastic forces and surface tension. The results will be of importance in mathematics, physics, and materials science since development of various morphologies in coexisting phases is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon. The acquired knowledge will bring about new and powerful tools to experimentally control these morphologies, leading to new and exciting applications. This interdisciplinary program further provides opportunities to educate students in the mathematics and physics of liquid crystals. <br/><br/>The project will focus on the characterization and description of the overall shape and internal structure of soft condensates representing nuclei of the orientationally ordered phases shaped by bulk elasticity with disparate elastic moduli and anisotropic surface tension. The proposed work will consider a broad spectrum of liquid crystals, embracing nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals that are described by non-orientable director line fields and experience transitions into partially positionally ordered phases, and newly discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals that are described by the director and a vector-valued electric polarization. The mathematical emphasis is on the analysis of stationary variational problems for energies defined over vector- and tensor-valued fields in two and three dimensions and associated gradient flows, so as to describe the equilibrium configurations of liquid crystals and dynamics of interfaces in a plethora of their phase transitions. The principal novelty of the proposed work is that it will consider singular limits of liquid crystal energies that impose severe geometric rigidity on admissible classes of functions. The primary challenges to the analysis arise due to high dimensionality of a target space and the need to consider singular asymptotic limits that result in highly nonlinear constraints.

Together with other currents in low and high latitudes, they transfer substantial amounts of heat and momentum from the tropics to the polar regions, influencing local and global climate. The balmy jet of seawater also carries a great potential for producing clean offshore carbon-free energy. To understand the spatial and time variabilities of such currents is thus of vital importance for our society. In this project, the investigator will analyze the interplay between intrinsic nonlinearity and extrinsic stochastic forcing in shaping the observed variabilities. To disentangle such interactions and to analyze the impact of noise on dynamical and statistical behaviors of the governing systems are still grand challenges for many practical applications. To address these questions, the investigator will establish a new paradigm for the parameterization and the effective reduction of stochastically forced nonlinear dissipative equations, such as those governing large-scale oceanic flows. The proposed approach relies crucially on a dimension reduction methodology developed recently by the investigator and his colleagues. The knowledge gained in this project is expected to bring new understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of large-scale climate patterns. The award will also provide opportunities for the involvement of graduate students in this research.<br/><br/>The dimension reduction methodology adopted and further developed in this project is based on a new stochastic parameterization technique for the unresolved small-scale dynamics of the underlying nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations. The investigator will derive explicit formulas that approximate the small-scale dynamics in terms of both the large-scale dynamics and the history of the noise path, leading thus to low-dimensional stochastic equations involving only large-scale variables. Such reduced equations are able to capture key dynamical features of the original stochastic systems and are much more accessible both theoretically and numerically.  The impact of noise on both pattern formation in the classical Rayleigh-Benard convection and time-variability of the double-gyre wind-driven ocean circulation will be studied within the proposed theoretic framework. The parameterization formulas of unresolved small-scale dynamics are rigorously justified in the context of stochastic invariant manifolds. These formulas will be extended in this project to handle parameter regimes that are away from the onset of the first instability using a variational framework. The parameterization is pathwise in nature, which is very well suited for cases when one is not only interested in statistical quantities but also trajectory-wise dynamical behaviors. The formulas involve the history of the noise, which introduces memory into the corresponding reduced equations. This memory effect plays a fundamental role for the reduced equations to capture both qualitatively and quantitatively the dynamical and statistical features of the original system, and it has already been illustrated to be responsible for achieving good modeling performance even in situations that are known to be challenging for other traditional methods to operate. These reduced systems will help us understand better the impact of noise on the studied systems, which are otherwise computationally too expensive to obtain. By studying these reduced models subject to various types of noise, the proposed approach will also bring insights into possible ways of further improving the underlying stochastic models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such systems can often be modeled as a stochastic network, with multiple jobs and many servers, and complex network topology. The operations and management of these sophisticated networked systems are subject to many risk factors under various random environments. This research will develop advanced methods and algorithms to provide solutions that mitigate the potential operational risks in a large-scale network model system. The model system roughly describes the system dynamics in large-scale parallel server networks. The research will provide approximate optimal scheduling and other operational policies. Risk-sensitive control has the advantage of achieving good performance in the presence of disturbances and uncertainty. It also limits large fluctuations since it penalizes higher moments of the running cost.

The new phases that will be studied in this project, however, are described in terms of particle-like entities called anyons, which have properties quite distinct from the traditional bosons and fermions that describe traditional materials (including superfluids and superconductors). Anyons are potential candidates to build quantum memory and other quantum information devices. Anyons have already been experimentally realized in fractional quantum Hall materials, and surely still hold surprises to be revealed in further studies. In this project, the principal investigator (PI) and collaborators will develop fundamental mathematical techniques required for the effective description of these new materials. This research falls squarely within NSF's Big Idea 'Quantum Leap'.

Unfortunately, effective methods for testing complicated materials for structural defects or for identifying unknown targets in an efficient way with little a priori information are still in a state of infancy. This is particularly the case for material that exhibits directional properties, nonlinear interaction with interrogating waves, or peculiar geometric structures, all of which are present in contemporary applications in the above areas.  In this project, the investigator and her graduate students will develop entirely new techniques in inverse scattering theory that can handle the aforementioned imaging problems, in order to obtain reliable target signatures or usable information about objects being examined in computationally efficient ways. The goal is to minimize dependence on a priori information describing the physics and/or geometry of unknown targets as well as of mathematical and computational complications arising from the complexity of the hosting background. This study will combine practical applications with the mathematical elegance of new imaging techniques that have recently led to establishing a new field in mathematics called the qualitative approach or direct imaging techniques.<br/><br/>This research is a multifaceted effort to develop fast imaging methods of advanced and novel materials (including nonlinear materials) based on generalized linear sampling methods and spectral parameters related to non-scattering phenomena. There are three main projects:1) A Spectral Approach to Imaging with Waves: Motivated by the theory of transmission eigenvalues, this project proposes to develop a general framework for modifying the scattering operator in order to provide new eigenvalue problems associated with the scattering by an inhomogeneity. Particularly important is the determination of these (real or complex) eigenvalues from the scattering data, together with their relation to the material properties of the inhomogeneity. A major effort of the investigator is to apply this technique to image complex structures, including anisotropic/absorbing/dispersive media, thin layers, and meta-surfaces. 2) Interior Eigenvalues and Non-scattering Frequencies: A necessary condition for the non-scattering of a particular incident wave is that the wave number (or a specified parameter) is an eigenvalue of an interior eigenvalue problem defined on the support of the scatterer. On the other hand, the converse is true if at an eigenvalue the corresponding eigenfunction is extendable outside the support as a solution to the Helmholtz equation. Currently, only the case of scatterers with a corner is understood. The investigator states a more general conjecture and lays out a proposed approach to prove it. This project is theoretical in nature, but if successful, it would lead to a more general uniqueness result for the support of the scattering object with one incident wave. 3) Initiate the Development of the Qualitative Imaging Approach for Nonlinear Inhomogeneities. Despite the great interest and extensive research on the theory and computation of qualitative (direct) inversion methods, nothing has been done in connection with imaging media that exhibit nonlinear interaction with interrogating waves, which is the case for many contemporary engineered materials.

To address important challenges in studying these equations, the PIs adopt an innovative approach combining deterministic and probabilistic perspectives. Informed by the qualitative properties of these PDE, the principal objective of this project is to identify the correct analogues of such properties at the many particle level, and to demonstrate that these correspond to the known properties at the PDE level.

The second direction is rooted on the integrability of the 1D cubic nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation and pursues two lines of inquiry. One of these questions focuses on exploring the origins of integrability of the 1D cubic NLS through a series of projects aimed at unveiling correct analogues of integrability at the many particle level, and then at demonstrating that these correspond to the known properties at the NLS level.

In order for a distributed system to be able to perform high-level tasks that may go beyond the capability of an individual agent, the system must first solve a ""clock synchronization"" problem to establish a shared notion of time. The study of clock synchronization (or coupled oscillators) has been an important subject of research in mathematics and various areas of science for decades, with fruitful applications in many areas including wildfire monitoring, electric power networks, robotic vehicle networks, large-scale information fusion, and wireless sensor networks. However, there has been a gap between our theoretical understanding of systems of coupled oscillators and practical requirements for clock synchronization algorithms in modern application contexts. This project will develop systematic approaches for bridging this gap based on combinatorial and probabilistic methods. The use of discrete oscillators will be a key thread in developing more robust and efficient clock synchronization algorithms, extending the current proof techniques for convergence guarantee, and providing a foundation for a data-driven approach to the clock synchronization problems.  This project will also include interdisciplinary collaboration and research opportunities for students at all levels <br/><br/>One of the key difficulties in analyzing the behavior of coupled oscillators lies in the cyclic hierarchy in the phase space. A widely used observation in the literature is that, if all initial phases are concentrated in an open half-circle, such a cyclic hierarchy disappears and we have robust synchronization results in various settings. Hence deriving global synchronization from arbitrary initial configurations not only warrants self-stabilization of the clock synchronization algorithm under arbitrary perturbation, but also addresses the theoretical limitation of such a half-circle condition. By extending techniques such as local concentration and adaptive pulse-coupling scheme due to the PI, the project aims at deriving global synchronization from an arbitrary initial configuration on undirected finite trees, for non-identical natural frequencies and non-zero propagation delay of signals with optimal bounds on convergence time. The convergence result will be extended to arbitrary graphs by combining with a spanning tree algorithm, and the composite algorithm will be implemented as a fast and resource-minimal clock synchronization algorithm for modern wireless sensor networks. This project will also include interdisciplinary collaboration and research opportunities for students at all levels. In particular, some of the projects involve generating a large database for the collective behavior of some models of discrete coupled oscillators on finite graphs, and applying machine learning techniques to extract key features of the pair of network topology and initial configuration that guarantee synchronization.

Most mathematical models used in the study of such evolution of black holes do not consider any matter or energy field present in the spacetime: more precisely, they only assume the presence of the gravitational field. This is called the case of the vacuum Einstein equation. Even though the vacuum Einstein equation already presents many difficulties from the mathematical point of view, they hardly represent a complete picture about the physics involved. In order to obtain a realistic model for astrophysical black holes, matter fields should be added to the Einstein equation to model the surrounding of the black holes. This research is aimed at the study of black hole stability both for the vacuum Einstein equation and for the coupled equations with electromagnetic radiation.<br/> <br/> <br/>The plan of this research is to create a rigorous and systematic approach to understand the interaction of gravitational radiation with other matter fields present in astrophysical objects. We plan to consider the interaction between gravitation and electromagnetic fields, governed by the Maxwell equations, and develop a rigorous and clear understanding of their interactions. Our approach is based on the Teukolsky formalism. The Einstein-Maxwell equation has many features in common with the vacuum Einstein equation, but also presents new substantial difficulties related to the coupling of the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions.  One of the difficulties is to identify gauge-invariant quantities which transport electromagnetic and gravitational radiation and derive the partial differential equations they satisfy. We then plan to be able to generalize the main ideas in dealing with those interactions to other matter systems, like Einstein-Vlasov, null dust or complex scalar, which are of fundamental importance in astrophysical systems. In general, in the case of the Einstein equation coupled with matter fields, we expect to obtain coupled hyperbolic PDEs with sources which interact one with another.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is aimed at the study of the nonlinear partial differential equations, which are instrumental for analysis and modeling of such soliton-like structures. Many important phenomena most readily manifest themselves through the behavior of the special solutions such as traveling or standing waves, which not only serve as basis for the behavior of the system, but also determine the related nearby dynamics. These structures and their stability are of great importance and are essential in practical applications. Stable states of the system attract all nearby configurations, while the loss of stability or being unable to control the dynamics is of practical importance as well. The investigator will involve undergraduate and graduate students in various stages of the project and will aim to recruit and retain them to continue working in the field of applied mathematics. Exposing students to parts of the project that require broad interaction with other sciences such as optics, water waves and liquid crystals, will be particularly beneficial for the students' training.<br/><br/>Throughout the project, the point of view in working with these partial differential equations will be one of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, which allows us to take advantage of the classical tools by adapting them to the infinite-dimensional setting. The project focuses on Hamiltonian models with sign indefinite energy functionals such as various Dirac systems. The goal is to investigate the linear and spectral stability for certain solitary waves, but also to prove results on uniform bounds for the spectrally stable solutions. Investigating the dynamics near solitary waves for some exotic NLS models and for water wave models such as the Benney-Luke equations is another focus of this proposal. The study of the long-term dynamics and asymptotic profiles in the Landau - de Gennes models of liquid crystals rounds up this research program. All these directions will require new techniques and tools from diverse areas such as functional analysis, dynamical systems, and harmonic analysis as well as numerical simulations.

Despite being widely used in applications, many fundamental issues in the rigorous mathematical analysis of these interactions remain challenging. The presence of boundaries, especially free boundaries, makes the underlying partial differential equations modeling the phenomena highly nonlinear and nonlocal. This project will further the mathematical understanding of equations in which fluids interact with either rigid boundaries, free boundaries, or both.

Compactly representing such files is generally a good idea for many practical reasons. Compressed music and image files (MP3, JPG, etc.) are much faster and cheaper to communicate and store than the originals. In classification applications, a small number of informative file features are often selected from larger categories of data in order to help boost accuracy and efficiency (this is akin to only focusing on the voice in a song when the aim is to identify the singer). In more extreme situations, data signals may be so large or change so rapidly that they cannot be stored or analyzed at all without first being quickly compressed. Many interesting problems of this type exist in research areas related to algorithms for internet data analysis aimed at, for example, quickly detecting particular types of large-scale cyber-attacks. As part of this project, the investigators will develop and implement new faster compression and data analysis techniques for complex data, which can then be used to facilitate faster data processing in a myriad of large-scale data processing applications. The project will also have educational benefits aimed at increasing the representation of students from under-represented and under-served groups in STEM research fields. This will be accomplished by the investigators hosting and mentoring research projects for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds who will apply the compression and data analysis techniques developed as part of this research to specific application data, for example, to analyze and better understand Lyme disease data.<br/><br/>This research includes a rich new class of practical Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) maps for vector data that cannot only be applied to vectors faster than Fast Fourier Transform time serially but are also trivially parallelizable.

In addition, the research will develop new nonlinear bi-Lipchitz extensions of linear modewise JL-maps for tensor data capable of preserving distances between all low rank tensors in a given database and all other lower rank tensors, even outside of the database.

Accurate simulation of fluid velocities for low viscosity fluids and for longer times is essential for safety, critical prediction and design in engineering and science. Accurate flow predictions are key to limiting damage of hurricanes (estimated to be hundreds of billions of dollars in typical years) and to energy efficiency optimization (85% of US energy is generated by combustion for which accurate simulation of turbulent mixing is critical). Fundamental barriers to accurate flow prediction will be addressed in this research. This research also develops expertise of PhD students who will contribute to the next generation of applied and computational mathematicians to address future challenges.  This project will support six graduate students per year and one undergraduate per year for each of the three years of the project.<br/><br/>This project will develop time accurate methods in computational fluid dynamics. Time accurate prediction must improve current turbulence models because they are only satisfactory at statistical equilibrium. The proposed research will extend them to non-stationary turbulence, simplify the models and reduce the number of calibration parameters by aligning them more closely to the true energy flow between means and fluctuations. Since fluid flow has complex dynamics, pushing out the limited predictability horizon requires reliable and efficient ensemble simulations. The research will develop algorithms allowing larger ensembles without sacrificing accuracy in realizations. Effective, adaptive time discretizations are under used in computational fluid dynamics.

The term ""nonlinear"" refers to a property of size-dependent response and the term ""dispersive"" refers to how the fluctuations of the wave influence the speed and direction of motion. At the mathematical level, one studies the behavior of general solutions and special types of solutions to these equations and seeks to provide quantitative descriptions of phenomena observed in the physical setting. In this project, the investigators explore how coherent waves travel - whether they retain their shape despite encountering obstacles, break apart and dissolve, or collapse into a singularity. Each of these possibilities hinges on both the nonlinear and the dispersive character of the equations; over the past several decades, mathematical techniques have been developed to model and measure these properties. The project aims to improve existing methods and apply the methods in new directions. The project contains educational efforts at various levels of mathematical learning. These include advising undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars, with special emphasis on attracting underrepresented minorities. <br/> <br/>The main objective of the research will be to provide analytical descriptions of the behavior of solutions to certain classes of nonlinear dispersive equations. The two main categories of equations considered are the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) family and the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) family. Both classes of equations satisfy powerful dispersive estimates called local virial estimates, and the KdV family in addition satisfies a monotonicity property that controls the movement of mass. The multiple-scale method, spectral analysis, application of dispersive estimates, and monotonicity bounds are core methods that will be utilized and extended. Several focus problems are identified in which some classical feature, like scale-invariance or a property of localized influence, have been removed or weakened, providing the stimulus to develop new techniques, while at the same time, provide new descriptions of real physical phenomena. The phenomena of primary interest are the dynamics of coherent structures like solitary waves and line solitons as they interact with each other and their environment, and the description of how singular collapsing solutions arise and their asymptotic description.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the deterministic equations describing the dynamics of fluids are well-established and their numerical solution has revealed much about the turbulent behavior of fluids, their analysis is challenging, and basic results remain elusive. The use of probabilistic tools offer complementary approaches that naturally incorporate the uncertainties of the actual state of the fluid and random perturbations due to external forces. This project will leverage state-of-the-art tools in probability, stochastic analysis, and dynamical systems, to study the basic fluid dynamics models and some of its variants, which are relevant to physics, engineering, and atmosphere-ocean dynamics. Emphasis will be given to study the effect of random forcing on these systems, gain further understanding on the energy transfer across scales, and the possibility of obtaining basic existence and uniqueness results using the probabilistic framework, which remain elusive in the deterministic approach. The project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in the research. <br/><br/>This research program studies several mathematical problems stemming from the challenges of turbulence theory and involves stochastic analysis, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations. The goal is to understand the link between the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, their stochastic versions, and the phenomenological laws of turbulence. The advantage of the stochastic approach is the major simplicity of balance laws between mean rates of energy injection, dissipation, and flux. Due to the rich structure of these stochastic models, some results on uniqueness and stability of some approximations of three-dimensional viscous and inviscid fluid flows could be proved while their deterministic counterpart is lacking. The smoothing effect of the noise on the associated dynamical system will be used. The study of the inviscid limit problem will be tackled for a better understanding of the direct energy cascade for the three-dimensional case and the inverse energy cascade for the two-dimensional case. Some inviscid limits for some geophysical models with anisotropic viscosity will be investigated as well.

This research takes on the challenge of mitigating the impacts of earthquakes through mathematical understanding. It holds the promise of producing fundamentally new insights in fault physics and advancing the knowledge of friction laws, nucleation and rupture dynamics, localization of (micro)seismicity, crustal rheology, and monitoring stress and material properties. Determining the friction during an earthquake is required to understand when and where earthquakes occur. While this case cannot be reasonably studied in isolation, it is a central thrust of the research. A study of earthquake physics comprises nonlinear (segmented) fault dynamics, formulated as an inverse problem. Faults have nontrivial geometry, dependent on material properties of juxtaposed crustal blocks changing in time, stress, and general rheology of Earth?s crust and upper mantle and large-scale deformation. Tidal forcing will be exploited to enable the study of buoyancy structure deep in our planet's interior. Results will yield procedures for monitoring and obtaining invaluable information about rheology and microstructure in the subsurface, which could also be employed in geothermal exploration and carbon dioxide sequestration. The project offers, via collaborations, a unique interdisciplinary educational experience for the students giving them a much broader appreciation of the importance of novel techniques and real-life implications.<br/> <br/>The investigator will study inverse problems associated with earthquakes, interseismic slip, and tidal deformation. These inverse problems are defined through systems of partial differential equations describing elastic-gravitational deformation and waves, coupled to nonlinear rate- and state-dependent friction laws on faults, as well as extensions to viscoelastic and nonlocal elastic behaviors accounting for microstructure and complex rheologies. The key advances will pertain to determining friction during an earthquake, gleaning information about friction laws on faults also during interseismic deformation, in conjunction with recovering anisotropic elastic / viscoelastic / nonlocal-elastic material parameters in the crust and fault zones exploiting ruptures, dislocation, and microseismic clouds as sources as well as tidal forcing of the Moon.

The second direction is rooted on the integrability of the 1D cubic nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation and pursues two lines of inquiry. One of these questions focuses on exploring the origins of integrability of the 1D cubic NLS through a series of projects aimed at unveiling correct analogues of integrability at the many particle level, and then at demonstrating that these correspond to the known properties at the NLS level.

Therefore, a better understanding of the dynamics of nonlinear surface and internal waves and their interactions is crucial in many disciplines, including physical oceanography, environmental science, and ocean and coastal engineering. Ultimately this information would help researchers working on climate change as the transfer of energy and momentum across the air-sea boundary and in the interior of the ocean is fundamental to their work.

The focus is on the evolution of a packet of short surface waves satisfying the so-called group resonance condition, which requires the group velocity of the packet to match approximately the phase speed of a long internal wave. This condition can be easily met under realistic oceanic conditions. The mathematical models will be then validated for one dimensional waves with fully nonlinear numerical solutions of the Euler equations obtained via an unsteady conformal mapping technique and previous laboratory observations. The theoretical approach for two-layered flows will be extended to three-layered flows, and the conditions for resonant interactions between the first two internal wave modes and their dynamics will be studied.

We provide mathematical models to detect when this could happen. To do this we need to create new theory, beyond the traditional models for credit risk. It turns out that such mathematical models can easily be modified to model certain issues in the propagation of epidemics (such as the current COVID-19 pandemic). In particular, imagine that a group of people attend a super spreader event. Assuming more than a few will contract the disease, with a subset needing hospitalization, then - from the standpoint of health control and hospital capacity control - one might want to know the probability of two or more people getting the disease at once. It is important to note that two people exposed to the disease at the same event will contract the disease at different times (if at all), and the progress of the disease within their bodies will depend on a large number of factors, many of which are unknown, or impossible to quantify; hence the need for random modeling. The project will provide training opportunities and support for graduate students to be involved in the research.<br/><br/>In Credit Risk Theory, default times are typically modeled via a Cox construction, and for two different companies a standard assumption is that the stopping times are conditionally independent, give the underlying filtration of observable events. Such models do not allow, however, for simultaneous defaults, due to the use of independent exponential random variables used in the Cox constructions. We propose to replace the independent exponentials with multivariate exponentials, using (for example) the form proposed in 1967 by Marshall and Olkin. We will then use martingale orthogonality in place of conditional independence to make the desired calculations of different properties of the default times. This extension should be especially useful when modeling catastrophic credit events, such as the simultaneous default of two banks, both of them being ""too big to fail.""  The other class of problems we propose to study is the modeling of the development of COVID-19 (or other epidemics) on an individual level. A key example is that if two people attend a ""super spreader"" event, what are the times after simultaneous exposure to the development of disease? Perhaps surprisingly this can be modeled in a near perfect analogy with the credit risk issues discussed above. Such models could be useful for, for example, hospital preparedness in a given locality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Roughly speaking, a coherent structure is a well-defined feature in fluid flow that can be easily distinguished and mathematically described in a simple manner. One example is a vortex, where all fluid particles rotate about a single point. Another example is a sharp front, which may arise when a fluid consists of warm and cold regions separated by a thin moving transition region.  Many more examples of coherent structures exist in the natural world and we encounter them daily. While it seems to be an extremely formidable problem to give an efficient way to describe general fluid flows, describing the evolution of coherent structures seems to be amenable to mathematical analysis. Moreover, since coherent structures are often observed to be dominant in physical and numerical experiments, describing their evolution is of great importance. A simple question that one could ask in this regard is: What happens to a ""strong"" vortex under small perturbations? Does the vortex persist or does it quickly disintegrate? Another question of interest is whether nice fluid flows can develop coherent structures that possess a singularity, that is, infinite velocity or velocity gradient.  Such questions lie at the core of this project.  <br/><br/>Mathematically, the research focuses primarily on the dynamics of both weak and strong solutions to the incompressible Euler equations and related models. The project investigates a novel approach to the classical problem of finite-time singularity formation in fluids with zero viscosity -- that is, the emergence of certain singular structures in a fluid without external influence. Previous work provided an example of finite-time singularity formation for strong solutions to the incompressible Euler equations in certain settings. Part of the project involves extending and strengthening these results as well as investigating the applicability of the methods to other questions including the dynamics of vortex patches in the 2D Euler equation. Another part of the project studies the stability of certain singular weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equation and related models, specifically, the stability of singular vortices with respect to smoother perturbations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Partial differential equations (PDEs) serve as the principal mathematical tool to model such phenomena, and to account for lack of information or model uncertainty it is natural to add randomness to the equations. A ubiquitous feature of such problems is a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, extending all the way up to the scale of observational interest. As numerical simulations are practically impossible on the microscopic scale, a simplified and effective description of the physical quantities, such as the surface height, the density of pollutants, and the wave intensity, is extremely desirable for these problems. The goal of the project is to study the relevant random PDEs, and to lay down mathematical foundations for simplified effective models in various approximation regimes. Organic part of this project is the educational program that is integrated with research. The educational program includes a sustained training of graduate and undergraduate students at the intersection of probability theory, analysis, and applications, through designing advanced courses, supervising undergraduate research, and organizing workshops for early career researchers. The goal is to introduce students to the analytic and probabilistic tools that are indispensable for both academic research and engineering applications.<br/> <br/>The focus of this project is in the areas of stochastic PDEs, diffusion in random environment, and wave propagation in random media. By combining tools, such as asymptotic expansions, functional inequalities and stochastic analysis, the principal investigator will study (i) nonlinear stochastic PDEs modeling interface growth; (ii) behavior of directed polymers in random environment; (iii) effective models of wave propagation in random media. One of principal themes of the project is to analyze the dependence of observables on the random perturbations, and to understand the interplay between the nonlinearity and the randomness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Institute will be held July 19-August 28, 2021 online; more information can be found on its website (http://geometry.institute).  Overall, SGI aims to accomplish the following objectives: (1) spark wide collaboration among students and researchers in geometry processing, (2) launch inter-university research projects in geometry processing involving team members across broad levels of seniority (undergraduate, graduate, faculty, industrial researcher), (3) introduce students to geometry processing research and development, and (4) diversify the ""pipeline"" of students entering geometry processing research, in terms of gender, race, socioeconomic background, and home institution. The first week of the Institute will train undergraduate and MS student participants on state-of-the-art techniques in geometry processing, intended as their first exposure to this discipline.  Then, for the remaining weeks, student teams collaborate on research problems, with the goal of exploring directions suggested by senior attendees.  Beyond these day-long interactions, visitors will give talks on frontier areas and lead relevant tutorials.  The opportunity cost for students taking six weeks to participate will be covered by the workshop.  <br/><br/>As a discipline, geometry processing presents substantial theoretical challenges motivated by practical considerations of manufacturing/fabrication, computer vision, physical simulation, and high-performance computing.  Participants will be exposed to---and will advance state-of-the-art in---technical problems ranging from the development of a toolkit for discrete differential geometry to the incorporation of probability/uncertainty in the shape processing pipeline.  Participating in geometry processing research also gives mathematics students exposure to fields like differential geometry in a more tangible environment, coupled with computer visualizations and concrete applications with immediate impact.  Our workshop is designed to make progress on several concrete challenges in geometry processing, including development of robust geometry processing algorithms, design of high-throughput shape analysis methods, design of sensible machine learning architectures for understanding and processing geometry built on foundations from differential/algebraic geometry, and extending machinery from geometry processing to higher-dimensional problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the deterministic equations describing the dynamics of fluids are well-established and their numerical solution has revealed much about the turbulent behavior of fluids, their analysis is challenging, and basic results remain elusive. The use of probabilistic tools offer complementary approaches that naturally incorporate the uncertainties of the actual state of the fluid and random perturbations due to external forces. This project will leverage state-of-the-art tools in probability, stochastic analysis, and dynamical systems, to study the basic fluid dynamics models and some of its variants, which are relevant to physics, engineering, and atmosphere-ocean dynamics. Emphasis will be given to study the effect of random forcing on these systems, gain further understanding on the energy transfer across scales, and the possibility of obtaining basic existence and uniqueness results using the probabilistic framework, which remain elusive in the deterministic approach. The project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in the research. <br/><br/>This research program studies several mathematical problems stemming from the challenges of turbulence theory and involves stochastic analysis, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations. The goal is to understand the link between the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, their stochastic versions, and the phenomenological laws of turbulence. The advantage of the stochastic approach is the major simplicity of balance laws between mean rates of energy injection, dissipation, and flux. Due to the rich structure of these stochastic models, some results on uniqueness and stability of some approximations of three-dimensional viscous and inviscid fluid flows could be proved while their deterministic counterpart is lacking. The smoothing effect of the noise on the associated dynamical system will be used. The study of the inviscid limit problem will be tackled for a better understanding of the direct energy cascade for the three-dimensional case and the inverse energy cascade for the two-dimensional case. Some inviscid limits for some geophysical models with anisotropic viscosity will be investigated as well. Theoretical issues, such as existence, uniqueness, and ergodicity of invariant measures, will be complemented by numerical simulations. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Applied Mathematics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
