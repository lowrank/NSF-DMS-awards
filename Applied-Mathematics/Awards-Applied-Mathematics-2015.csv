In astrodynamics, small forces resulting from the intertwining of the natural gravity of Moon, Sun, and planets, can be exploited to design spacecraft trajectories to distant locations within the Solar System, or to correct the orbits of artificial satellites near the Earth, with significant fuel savings. In climate science, small changes in the system parameters, such as in the concentration of greenhouse gases, can cause sharp transitions of the climate from one regime to another, and the mathematical analysis of climate data can detect early warning signs of such transitions. In molecular biology, small changes in the structure of molecules involved in the process of protein folding can have significant functional effects; such changes can be detected via topological data analysis of electron microscopy imaging.    <br/><br/>This project seeks to discover explicit mechanisms that produce large effects in general mathematical models of various real-world systems, as well as to infer such mechanisms directly from data. Data is often used in the case of complex systems where explicit models are difficult to conceive from fundamental principles. The first research direction is devoted to large effects in mechanical Hamiltonian systems subject to small perturbations, deterministic or random. The goal is to describe mechanisms that yield trajectories that travel a large distance in the phase space, as well as trajectories with prescribed itineraries.  Applications of these mechanisms include astrodynamics and celestial mechanics. The second research direction is devoted to critical transitions in complex systems. The goal is to develop methods based on persistent homology that detect critical transitions in noisy dynamical systems with slowly evolving parameters, and to study topological changes in macromolecular processes. These methods are applied to paleoclimate data and GroEL/ES chaperonin systems involved in protein folding."

Contributing factors include the advent of the internet, advances in computational power and computing architectures, the availability of very large data sets, as well as advances in science, engineering, communication, and business. These developments have created a fertile ground for the emergence of new applications and data acquisition modalities, in addition to new methods for data management, interpretation, and modeling. These are the driving forces behind big data and machine learning research. In addition, there is a greater urgency in many disciplines for addressing questions concerning design, efficiency, risk, and inference, as well as model selection, system identification, and error and uncertainty quantification. This research project aims to develop new methods in non-smooth optimization and to study the practical impact of these methods.  The research will emphasize underlying optimization tools, including model development, the design of numerical solution procedures, and the assessment and quantification of model validity, sensitivity, robustness, and uncertainty.<br/><br/>This project concerns the methods and theory associated with the use of smoothing techniques in optimization. In order to extract solutions having pre-specified properties, objective functions in modern optimization problems are often non-differentiable, with the non-differentiability being a key descriptive component. In addition, non-differentiability is present in an essential way when the problem is constrained. Problems possessing non-differentiability appear across a broad spectrum of applications. These include robust statistical modeling, regularization formulations to encode prior information, system identification, sparsity optimization, matrix completion, semi-definite programming, and any problem possessing constraints. In addition, many modern problems are very large scale.  Hence, there is a focus on the development of fast optimization algorithms for large-scale applications in the presence of non-smooth/non-convex objectives. Smoothing methods are designed to approximate these non-smooth problems, with the goal of rapidly obtaining good approximate solutions. This project is devoted to the development and understanding of new and emerging smoothing methods for non-smooth optimization, to providing a mathematical foundation for these methods, and to studying the practical impact of these methods on a range of applications. Primary objectives include (1) developing a framework for convergence analysis, (2) extending results for convex problems to non-convex problems, (3) providing a calculus for smoothing techniques, (4) developing error bounds using duality theory, (5) continued development of the level set method for optimization, and (6) consideration of parametrized optimal value functions."

Specifically, the principal investigator considers equations used as models governing the motion of currents in the oceans and the propagation of pulses in optical fibers. Solitary and periodic waves, often observable in physical systems and lab experiments, are solutions of particular interest for these applications. The stability of solutions implies that they are persistent through small changes in the environment, impurities of the materials, imperfections of the model, etc. Results of the research can be used to address important problems, such as optimization, in engineering. <br/> <br/>This project addresses a variety of problems in partial differential equations, focusing on the study of stability and long-time behavior of coherent structures, such as periodic and solitary waves and more complicated excited states. The principal investigator uses the point of view of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, which takes advantage of the analogy between partial and ordinary differential equations. The approach is to look at systems whose time evolution occurs on appropriately defined infinite-dimensional function spaces and use ordinary differential equation objects such as invariant manifolds and attractors, as well as more subtle connections. The proposal consists of two parts. The first part focuses on the linear stability of waves for several models, both in one and higher spatial dimensions. The principal investigator finds the spectral stability with a method that treats both spatially periodic and solitary waves equally well. Important examples here are the Boussinesq system and the short-pulse equation, and also the sine-Gordon and Klein-Gordon equations. These problems present many challenges at the spectral and linear stability level, but virtually nothing is known for their asymptotic stability. In the second part, the project focuses on the long-time behavior and nonlinear stability of waves for these models. Of interest is the relation between linear and nonlinear stability, particularly for wave equations where the generators for the semi-groups are operator matrices whose spectrum is not easy to compute. The common feature of these equations is that they support soliton-like solutions, such as ground or excited states and solitary or periodic traveling or standing waves."

The subject of continuum mechanics is concerned with modeling the mechanical behavior of materials as continua: solids (elasticity) and liquids (fluid dynamics).  It underlies numerous engineering applications, including the behavior of architectural structures, tires and other vehicle parts, aerospace vehicles, and a wide range of other deformable substances.  Partial differential equations provide a mathematical language for expressing relationships among quantities of interest, such as the distortion of an elastic body or the velocity in a fluid, and most mathematical models in engineering and science are expressed in terms of partial differential equations.  This meeting will be held in conjunction with the Howard Rowlee Lecture, an endowed public lecture presented annually by the Department of Mathematics at UNL.  This year's lecture will be given on April 17th, and the timing and coordination of the Lecture and the Conference should enhance the impact of both.  The purpose of the Conference is to foster contacts between mathematicians (junior, senior, and all points in between) within a broad spectrum of applied mathematics.<br/><br/>The Conference will comprise a series of presentations by established, prominent researchers, as well as recent Ph.D. recipients.  The meeting brings together specialists who, owing to their respective fields of study, might not otherwise have occasion to meet and exchange ideas.  The meeting will focus on recent advances in continuum mechanics, partial differential equations, and related fields in applied mathematics. The interests of the speakers cover areas such as numerical analysis, variational problems, mathematical modeling, singular integrals, pseudo-differential operators, dispersive equations, and nonlinear acoustics.  The lectures will address some of the major problems in these fields, including modeling aspects, and analytic and numerical results.  They will also present new techniques that have been recently developed, as well as open problems and possible venues for their investigation.  <br/><br/>Conference web site: http://www.math.unl.edu/~mfoss3/2015conference/"

For example, the spread of an epidemic in a specific population can be described using a contact network representing the nature and strength of interpersonal interactions among individuals. Historically, these models were intractable due to the complexity of individual behavior and, therefore, many early disease models utilized simplified representations involving population averages and statistics. By differentiating individuals, network models carry a large amount of additional information that has become more accessible thanks to increasingly powerful computer processors and the advent of fast computational algorithms. This project develops new mathematical theories and computational algorithms to capture the essential features of networks and applies them to models in epidemiology. Results from this project will allow researchers to identify a number of valuable patterns in the data, including the subpopulations at highest risk, vulnerable transmission pathways, and effective mitigation strategies. <br/><br/>The investigator and his colleagues study the mathematical concept of p-modulus on networks, focusing on the analysis of theoretical properties, the development of numerical algorithms, and the study of applications to the spread of diseases in contact networks. This is an interdisciplinary project intended to enhance both the theoretical understanding of the ways in which diseases spread in an interconnected network of individuals or sub-populations, and the computational tools available to researchers interested in modeling, simulating, and predicting the behavior of epidemics. The theory of p-modulus was originally developed in the field of complex analysis and has a connection to the concept of effective resistance in the context of electrical networks. The p-modulus provides a method for quantifying the richness of a family of walks: families of many short walks have a larger modulus than families of few long ones. Therefore, the flexibility of p-modulus provides a means for extracting fine structure characteristics of linked data."

Do the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations correctly describe what we see in fluid experiments?  Can we use these equations to make precise predictions about the flows, to predict tomorrow's weather, or to predict the macro-scale evolution of the Earth's climate?  These questions are conjecturally related through the phenomenological theories of turbulence and the statistical properties of solutions to the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.  When attempting to give rigorous answers to these questions we are faced with new frontiers in mathematical analysis, and fundamental new ideas are needed to understand the underlying phenomena.  In this project the investigator studies the relation between turbulence and the equations that are used to describe fluid flows.<br/><br/>     The project focuses on furthering our understanding of the hypothesized link between fluid turbulence and the Navier-Stokes equations.  The complexity of turbulent flows observed in experiments translates into fundamental mathematical issues, chief among which are the problems of singularities, uniqueness, and stability in the fluid equations.  The investigator and colleagues attack these problems from two intimately related angles: by analyzing the statistical properties of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations; and by studying the emergence of singularities in the Euler and related active scalar equations.  In tackling these problems the investigator appeals to ideas from hypoellipticity (in the sense of Hormander), convex integration, Lagrangian particle adapted methods, and Landau damping.  The goal is to develop nonlinear, solution-adapted methods."

On one hand, suppressing turbulent drag is key in designing and engineering energy efficient vehicles.  Understanding the genesis and dynamics of a turbulent wake behind a large plane is key in maintaining safety of the airspace in the proximity of an airport.  On the other hand, turbulent mixing may be desirable -- an example being designing more efficient drug delivery systems.  The main theme of the project is a rigorous study of various manifestations of turbulence in three-dimensional fluid flows modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations.  This is considered both from the perspective of the mathematical theory of turbulence, and as a physical mechanism underlying possible blow-ups (singularities) of the solutions of the system.  Ruling out the possibility of singularity formation in any physical model is a fundamental question, even more so when the model should be applicable to such an omnipresent class of physical phenomena as are 3D fluid flows.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.  <br/><br/>     The project branches into three directions: (1) vortex stretching and local anisotropic diffusion, (2) isotropic diffusion of the velocity field and induced scaling laws, and (3) turbulent transport in non-homogeneous Navier-Stokes model.  The first two directions follow from the recent work of the investigators and their collaborators in presenting a numerically and analytically motivated geometric scenario of vortex filaments formation that exhibits logarithmic sub-criticality in the context of the 3D Navier-Stokes regularity problem.  In this scenario, the transversal scale of the filaments -- a natural, anisotropic micro-scale of the flow -- triggers the mechanism of local, anisotropic diffusion, preventing the possible formation of singularities.  The motivation for the third direction of the study comes from the realm of building and reinforcing mathematical support for Kolmogorov phenomenology in physical scales of the flow.  The investigators have recently managed to adopt their physical scales methodology to the study of forced turbulence.  This opens up an avenue for studying the influence of the spatial distribution of the force on formation of turbulent cascades, as well as for the study of boundary effects via the masking feedback/volume penalization approach.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project."

From the practical standpoint laws of turbulence are crucial in many real-life applications.  They stand behind the modern design of a plane airfoil or development of weather and climate forecast models.  One of the features of turbulence is called anomalous energy dissipation.  This phenomenon arises when the motion of a fluid is so chaotic or rough that the the classical laws of smooth dynamics no longer apply.  Anomalous energy dissipation is harnessed in many commonly used energy-dumping mechanisms, such as automobile wheel struts.  Common though it is, in some cases energy dissipation does not occur even in what otherwise would be considered a flow turbulent enough to facilitate such dissipation.  It has been observed that in various natural phenomena, such as vortex sheets that develop behind the wing of a plane, energy dissipation does not occur until motion reaches a supercritical state.  The project goal is to isolate several mechanisms responsible for energy preservation or dissipation in fluid motion that is turbulent or nearly so.  A main focus is on investigation of the role of symmetries in energy conservation.  Students are included in the project.<br/><br/>     The investigator studies weak solutions to the Euler equation and its viscous Navier-Stokes counterpart in the vanishing viscosity limit regime, by considering the role of energy conservation or dissipation in the fluid flows described by these equations.  The equations have been shown to describe turbulence rather accurately from a numerical point of view, although theoretically they present many challenges.  Following Onsager, in terms of regularity a solution reaches its turbulent state when smoothness of the flow is reduced to a third of one full derivative, also known as Onsager regularity.  In that regularity regime the investigator examines four main mechanisms as candidates responsible for energy conservation or dissipation:  Hamiltonian structure of the underlying governing equation, incompressibility condition, basic scaling symmetries and transport nature of the motion, and the vanishing viscosity limit in the two-dimensional setting.  The last point connects energy dissipation to regularity of solutions of the Euler equations.  The project involves active participation of students."

Many problems arising in physics can be modeled by nonlinear partial differential equations, and some of these differential equations generate solutions with interesting structures, such as pulse-like solutions that model light traveling through fiber optics or vortex solutions that arise in fluids and condensed matter physics.  This research aims to understand some of these structures.  In the first case, the behavior of large numbers of vortices in superconducting materials (a typical feature of certain classes of superconductors) will be studied.  In the second case, how vortices are generated in superconductors will be examined.  The third project will consider numerical algorithms that are used to compute pulse-like solutions that arise in nonlinear optics.<br/><br/>This research will focus on three problems arising in applied mathematics.  The first project will study the mean-field behavior of asymptotically large numbers of vortices arising in superconductivity.  The analysis requires handling asymptotically large numbers of vortices, each of which has asymptotically large energy.  To do so, refined estimates will be developed for tracking concentrations of energy.  The project on the understanding of vortex nucleation in the time-dependent setting should help to understand the transition to the mixed-vortex state in Type-II superconductors.  Finally, the project on iterative methods for computing bound states will study why certain methods are unconditionally convergent, which should lead to better algorithm design."

The interaction between mathematics and mechanics, with ensuing applications to materials science and biology, will be the central theme of the conference. The grant will support travel expenses of young scientists to participate in the conference and present a poster in the blitz and exhibit sessions. The late 1940s saw the beginning of new trends in the development of a continuum theory of complex materials and the foundation of theories that bridge continuum mechanics and molecular and atomic structure. These new areas of inquiry were catalytic to the development of new mathematical and mechanics theories at the basis of design of new materials and devices, with applications from medicine to advanced manufacturing. The conference has two main goals. First, it will explore recent developments and new trends and will identify prospects for future research on nonlinear materials, devices, biological modeling, and related mathematical and computational ideas and tools. The interdisciplinary school of scientists at the forefront of such developments during the last seven decades has mentored and produced new generations of outstanding scientists, which include a large number of women, who have themselves reached leadership roles in the field. Thus, another main goal of the conference is to discuss mentoring strategies for future generations to ensure the continued scientific and human development success and to reach out to members of underrepresented groups.  The participants will explore tools to overcome the challenges of an incipient career in interdisciplinary research and identify new educational demands.  Another organizational task will be identifying an academically diverse pool of junior researchers across the USA and oversees, with a very strong presence of women and members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Nonlinear elasticity emerged in the mathematical community as a result of the works by Ericksen and Rivlin, from the late 1940s to 1960s. This initiated a golden period of research in the calculus of variations and partial differential equations, from the points of view of both analysis and geometry. These developments also lead to outstanding success in the field of complex materials, such as the theories of phase transformations in crystals, shape memory alloys, ferroelectric and magnetic materials, composites, and liquid crystals. While the selection of conference speakers is made in connection with these themes of research, the emphasis will be placed on new and prospective mathematical and materials developments and applications. These will include topics on materials research leading to new sources of clean energy, as well as new mathematical tools to understand and compute defects in liquid crystals and ensuing applications to electrolytic transport, and mechanical studies of viruses towards research on antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The conference also envisions a scientific panel on strategies for new materials development, accompanying mathematical tools, and interdisciplinary and educational challenges.

A first approach is the design and theoretical analysis of imaging methods exploiting physical phenomena in new ways, leading to imaging strategies with both improved contrast and resolution, and providing access to new features such as anisotropic properties of muscle fibers. A second approach is to provide distortion-free reconstructions and accurately located inclusions in human bodies or the Earth's crust. This is achieved by using more realistic descriptions (specifically, spatially varying) of the propagation speed of the waves used to probe the medium of interest. The model considered becomes augmented with new technicalities, where additional phenomena (e.g., caustics) can occur and open mathematical questions abound. The present project provides theoretical and practical imaging answers to some of these new problems. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the theoretical and mathematical understanding of: (i) coupled-physics inverse problems, which often consist of parameter identification problems in partial differential equations (PDE) using internal measurements; and (ii) geodesic X-ray transforms (a generalization of the famous Radon transform, in two dimensions), with applications to X-Ray Tomography in media with variable index of refraction. In the former topic, methods from analysis and PDEs are used to derive reconstruction algorithms for various models of increasing complexity, including additional constitutive parameters relevant for medical imaging, and including a transition from scalar to systems of PDEs. In the latter topic, the investigator uses tools of integral geometry, Fourier analysis, and PDEs to provide statements about injectivity/stability (or lack thereof), reconstruction formulas and their numerical validation, for the tensor tomography problem on Riemannian surfaces. Generalizations to higher dimensions, attenuated transforms and other types of flows (e.g., magnetic and thermostat flows) are also considered."

They appear in industrial applications in the production of food products, cosmetics, and advanced materials; and they occur naturally as biological fluids like mucus, blood, and biofilms. Complex fluids are known to exhibit exotic properties, sometimes acting like solids, while at other times flowing freely like liquids. These are macroscale observations, but recent advances in particle tracking techniques have shed light on fascinating dynamics that occur at the microscale as well. Accurately characterizing and understanding the behavior of foreign particles in complex fluids is vital for certain applications.  For example, learning why some particles penetrate biological fluids, while others do not, can be critical for the development of successful drug delivery techniques. Furthermore, it has been shown that the statistics of immersed particle paths can carry the signature of important large scale material properties, making it possible to study expensive complex fluids with microliter sized samples. <br/><br/>While there has been success in describing the motion of individual particles in complex fluids, developing models for interacting particle populations has proven frustrating for theoreticians. It is remarkable, for example, that there is no mathematical model for particles that individually behave according to fractional Brownian motion, but when close together, interact with each other through forces mediated by the laws of a fluid environment. This collaborative project addresses stochastic, numerical, and experimental issues arising in the study of diffusion of foreign particles in complex fluids. Specifically, we will consider two fluid models that amplify the fundamental relationships between mechanical properties of the fluids and particles paths. The models are (1) a linear viscoelastic fluid and (2) a motile suspension in a viscous fluid. In addition to developing the mathematical tools to efficiently and accurately simulate these models, we will use these simulations to address fundamental theoretical challenges that confront engineers who use particle tracking techniques."

Nearly all important physical phenomena are governed by fundamental laws and design principles that directly relate rates of change of some quantity to that of some other quantity.  Indeed, given the initial conditions and the physical laws of motion one seeks to predict the future and reconstruct the past.  This important observation naturally leads to the idea of a differential equation, thus providing the key to understanding many real-world problems.  Differential equations are widely used as models in mathematical physics and have potential applications to many fields including Bose-Einstein condensates, fluid dynamics, pattern formation, gas dynamics and for modeling signals in optical communication networks. This conference will facilitate greater interaction between researchers in differential equations and its related fields from the area close to Kansas and Missouri. Planned as the first of a series of annual meetings, the conference will provide a venue for regional junior and established researchers, as well as graduate students to discuss the recent advances and challenges in their respective fields.  In addition, young researchers will be given the opportunity to present their own work and to gain insights into this important subject through interactions with senior experts in the field. The conference website: https://www.math.ku.edu/conferences/2015/KUMUPDE/index.html<br/><br/>Complex nonlinear systems abound in science and engineering, and their behavior is often modeled by systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE).  Any progress towards understanding the behavior of their solutions is of paramount importance for a variety of practical applications, including fluid flow, flame front propagation and fiber optical communication.  Many PDE can be conveniently described as infinite dimensional dynamical systems, allowing for the use of tools and methodologies from dynamical systems theory to make qualitative and quantitative predictions about the solutions of these systems.  Objects like invariant manifolds have been a great aid in understanding the behavior of finite-dimensional dynamical systems, but the connections between nonlinear PDE's and dynamical systems is still an area active current research.  In the last few decades, collaborations between researchers in these fields, as well as with those working in their applications, have provided tremendous progress in our understanding of the dynamical behavior, stability and robustness of coherent structures in such nonlinear PDE.  The main themes of this conference include (i) fluid dynamics, water waves and dispersive PDE's, (ii) existence, dynamics, and stability of nonlinear waves in dissipative systems, and (iii) dynamical systems and 2d-Navier Stokes equations.The techniques used to solve many challenging problems in these broad areas often combine ideas and methodologies from dynamical systems and partial differential equations together with probability theory, spectral and functional analysis, Evans functions, and geometric singular perturbation theory, to name a few."

Examples arise in nature with suspensions of rod-like, flagella-propelled bacteria, in living cells where actin filaments provide structural integrity and molecular motors propel the filaments to achieve cellular function, and in high performance materials where catalytic nano-rods are suspended in a reactive solvent and propelled by chemical reactions.  These systems share the remarkable feature of self-organization on scales in space and time far greater than those of the individual particles, translating to functionality across many scales.  These diverse active particle-fluid systems have been previously modeled.  Here the investigators undertake a unified theoretical and computational platform for such problems, which offers multiple benefits.  A common mathematical structure reveals how these systems achieve their functional properties, informs which physical and chemical features allow the most efficient steering and optimization of the system toward desired properties, allows for a common computational platform, and allows one to incorporate additional degrees of freedom or perturb existing particle and fluid properties and predict their consequences.  These advances have applications to enhance beneficial bacterial colonies and to disrupt harmful ones, to repair damaged cellular functions, and to design nano-composite materials with optimal properties.  Graduate students are involved in the work of the project.<br/><br/>The principal investigators develop a modeling and computational platform for active, anisotropic fluids, unifying three apparently diverse fluid systems (catalytic nano-rod dispersions, swimming bacterial suspensions, and motor-driven actin filament gels) for which models, analysis, algorithms, and simulations have so far evolved independently.  The mathematical platform unifies previous results, spans kinetic to continuum spatial and temporal scales, and identifies a common leading-order mathematical structure at each scale of description as well as the lower-order structure that distinguishes among different active, anisotropic fluids.  This structure guides analysis and algorithm development toward an understanding of, and predictive control over, the remarkable observed behavior of these fluid systems.

But even with such a wave equation in hand, there remains the difficult task of deducing important information from the model, information that is needed to solve important problems of engineering that motivate the study of waves in the first place.  One common approach is to use computers to solve the equations (approximately). However, such an approach is limited in scope to very concrete simulations involving particular initial conditions, and it holds only in parameter ranges in which the numerical methods can be accurate.  On the other hand, there are other parameter regimes that are quite common (for example, the situation that electromagnetic waves can be approximated by light rays) in which the computer-based approach becomes difficult, and therefore one would like to have an alternative method of analysis.  This project is aimed at developing such alternative methods of asymptotic analysis for wave propagation problems that are nonlinear (so that large waves can be accurately modeled) but that nonetheless admit a kind of transform relating them to linear problems (for which the familiar superposition principle applies).  One application of such theoretical analysis would be to describe the evolution of sub-surface oil plumes caused by an oil leak like the Deepwater Horizon disaster.  <br/><br/>This project is an attempt to place completely integrable nonlinear wave equations on a similar footing as constant-coefficient linear equations, from the point of view of asymptotic analysis (i.e., to further develop nonlinear analogues of the classical methods of stationary phase and steepest descent for integrals).  The specific problems to be addressed include the study of the inverse-scattering transform for the Benjamin-Ono equation (a nonlocal integrable model for internal gravity waves) in the small-dispersion limit, the study of the resonant interaction of wave packets through a quadratic nonlinearity in the semiclassical limit, the study of an analogue of the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation describing waves in two spatial dimensions in the semiclassical limit, the study of dynamical stability of so-called rogue waves, the study of mixed initial/boundary-value problems for integrable equations in the semiclassical limit, and the investigation of ""universal wave patterns"", analogues to wave propagation problems of universal phase transitions in statistical mechanics and mathematical physics."

A first approach is the design and theoretical analysis of imaging methods exploiting physical phenomena in new ways, leading to imaging strategies with both improved contrast and resolution, and providing access to new features such as anisotropic properties of muscle fibers. A second approach is to provide distortion-free reconstructions and accurately located inclusions in human bodies or the Earth's crust. This is achieved by using more realistic descriptions (specifically, spatially varying) of the propagation speed of the waves used to probe the medium of interest. The model considered becomes augmented with new technicalities, where additional phenomena (e.g., caustics) can occur and open mathematical questions abound. The present project provides theoretical and practical imaging answers to some of these new problems. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the theoretical and mathematical understanding of: (i) coupled-physics inverse problems, which often consist of parameter identification problems in partial differential equations (PDE) using internal measurements; and (ii) geodesic X-ray transforms (a generalization of the famous Radon transform, in two dimensions), with applications to X-Ray Tomography in media with variable index of refraction. In the former topic, methods from analysis and PDEs are used to derive reconstruction algorithms for various models of increasing complexity, including additional constitutive parameters relevant for medical imaging, and including a transition from scalar to systems of PDEs. In the latter topic, the investigator uses tools of integral geometry, Fourier analysis, and PDEs to provide statements about injectivity/stability (or lack thereof), reconstruction formulas and their numerical validation, for the tensor tomography problem on Riemannian surfaces.

Transport, mixing, and dissipation are among the most fundamental features of fluid flows and are of foundational significance for important applications ranging from microfluidics engineering to modeling in climate science and astrophysics.  The control and optimization techniques adopted here constitute a new and unified computationally aided analysis approach to these problems.  This project directly involves advanced training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>This project utilizes methods of modern applied mathematics and scientific computation.  Mathematical measures of mixing introduced by the investigator and collaborators are utilized in optimal control analyses of the advection and advection-diffusion equations in order to place absolute limits on passive tracer mixing by incompressible flows, and to illuminate key features of particularly effective stirring strategies.  Computational control and applied analysis are employed to construct incompressible fluid flows optimizing transport between impenetrable surfaces and produce new transport bounds for buoyancy-driven Rayleigh-Benard convection and the outstanding problem of turbulent convection.  Optimal control techniques are developed and deployed to determine maximal enstrophy production in the incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations over finite time intervals.

The topic lies at the interface where mathematics meets physics, probability, numerical simulations, and signal processing. The research is driven by challenges in application areas such as ground penetrating radar, satellite imaging and tracking through atmospheric turbulence, nondestructive ultrasonic testing of materials such as aging concrete, imaging in shallow water, and underground exploration. Complex media are ubiquitous in such applications and pose a serious impediment to the imaging process, which is largely ignored by the present imaging technology. Moreover, computer modeling of wave propagation in complex media is faced with formidable computational challenges. Mathematical analysis is needed to unravel the complicated scattering effects of such media so that the present imaging technology can be advanced. This project seeks to analyze long-range propagation of sound and electromagnetic waves in complex media that may also vary in time, develop novel adaptive imaging methodologies that mitigate the medium scattering effects, and propose new measurement setups that can improve the imaging process. <br/><br/>Complex environments are naturally modeled with random processes, and the wave equation has random coefficients and boundaries. The propagation of uncertainty from these random processes to the uncertainty of the waves measured in imaging applications is a highly non-trivial problem. One goal of the project is to develop a better understanding of this problem for the acoustic wave equation and Maxwell's system of equations. The mathematics is a combination of asymptotic stochastic analysis and invariant imbedding for studying transmission and reflection operators. The project considers mixing random processes that are static or may vary in time. The time variations are studied in various setups, with both rapid and slow time changes with respect to the duration of pulses emitted by sensors that probe the complex environment. Another goal of the project is to develop a novel robust and adaptive imaging methodology in complex environments. The methods should be able to detect the loss of coherence of the measured waves due to scattering in the environment and to enhance the signal to noise ratio by filtering the components of the fields that are useless in imaging. The analysis of the imaging methods seeks a resolution theory that quantifies the focusing of images and their statistical stability."

One of the components of this project concerns adaptive optics. Adaptive optics is a method to improve accuracy of astronomical telescopes, laser communication systems, and other optical devices. The main source of distortion in these devices comes from atmospheric turbulence. The aim of this part of the project is to understand the mechanism of this distortion.

One of the goals of this research is to develop tools and a better understanding of approximate models for particle propagation in heterogeneous media. This project concentrates on transport of particles in slowly decorrelating media, because it was observed recently that propagation in slowly decorrelating media has properties with no analogs in rapidly decorrelating media. One of the outcomes of this project will be a rigorous justification of the Random Travel Time Approximation - a method used in adaptive optics.

Unfortunately, effective methods for testing complicated materials for structural imperfections or for identifying unknown targets with little a priori information are still in a state of infancy. In this NSF-funded project, the PI and her graduate students will develop entirely new techniques in inverse scattering theory to obtain reliable target signatures or usable information about objects being examined in computationally efficient ways. The goal is to minimize dependence on a priori information describing the physics and/or geometry of unknown targets. This study will combine practical applications with the mathematical elegance of new imaging techniques that have recently led to the establishment of a new field in mathematics called ""qualitative methods.""<br/><br/>Until not long ago, essentially all existing algorithms for target identification in inverse scattering theory were based on either a weak scattering approximation or on the use of nonlinear optimization techniques. Alternative methods for imaging have been developed to avoid incorrect model assumptions inherent in weak scattering approximations and the requirement of a priori information on the topological and physical properties of the unknown object. Such methods come under the general title of qualitative methods in inverse scattering theory, otherwise referred to as non-iterative methods. Roughly speaking, these methods explore the properties of a linear compact operator determined by the scattering data, which encodes nonlinear information about the scattering object and provides easily implementable reconstruction algorithms. Inherent to the methods appears a new eigenvalue problem, known as the transmission eigenvalue problem. The practical importance of transmission eigenvalues is that they can be determined from the measured scattering data and they carry information about the material properties of the scatterer. This proposal concerns broadening the applicability of the qualitative approach for solving inverse scattering problems with particular emphasis on inhomogeneous media. Of main concern are potential applications to nondestructive testing and target identification. The investigation will take two directions: 1) develop qualitative inversion approaches for inhomogeneous media containing small parameter features that are not in the Born approximation regime, 2) reduce the amount of spatial data needed for the qualitative approach by using only quasi-backscattering and time domain data. To accomplish the above objectives, the investigator and her graduate students will need to investigate new theoretical questions related to the (non-selfadjoint and non-linear) transmission eigenvalue problems that arise in the investigation of the above two parts."

The ability to manipulate and predict the behavior of dynamic processes on microscopic scales is a necessity for the design of modern nanotechnology.  This can be challenging because intuition of processes on the macro scale does not necessarily translate to very small spatial scales.  Mathematical modeling is an essential tool for bridging this gap; however, the relevant equations are highly complex.  In this project, the PI and his students will develop analytical and computational tools for studying these complex mathematical models.  The goal is to establish a set of mathematical methodologies for practitioners that can inform the engineering of these important technologies.  These methodologies will also be useful to many mathematical researchers studying problems from a variety of related fields, such as Fluid Mechanics, Pattern Formation, and Mathematical Biology.<br/><br/>Mathematical modeling of nanotechnology requires a coupling of multiple physical theories, in particular those of elasticity and electrostatics.  This gives rise to models that feature coupled systems of non-linear and higher order (greater than two) partial differential equations.  The complex nature of these equations means that many existing tools, in particular those based on maximum and comparison principles, are not applicable.  Without such constraining principles, these systems can exhibit rich and unexpected patterning behaviors.  To study these behaviors and their implications for the engineering of micro-devices, the PI will develop novel singular perturbation methods and computational techniques.  The particular focus of this project is studying singular solutions of these systems, mainly in the form of finite-time singularities and sharp interfaces.  The PI will focus on obtaining both formal and rigorous results regarding the location, multiplicity, and local dynamics of these singular solution structures.  The analytical arm of this project will be coupled to highly accurate and adaptive numerical simulations developed by the PI and his students."

In addition to its intrinsic scientific value, understanding collective behavior observed in nature (such as in flocks of birds and schools of fish) is expected to facilitate the ability to control technological swarms in the form of nanoparticles delivering drugs or micro-robots performing assemblies and conducting searches. There is a variety of models that provide superficially similar output, that is, they all generate some sort of collective motion. However, there is a lack of studies that distinguish among swarming models and determine their relevance with respect to experimental observations. This project develops a bridge between different mathematical tools to describe swarming behavior and experimentally relevant measures of such behavior in application fields ranging from biology to robotics and from marketing to opinion formation. <br/> <br/>For many common mathematical models, characterizations of swarms are elementary (for example, flocking or milling) and are based on simple global quantities (that is, average velocity or angular momentum). In contrast, this project focuses on more complex observables unveiling key attributes of swarms and swarming models.  For instance, the speed of information propagation is crucial in swarming to avoid obstacles or predators and can be characterized through the analysis of different types of traveling waves. Similarly, interaction with boundaries and other swarms generate internal excitations in the form of standing waves. Connecting swarming behavior and observables requires investigating both micro- and macro-scales. Therefore, this project will combine tools from information theory and statistical physics (micro-models) with the analysis of partial differential equations (macro-models)."

The World Health Organization declared the Ebola epidemic in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 8 August 2014.  As the epidemic continues to spread at an alarming rate in some areas of West Africa, there is an urgent need to develop, test, and calibrate novel mathematical models of Ebola transmission and control with the goal of generating real-time, science-based forecasts of the epidemic in West Africa in order to quantify the times, locations, type and intensity of interventions that would be required to achieve control.  To this end, the investigators and their colleagues formulate and validate models that can be used to predict the number and location of new cases, in order to facilitate decision-making on the allocation of resources that will allow timely medical treatment and isolation of the sick and to implement effective and sensible travel controls.  This project provides first-hand educational experience in cross-disciplinary communication and exploration and cutting-edge research opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students.  It also provides professional development for graduate students.  The investigators disseminate their findings to a diverse range of mathematicians, modelers, and public health and biomedical researchers. <br/><br/>     The investigators divide the project efforts into three modeling tasks.  At first, they formulate dynamical models of the evolving infection reproduction number, comparing how well a simple SI model and the logistic model fit past and current real Ebola epidemics data.  In this initial task, instead of treating the whole population as susceptible, they treat the susceptible population size and the final epidemics size as parameters and allow the reported data to inform these parameter values.  Subsequently, they present a novel delay differential equation based modeling framework that allows models to treat susceptible population size as a dynamical variable, which is highly correlated to current infectious population size.  More specifically, they initialize the susceptible population size as zero instead of the current thinking that susceptible population size equals the total population size initially.  This is simply due to the fact that individuals become susceptible to Ebola only if they had a direct and close contact with infectious Ebola patients.  In the second half of this project, they formulate and validate partial differential equation-based models in order to estimate the Ebola spread speed and to predict the locations and numbers of new Ebola cases subject to various treatment options and travel control policies.

These equations can explain and predict the pattern of circulation of the oceans, atmosphere, or blood in the cardiovascular system; predict changes in weather; describe the motion of a boat or an aircraft.  They were introduced almost two centuries ago but are still not well understood mathematically.  Even though the equations are broadly used by physicists and engineers for real-life applications, the existence and uniqueness of solutions are still not known.  A mathematical proof of existence of solutions would justify the equations definitively.  A mathematical proof of a loss of uniqueness of solutions would identify limitations of the equations.  The project is also expected to shed light on certain fundamental issues related to turbulence.  Turbulence, sometimes referred to as the last unsolved problem in classical physics, is a crucial phenomenon occurring in many fluid flows, for instance those around airplane bodies, vehicles, ships, and blades of turbines.  A better mathematical understanding of turbulence would lead to improvements in the design of these objects. <br/><br/>     Eighty years ago, Leray suggested that turbulence was due to formation of singularities in the flow and introduced a notion of weak solutions to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.  The notion became a basic concept in the theory of partial differential equations.  The aim of this proposal is to study regularity properties of weak solutions to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and their relation to turbulence.  One direction of this work is to construct weak solutions with various abnormal behaviors, such as norm inflation, discontinuity, or norm discontinuity.  Such phenomena may be a result of an instantaneous blow-up from the right, which is much easier to control than a blow-up of a smooth solution.  When the forcing term in the equations is large, the long-time behavior of solutions to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations becomes very complicated and often chaotic.  For fluid flows this phenomenon is known as turbulence.  Even when a velocity field in a turbulent flow is chaotic, experimental and numerical evidence show that the averaged velocity still displays some regular structure.  The investigator studies Leray-Hopf weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations and proves some of the empirical laws of turbulence, using the Littlewood-Paley and atomic decompositions of the velocity vector field."

This project builds and studies theoretical models for the assembly of block copolymers into a variety of microscopic architectures.

For finite random samples, methods such as maximum likelihood estimation and cumulative sum (CUSUM) sequential rules are known to be optimal for dealing with the two previously mentioned problems. Although one expects that optimality would be preserved when the time span between consecutive observations of a Levy process shrinks to zero, there exist important examples showing this not always to be the case. The mystery behind these counterintuitive results is closely connected to the ""fine"" distributional properties of Levy processes in short time. Rather than directly attacking the two proposed problems in continuous time, the investigator builds on the well-studied analogous problems in discrete time and fill in the infinite time continuum by analyzing their evolution when the time span between consecutive observations is made increasingly small. This bottom-up approach is not only appealing but also useful since in practice one would like to determine the performance of statistical methods for high-frequency observations rather than for continuous-time observations, which are arguably never available. The focus on Levy processes is motivated by the fact that the latter are the simplest stochastic models displaying abrupt changes while still preserving the parsimonious statistical properties of their increments. Extensions to other multi-factor stochastic models driven by Levy processes are also contemplated. <br/><br/>Automatic high-frequency monitoring systems of natural and social phenomena are increasingly used in engineering applications, financial markets, and environmental studies. Therefore, there is an increasing need for efficient and accurate statistical and computational methods for the high-frequency data generated by these systems. Two important issues arise with this need: understanding the meaning of statistical efficiency in a high-frequency sampling setting and analyzing the optimality of some of the commonly used statistical methods when applied to high-frequency data. The undertaken research responds to these two pressing problems. The project's outcomes have important applications in pricing of financial derivatives, calibration of financial models, monitoring of navigation system, intrusion detection in computer networks, and more. Educational impacts include providing summer research experiences for undergraduates and developing teaching/computational resources for interdisciplinary topics in statistics, probability, and mathematical finance.

One distance metric on the space of planar shapes is realized by identifying this space as a subset of the Universal Teichmueller Space, and equipping it with the Weil-Petersson metric. This results in a metric that is scale- and translation-invariant on shapes, and has unique geodesic flow between two shape endpoints. The work of this proposal develops robust computational methods for the computation of metric distances and geodesics between shapes on this space. The major difficulty lies in computations involving ""crowded"" shapes, i.e., those with elongated, winding, or extended protrusions. Such shapes stymie finite-precision computations because direct algorithms suffer from severe roundoff error. The major thrusts of this proposal develop algorithmic methodologies to address roundoff error and related issues: The Zipper conformal mapping algorithm will be augmented to produce accurate conformal maps for crowded shapes. The velocity field representation on a geodesic will be rewritten into a form that is resistant to roundoff error. The geodesic equation will be transformed into a expression that takes advantage of the aforementioned velocity field transformation, and can effectively flow between crowded shapes. The final phase of this project will demonstrate accurate geodesic flow and distance computations between crowded shapes. The methods developed under this project can be applied to several related problems in scientific computing: solutions to differential equations on irregular geometries through conformal mapping, conservative integration methods with ill-conditioned particle systems, and moving-mesh kernel approximations.<br/><br/>The work of this project can contribute to far-reaching applications in scientific and computer vision problems: automated object recognition (e.g. projectile identification), outline classification (determination of an animal's species), medical imaging (usage of MRI to diagnose dementia and related diseases), and artificial intelligence (visual recognition and interpretation) to name a few. All computational deliverables (computer code, example simulations, documentation) will be made publicly available.

Modern technological capabilities such as 3d-printing, micro- and nano-fabrication, allow a huge variety of material structures to be manufactured, and one wants to know the ""best"" structure, or how composite microstructures can be optimized.  This project develops methods of structural optimization of multimaterial composites.  Optimal composites lead to metamaterials that utilize the extreme properties.  Optimal composites are crucial to structural optimization because optimal designs are made from specially tailored composites.  Numerous applications call for optimal design of multimaterial composites, but so far the vast majority of related results deals only with two-material optimal composites because of limitations of existing theory.  This project fills this gap.  Optimal microstructures of multiphase composites drastically differ from the structures of optimal two-phase composites.  The latter have an intuitively expected topology: a strong material always surrounds weak inclusions.  In contrast, optimal three-material structures show a large variety of patterns: they may contain a strong envelope, ""hubs"" of intermediate material connected by anisotropic ""pathways"", and other configurations that reveal a geometrical essence of optimality.  The topologies of optimal structures cannot be easily guessed, and the proposed research develops a regular way to construct them.<br/><br/>Optimal structures and bounds for effective properties of composites are studied by methods of convex analysis.  The problem of optimal multimaterial composite structure is formulated as a problem of constructing a quasiconvex envelope of a multi-well Lagrangian.  Two methods will be developed: a novel method of bounds derivation that accounts for inequalities due to ordering of gradient fields in optimal structures (weaker fields corresponding to stronger materials) and a complementary method for building minimizing sequences that realize the bounds to determine the structure of an optimal composite.  It is assumed that fields in the materials are known from optimality requirements derived from the bounds, and the geometry is chosen so that these fields are compatible.  Special attention is paid to optimal 3d structures of multiphase composites; the developed methods for structures can be used for constructing metamaterials."

In this research project, the investigator develops a novel framework and an approach for analysis of various notions of prices and hedging strategies in general models of financial markets.  He aims to develop a utility-based pricing method for contingent claims with embedded payment streams. <br/><br/>In a complete financial market every contingent claim can be replicated by a portfolio of the traded securities and therefore admits a unique arbitrage-free price, which is an initial value of the replicating strategy.  In an incomplete market, to every contingent claim is associated an interval of arbitrage-free prices (unless the claim is replicable).  In order to overcome the issue of non-uniqueness, alternative (equilibrium- or utility-based) approaches have been developed.  The present project focuses on the probabilistic process-theoretic aspects of the problems of utility-based pricing and hedging of contingent claims and income streams.  The aim of this project is twofold -- investigation of different notions of prices, hedging strategies, and relationships between them, in the settings that include stochastic utility (as a natural generalization of the utility function concept), and a construction of a utility-based pricing methodology for the contingent claims with embedded payment streams, in incomplete continuous-time models of financial markets.  A novel concept of a unified framework of admissibility is introduced for the accomplishment of the goals described above.  The unified framework permits consideration of the underlying utility maximization problems with different types of budget constraints, in one formulation.  On the technical level, the analysis relies on the existing and new techniques drawing on the general theory of semimartingales, stochastic optimal control, and convex analysis.  The approach provides a firm ground for an extension of the scope of applicability of the utility-based pricing techniques and for asymptotic expansions of the utility-based prices and hedging strategies."

Various mathematical and numerical issues will be studied, ranging from efficient local saddle point search and its robust numerical implementation to rigorous analysis and effective multiscale simulations of relevant dynamics and rare events. It is expected that the progress made during the project will have a broad impact on the community interested in the study of rare events. The project will also contribute to education and training as it will provide students valuable training ground and research experience in an interdisciplinary environment. Much effort will be devoted to promoting active engagement of student participation at all levels and integrating research findings into teaching and training."

Modern sensors are ubiquitous.  They measure signals of interest and digitally store or transmit large amounts of data.  Sophisticated computer algorithms then process the data, to recover the signals or to perform other tasks.  To allow accuratesignal recovery and optimize subsequent use, it is critical that the measurement and digitization processes be well designed.  It is also important thattheir theoretical properties, performance guarantees, and limitations be understood.Under practical constraints, wetheoretically investigate not only how measurements should be made, but also how they should be digitized (i.e., how they should be converted into bit-streams and subsequently compressed).  The Principal Investigator will focus onnonclassical signal models (including sparse vectors and low-rank matrices) whoseimportancehas been increasing in recent years due to their relevance to modern applications.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand the interplay between sampling of structured signals, digitization, and compression---all in the modern setting of signal reconstruction by non-linear algorithms. For example, it focuses on approximately sparse signals measured using compressed sensing techniques, low-rank matrices measured by randomly sampling their entries, and vectors whose phase-less measurements consist of the magnitudes of inner products with other vectors. In short, the Principal Investigator seeks sampling and quantization theorems for the digital world.  This requires developing and using tools from various areas of mathematics.  As the measurement models related to this research rely heavily on randomness, the project must develop and use methods from geometric functional analysis and nonasymptotic random matrix theory.  In the formulation of quantization methods for redundant measurements, connections with frame theory and the mathematical literature on noise-shaping quantization will be established and used.  The encoding (compression) algorithms proposed in this research use randomness extensively, and here the Principal Investigator anticipates connections with the randomized numerical linear algebra literature.  In analyzing new reconstruction algorithms, he will employ and develop methods from convex optimization and numerical analysis."

Since the number of particles in such models is very large, one would like to understand qualitative and quantitative properties of such systems through macroscopic, averaged characteristics. This is similar to the description of the huge number of gas atoms in a volume of gas through temperature and pressure. In order to identify macroscopic behavior of multi-particle systems, it is helpful to study the asymptotic behavior when the number of particles approaches infinity, with the hope that the limit will approximate properties observed in the systems with a large, but finite, number of particles. An example of an important phenomenon described by such macroscopic behavior is the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a large system of particles, which is a state of the matter of a dilute Bose gas at very low temperatures. Mathematical models developed to understand the phenomenon connect large quantum systems of interacting particles and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) that are derived from such systems in the limit of the number of particles going to infinity. The theory of nonlinear PDE is becoming an important mathematical mechanism in understanding such limits. This research project focuses on establishing further connections between complex systems of interacting particles and nonlinear PDE, including wave and dispersive equations that have been proposed as models for many basic wave phenomena, from Bose-Einstein condensation to formation of freak waves in an ocean, and kinetic equations that describe dynamics of a dilute gas and are at the core of applied analysis, probability, and statistical physics. The research activity contains an interdisciplinary approach with potential to bring ideas and techniques that turned out to be useful at the level of a nonlinear PDE to the analysis of many body systems, while incorporating diverse tools from mathematical analysis, probability, and statistical physics.  <br/><br/>With fundamental work on derivation of effective equations from quantum many body systems (e.g. nonlinear Schrodinger equation) and effective equations from classical many particle systems (e.g. Vlasov equation) a new channel of communication between mathematical physics and nonlinear PDE communities has opened, contributing to advances in both areas. The Principal Investigator will continue collaborative work on understanding emerging connections between dynamics of many body systems and nonlinear PDE. The PI further plans to expand this line of work to explore some aspects of a derivation of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation from many body particle systems. The PI will study analytical properties of the Boltzmann equation, a probabilistic model for a statistical flow of interacting particle systems with a nonlinear term involving a collision kernel that accounts for the rate of collisions or interactions. Given that the solutions of the Boltzmann equation are probability distributions, the study of the behavior of its polynomial and exponential moments is a fundamental analytical tool. In particular, since the equilibrium state for the Boltzmann equation is a Gaussian distribution, one expects that the solution would be controlled by bounds of exponential decay. Thus, bounds for exponential moments of the solution will be studied as well."

In this research project, the investigator develops a novel framework and an approach for analysis of various notions of prices and hedging strategies in general models of financial markets.  He aims to develop a utility-based pricing method for contingent claims with embedded payment streams. <br/><br/>In a complete financial market every contingent claim can be replicated by a portfolio of the traded securities and therefore admits a unique arbitrage-free price, which is an initial value of the replicating strategy.  In an incomplete market, to every contingent claim is associated an interval of arbitrage-free prices (unless the claim is replicable).  In order to overcome the issue of non-uniqueness, alternative (equilibrium- or utility-based) approaches have been developed.  The present project focuses on the probabilistic process-theoretic aspects of the problems of utility-based pricing and hedging of contingent claims and income streams.  The aim of this project is twofold -- investigation of different notions of prices, hedging strategies, and relationships between them, in the settings that include stochastic utility (as a natural generalization of the utility function concept), and a construction of a utility-based pricing methodology for the contingent claims with embedded payment streams, in incomplete continuous-time models of financial markets.  A novel concept of a unified framework of admissibility is introduced for the accomplishment of the goals described above.  The unified framework permits consideration of the underlying utility maximization problems with different types of budget constraints, in one formulation.  On the technical level, the analysis relies on the existing and new techniques drawing on the general theory of semimartingales, stochastic optimal control, and convex analysis.  The approach provides a firm ground for an extension of the scope of applicability of the utility-based pricing techniques and for asymptotic expansions of the utility-based prices and hedging strategies."

For example, one player's reward can be the other player's cost, known as a two-person zero-sum game.  At a formal level, one can similarly model so called robust optimization problems, where an active/intelligent player optimizes a reward under the worst case scenario (chosen by a passive/uninterested player, thought of as nature).  The project focuses on such zero-sum games and robust optimization problems where the existence of equilibria with pure strategies (which means that players do not introduce additional randomness) is not expected.  The modeling and existence of a value for zero-sum games with mixed strategies is studied.  It is expected that, despite a similar analytic representation, genuine zero-sum games and robust optimization problems behave differently in the presence of mixed strategies.  These mathematical models arise as descriptions of problems in which one must make decisions in the face of uncertainty; their solutions reveal how to choose among alternatives.  Applications occur in areas of engineering as well as finance and economics.  Another direction concerns a problem in Financial Economics: optimal investment strategies with high-watermark performance fees.  Students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The project focuses on the modeling and analysis of games without Isaacs conditions.  In a genuine zero-sum game with two active players, modeling of mixed strategies is non-trivial.  One way is to allow for actions (including mixing) to be changed over discrete time grids and then attempt to find a value for the game.  It appears that the cases when both players are restricted or not to the same time grid lead to different results.  For a robust optimization problem (where the uninterested player chooses open-loop controls), allowing the only intelligent player to randomize may lead to a better value function.  Special attention is given to the dynamic programming analysis using probabilistic modifications of Perron's method.  A second topic of the project studies a general two-dimensional reflected diffusion model of optimal investment with performance fees.  The feedback representation of the optimal control plays a prominent role.  Students are included in the work of the project."

Optimal transport is the study of exactly how to do this so that the cost of transportation is the smallest it can be. This is a very broad field with many applications, from the planning of urban transportation networks to molecular transport. The present project considers several important generalizations of the classical optimal transport problem which have not been previously studied. For example, a natural question to consider is what happens if there are two or more entities transporting the same initial mass to another location, each having its own costs to minimize. This is the ""game theoretic"" version of the optimal transport problem. Another problem deals with time-dependent transportation costs. This considers various cases when moving objects is more or less expensive depending on the time of movement. Overtime payments or transport in congested periods fall into this category. Transport problems in which one seeks to minimize the worst possible costs (instead of some average cost) are also important in applications and are considered here. Since optimal transport arises in many economic, biological, engineering, and other scientific areas, the mathematical theory developed for the problems considered in this project could have a significant practical impact. In addition, the project will study several new mathematical models arising in image processing and in understanding the motion of frontal boundaries due to flame or plasma propagation.<br/><br/>The relaxed version of the optimal transport problem involves finding a measure, called a ""transport plan,"" that minimizes the integral of a given cost density, subject to the constraint that the transport plan has given marginals. This is a one-player transport problem. Several generalizations of this much studied problem will be considered in this project. For example, if there are two players, each with their own cost density and each choosing their own transport plan, then they are coupled through the cost densities and, more importantly, through the given marginals. Another generalization of the original problem is to consider cost densities that depend on time. When that happens, the transport plan and map will also depend on time. Yet another line of investigation is driven by issues in the emerging area of L-infinity optimal transport, where the cost to be minimized is represented as the essential supremum of a cost function rather than the integral of a cost density. Optimal transport differential equations for the transport maps in the game model should lead to generalized Monge-Ampere systems. Dynamic programming of the time-dependent and perhaps the game-theoretic transport problem should lead to Hamilton-Jacobi equations in measure spaces. Existence of a generalized Nash equilibrium in the non-zero-sum case will be established. Finally, several PDE models arising in the study of quasiconvex functions and in the theory of stochastic differential games will be analyzed.  The techniques used to tackle the problems proposed in this project will involve nonlinear functional analysis, game theory, and nonlinear partial differential equations arising from dynamic programming, as well as the theory of viscosity solutions for first and second order partial differential equations and modern methods in the calculus of variations."

The theory for complete markets has been worked out reasonably well, but the equilibrium of incomplete markets is open.  In the second, he examines stochastic control problems that arise in considering how to make optimal investments with a random endowment.  Formation of financial markets is a complex process, but ultimately reliant on fundamental economic principles.  This reliance is what makes it amenable to mathematical analysis and quantitative study.  The benefits of better understanding of how real financial markets come to exist, and how their salient features emerge from the basic building blocks, are multiple.  They range from enhancing our ability to regulate both existing and nascent markets to building tools for prevention of future financial instabilities and crises in the US and worldwide.  Graduate students are included in the project.<br/><br/>The investigator and his students study two separate, but related, clusters of problems in mathematical finance and stochastic-control theory.  The first one aims to elucidate the rational agents' optimal response to diverse market structures and the formation of incomplete financial markets.  In addition to the classical, convex- and functional-analytic tools, the investigator's approach rests on stochastic analysis and the theory of backward stochastic differential equations, as well as their relationship with systems of partial differential equations, touching upon topics in Riemannian geometry and non-cooperative game theory.  The second research focus -- centered around a novel class of stochastic control problems termed ""weakly constrained"" -- is modeled after one of the fundamental questions in mathematical finance, namely the optimal investment problem with a random endowment.

These systems share the remarkable feature of self-organization on scales in space and time far greater than those of the individual particles, translating to functionality across many scales.  These diverse active particle-fluid systems have been previously modeled.

A common mathematical structure reveals how these systems achieve their functional properties, informs which physical and chemical features allow the most efficient steering and optimization of the system toward desired properties, allows for a common computational platform, and allows one to incorporate additional degrees of freedom or perturb existing particle and fluid properties and predict their consequences.

The two classes of problems considered are the study of boundary conditions for predictions made in a limited domain, and the study of moist convection, which is related to the understanding of the behavior of clouds.  It is generally considered that our limited understanding of the physics of clouds is a major cause of uncertainty in current weather and climate predictions.  Developing methods that improve weather predictions and climate modeling is an objective of important human, societal, and economical interest.  The training of graduate students and postdoctoral students at the interface of mathematics, geophysical and industrial fluid mechanics, and scientific computing is another broader impact of the project. <br/><br/>A major problem in developing computational models of geophysical flows, when the flows extend over a large area but the region of particular interest is smaller, is to develop suitable boundary conditions for limited-area models when the physics does not provide natural boundary conditions.  This old problem, already mentioned by von Neumann and Charney, is expected to become very significant.  Indeed, when new computers will allow the use of fine spatial resolutions, it is predicted that inappropriate boundary conditions will introduce spurious modes.  The problem arises also in other contemporary developments like the use of multilevel numerical methods or modeling.

On the theoretical side, the tools of convex analysis and variational inequalities are used to address questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions for the equations of the humid atmosphere with saturation, which are nonlinear discontinuous partial differential equations (PDEs) not directly connected to any existing PDE theory.  On the modeling side, using again tools of convex analysis, he models the equations of the humid atmosphere corresponding to water clouds below freezing levels by considering a more refined description of the micro physics at saturation, which would introduce additional state parameters.  On the computational side, he studies numerically the superparameterization of the very complex convection phenomena occurring near the equator in the presence of topography, using finite volumes and multilevel methods.   The importance of these phenomena, which involve tropical rains and affect the climate far into the mid-latitude regions, is well known.

The need for analyzing and modeling data taken from scattered, irregularly placed sites arises frequently in diverse fields: computer-aided design graphics, data mining, medical imaging, learning networks, and geoscience, in addition to many other areas.  For example, weather prediction or climate modeling is based on geophysical data collected at scattered sites, by sensors on satellites, ground stations, or stations at sea.  Carrying out such tasks presents difficulties for traditional methods, which are based on collecting data at uniformly placed sites or which require constructing ""meshes""---think of a wire fence---that must be carefully tailored to deal with the data sites involved.  Newer methods, so-called ""kernel methods"", do not require such meshes and can handle scattered data.  In addition to analyzing and modeling such data, these methods can solve numerically the equations governing, say, atmospheric flow.  This project will further the development of kernel methods, making them easy to use, faster, less expensive to implement, and capable of handling data from a hundred thousand or more sites.  It will provide support for graduate students, who will be trained in both the theoretical and the applied aspects of using and developing these methods.<br/><br/>The main object of this project is to develop new methods and tools for attacking the analysis and synthesis of scattered data (i.e., data collected from non-uniformly distributed sites) by means of kernel methods and, in particular, for numerically solving partial differential equations and non-local diffusion problems in peridynamics, for example.  Efficiently dealing with such problems requires constructing local, stable bases, preconditioners, and other similar tools.  To address such problems, the PIs plan to use their recently discovered highly localized stable kernel-based bases to develop novel kernel-based meshless Galerkin methods.  The PIs plan to further develop the full potential of these recently discovered basis functions, and to investigate constructing such bases in situations where boundaries or data that is not quasi uniform occur."

On the one hand, focusing, concentration, or aggregation effects are typically produced by nonlinear mechanisms.  These effects are often counterbalanced by other processes that disperse, defocus, fragment, or spread things out in some way.  This proposal aims to develop several novel and useful mathematical tools for analyzing how such competing effects achieve dynamic balance.  The particular models of aggregation and dispersion to be studied arise specifically in studies of: animal ecology, crowd dynamics, shape matching, hydrodynamics, and mass transportation.  The mathematical lessons learned are expected to be fundamental, and contribute to a body of understanding that promises to be useful to researchers across a range of disciplines.  Further, the investigators plan to be substantially engaged in training and interacting with students and young researchers, at summer schools, lecture series, and disseminating results at conferences, workshops, and seminars.<br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on the study of dynamic behavior in four areas strongly motivated by applications and the theory of partial differential equations. The first area considers a fundamental coagulation-fragmentation model without detailed balance, coming from Niwa's scaling analysis of a large body of empirical data on fish school size in the mid-ocean. The second area will develop metrics and geodesics for crowd-configuration paths and related hydrodynamic problems for shape distances proposed by image analysts. The third area focuses on the long-time dynamics and gradient structure in a new model of nonlocal dispersion and nonlinear concentration, related to fixed-point equations for solitary wave profiles. The final area considers random sticky particle dynamics, seeking to build on recent advances in PDE theory that tie sticky particle dynamics to singular solutions of conservation laws, and on related progress for random shock clustering. Real-world applications include the fields of animal ecology, image analysis, fluid dynamics, and stochastic interacting particle systems."

For instance, in the transition from the JPEG standard to JPEG2000, the wavelet transform replaced the discrete cosine transform because it provided a sparser representation for images and because its performance degrades more gracefully when bandwidth is variable.

This research project aims to develop novel ideas and algorithms for the model reduction of such systems. The investigator will develop automatic learning algorithms that, by collecting a number of short simulations in parallel, output a much lower-dimensional model of the original system that yields faster simulations, with provable accuracy, in a much reduced number of variables. This will make the simulations less expensive, allowing one to perform more and longer simulations, and make the extraction of useful information from simulated data easier. He will apply these constructions to molecular dynamics simulations, expecting to significantly reduce the computational time needed to simulate small biomolecules.<br/><br/>Large data sets in high dimensional spaces appear in a wide variety of scientific fields and applications. The PI focuses here on data sets that originate from the simulation of high-dimensional stochastic systems that arise in a wide variety of applications (e.g. molecular dynamics), with the goal of producing a much lower dimensional stochastic system with similar statistical properties as the full system, at least at a certain time scale. This is possible for a wide variety of dynamical systems with separation of time scales when the structure of the forces acting on the system and the stochastic perturbations are such that the trajectories of the system accumulate, in state or phase space, around low-dimensional sets (at the appropriate time scale and accuracy). The approach only requires access to a simulator S for the original system that, given initial conditions and the shortest time scale of interest as inputs, produces as output a (stochastic) path of the system starting at that initial condition and stops at the specified time. A call to S is typically expensive, but after a small number of carefully designed calls that yield a relatively small number of short paths, the algorithm learns and outputs a low-dimensional representation of the system, that is, a low-dimensional stochastic system whose trajectories are (in a suitable statistical sense), at the requested time scale, close to those of the original system. This construction may be performed in an online setting, as new regions of state space are explored, and in a multiscale fashion, where the time scale at which the system is reduced varies. These techniques will be adaptive to the assumed low intrinsic dimension of the simulated data, the timescale of interest, and the accuracy, leading to a new generation of results and algorithms for learning and approximating high-dimensional stochastic systems. While the techniques to be developed are applicable to a large family of stochastic systems, the main application considered in this project is Molecular Dynamics (MD). These techniques are expected to dramatically speed up the exploration of the state space of these molecules and of MD simulations as a whole. At the same time, they are general enough that they are applicable to a wide variety of stochastic systems, and the framework sets the stage for a novel approach to automatic learning of dynamical systems that is amenable to further generalizations."

A typical two-phase transition is the solidification process of a liquid. A classical multi-phase transition arises from  evolutions of grains in a polycrystal where alignments of atoms in different grains do not match at grain boundaries. The growth of a solid polycrystal from a liquid involves  a two-phase transition between liquid and solid and a multi-phase transition among grains.

They have been investigated for hundreds of years, yet many of their most basic features remain poorly understood mathematically.  For instance, only very recently has significant progress been achieved in developing a rigorous existence theory for steady rotational water waves, that is, waves with vorticity in the bulk of the fluid.  These types of waves are ubiquitous in nature:  vorticity is generated by incoming currents, the wind blowing over the ocean, or the density stratification due to salinity.  A deeper understanding of the mathematics underlying these phenomena would have many scientific and practical applications.  For example, traveling waves in density-stratified water (internal waves) are a generic feature of coastal flows in the ocean; they are known to play a major role in driving the circulation of ocean.  Vorticity in air is likewise strongly connected to the process of wind generation of water waves, a topic of great importance to ocean and climate modeling as well as ocean engineering.  The investigator studies traveling waves in density-stratified water, traveling waves with localized vorticity, and the stability of several important classes of steady waves.  He also studies the question of whether stratified waves depend continuously on their density distribution.  This question has serious practical implications for how well layered-fluid models can reliably represent flows in the ocean. <br/><br/>     The specific goals of this project are to (i) expand the existence theory for steady stratified waves and rotational traveling waves; (ii) develop new tools for studying the qualitative properties of internal waves; and (iii) ascertain the stability/instability of several important classes of steady waves.  The investigators and colleagues improve on the current existence theory for large-amplitude internal waves by allowing for a general velocity profile in the far field.  Concurrently, they study the question of whether stratified waves depend continuously on their density distribution.  Confirmation or denial of this fact has serious practical implications:  if it is not true, then there is an unbridgeable gap between continuously stratified fluids and the layered-fluid systems that are commonly used to model them.  Conversely, if the dependence is smooth, then the modulus of continuity gives bounds on the error arising from the layered approximation.  The investigator studies traveling waves with localized vorticity.  In earlier work, he and collaborators proved the existence of classes of traveling wave with compactly supported vorticity (including point vortices and vortex patches), but completely unexplored is the intermediate regime where the vorticity is localized but not compact.  This important regime is attacked using techniques from bifurcation theory and semi-linear elliptic theory on unbounded domains.  Using newly developed tools for determining stability/instability of bound states for non-canonical Hamiltonian systems, they also study the orbital stability of traveling waves with point vortices.  Lastly, the problem of wind generation of water waves is considered.  This entails studying the stability of small-amplitude steady waves in a two-fluid Euler system, which sheds light on the role of the air-sea interface in the transfer of energy from wind to water."

Unfortunately, effective methods for testing complicated materials for structural imperfections or for identifying unknown targets with little a priori information are still in a state of infancy. In this NSF-funded project, the PI and her graduate students will develop entirely new techniques in inverse scattering theory to obtain reliable target signatures or usable information about objects being examined in computationally efficient ways. The goal is to minimize dependence on a priori information describing the physics and/or geometry of unknown targets. This study will combine practical applications with the mathematical elegance of new imaging techniques that have recently led to the establishment of a new field in mathematics called ""qualitative methods.""<br/><br/>Until not long ago, essentially all existing algorithms for target identification in inverse scattering theory were based on either a weak scattering approximation or on the use of nonlinear optimization techniques. Alternative methods for imaging have been developed to avoid incorrect model assumptions inherent in weak scattering approximations and the requirement of a priori information on the topological and physical properties of the unknown object. Such methods come under the general title of qualitative methods in inverse scattering theory, otherwise referred to as non-iterative methods. Roughly speaking, these methods explore the properties of a linear compact operator determined by the scattering data, which encodes nonlinear information about the scattering object and provides easily implementable reconstruction algorithms. Inherent to the methods appears a new eigenvalue problem, known as the transmission eigenvalue problem. The practical importance of transmission eigenvalues is that they can be determined from the measured scattering data and they carry information about the material properties of the scatterer. This proposal concerns broadening the applicability of the qualitative approach for solving inverse scattering problems with particular emphasis on inhomogeneous media. Of main concern are potential applications to nondestructive testing and target identification. The investigation will take two directions: 1) develop qualitative inversion approaches for inhomogeneous media containing small parameter features that are not in the Born approximation regime, 2) reduce the amount of spatial data needed for the qualitative approach by using only quasi-backscattering and time domain data. To accomplish the above objectives, the investigator and her graduate students will need to investigate new theoretical questions related to the (non-selfadjoint and non-linear) transmission eigenvalue problems that arise in the investigation of the above two parts."

On the application side, this is due to the recent financial crisis where overconfidence in models played an important role.  On the mathematical side, the reason is that an abundance of interesting connections to other areas have emerged; in particular, optimal transport, stochastic analysis, nonlinear partial differential equations, Skorokhod embeddings, nonlinear expectations, decision theory, and quasi-sure analysis.  In this project, the investigator studies how model uncertainty influences the fundamental tasks of pricing, hedging and investment in financial markets.  Students are included in the work of the project. <br/><br/>     The first part of this project is concerned with the pricing and hedging of financial derivatives under model uncertainty.  If both the underlying security and liquid options are used as hedging instruments, the superreplication principle yields sharp and robust bounds for derivatives prices that are consistent with the market data, without making excessively strong assumptions about model dynamics.  Moreover, this approach yields a robust hedging strategy to manage the associated risk.  In a mild idealization where a continuum of call options can be traded, superreplication is intimately linked to a Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem, namely, a transport between the marginal laws of the security.  The no-arbitrage principle of finance imposes a probabilistic structure on this transport, which leads to the so-called martingale optimal transport problem that is studied vigorously in this project.  The investigation leads to the computation of worst-case scenarios and hedging strategies, and is also of great interest to probability theory and analysis.  A second part of the project is dedicated to understanding the impact of model uncertainty on the optimal portfolio choice for an investor such as a retirement fund.  A third part, again related to the pricing of derivatives, studies a problem of financial engineering: How does one algorithmically construct market models that are consistent with quoted option prices as observed in financial markets?  More precisely, the project shows how to build a risk-neutral model that is calibrated to a given set of liquidly traded instruments, not necessarily of plain vanilla type.

The investigators develop analytical and computational tools to study the long-term behavior of the fundamental governing equations of the atmosphere and climate.  A main focus is to connect recently developed techniques of data assimilation with the theory of statistical solutions of these equations.  This in turn facilitates the incorporation of vast amounts of weather/climate data, collected over a long period of time, into mathematical models of weather and climate, potentially leading to improved statistical prediction.  Graduate students are engaged in the work of the project. <br/><br/>The investigators study several aspects of turbulent flows, including the time of existence of smooth solutions, statistical properties, and the long-term dynamics on the strong or weak global attractor, in a new class of functional spaces that is contained in all Sobolev classes.  A key feature of this class is that the nonlinear evolution equation satisfies a differential inequality that is almost linear.  This functional class has the property that it can absorb derivatives, which has the effect of making the nonlinear term milder, with potential applications to a wide class of nonlinear evolution equations.  For certain types of initial data, this yields a better existence time for the Navier-Stokes equations than some well-known Sobolev functional classes. This new class of functional spaces is employed to study the finite-dimensional properties of statistical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, via the determining modes, nodes, and determining forms.  Furthermore, the investigators develop data assimilation techniques for statistical solutions of hydrodynamic equations.  Statistical solutions are directly related to the average physical quantities with which engineers are concerned.  They provide a bridge from the time average of physical observables such as energy, enstrophy, and heat transfer to ensemble measures on the phase space.  The techniques developed in this project should have immediate engineering and scientific applications."

A major aim is to better understand sources of climate variability and the extent of their influences.  The work involves new mathematical theory and techniques for dynamic transitions between states of a system described by a set of partial differential equations, and for memory effects -- differences in any particular state's features that depend on the chain of states through which the system arrives at that state.  The system may be deterministic or stochastic.  The mathematical issues are motivated by climate problems, and in turn the theory and the techniques are applied to the understanding of fundamental issues in climate dynamics and prediction.  This project leads to improved predictions and new insights into weather, climate, and environmental phenomena of central importance to our economy.  One such phenomenon to be studied in this project is the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is the dominant mode of inter-annual climate variability, and which has global impacts on temperature, precipitation, tropical cyclones, human health, and even conflict.  The project involves scientists as well as graduate students from the related scientific disciplines.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project. <br/><br/>     The principal investigator and his collaborators work on dynamic transition theory for both deterministic partial differential equations and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), and on developing theory and methods to establish effective non-Markovian reduced models for SPDEs.  The goal is to quantify the sensitivity and dynamic transitions associated with typical sources of climate low frequency variability.  Major goals include quantifying the role played by the memory effects, and identifying the key nonlinear interactions between low and high modes and the memory effects caused by noise.  A few typical sources of climate variability that will be studied include ENSO, tropical convections, and the thermohaline circulations.  Their variability, independently and interactively, may play a significant role in climate changes, past and future.  The project involves specific collaborations with active atmosphere/ocean scientists in different institutions, and graduate students are included in the project work as well."

While in most engineering applications robust methods have a long history, the standard approach in mathematical finance is still to describe all underlying uncertainty with a single probability measure.  However, in many real-life situations it is not possible to determine the precise probabilities of future events, and financial decision rules that are sensitive to particular assumptions can lead to disastrous outcomes if reality does not exactly unfold as predicted by the model.  The goal of this project is to develop methods of financial decision-making that take into account extreme events and are robust with respect to model misspecification.  The outcomes are expected to lead to robust approaches to investing, asset pricing, hedging, and risk management.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project. <br/><br/>The project aims to create robust methods that can be used to address relevant problems in mathematical finance.  Discrete-time as well as continuous-time models are studied.

Transport phenomena are ubiquitous in nature, whether at the large scale of our macroscopic world or at the very small scale of microscopic particles. They describe interactions and exchanges between systems, and how quantities of interest are transported from one location to another. This project focuses on two important instances of these phenomena: the transport of light or sound waves in complex environments, and the transport of particles in devices at the nanometer scale. These two topics have many applications in various fundamental domains such as telecommunications, non-destructive testing, medical imaging, and nanoelectronics. Very often, transport phenomena are multiscale, in the sense that the underlying physics involves various spatial or temporal scales of very different orders of magnitude. As a consequence, the description and the computer simulation of transport processes are extremely difficult, and this is where mathematical analysis plays a central role. By identifying a set of important parameters, the original models can be simplified into reduced models, more amenable to analysis and computations. This notion of asymptotic analysis is the common thread of the two topics of the project. The project will advance new mathematical models and techniques, as well as new computational methods for transport phenomena in complex media and in quantum systems. The research will impact, in particular, the field of target or defect localization in disordered media, as well as the modeling of semiconductors. The project integrates research with an educational plan that is designed to reach various generations, from high school to doctoral students.<br/><br/>This project addresses two topics related to transport phenomena. The first one concerns quantum hydrodynamical transport models for nanodevices, which offer a reduced yet accurate macroscopic description of the dynamics at the quantum scale.  The main objectives are to build a complete mathematical theory for recent formal models, to develop numerical methods for their simulations, and to validate the models for future applications. A key ingredient in the theory is the ""quantum moment problem,"" which is a generalization to density operators of the classical moment problem for measures. The second topic concerns inverse problems in random media. The main goal is to develop transformative transport-based methods for imaging in strongly diffusive environments for which no efficient techniques are available as of today. Such methods are based upon understanding the transfer of information from the microscopic scale to the macroscopic scale. The stress will be put on random media with long-range correlations, such as the turbulent atmosphere, which offer an ultimate benchmark for the methods proposed in the project. The problem of fast intensity imaging algorithms using optimization techniques will also be addressed."

The most commonly encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum circuit model, requires challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the hardware to be of practical value, due to local interactions of the system with the surrounding environment. The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. This research project studies mathematically the application of topological phases of matter to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit in quantum computation.<br/><br/>In this project the investigators study mathematical models for topological phases, focusing on their applications to topological quantum computation.  Topological phases of matter in two spatial dimensions are well-described in the framework of modular categories, but relatively little is known in three spatial dimensions.  A large part of this project is devoted to developing appropriate mathematical models in three spatial dimensions and analyzing the corresponding computational paradigms.  Specifically, the project will study (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories and representations of the loop braid group, and symmetry enriched topological order and gauging symmetry.  In addition, because locality and universality are two desirable properties for quantum computation that are manifested in the representations of the braid group, this project also aims to formulate conjectures characterizing when these properties hold and to verify and adapt these conjectures where appropriate to better characterize physical and computational aspects.  To compare the computational power of topological quantum computers to that of classical computers, the project investigates the complexity of the most natural computation in this setting: topological invariants."

Such a decomposition is crucial for the understanding of the observed data in many cases, especially in atmosphere and  ocean fluid dynamics, where we are often presented with a complex jigsaw puzzle of waves and vortices far beyond the threshold of our contemporary simulation and observation tools.  For example, this is highly relevant for extracting the maximum value out of expensive measurements obtained by aircraft, ships, and satellite-based remote sensing.  The method plays fundamentally into our understanding of difficult fluid-mechanical processes that are highly relevant for climate dynamics.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The new method is generally applicable to any fluid mechanical problem that involves stable stratification and/or Coriolis forces due to background rotation.  Preliminary results with the new technique have been promising, but the technique is limited by a number of restrictive assumptions that had to be made to derive it cleanly.  These include assumptions about horizontal isotropy and three-dimensional spatial homogeneity of the data as well as an assumed lack of statistical correlations between waves and vortices.  The present project seeks to remove these restrictions, to make the new technique much more broadly applicable.

The mathematics linking these applications concerns the modeling of continuous processes with nonlinear equations, and the study of wave-like solutions of the equations.

Complex systems with a large number of parameters and agents are ubiquitous -- think, for example, of the traffic on a network of highways or of bio-chemical systems, which involve many types of molecules and many chemical reactions.  For such systems, the issue of sensitivity analysis presents special challenges: sensitivity analysis consists in understanding the effects of parameters on the future behavior of the system -- for example, how the closure of one lane on a busy highway influences the traffic, possibly many miles away and several hours later.  Understanding these effects is at the heart of the field of predictive modeling and poses formidable challenges, which often exceed the capabilities of modern computers.  The Principal Investigators will develop tools, both conceptual and computational, to tackle such issues by using, in a complementary fashion, techniques from different fields of science.  This includes methods from information theory (which quantifies how information is lost in physical processes), from statistical mechanics (which allows one to understand the global behavior of very large systems), and from numerical analysis (which is the science that allows one to simulate and reproduce the behavior of complex systems on a computer).<br/><br/>Understanding non-equilibrium systems driven by external forces, boundary effects, and multi-physics presents numerous mathematical and computational challenges, especially if the system is large and involves many parameters.  A paradigmatic example is a bio-chemical reaction network, which often involves multiple time scales, feedback loops, hundreds of species, and hundreds of parameters.  At the center of this project is the development of mathematical and numerical tools for the analysis and simulation of such non-equilibrium high-dimensional stochastic systems.  The research blends together concepts from information theory, statistical mechanics, numerical analysis, and probability theory in order to develop novel algorithms, as well as novel tools to assess existing algorithms for complex systems.  The issue of sensitivity analysis plays a central role in the work.  One of the novelties here is the systematic use and development of information-theoretic tools for the analysis and uncertainty quantification of stochastic systems, with a strong emphasis on the long-time behavior of the systems.  Concepts such as the relative entropy and the Fisher information matrix, especially applied to the time histories of the system, are particularly well suited.  Another important feature of the project concerns the fact that non-equilibrium systems do not respect invariance under time reversal.  Measuring quantitatively this symmetry breaking is one the main themes in modern non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and the Principal Investigators will use concepts developed in this project to create efficient algorithms to do this for complex systems.  Finally, the research team will investigate the role of memory or delay effects, which are unavoidable in complex systems with multiple spatial or temporal scales."

Although not as familiar as free-surface waves, internal waves in fact are ubiquitous in oceans, lakes, and the atmosphere.  In these natural settings, stratification is caused by temperature variations as well as changes in salinity (in oceans) and pressure (in the atmosphere).  Internal wave motion is inherently anisotropic because gravity provides a preferred direction.  As a result, energy is transported in the form of wave beams, which are the analogues of the familiar circular wave fronts in isotropic media.  Internal wave beams are of great geophysical interest because they form the backbone of the oceanic internal tide; moreover, in the atmosphere, they frequently arise due to thunderstorms.  In contrast to most prior studies, which assume strictly two-dimensional disturbances, this project is concerned with internal wave beams featuring three-dimensional variations, as expected in the field.  Motivation comes from recent findings, by the investigator's group and others, that suggest that the propagation of internal wave beams in three dimensions differs fundamentally from its two-dimensional counterpart.  Apart from making basic contributions to applied mathematics, this project is expected to also shed light on the role of the oceanic internal tide in momentum deposition, material transport, and deep-ocean mixing.  These processes affect climate dynamics, pollutant dispersal, and nutrient cycles.

This conference will bring together experts in both the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and cutting edge applications, which are dramatically impacted by the study of waves and spectral theory in nonlinear science. The models to be discussed at the conference have applications to the studies of graphene, nonlinear optics, neuroscience, large quantum systems, and the formation of topological states.   Such states are ideal for the transfer or storage of energy or information. Another important set of mathematical problems concerns the issues for design of metamaterials. Metamaterials are composites that include nano-size microstructures. In some regimes these materials exhibit properties not achievable in naturally occurring materials. For example, it is possible to manufacture a metamaterial with negative index or reflection that allows one to ""cloak"" objects, making them invisible.  <br/><br/>The conference will focus on the issues of spectral theory and nonlinear dynamics that are instrumental for understanding the behavior of nonlinear bound states interacting with various types of potentials.

Some salient features of these diverse phenomena can be described by mathematical models based on reaction-advection-diffusion equations that have been used extensively to investigate fundamental and ubiquitous phenomena in several areas of biology, and more recently in the social sciences.  While these models are simplified versions of reality, their mathematical analysis has contributed to the understanding of many important phenomena. At the same time, the underlying equations can be extremely interesting and challenging from the mathematical point of view as their solutions can exhibit rich behaviors, e.g., pattern formation and traveling wave structures. The behavior of solutions reflects critical features of the system that mathematics models and have clear and convincing parallels with the evolution of real-world systems. However, there is still a large gap between real world systems and their more tractable mathematical models.  One of the goals of this project is bridging this gap through the use of accumulated concrete data and the corresponding calibration and modification of mathematical models.  Of particular importance is the analysis of systems which include heterogeneous environments, the understanding of the effects that non-local dispersal has on the behavior of the solutions, and the validation of these models with real-world data.  Efforts will be focused on four reaction-advection-diffusion systems where the heterogeneities are due to: climate change in an ecological context, non-local and asymmetrical spread of information in the context of riots, income heterogeneities in the context of social segregation, and environment heterogeneities due to specific concentrated inputs.  The primary goal of the project is to understand how heterogeneous environments and non-local dispersal impact solution patterns in both a general class of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations as well in specific ecological and social contexts.  Throughout this project the investigators will maintain and foster contacts with social scientists in order to conduct the much needed discourse between the mathematical theory and the applications.     <br/><br/>This project will focus on the development of an extensive theory for reaction-advection-diffusion systems in heterogeneous environments with applications in ecology and sociology.  In particular, the objective of this research is three-fold: to expand the current mathematical theory for local and non-local reaction-advection-diffusion systems in heterogeneous environments, to gain insight into various (ecological, sociological, and biological) complex systems by modeling them using these types of systems, and to  take an initial step toward bridging the gap between basic mathematical models and the complex real-world systems they aim to describe by incorporating the use of data. From the qualitative perspective, this work will be mainly concerned with exploring the effects that various dispersal mechanism have on the propagation (and lack thereof) of a solution in a heterogeneous environment: for example, determining the spreading speed, the existence of traveling wave solutions, pulsating fronts, traveling pulses, or generalized fronts in heterogeneous systems.  Additionally, the fundamental issues of the global well-posedness of solutions to these systems, intermediate and long-term asymptotics, and existence and uniqueness of non-trivial steady-state solutions will be rigorously analyzed."

An important class of these waves, that of nearly solitary, coherent large amplitude structures, has recently been given renewed attention with the realization, thanks to instrumentation improvements and increased human activity, that such waves are ubiquitous in a wide range of geophysical settings and are easily observed in both field and laboratory experiments. In the former case, one of the main tools for collecting data over scales beyond what in-situ sensors can reasonably afford is the satellite observation of the surface expression of internal waves, seen as bands of choppy waters moving in otherwise calm seas. The in-depth investigation of the mechanisms responsible for this surface-internal wave interaction, as well as some of the ramifications in the mathematical framework for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of this class of wave propagations, is the main thrust of this research project. With accurate models, it becomes feasible to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing solely from surface observations the internal state of motion of the ocean due to large solitary waves. When combined with satellite and remote sensing capabilities, this would allow a global mapping of such wave motion, especially for the large swaths of world ocean, such as the South China and Andaman Seas, where these large waves are frequently observed and affect human interests such as oil-drilling and navigation. <br/><br/>The work is organized around three mutually overlapping efforts that target outstanding issues in this class: (i) the derivation of asymptotic models for the coupled dynamics of free surface/large amplitude internal waves, with the goal of maintaining sufficient quantitative fidelity with respect to parent systems such as stratified Euler equations, while maintaining accessibility to analysis and numerical tools for large-scale simulations; (ii) the rigorous assessment of validity of these models (consistency, existence time scales and closeness), with particular attention to stability issues coupled with surface tension, and (iii) the implementation of the first experimental investigations in a controlled lab environment of coupled surface/internal wave dynamics, with further attention to transport and mixing of tracers. Achieving these goals relies on the application as well as the implementation of novel mathematical techniques: in (i) new asymptotic tools removing the classical weak nonlinearity assumption would have to be refined beyond those obtained in recent advancements in this direction; for (ii) the corresponding advances in the free surface formulation of the classical water wave problem have to be adapted to the internal stratified fluid dynamics, with the development of analytical estimates for surface dynamics under surface tension and internal-wave induced currents; in (iii), the combined use of surface wave generators and surfactants is implemented to explore the relevant physical parameters such as surface group velocity and internal wave phase speed, including regimes with capillary/gravity wave interactions, to validate and test the theoretical and numerical advances in coupled surface-internal dynamics with controlled experiments."

Examples include essentially everything that is squeezed from a tube or spread with a knife, including common household substances such as cosmetics, shampoo, and ketchup, as well as a wide array of industrial compounds. The study of these fluids is important, for instance, in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries as well as for biological applications. For many such fluids the yield stress is not fixed, but depends on the flow history. A familiar example is the common experience that ketchup will flow more readily for a second helping than it did the first time. This type of complex yield stress behavior is referred to as ""thixotropic."" There are several approaches to modeling thixotropic fluids. This project follows up on work of the investigator that showed that the essential features of thixotropic behavior can be obtained by considering the limit of certain models of viscoelastic fluids when a relaxation time becomes very long. This kind of model naturally opens up the possibility of applying mathematical methods of asymptotic analysis, which rely on the presence of a small parameter. The investigator explores the systematic application of these methods to study the behavior of thixotropic yield stress fluids. The second part of the project concerns questions of controllability, that is, whether a system can be driven from a given class of input states to a desired state by a control mechanism. This is a natural engineering question that, from a mathematical point of view, poses fundamental and challenging problems in the theory of partial differential equations. The investigator studies this issue for the equations modeling compressible flow and for other equations of a similar mathematical structure that arise in modeling viscoelastic fluids. A question closely related to controllability issues is that of backward uniqueness. Do we change the future state of a system by altering its present state or is the future partly independent of the present? For systems given by partial differential equations, it is not always possible to ""invent the future"" in this sense. The investigator has developed a technique that can be used to prove backward uniqueness for certain systems of partial differential equations. A graduate student and a postdoctoral student are included in the project. <br/><br/>The project addresses the following areas: Thixotropic yield stress behavior arises as a limit of viscoelastic flow when a relaxation time is large. This large relaxation time naturally provides a small parameter for asymptotic analysis. The investigator has recently analyzed the distinct dynamics regimes of fast, slow and yielded dynamics that arise in this limit. In spatially inhomogeneous flows, these regimes coexist in spatial regions separated by sharp boundaries. Here he analyzes the development of these boundaries as functions of time. The second topic concerns questions of controllability. The equations of compressible flow involve the coupling of a transport equation and a parabolic equation. The investigator studies the controllability of this system and other mathematically similar problems. Prior results for linearized problems are extended to the nonlinear situation. The analysis is based on Carleman estimates for the parabolic part and the method of characteristics for the transport equation, along with a suitable splitting method that allows the construction of controls in an iterative fashion. The design of this splitting method is the principal challenge. The problem of backward uniqueness for partial differential equations is closely related to questions of controllability. The investigator has developed a method of establishing backward uniqueness that is based on the Phragmen-Lindeloef theorem. This method can be applied to one-dimensional linearized compressible flow and to the one-dimensional damped wave equation. The investigator aims to extend the technique to problems in higher space dimensions. The essential ingredient in the analysis is the derivation of certain resolvent estimates, which are based on a rigorous application of matched asymptotics."

Examples of such systems include bands of mussels in tidal flats, bacterial aggregation patterns, and hexagonal or stripe patterns in convection problems.  Spatial patterns often arise due to the instability of a simpler state.  For example, in ecological or chemical applications an equilibrium state may be destabilized due to the introduction of a previously absent species.  Initial states lying near this equilibrium state will evolve towards a new profile and one would like to predict what this new state will be.  For spatially extended problems, this process involves the formation of moving interfaces, known as invasion fronts, that move at a fixed speed and serve to transition the unstable state to some other configuration.  The objective is to uncover the properties of a nonlinear system that lead to selection of a particular invasion front and consequently the patterned state that is created by that front.  Transitions from unstable to stable states occur in many applied contexts and this research will help inform scientists to formulate predictions regarding, or even control over, the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns in those systems.  The work has potential application via the role of reaction-diffusion equations in modeling the generation of small scale structures in nanotechnology and materials science.<br/> <br/>The mathematical focus of the project is the study of pattern formation in systems of reaction-diffusion equations in which periodic structures are created by invasion fronts.   Several specific systems of parabolic partial differential equations will be considered with the aim of extracting general principles mediating wavespeed selection.  The project areas include the study of competition amongst patterns in reaction-diffusion-advection equations arising in ecological and chemical applications, coarsening modes in biological aggregation models of Keller-Segel type, and the existence of fronts in coupled amplitude equations describing the emergence of and competition between patterned states near a supercritical Turing bifurcation.  The project will require a variety of tools including linear analysis, geometric singular perturbation theory, blow-up techniques, and comparison principles. There are several innate challenges in regards to describing pattern-forming fronts in systems of equations that will require extensions of analytical techniques.  For example, systems of equations can support invasion fronts wherein different components invade at different speeds for which no single fixed frame can capture the relevant dynamics."

The modeling approach that divides the population into three groups (susceptibles, infected, and removed--the so-called SIR model) and its various generalizations has been used historically as an important tool in deciding whether epidemics grow or dissipate.  The investigators expand the traditional model of an SIR stochastic epidemic on a graph with a given degree distribution,  in order to account for the Ebola-specific features.  These include, among others, incorporating a class of individuals at high risk of infection (e.g., health workers), and incorporating a dynamic network structure that reflects how contacts with different segments of the population change over the course of infection within host.<br/><br/>The new mathematical model describing the way in which Ebola spreads through a network of human contacts, both in rural and urban areas as well as across countries and continents, will be informed by the actual  field data from   various parts of the world including Africa and the United States.

As such, dispersive partial differential equations can describe phenomena in optics, fluids, or plasmas, to name just a few areas of application.  To determine the validity of a particular equation as a model for a given phenomenon, it can be helpful to determine whether the equation has a solution, and if it does, how this solution depends upon the physical parameters.  For certain nonlinear Schrodinger equations, and for certain equations which can be used as models for waves in water, the principal investigator will study when these equations either lack solutions, or have solutions which depend discontinuously upon the data.  This will indicate that these particular models have only limited validity for applications.  As another part of the project, for some other families of dispersive partial differential equations, the principal investigator will determine when the equations either do or do not possess solutions with certain special forms.  Understanding such solutions, such as waves of permanent form or time-periodic waves, can lead to a deeper understanding of the behavior of the corresponding physical phenomena over long intervals of time.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will study well-posedness and ill-posedness for quasilinear Schrodinger equations and for truncated series water wave models.  For quasilinear Schrodinger equations, well-posedness theorems have been proved under certain non-degeneracy hypotheses; in this work, ill-posedness will be studied when the non-degeneracy condition is violated.  For truncated series models of water waves, the relationship between well-posedness/ill-posedness and the strength of dispersion will be investigated using complex variable methods and tools from paradifferential calculus.  For nonlinear Schrodinger equations and for general families of nonlinear dispersive equations, the principal investigator will use small divisor estimates, normal forms, and dispersive smoothing estimates to demonstrate the non-existence of small-amplitude spatially periodic, time-periodic waves in certain parameter regimes.  Also, existence of time-periodic, spatially-periodic waves for dispersive equations with high-derivative nonlinearities (especially for systems related to capillary waves in fluids) will be studied, using small divisor methods and techniques of Fourier analysis."

Problems of this kind arise, for example, in the design of materials for use in non-destructive testing and shock absorption. In the settings where the channel's bottom is flat or the solid is homogeneous, there are well-developed quantitative and qualitative theories which are both mathematically rigorous and are commonly used in applications. However, the presence of heterogeneity (due to the channel bottom topography or inclusions/defects in the material) leads to unexpected physical phenomena (for example, pulses that appear ""jagged"") that this research will help to elucidate and predict. <br/><br/>The key mathematical tool for the investigation is to adapt the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) approximation in a rigorous way so that it applies to heterogeneous problems. Doing so requires applying methods from elliptic homogenization theory to the study of nonlinear dispersive systems. This sort of approximation suggests that there are solutions to the heterogeneous systems which are, roughly speaking, solitary waves. However, a typical KdV approximation result is only valid on a time interval which, while long, is of finite duration. As such the question of whether or not the approximated system admits a genuine global in time counterpart to the solitary wave is left unresolved. The KdV approximation will serve as a point of departure for investigations into the very difficult question of the existence of ""generalized traveling waves"" for heterogeneous systems. In the presence of spatially periodic coefficients, classical traveling waves, which are static in a moving reference frame, are highly unlikely to exist. What one expects instead are shift-periodic solutions, i.e. solutions which, in an appropriate moving frame, are time periodic. An additional complication is the spatial heterogeneity that unexpectedly enters the problem as a singular perturbation. The main consequence of this is that the waves are not expected to converge to zero at spatial infinity but instead approach extremely small amplitude spatially periodic solutions. Such waves have infinite total energy, thus complicating the structure of long time asymptotics enormously. In particular this indicates that, while truly localized finite energy traveling waves may not exist, their metastable analogs may."

Miniaturization will reach its ultimate limit when the size of individual components in electronic devices approaches the size of a single atom. Unless we succeed in implementing a new paradigm of computation, called Quantum Computation, the growth in computational efficiency, which is often referred to as Moore's Law, will come to an end. One of the most promising research directions to implement the ideas of Quantum Computation is the development of topological materials. Topological materials have the capacity to store quantum information, which under ordinary conditions is subject to fast deterioration due to a process called decoherence. In this project the PI and his collaborators will study mathematical models of topological materials. The main goal is to better understand the factors that determine the robustness of a quantum memory  based on topological materials.<br/><br/>The project will address three questions that are crucial for the possible application of topologically ordered materials to the development of reliable quantum computation devices. First, what determines the rate with which the spectral gap at critical points vanishes as the system size increases? Second, under what conditions is the anyonic excitation spectrum of systems with topologically ordered ground states stable under sufficiently small perturbations? Third, what is the effect of randomness (such as occurs in doped materials) on the structure of the ground state and low-lying excitations of such systems? The project will also investigate the dynamical behavior of the model systems. Questions regarding the energy of low-lying excitations above the ground state, i.e., the spectral gap, are central to many issues in quantum many-body physics. The goal of the project is to significantly extend the range of applicability of methods to estimate the spectral gap in at least two directions. One is the situation where the gap vanishes with increasing system size (critical points or regions). The second aim is to develop methods to analyze the gap of systems in two or more dimensions, which has so far only been achieved in a few special cases. Further, in the case of disordered systems the spectral gap may close, but a so-called mobility gap may play a very similar role and another goal of the project is to extend current methods to situations where the spectral gap is replaced by a mobility gap. Techniques from representation theory, analysis, and probability will be used when available and new methods will be developed when needed."

It is of fundamental technological importance, as many modern opto-electronic devices are fabricated by this process.  Important examples include transistors in microelectronics, quantum dots for photonic crystal lasers, quantum dot-based product enhancements in the energy sector, and nonvolatile storage media, which are sought to replace hard drives, flash memories, and RAM memories.  Other applications include, for example, catalysts (speeding up chemical reactions), which often rely on metal epitaxy.

The investigators of this collaborative project develop models that lead to a better and more fundamental understanding of epitaxial growth.  Results of the work are of interest not only to mathematicians but also to physicists, material scientists and engineers, and medical scientists to whose problems the mathematical results apply.

The investigators design and implement a hierarchy of growth models that combine atomistic master equations in the context of kinetic solid-on-solid models, density-functional theory (DFT), a partial differential equation-based island dynamics growth model, and an efficient scheme to solve the elastic equations to include elastic strain.

On one hand, suppressing turbulent drag is key in designing and engineering energy efficient vehicles.  Understanding the genesis and dynamics of a turbulent wake behind a large plane is key in maintaining safety of the airspace in the proximity of an airport.  On the other hand, turbulent mixing may be desirable -- an example being designing more efficient drug delivery systems.  The main theme of the project is a rigorous study of various manifestations of turbulence in three-dimensional fluid flows modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations.  This is considered both from the perspective of the mathematical theory of turbulence, and as a physical mechanism underlying possible blow-ups (singularities) of the solutions of the system.  Ruling out the possibility of singularity formation in any physical model is a fundamental question, even more so when the model should be applicable to such an omnipresent class of physical phenomena as are 3D fluid flows.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.  <br/><br/>     The project branches into three directions: (1) vortex stretching and local anisotropic diffusion, (2) isotropic diffusion of the velocity field and induced scaling laws, and (3) turbulent transport in non-homogeneous Navier-Stokes model.  The first two directions follow from the recent work of the investigators and their collaborators in presenting a numerically and analytically motivated geometric scenario of vortex filaments formation that exhibits logarithmic sub-criticality in the context of the 3D Navier-Stokes regularity problem.  In this scenario, the transversal scale of the filaments -- a natural, anisotropic micro-scale of the flow -- triggers the mechanism of local, anisotropic diffusion, preventing the possible formation of singularities.  The motivation for the third direction of the study comes from the realm of building and reinforcing mathematical support for Kolmogorov phenomenology in physical scales of the flow.  The investigators have recently managed to adopt their physical scales methodology to the study of forced turbulence.  This opens up an avenue for studying the influence of the spatial distribution of the force on formation of turbulent cascades, as well as for the study of boundary effects via the masking feedback/volume penalization approach.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project."

These systems share the remarkable feature of self-organization on scales in space and time far greater than those of the individual particles, translating to functionality across many scales.  These diverse active particle-fluid systems have been previously modeled.  Here the investigators undertake a unified theoretical and computational platform for such problems, which offers multiple benefits.  A common mathematical structure reveals how these systems achieve their functional properties, informs which physical and chemical features allow the most efficient steering and optimization of the system toward desired properties, allows for a common computational platform, and allows one to incorporate additional degrees of freedom or perturb existing particle and fluid properties and predict their consequences.  These advances have applications to enhance beneficial bacterial colonies and to disrupt harmful ones, to repair damaged cellular functions, and to design nano-composite materials with optimal properties.

This structure guides analysis and algorithm development toward an understanding of, and predictive control over, the remarkable observed behavior of these fluid systems.

They are generated by drawing energy from wind, evolve through nonlinear wave interactions, and are eventually dissipated by wave breaking.  When fully developed, ocean waves have wavelengths that span scales from centimeters (capillary waves) to kilometers (tsunami).  Computationally resolving models for ocean waves over such a wide range of spatial scales is an enormous challenge, and it is impractical to solve the full hydrodynamic equations over a large surface area of the ocean.  These facts have produced an increasing interest in developing a novel and efficient computational tool that can simultaneously treat wind forcing, breaking wave dissipation, and nonlinear wave interactions.  This research project aims to contribute to the development of such a tool.  Once it is developed, the computational model would be useful for researchers working on physical oceanographic processes and climate change, because the transfer of energy and momentum across the air-sea boundary is fundamental to their work.  A graduate student is involved in the project.<br/><br/>To predict accurately the evolution of nonlinear surface waves, the investigator and his colleagues develop a reliable and efficient phase-resolving wave model combined with theoretical models of wave breaking and wind-wave interaction.  Through numerical simulations using a pseudo-spectral method and controlled laboratory experiments, the predictive capability of the integrated wave model is examined for steep surface waves evolving under wind forcing.  To achieve this goal, a robust breaking criterion is first determined though numerical simulations of the wave model and then is confirmed with laboratory experiments.  Then, through viscous boundary layer analyses at the deformed surface of steep waves, the viscous energy dissipation rate and the air pressure distribution over the free surface, as well as a criterion of airflow separation, is identified in terms of local flow and wave characteristics.  By coupling the results of the boundary layer analyses with measurements of wave breaking and wind-wave interaction experiments, the energy dissipation and wind forcing terms are determined and integrated into the wave prediction model.  Finally, the resulting wave model is validated by comparing its numerical solutions with laboratory experiments."

The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. This research project studies mathematically the application of topological phases of matter to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit in quantum computation.<br/><br/>In this project the investigators study mathematical models for topological phases, focusing on their applications to topological quantum computation.  Topological phases of matter in two spatial dimensions are well-described in the framework of modular categories, but relatively little is known in three spatial dimensions.  A large part of this project is devoted to developing appropriate mathematical models in three spatial dimensions and analyzing the corresponding computational paradigms.  Specifically, the project will study (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories and representations of the loop braid group, and symmetry enriched topological order and gauging symmetry.  In addition, because locality and universality are two desirable properties for quantum computation that are manifested in the representations of the braid group, this project also aims to formulate conjectures characterizing when these properties hold and to verify and adapt these conjectures where appropriate to better characterize physical and computational aspects.  To compare the computational power of topological quantum computers to that of classical computers, the project investigates the complexity of the most natural computation in this setting: topological invariants."

These equations describe fluid motions for gases and liquids under quite general conditions, from laminar to turbulent flows, on scales ranging from below a millimeter to astronomical lengths.  Consequently, their study has wide-ranging applications in aeronautical sciences, in meteorology, in the petroleum industry, in plasma physics, and more recently, in biophysical fluid dynamics.  The inherent nonlinear and multi-scale nature of these equations make the problem of weather forecasting and understanding climate evolution challenging.  The investigators develop analytical and computational tools to study the long-term behavior of the fundamental governing equations of the atmosphere and climate.  A main focus is to connect recently developed techniques of data assimilation with the theory of statistical solutions of these equations.  This in turn facilitates the incorporation of vast amounts of weather/climate data, collected over a long period of time, into mathematical models of weather and climate, potentially leading to improved statistical prediction.  Graduate students are engaged in the work of the project. <br/><br/>The investigators study several aspects of turbulent flows, including the time of existence of smooth solutions, statistical properties, and the long-term dynamics on the strong or weak global attractor, in a new class of functional spaces that is contained in all Sobolev classes.  A key feature of this class is that the nonlinear evolution equation satisfies a differential inequality that is almost linear.  This functional class has the property that it can absorb derivatives, which has the effect of making the nonlinear term milder, with potential applications to a wide class of nonlinear evolution equations.  For certain types of initial data, this yields a better existence time for the Navier-Stokes equations than some well-known Sobolev functional classes. This new class of functional spaces is employed to study the finite-dimensional properties of statistical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, via the determining modes, nodes, and determining forms.  Furthermore, the investigators develop data assimilation techniques for statistical solutions of hydrodynamic equations.  Statistical solutions are directly related to the average physical quantities with which engineers are concerned.  They provide a bridge from the time average of physical observables such as energy, enstrophy, and heat transfer to ensemble measures on the phase space.  The techniques developed in this project should have immediate engineering and scientific applications."

Inverse problems for complicated drift-diffusion systems, such as semiconductors and ion channels, abound with mathematical challenges including analytic conditions for uniqueness and reliable numerical algorithms. The principal investigator addresses these by using various asymptotic simplifications, dual problems, and methods similar to those used in inverse obstacle problems for scalar elliptic and parabolic equations."

Running a series of international workshops on mathematics of novel materials science is also planned.<br/><br/>The variety of interconnected problems approached can be grouped into four broad areas, the first concerning the Geometry of Dispersion Relations (DR) in periodic media.  Here various issues such as existence and number spectral gaps, generic behavior and location of extrema of DR, irreducibility of DR, and existence of Dirac points will be addressed.  All these problems are at the heart of understanding properties of metals and semiconductors, as well as novel materials such as 2D crystals (graphene, graphynes, etc.), topological insulators, and photonic crystals.  The problem of overcoming the known topological obstacles to the existence of bases of Wannier functions (important for numerical computations) will be also attacked here.  A second area to be addressed concerns threshold effects, which arise near and at the relevant edges of the spectrum.  These include, in particular, precise asymptotics of Green's functions, homogenization, Liouville type properties, and design of materials slowing down light.  The third area concerns thin structures and will address issues of modeling and properties of thin graph-like or surface-like structures.  These arise naturally in modeling photonic crystals, photonic waveguides, quantum wires, and other applications.  The fourth area is devoted to nodal patterns (Chladni figures) of Dirichlet and Neumann eigenfunctions."

A truly complex system or problem is often intractable, and we often need to find an approximation that is more manageable.  Approximation methods on domains in higher dimensional spaces are good examples of this principle, and they are crucial in many problems in applied mathematics.  In contrast to one dimension, many challenging problems in higher dimensions that are of fundamental importance are not resolved.  The Principal Investigator will study several problems on approximation and orthogonality in Sobolev spaces that rely on new connections and ideas revealed only recently.  The project aims at both theoretical understanding and construction of new approximation methods, and the work has the potential to impact scientific computing, numerical analysis, statistics, and geoscience.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator will study approximation and orthogonality in Sobolev spaces on regular domains, such as cubes, balls, spheres, and simplexes.  The project combines several research topics: approximation theory, Fourier analysis, numerical analysis, and orthogonal polynomials.  One of the main problems originates from the area of spectral methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations.  Through recent work of the Principal Investigator and collaborators, it has become increasingly clear that understanding orthogonality in Sobolev spaces is crucial for approximation and computation in Sobolev spaces.  This research will be based on recent progress in characterization of best approximation by polynomials on the unit sphere and on the unit ball, in Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, and in spectral approximation.  The project is expected to lead to new scientific computational methods and new algorithms."

Certain species of crickets chirp in unison; Malaysian fireflies flash in sync; and the thousands of pacemaker cells in our hearts beat in rhythmic lockstep billions of times during our lives. If engineers and scientists could imitate nature's success at designing networks that automatically synchronize themselves, many technological benefits would follow. For instance, consider wireless sensor networks, whose applications include habitat monitoring and intrusion detection (both for ecology and anti-terrorism), health monitoring of patients in hospitals, and keeping track of workers in coal mines. One technical challenge is that a wireless sensor network needs to keep all its sensors in sync, to coordinate communication between them and to enable them to record data accurately in space and time. But traditional methods of maintaining synchrony, based on exchanging timestamp packets, require large amounts of energy. More efficient methods have been developed by modeling the sensors as idealized fireflies coupled by sudden pulses, a synchronization scheme first studied in the context of mathematical biology. The investigator and his colleagues study such self-synchronizing networks inspired by biology. The objective is to understand their mathematical properties and to suggest potential applications of them in physics and engineering. Benefits are expected for our understanding of how rhythmically active cells work together in tissues and organs, and for spin-offs to technological applications involving arrays of oscillators, such as sensor networks, lasers, and superconducting Josephson junctions. By training four graduate students through the research and outreach opportunities offered here, this effort will also help to develop human resources that are vital to our nation's success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. <br/><br/>The investigator and his colleagues study the nonlinear dynamics of oscillator networks, using mathematical methods of dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, and statistical physics, along with numerical simulation. Two of the projects concern the Kuramoto model, the simplest bio-inspired model of a self-synchronizing system. The first project addresses what happens if the model's interactions incorporate realistic but mathematically inconvenient features, such as a random mix of repulsive and attractive interactions, a weakening of the interactions with distance, or time-delayed interactions. The goal of the second project is to find a transformation that will reduce certain infinite-dimensional oscillator networks studied in physics and engineering to low-dimensional systems - a feat that was achieved unexpectedly for the Kuramoto model four years ago, and that may be a harbinger of breakthroughs to come. The third project examines pulse-coupled oscillators, and asks how synchrony builds up from a state of initial disorder. The new idea here is to approach the question with aggregation theory, a powerful technique borrowed from statistical physics. The fourth project uses dynamical systems theory to study cycles of defection, retaliation, and cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma and related evolutionary games."
