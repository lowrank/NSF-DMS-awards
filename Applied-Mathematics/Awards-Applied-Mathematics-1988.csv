Studies on the stability and instability of solitary                 traveling waves arising in laser propagation, plasma waves and                  water waves will be carried out.                                                     Solitary waves are localized finite energy solutions of                    nonlinear equations that result from a balance of dispertion and                a focusing nonlinearity.  Important questions to be addressed in                this work are concerned with the stability of solitary waves and                their role in the general structure of solutions.  The model                    equation to be analyzed is the nonlinear Schroedinger equation.                 Many of the phenomena which hold for this equation also hold for                other nonlinear dispersive systems which arise as envelope                      equations.  These include the generalized Korteweg-de Vries,                    Benjamin-Ono, Intermediate Long Wave and Benjamin-Bona-Mahoney                  equations.                                                                           The ground state solitary wave solution plays a critical                   role in that it is an interface between stable and unstable                     solutions.  Two goals of this work are to determine the sense in                which blowing up solutions are attracted to the ground state and                to quantify the loss of compactness in these functions.                              Work related to differential geometry concerns the motion of               curves governed by their curvature.  Flows of this type arise in                the mathematical description of propagating fronts.  The initial                expectation was that one could obtain geodesics as the asymptotic               limit of some gradient flow on the space of curves.  This has                   turned out to be impossible in general.  Efforts will be made to                understand the global behavior of these flows and to determine                  the final form of flows on spaces of curves lying in unstable                   manifolds."

In previous work, the PI has introduced the                    cauchy characteristic multifoliate structure associated with a                  control system.  It is a basic geometric invariant of the                       feedback structure, ultimately determining (both locally and                    globally) what can be accomplished by applying state-feedback                   control to the apparatus.  This proposed work will carry on the                 study of the cauchy characteristic structure both from the point                of view of traditional mathematics (e.g. to what extent does the                cauchy characteristic structure determine the control system up                 to feedback equivalent?)  and from the LISP/Symbolic computation                point of view.  In parallel, work will also continue on the Lie-                theoretic foundation of various numerical algorithms for dealing                with nonlinear differential equations.

The general method is first to                    build a realistic mathematical model of the specific system, then               to determine the properties of the model by analytical methods,                 and finally to compare the behavior of the model with observed                  properties of excitation waves in the specific  system.

A suitable example of the latter is the               group of rotations of a sphere.  Groups like this are important                 because they occur in many areas of mathematics (e.g. geometry,                 differential equations, algebraic number theory, mathematical                   physics) as groups of symmetries.

The transform methods ultimately yield the picture pixel values as a convolution of the projection data with some weights (filter). Finite dimensional methods discretize at the very beginning by assuming a fixed set of basis pictures whose linear combination gives an approximation to the image. The choice of coefficients in the linear combination is determined by some optimization criterion. Current comercial CT-scan machines and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) machines employ the transform methods in image reconstruction. The reason for this is that transform based algorithms are simpler and faster. Finite dimensional methods however, are more robust in data collection geometries, noisy data or small number of views. This project explores a finite dimensional method that is computationally competitive with the transform methods and enables one to express the picture pixel values in closed form. The essence of this approach is to use dynamic programming ideas to express the optimization criterion as recurrence relations. One then solves these recurrence relations and uses the solutions to obtain the pixel values of the picture."

An immediate application of such a procedure involves the optimal positioning of sensors and actuators, particularly for structures with a large number of identical sensor/actuator mechanism, such as large space antennas. A related question is whether co-locating actuators and sensors always leads to the best system performance. Aspects of a method for determining optimal changes, in either the underlying system or the weighing matrices of the performance index, are discussed, as well as extensions to infinite dimensional distributed parameter systems."
