The numerical range is a convex subset of the plane that has proven useful to engineers in determining the stability of control systems associated with linear operators. The chaotic behaviour of dynamical systems has recently become an important subject spanning mathematics, physics, engineering, and biology. It has only recently been discovered that significant classes of linear operators can give rise to chaotic systems, and this has led to unexpected connections between operator theory and dynamical systems. The idea of decomposability---the study of how to break a complicated linear system up into simpler ones---has recently been shown to have surprising connections with such chaotic behaviour. The research of Shapiro and Bourdon arises from, and has contributed to, these developments: it is anticipated that the project outlined in this proposal will further enhance our understanding of the connection between dynamical systems and operator theory.<br/><br/><br/>"

Depending on the setting, it can lead to a significant speed up of combustion or to the quenching of the flame.  The main goal of this project is to improve fundamental understanding of this important phenomenon.  In particular, this work explores analytically how the geometry, scaling, and intensity of the velocity field determine the effect advection has on combustion.  A primary goal is to determine the optimal geometry for the fastest extinction of the flame, or for the most effective speed up.  The models to be studied include passive reaction-diffusion equations with physically-motivated reaction terms, systems of reaction-diffusion equations, and active scalar models with feedback of temperature and concentration on fluid velocity.  The methods of analysis include maximum-principle-based techniques, estimates on solutions of partial differential equations, and functional inequalities, as well as some methods of harmonic and spectral analysis. <br/><br/>The influence of strong fluid advection on combustion plays a crucial role in many important combustion processes in technology and in nature.  Strong fluid advection may drastically enhance the rate of burning, leading to higher efficiency, or, in some situations, extinguish the flame. This question has been extensively studied by engineers, physicists, and mathematicians alike. However, until very recent work of several research groups, there were few rigorous results on the topic. Building on the technique developed in earlier works, the project seeks to deepen the understanding of this phenomenon, in particular relating the geometric characteristics of the fluid flow with the effect it has on combustion. The potential impact of the project is an improved knowledge of combustion processes in settings as diverse as internal combustion  engines and stars. The research may lead to direct suggestions on the most efficient ways of flame suppression or enhancement.  In addition, the techniques developed for tackling this problem may prove useful in analyzing other partial differential equations.  <br/><br/>"

Of particular importance are solutions<br/>of such equations that are stable and hence typically <br/>correspond with observable phenomena.  Unfortunately, establishing<br/>the stability of these solutions has proven to be a quite<br/>difficult problem.  The pointwise Green's function approach,<br/>however, initiated by Liu and developed by Liu and his <br/>collaborators, has proven quite robust: in applications to <br/>viscous shock waves arising in single conservation laws of<br/>arbitrary order, viscous shock waves arising in systems <br/>with second order diffusion, planar viscous shock waves, <br/>degenerate viscous shock waves, and rarefaction waves.  <br/>We propose to continue and extend this promising line of<br/>research in three directions.  First, new techniques <br/>recently developed by Howard and Zumbrun appear suitable<br/>for extension to (i) systems of viscous conservation <br/>laws admitting degenerate viscous shock waves, and (ii)<br/>systems of viscous conservation laws with high order<br/>viscosity.  Second, we propose to develop further <br/>techniques that will extend the pointwise Green's <br/>function approach to the case of viscous rarefaction <br/>waves.

The first goal is to advance the theory of the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations on pseudoconvex domains in multidimensional complex space. Although global regularity of the d-bar Neumann problem holds on large classes of domains, it fails on the so-called worm domains. Currently there is no general theory that unifies the known positive results, much less one that also accounts for the negative results on the worm domains. Likewise, necessary and sufficient conditions for the stronger property of compactness of the d-bar Neumann operator are not known. A basic question to be addressed is how to unify Catlin's approach to global regularity (via compactness) with the investigators' vector field method.  The investigators expect a new sufficient condition for global regularity to emerge from this study. They also hope to characterize compactness in the d-bar Neumann problem by some condition slightly weaker than Catlin's so-called property P.  The second thrust of this project is to develop a new area in multi-dimensional complex analysis: namely, the study of how the theorems and estimates of the subject depend asymptotically on the dimension of the space as the dimension tends to infinity.  Two particular problems of interest are the recently developed theory about extending Bohr's classical power series theorem to higher dimensions and the question of quantifying how zeroes of the Bergman kernel function depend on the dimension of the ambient complex space. During this project, the investigators will train graduate students, and they will supervise a young mathematician at the post-doctoral level (supported through a VIGRE grant at Texas A&M University) in his study of the d-bar Neumann problem on domains with corners.<br/>The study of analysis in several complex variables is motivated both by the centrality of the subject within mathematics and by its inherent usefulness. For example, one of the basic laws of nature, causality, when transcribed by a mathematical device called the Fourier transform, immediately gives rise to analytic functions of several (in this case four) variables. The work in this project will impact not only the core areas of several complex variables and partial differential equations, but also other areas of science. For example, the Cauchy-Riemann equations form a model problem for a subject central to physics and engineering; Bohr's classical theorem has repercussions in operator theory; and the Bergman kernel function provides a concrete model for Berezin's quantization scheme in mathematical physics. In addition to advancing the frontiers of knowledge through basic research, this project will contribute significantly to the development of human resources through the scientific training of highly qualified personnel.<br/><br/>"

The common thread of the problems posed in this proposal is the existence of a symmetry group. An important class of applications, for example, is formed by the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser (CSM) systems; these are quantum-mechanical problems of a number of identical particles in a one-dimensional space with certain interactions (inverse square, for one). The symmetry group is the group of all permutations of the coordinate functions (the type-A Weyl group) or the group of permutations and sign-changes (the type-B Weyl group); the latter occurs in spin models. Some of the classical orthogonal polynomials are associated to Weyl groups and compact homogeneous spaces. Dunkl has developed a theory of differential-difference operators (called ""Dunkl operators"" in both mathematics and physics literature) which are crucial devices for this analysis. These operators are a parametrized version of the usual derivatives. They are used to construct certain invariant differential operators (which prove the complete integrability of several CSM models). There is also an associated generalization of the Fourier transform. Specifically this project concerns the construction of generating functions for polynomials with certain desirable properties (orthogonality or eigenfunctions, for example) associated to finite reflection groups (of types I, A, B, H); a study of the generalized binomial coefficients defined in terms of nonsymmetric Jack polynomials, a search for useful self-adjoint operators enabling orthogonal decomposition of type-B harmonic polynomials (which would be used to express wave-functions of CSM models on the line in spherical polar coordinates), a study of special CSM models with three-body interactions. Also it is proposed to investigate possible modifications of the original differential-difference operators connected with bispectral problems or  super-integrable models.<br/> Mathematical analysis can be considered as having two different emphases, one is to find exact formulae to describe some mathematical system, like the motion of the planets or of a pendulum, or an electron belonging to an atom which is part of a crystal, and the other is to find good and useful approximations and processes which can get as close as desired to the solution of a problem by taking an adequate number of steps. For example, computed tomography does not give a perfect image of a cross-section of the subject, but it does provide all the detail needed for practical purposes. This project is in the part of analysis which aims to give exact solutions in situations which enjoy some symmetry. This could be the quantum-mechanical problem of indistinguishable particles, a statistical analysis which treats each data point the same way, or the molecular structure of a crystal where each atom has six nearest neighbors, up, down, left, right, front and back. In particular, Dunkl has developed a calculus which takes the symmetry into account, thus allowing   precise and powerful techniques for the analysis. The problems in the proposal can be categorized by the types of symmetry, such as those formed by rotating a circle through multiples of sixty degrees (that is, one sixth of a complete revolution), or those associated to permutations of identical objects, to name just two. The goal of the project is to develop tools and discover methods for multi-variable analysis of problems with symmetry; these will be useful in understanding the physics of interacting particles, statistical analysis of complicated data, and the techniques of digitizing and the subsequent reconstruction of sounds and images.<br/><br/><br/>"

It has already been proved that bounded simply connected smooth strongly pseudoconvex domains can always be mapped onto<br/>each other by such maps.  The present project is concerned with developing geometric methods for computing or estimating the minimal qusiconformal distortion.  The second line of investigation has to do with Poisson transforms of sections of vector bundles.  Such Poisson transforms have<br/>been used to extend infinitesimally quasiconformal maps from the complex unit ball to the interior.  They are now to be further investigated for their injectivity properties and for pairs of differential operators intertwined by them.  Here the machinery of semisimple Lie groups will be used to its full capacity.  A further subject to be studied is generalized conformal maps of generalized flag manifolds; it is expected that Liouville's classic theorem will extend to this situation.  (This question is related to the preceding one through the notion of parabolic geometry.)  In addition, three further, more or less related problems will be investigated; these concern analysis on two-step nilpotent groups, harmonic functions on spaces with negative curvature, and an application<br/>of the theory of reflection groups to statistics.<br/><br/>The main goal of the proposal is to discover new mathematical facts in the field of analysis of functions.  The theory of functions of one complex variable has been the most central field of mathematics in the last 150 years.  It has innumerable applications to physics and other<br/>sciences.  The theory of functions of several complex variables has had important successes but has not up to now matched in perfection and applicability the one-variable theory.  The first goal of the proposal is to try to improve on this situation by studying the so-called mapping properties of functions of several complex variables.  It will also be investigated to what extent the fundamental notions and facts of this theory can be extended to more general situations.  The project also includes the investigation of some further related problems, one of these concerns an application to statistics.  A secondary goal of the proposal is to understand more clearly the connections between certain already known facts in the main subject.  This should make them easier to learn; in this way a contribution to mathematical education is expected to be made.<br/>"

We are working to create stable algorithms by utilizing the principle of causality and by characterizing the scattering data, as much as we possibly can. Inverse scattering problems are often posed in either the ""frequency<br/>domain"" or in the ""time domain"". Theoretically, the two are equivalent, one set of data being related to the other by the Fourier transform. However, features that are easily seen in one domain can appear much more complicated in the other. For example, the scattering operator, in the frequency domain is easily seen to satisfy certain bounds.  The analogous bounds in the time domain appear much more complicated.  Similarly, the timing of reflections (i.e. you hear reflections from nearby objects before you hear those from objects further away) becomes a property of ideals in spaces of analytic functions when translated to the frequency domain.<br/><br/>A main feature of our approach is to carefully analyze how to express each such feature in both contexts, and use these to help characterize the scattering data and enforce stability.<br/>The fundamental task of science is to investigate the world. Most often, we accomplish this goal by directing waves (e.g. light, X-rays, sound) at an object and  observing the waves after they have interacted with that object.  In some cases, the results of such an experiment can be readily understood (e.g. a photograph, a single X-ray).  However, as our technology becomes more and more complex, the data from an experiment are less and less likely to be directly meaningful. More and more, sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques are necessary to translate data into something which is meaningful to the human investigator (e.g. a CAT scan, a neutron scattering experiment). This is the general role that Inverse Problems plays in science today.  It is the mathematical science of interpreting experiment. When we solve inverse problems we run physics backwards, deducing the cause from the effect. While physical intuition often suggests the best imaging experiments, an imaging algorithm is not a model of a natural process. In particular, these problems are often ill-posed, and physical principles must often be applied in ways that are radically different than how they would function in a ""forward problem"" which directly models nature. Thus they offer a unique opportunity for using  mathematical intuition to supplement physical intuition. This project seeks to employ physical principles in novel ways to develop stable imaging techniques. Here is an example, discovered under previous NSF support. We observe reflections of waves from a layered lossless medium with unknown wavespeed. If one makes a guess at the wave speed in part of the medium and uses that guess to compute the reflection one would have seen from the rest of the medium, then either the guess is correct or the computed reflections violate the principle of causality by arriving back at the receiver too soon. We used this principle to develop a very stable algorithm.<br/>"

Abstract of Proposed Research.<br/> <br/>  Many phenomena in nature and human society, such as the weather,<br/> or the stock market, are chaotic and hard to predict and analyze. In <br/> fact any time three or more entities interact, the behaviour tends to <br/> have chaotic features as the interaction between any two of them is <br/> constantly interfered with by the third and the effects of these third<br/> person interferences accumulate and backfire. Large systems<br/> are beyond our ability to calculate completely. One can only understand<br/> with complete precision lower dimensional systems and then one can hope<br/> to infer from these which phenomena can happen in larger systems.<br/> Complex dynamics provides the low dimensional setting with the most<br/> tools available for such analysis. The theory of complex analysis provides<br/> powerful methods for complex dynamics. It is also exciting that complex <br/> dynamics provides tools back to complex analysis. So getting these groups<br/> together for an extended period should have strong impact on both areas.<br/> <br/> <br/>  One of the main tools in complex dynamics is (pluri)potential theory,<br/> which is a key area in complex analysis. Using Green functions from<br/> potential theory one can get invariant currents and measures for the<br/> dynamics via the complex Monge ampere operator. A basic problem<br/> here is that in some cases it is difficult to define this operator<br/> due to the fact that one needs to multiply distributions. Kobayashi<br/> hyperbolicity is another key concept. Invariant regions which are<br/> Kobayashi hyperbolic gives rise to nonchaotic behaviour because iterates<br/> are then a normal family. It is however difficult to decide which regions<br/> in complex manifolds are Kobayashi hyperbolic.  The best results on the<br/> embedding problem for Riemann surfaces in C^2 use complex dynamical <br/> techniques, but there are many open cases still. And these are only a<br/> few of the topics that will be investigated by this huge group of<br/> researchers<br/>"

The effect is easily observed in abelian groups, thanks to Fourier theory and Pontrjagin duality, but the situation is more involved for nonabelian groups, whose unitary representation theory is too complicated to admit a direct descriptive account.  However the perspective on dual spaces provided by Alain Connes' noncommutative geometry makes it possible to formulate instances of this large-scale to small-scale phenomenon for nonabelian groups.  Moreover the tools of algebraic topology, carried over to the noncommutative realm, make it possible to elevate the phenomenon to a conjectural reciprocity (formulated by Baum and Connes) between the global, homotopy theoretic structures of groups and their reduced duals.  The purpose of the research outlined in this proposal is to obtain a more accurate and deeper understanding of the Baum-Connes conjecture in operator K-theory and of the large-to-small scale phenomenon which underlies it.  The proposers will investigate issues related to group boundaries, Sobolev theory on the reduced dual of a group, and Hilbert space embeddings of groups.  The recent discovery of counterexamples to variants of the Baum-Connes conjecture will be analyzed in depth.<br/>Although the tools used to investigate it are rather elaborate, the idea behind large scale-geometry is very simple: ignore the local, small-scale features of a geometric space and concentrate on its large-scale, or long term, structure.  By doing so, trends or qualities may become apparent which are obscured by small-scale irregularities.  The investigators and others have developed tools to distinguish between different sorts of multi-dimensional, large scale behavior in geometry.  Somewhat surprisingly, aside from their intrinsic interest, these tools have found application in ordinary, small-scale geometry and elsewhere.  The present proposal focuses on geometric aspects of group theory which are illuminated by large-scale geometry.<br/>The proposers are actively involved in training the next generation of mathematical scientists.  They lead Penn State's Geometric Functional Analysis group.  They run an active, twice-weekly research seminar and between them they have eight doctoral students under their direct supervision (a number of other students attend the seminar regularly).  They currently serve as mentors to one VIGRE supported postdoctoral fellow, and will be recruiting a second fellow to be supported by NSF Focussed Research Grant funds this year.  The Geometric Functional Analysis group frequently hosts sabbatical visitors as well as visiting graduate students.  Besides the seminar, the group runs a continuing program of mini-workshops on research subjects of current interest.  The research described in this proposal will be supported by, and carried out as part of, the activities of the Geometric Functional Analysis group.<br/><br/>"

It is devoted to three projects.  The goal of the first project is to obtain construction of characteristic classes for the important class of noncommutative spaces, arising naturally in the contexts of discrete group actions on manifolds and foliations. The approach is based on the recently developed by A. Connes and H. Moscovici theory of cyclic cohomology of Hopf  algebras. The goal of the second project (joint work with R. Nest and A. Uribe) is to obtain index theorem for algebras of Fourier integral operators, and study applications of these results.  The third project (joint work with J. Lott) is devoted to the proof of the local version of Connes' index theorem for etale groupoids, as well as various extensions of this theorem.  Noncommutative geometry is a field of mathematics situated on the crossroads between analysis, geometry, and mathematical physics. Discovery of quantum mechanics has shown that the classical principles of geometry are not applicable to the world of microscopic particles. Noncommutative geometry unifies geometry with analysis for the solution of the problems of quantum mechanics. Different parts of the present work deals both  with solving internal problems of noncommutative geometry and with applying methods of noncommutative geometry to other parts of mathematics and mathematical physics.<br/>"

The first of these two methods is based upon extension of earlier joint work of Moy and Prasad which proved the conjecture in the case the supercuspidal representation has depth zero.  The second method would be to show that any irreducible smooth representation which does not contain a cuspidal representation of a parahoric subgroup must have a nonzero Jacquet functor.  Both these methods involve the Bruhat-Tits building.

The second one is the construction of relativistic Vlasov kinetic theory from a microscopic model, a nonequilibrium problem. As to the first problem, we use a new, entirely analytic strategy to extend the known universality for the unitary matrices also to the other types of random matrices: real symmetric, complex normal, and quaternionic self-dual. The strategy applies to the bulk and to the edge of the spectrum. We also apply our method to the study of the Laughlin wave function of superconductivity, which is of a related structure. As for the second problem, we use the recently laid microscopic dynamical foundations of relativistic many-particle theory to establish the first derivation of relativistic Vlasov kinetic theory in form of a weak law of large numbers. We also study its fluctuations around the limit in form of a central limit theorem. <br/> The universality conjecture is currently one of the top priority problems of random matrix theory, a subfield of probability and mathematical physics. Its applications range from nuclear physics, nanotechnology and superconductivity on the physics and technology side to deep number theoretical implications on the mathematical side - which in turn have applications in cryptography and related fields. The conjecture has been proven so far for the simplest type of matrices, but a proof for more general matrices has so far been elusive. The relativistic Vlasov theory of charged particle systems forms the dynamical basis for a large part of high temperature plasma physics, with applications ranging from thermonuclear fusion research to space plasma research, e.g. about the solar wind and magnetic storms. Its microscopic atomic underpinnings, which have so far eluded researchers, will make it possible for the first time to systematically study the accuracy of Vlasov theory and in particular to compute its leading corrections."

One main focus of the <br/>proposal will be the use of invariants coming from C*-algebras (especially Kasparov's KK-theory) to study the geometry and <br/>topology of manifolds.  For example, KK-classes coming from the classical elliptic operators (the Euler characteristic<br/>operator, the signature operator, and the Dolbeault operator)<br/>will be intensively studied.  Attention will also be paid to the equivariant case, where a finite group acts on the manifold in question.  These studies will deepen the link between <br/>topological and analytic approaches to manifold theory.  <br/>In addition, Professor Rosenberg will study the classification <br/>of manifolds via their Yamabe invariants, and the <br/>classification of metrics of positive scalar curvature, <br/>problems which involve a quite subtle blend<br/>of differential topology, differential geometry,<br/>and analysis.  He will also study the applications<br/>of K-theory to the study of C*-algebras, and various <br/>related problems on algebraic K-theory, especially on <br/>algebras of operators or on algebras coming from <br/>quantization of geometrical systems.<br/><br/>The context of this project is the use of new methods <br/>in analysis, based on noncommutative operator algebras, <br/>for attacking problems in geometry and topology.  On the <br/>one hand, these methods are useful as a new source<br/>of tools for studying geometry, especially in high dimensions.  <br/>And on the other hand, the methods are motivated (and more <br/>or less forced) by the quantization of classical physical <br/>systems.

The motion of the interface of general two layered fluid flow includes vortex sheet motion as a  special case. In a recent work, the PI shows that arbitrarily specifying independent position and velocity data generally will yield no Sobolev class vortex sheet for any positive time. Some crucial assumptions in this work are: the fluids are inviscid, there is no surface tension, and the interface remains a regular surface at positive time.  A problem of interest is therefore a well-posed model for the vortex sheet motion. The PI proposes to reintroduce viscosity into the fluids, and to understand the effect of the viscosity near the interface. This leads to the study of the zero viscosity limit of two layered viscous fluids. A related problem of both mathematical and practical importance is the boundary layer problem. The question is to find the zero viscosity limit of the incompressible Navier-Stokes flow in a domain with a fixed nonempty boundary. It is well-known that the difficulty is in the boundary layer, within which the normal velocity gradient generally becomes very large. The PI's approach is different from the usual one, in the sense that the PI will assume no knowledge of the possible limit equations. The PI proposes to analyze directly the Navier-Stokes flow, and to obtain the qualitative behavior of the boundary part and the interior part of  the solutions of Navier-Stokes equation. The method will be from harmonic analysis. It is expected that the techniques and results developed in solving the boundary layer problem will provide insight in finding a well-posed model for the vortex sheet motion.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to continue her study in the water wave problem. Recently, the <br/>PI proved the existence and uniqueness of solutions locally in time for the <br/>Water wave problem.

Professor Bourdon and his collaborator Joel Shapiro of<br/>Michigan State University will investigate problems arising from the<br/>interaction between the modern theory of linear operators and the<br/>classical theory of analytic functions. The problems to be studied involve<br/>norms, decomposability, and numerical ranges of composition operators as<br/>well as the chaotic behavior of both composition operators and operators<br/>commuting with backward shifts. Insights and tools developed during the<br/>course of the project will be applied to other classes of linear operators<br/>on Hilbert and Banach spaces.<br/><br/>   Many of the differential and integral equations that physicists and<br/>engineers use to model physical processes may be viewed as linear<br/>operators on spaces of functions. This viewpoint, pioneered by David<br/>Hilbert, led to the development of function-theoretic operator theory,<br/>which is the branch of mathematics inspiring the problems that are the<br/>focus of Bourdon and Shapiro's project. A number of these problems concern<br/>the notion of numerical range of a linear operator, an object that has<br/>relevance to quantum physics and that has proven useful to engineers in<br/>determining the stability of certain control systems. Other problems<br/>relate to the chaotic behavior of linear operators. That linear operators<br/>can give rise to chaotic systems is a relatively recent discovery which <br/>has led to unexpected connections between operator theory and dynamical<br/>systems. The idea of decomposability--the study of how to break a<br/>complicated linear system up into simpler ones--has been shown to have<br/>surprising connections with such chaotic behavior. The final group of<br/>problems involves norm calculations for composition operators. The norm<br/>of an operator measures how much the operator can stretch the unit ball of<br/>the space on which it acts. Computer experimentation should yield<br/>insights and intuition concerning both composition-operator norms and<br/>numerical ranges. Through such experimentation, undergraduate students at<br/>Washington and Lee University will be given an opportunity to participate<br/>in the project. The training and research experience provided to these<br/>students by the project contribute to its human-resources impact.<br/><br/><br/>"

Aspects of  the Cauchy-Riemann equations on Lipschitz domains addressed include  the complex Neumann boundary value problem and estimates of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Function theory will be analyzed   on strongly pseudoconvex Lipschitz domains, as well as the Bergman projection<br/>and biholomorphic maps.

Classically, harmonic analysis offers a  powerful tool to solve partial differential equations, especially the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems.  Harmonic analysis is also intertwined with one complex variable, especially for function theory in the unit disc. In its modern version, harmonic analysis has evolved into singular integral theory and geometric measure theory.  The development of one influences the other and both collectively are viewed as  one of the most important and elegant theories in mathematics. In several complex variables, these overlapping areas  have produced even richer and more profound results whose impact have shaped modern partial differential equations, several complex variables and harmonic analysis. Their influence even extends beyond these fields into other areas, like complex differential geometry, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. While great progress has been made in the past few decades for the case when the domains are smooth, little is known when the domain is less regular.  The investigation of these problems on nonsmooth domains is already  central to the study of classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems using harmonic analysis. Built on these solid foundations, the PI intends to tackle more challenging problems in several complex variables. Their solution will<br/>advance all the aforementioned intricately related fields and open up a  vast unexplored area.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

More specifically, he focuses on questions that are related to the local classification problem, which asks for a local description of the CR structure on a manifold near a distinguished point up to equivalence. For instance, for a real submanifold in complex space, one would like to know which other real submanifolds are equivalent to it by a local biholomorphic transformation. The PI studies this problem extrinsically by trying to find normal forms in classes of real submanifolds, and intrinsically as an equivalence problem for systems of differential equations.  An important part of the classification problem is to understand the group of transformations preserving the structure or, more generally, the set of mappings between two given structures. The PI of this project studies the local stability group of a real submanifold in complex space, i.e. the group of local biholomorphisms preserving the real submanifold and a given distinguished point on it. He investigates under what conditions this group can be embedded as a subgroup of the jet group of a predetermined order, and seeks to describe the subgroups that arise in this way in more detail. He looks for conditions that imply coercivity results such as e.g.  convergence of all formal mappings between real-analytic submanifolds, or real-analyticity of all smooth CR mappings. He also investigates closer the prolongation of the system defining CR mappings to a Pfaffian system, and explores its applications.<br/>The theory of several complex variables is a rapidly developing subject in mathematics which has applications in contemporary mathematical physics (e.g quantum field theory and string theory) as well as in engineering (e.g. control theory). The study of the geometry of real submanifolds in complex spaces, such as e.g. smooth boundaries of domains, is central to this theory, and is also related to other areas of mathematics such as partial differential equations and differential geometry. In this project, we investigate questions regarding the geometry of real submanifolds in complex space and their mappings that arise in the classification problem of such up to equivalences that preserve the complex structure of the ambient space. <br/>"

The idea of representing a general operator in a specialized class of operators as a part of a nice operator in the class has had many successes and we seek to develop this point of view with a primary focus on problems in the theory of functions in one and several complex variables. A particular group of problems that we propose to attack involves the generalizations to several complex variables of some of the classical moment and interpolation problems on the unit disc such as the interpolation theorem of Nevanlinna and Pick and the moment theorems of Caratheodory and Herglotz. Another group involves deriving analogs of the theorem of Adamyan, Arov, and Krein on spaces more general than the classical Hardy space. Research intrinsic to operator theory that we will undertake includes issues involving model theory in one variable on nonsimply connected domains in the plane and in several variables on domains other than the bidisc. <br/><br/>Operator Theory, the particular type of mathematics that we are proposing to investigate, has direct and concrete benefits for a number of areas of human endeavor. For example, the model theory aspects of our proposal all involve the generalization of the Commutant Lifting Structure which leads to an effcient algorithm for the discovery of oil from acoustical data taken on the surface of the earth. Other aspects would add to the theory of Linear Matrix Inequalities. LMI 's, which currently are all the rage in several areas of engineering, are an extension of linear programming, a mathematics which has made possible not only the optimization of large scale resource allocation but the accurate prediction of economic markets as well. Finally, the particular branch of function theory we propose to study, forms the mathematical core of the recently developed H-infinity control theory, which has been used to design control systems for fusion reactions inside Tokamaks and feedback stabilization systems for the space shuttle.  <br/><br/>"

The goal is to find canonical ""nonlinear generalizations"" <br/>of analytic function theory and the related parts of linear operator theory.  Many <br/>classical and many new analytic function theorems have a statement purely in terms of <br/>linear operators.  The surprising thing is that these theorems about linear operators <br/>do not actually require linearity, and it has become clear that there will be  extensive <br/>nonlinear generalizations of them.  This wide open area is close to control theory.<br/>COMPUTER OPERATOR ALGEBRA.  Linear engineering systems theory and operator theory are rife with calculations in a noncommutative algebra. Helton's group with M. Stankus <br/>are major providers of software (called NCAlgebra) for performing general noncommutative <br/>calculations in Mathematica.  One phase of the software is at the level of a very <br/>powerful `yellow pad', and contains numerous algorithms they developed. For example, <br/>the  ""noncommutative convexity"" algorithm discussed  below will go in.  In another phase <br/>there is  extensive software implementing noncommutative Groebner basis algorithms <br/>due to Mora and algorithms for sorting and ""shrinking"" the output in various ways ( this <br/>is crucial in the noncommutative case). Since the techniques are new, experimentation on <br/>traditional problems is important. <br/>NONCOMMUTATIVE INEQUALITIES.  Recently, Helton and collaborators made progress on a <br/>theory and resulting algorithm which takes a rational function F of noncommutative <br/>variables Z and outputs a family of inequalities which determine a domain G of Z on <br/>which F is ""matrix convex"".  Decidedly non-trivial is showing that the domain G <br/>determined by the algorithm is  ""the  largest possible"" domain of matrix convexity <br/>for F. This is a first attempt at an automatic method for what engineers now do with <br/>Schur complement tricks  to convert a design problem to Linear Matrix Inequalities.  <br/>OPTIMIZATION  OVER SPACES OF ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS. Qualitative theory, computer algorithms based on this theory, analysis of such algorithms.  These are the key optimization <br/>problems which arise in designs of linear systems where there are competing constraints, <br/>or uncertainty in the math model of the physical system one is trying to control.<br/><br/>The research is directed at several projects in parts of operator theory and functional <br/>analysis related to engineering system theory. Linear operator theory has had a strong <br/>interplay with analytic function theory and engineering for many decades.  Indeed most <br/>commercial software (at least in the control engineering community) for solving analytic <br/>function problems is based on this type of interplay between functions and matrices.  <br/>One branch of analysis closely related to applications is classical Nevanlinna-Pick-<br/>Nehari theory, or equivalently commutant lifting theory, a part of the area called <br/>operator model theory.  The early development of this  was done for the purest of <br/>mathematical reasons, but in the mid 1970's  and early 1980's this was shown to be <br/>critical to the design of engineering systems where stability of the system is the key <br/>constraint. This motivated much more mathematical development and now it is one of the <br/>areas of functional analysis most closely associated with control engineering. For many <br/>years (since Norbert Wiener) design tools optimized mean square performance. The theory <br/>above ultimately lead to (commercially commonplace) tools for optimizing worst case <br/>frequency domain performance. The goal of much of the proposed research is to extend <br/>this theory in several radically new directions and we list the main ones.<br/>HIGHLY NONLINEAR GENERALIZATIONS; the goal is to find canonical ""nonlinear <br/>generalizations"" of analytic function theory and the related parts of linear <br/>operator theory.  This wide open area is closely related to control theory.  Many <br/>systems which people wish to control are nonlinear (e.g., jet engines).<br/>NONCOMMUTATIVE COMPUTER ALGEBRA; if a signal goes into a system A, comes out and then goes into B what we get is BA, while if a signal goes into B and then A what we <br/>get is AB.  Seldom does AB  equal BA, thus the design of engineering systems<br/>requires (heavy) noncommutative calculations.  Helton's group has a broad based <br/>effort to develop methods and theory for computer assistance of such calculations.  <br/>Inequalities with noncommuting elements is now a major topic in engineering and <br/>Helton's group is working out systematic methods for treating them.<br/><br/>"

As a long range goal the principal investigator also hopes to determine whether the strong maximum principle holds for p-harmonic functions for general values of p. The second issue is to construct the Martin boundary for Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces that admit Green functions.  It is also proposed to study some properties of Green functions, including the uniqueness property and the boundary Harnack principle. These two problems will be studied for two different constructions of Green functions, one - using the upper gradients, and the other - the Cheeger derivative.

Concerning the first area, Curto plans to extend his recent work (joint with L. Fialkow) on flat extensions of positive moment matrices, which has led to a general framework for the study of truncated complex moment problems. He plans to apply these methods to study the case of singular moment matrices, and to continue to analyze the question of localization of the support of representing measures. Curto expects to settle a conjecture on the solubility index of a truncated moment sequence, and to characterize quadrature domains in terms of their moment matrices. As part of (ii), a model theory for 2-hyponormal operators will be sought, along the lines of the existing theory for subnormal operators, and using as test ground recent results on unilateral weighted shifts. In joint work with W.Y. Lee, Curto has introduced the class of weakly subnormal operators and obtained preliminary results on its position relative to subnormality and 2-hyponormality, including a proof that contractive 2-hyponormal operators with closed range self-commutator are extremal for the family of 2-hyponormal contractions. The third area is closely related to the first two, in that both originate in Curto's work on quadratic and joint hyponormality, which eventually led to the solution of the subnormal completion problem for weighted shifts and to the existence of non-subnormal polynomially hyponormal operators. Curto will seek a characterization of polynomially hyponormal weighted shifts, a structure theorem for quadratically hyponormal shifts, and the detection of non-subnormal polynomially hyponormal operators through the Pincus principal function. The fourth area deals with a Sz. Nagy-Foias dilation theory in several variables, by extending existing results to functional Hilbert spaces over Reinhardt domains.  The suitability of multi-shifts as standard models and the validity of von Neumann's inequality for special n-tuples will be considered. Curto plans to extend the description of the spectral picture of multiplication operators associated with Reinhardt measures to functional Hilbert spaces over matrix Reinhardt domains. Finally, the fifth area deals with the invariant subspace structure of commuting contractions on Hilbert space. Two main goals will be pursued: (a) an extension to the Taylor spectrum of results on spectral dominance currently available only for the Harte spectrum, and (b) an analog of Apostol's Theorem in several variables. <br/><br/>Multivariable operator theory is a rapidly evolving area of mathematics, with deep and significant connections with areas of differential geometry, topology, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry, and with exciting applications to engineering, quantum and relativistic mechanics, and computational mathematics. The theory of truncated moment problems provide easily accessible formulas for the evaluation of areas and volumes of complex regions, of moments of inertia and centers of gravity. Dilation theory and invariant subspace theory are essential tools in the description of algebraic properties of elaborate physical or engineering systems, and the study of transformations on function spaces has often led to the solution of problems in control theory, intimately tied to systems theory and electrical engineering. Our research project is aimed at resolving some outstanding problems in multivariable operator theory, while creating recruitment and retention opportunities for women and minorities to pursue careers in mathematics, by engaging their participation in projects related to the interaction of mathematics with other sciences.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The main cases concern, but are not limited to, spaces whose reproducing kernel has one positive square.  Recent commutant lifting theorems and Beurling-Lax-Halmos type theorems for such spaces provide the rationale for connecting these topics.  Among the function theory questions considered are corona theorems for various multiplier algebras of operators on reproducing kernel spaces.  In addition, using Hilbert space methods, the principal investigator expects to derive new estimates for the H2(D2)-corona theorem on the bidisk and consider vector valued corona theorems.  The invariant subspace topics which will be pursued include consequences of the Beurling-type invariant subspace theory for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with Nevanlinna-Pick kernels.  In addition, a concrete model theory of commuting n-tuples related to that of Agler and Athavale will be developed.<br/><br/>One of the unifying themes of the proposed work is the systematic use of control theory ideas in the context of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.  Such spaces provide a fundamental notion for connecting problems in, for example, classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, circuit theory, and signal analysis.  Some of the proposed problems may be viewed as inverse problems or ""partial knowledge"" problems.  For example, to effect a desired output, how should one decide on an appropriate input?  Interpolation type problems have long been studied for the stabilization of systems in feedback control in one dimension.  Much of the emphasis of the proposed research will be on the multidimensional theory.  The proposer expects this viewpoint to be productive in developing new techniques for the inverse problems being considered. <br/>"

""Jets"" are generalized (local) pointwise derivatives that<br/> allow for the interpretation and calculation of non-linear functions<br/> of derivatives. In this proposal, the PI presents a project to extend the notion of jets from the Euclidean or Riemannian case to more general state spaces.

Jets adapted to the geometry of a state space endowed with a family of vector fields satisfying a <br/> non-degeneracy condition are called  ""subelliptic jets"". Basic analysis topics like Taylor developments and maximum principles have to be adapted to conform to the new<br/> subelliptic geometry.

The oil is then removed by forcing a less viscous fluid (say water) into the channel. After an initial formation of several invading fingers, the penetrating fluid reaches a steady state and takes the form of a single finger. Mathematically one seeks a harmonic function within the set occupied by oil and vanishing on the set occupied by water. On the free boundary separating the two fluids, one imposed a kinematic condition guaranteeing conservation of mass.  Saffman and Taylor in the late '50's computed explicitly a family of profiles of the invading finger, parameterized by the asymptotic upstream width of the finger. Experimental data however show that such a width is always 1/2 of the width of the channel.<br/><br/>The mathematical and physical mechanism by which Nature selects the solution corresponding to the value 1/2 of  the parameter, is not well understood. We have shown that among all the Saffman-Taylor explicit solutions, the one corresponding to the value 1/2 of the parameter, maximizes the thrust of the fluid across the channel at the tip of the invading finger. The problem, which is non--variational, is recast into one that has a variational form, through a Baiocchi-type transformation. The non-variational nature of the problem, set in an unbounded domain, is accounted for by a precise description of the asymptotic behavior at infinity of the solutions of the corresponding non-linear elliptic equation. Such estimation is achieved through non-standard applications of the Harnack Inequality and the identification of the 'nose' of the finger. We have also shown that for the value 1/2 of the parameter the motion of the finger occurs by mean curvature. An effort will be made to connect and understand these two features. <br/>In another direction, we will investigate local behavior and uniqueness of solutions to the <br/>Buckley--Leverett system. This is a system of two degenerate (in the principal part)  and singular (in the lower order terms) of parabolic equations. The degeneracy yields <br/>a hyperbolic-parabolic behavior. Kruzkov observed that  uniqueness of boundary value problems for such a system is linked to the regularity of the solutions. We intend to use recent ideas developed in connection with hyperbolic--parabolic problems and our long standing investigations on the regularity of solutions for degenerate evolution equations, <br/>to investigate the uniqueness of such solutions. More theoretically, we will continue our investigations on Harnack--type estimates for solutions of degenerate parabolic equations and quasi--minima in the Calculus of Variations. The Hele-Shaw problem simulates the penetration of oil into water.  It's importance stems from its applications to the recovery of oil trapped into layered rocky soil (hence the 2-dimensional model). Physically one observes that the asymptotic width of the penetrating finger is 1/2 of the width of the channel. The natural questions we are attempting to understand is why Nature selects such a value and what's the underlying mathematical and physical reason for such a specific selection to occur. On the same realm of physical application one asks whether two fluids one penetrating into another (Buckley-Leverett system) do so in a unique manner, and if not, what is the reason the a possible lack of uniqueness. The supporting mathematics to such physical issues involves fine estimates of the local behavior of solutions of degenerate and/or singular evolution partial differential equations, such as <br/>for example the Harnack inequality.<br/>"

Zdunik to the dimensions greater than 2, we propose to deal with the Hausdorff dimension of the harmonic measure of the limit set (whose closure is a topological Cantor set) of an IFS. Developing our rigidity investigations we intend to prove the geometrical rigidity of higher dimensional limits sets whose closures are topological disks.  We intend to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for conformal measures of regular IFS to satisfy the doubling property and as an application we would present a characterization of all subsets of natural numbers which generate the continued fraction systems with conformal measures satisfying the doubling property. Passing to rational functions we propose to deal with no-recurrent maps (more precisely, the critical points contained in the Julia sets are assumed to be non-recurrent). We would like to work on the proof of equality of the Hausdorff dimension and box dimension of these maps, to study various definitions of pressure and the escape rates. Employing the concept of affine laminations, we propose to develop together with M. Lyubich the thermodynamic formalism of semi-hyperbolic rational functions. Together with J. Kotus and A.

These notions are studied from two interlaced viewpoints. One is that of various dynamical systems and the other is that of geometric measure theory as applied to recursively generated objects. These approaches naturally meld with one another and lead to some interesting mixtures of ideas. We have developed an extensive theory of conformal iterated function systems, the iteration of infinitely many conformal maps, which may be hyperbolic (uniformly contracting) or parabolic (at least one map has an indifferent fixed point) and also have made some applications of it to some well known problems, e.g., continued fractions and Apollonian packings. There are yet some fundamental outstanding problems and several others which arise within the context of applications. We want to extend and develop this theory to cover a more structured iteration of maps-whose governed by directed graphs or substitutions and random iterations and an appropriate multifractal formalisn for these systems. This has many applications not only to the study of rational, entire and meromorphic functions, but also to newly emerging theory of quantization dimension problems arising from statistics and engineering. We also intend to apply our theory to limit sets generated by various cellular automata. This could be very important for compressing visual images.<br/><br/>"

Linking them together is the notion  of viscosity solution. Part of the proposal focuses on equations of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) type that are related <br/>to optimal control of stochastic partial differential equations. The HJB equations associated with their control are equations in infinite dimensional spaces. The theory of such equations is not well developed. The principal investigator (PI) studies them in the project paying special attention to several equations related to problems of particular interest. One of such problems is <br/>optimal control of fluid flow that can be reformulated as optimal control of  deterministic or stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. Another problem comes from mathematical finance and is related to option pricing. It includes analysis of infinite dimensional equivalent of ``Black-Scholes"" equation and its nonlinear version, so called ``Black-Scholes-Barenblatt"" equation. HJB equations in Hilbert (or Banach) spaces are the key to the dynamic programming analysis of optimal control problems of systems driven by partial differential equations.<br/>These HJB equations must be investigated from the point of view of generalized solutions. Viscosity solutions should provide the right approach to such equations and the proposed research should be an important ingredient in setting the stage for optimal control of infinite dimensional stochastic systems. The PI also proposes to investigate a class of fully nonlinear non-divergence form uniformly elliptic equations that includes generalizations of quasilinear <br/>equations and certain equations of geometric type, an important class in the elliptic theory. Such equations have not been studied systematically, especially when they are discontinuous in the spatial variable. The equations do not have classical solutions and the PI wants to extend the theory of so called L^p-viscosity solutions to this class. In particular the PI plans to investigate <br/>the question of regularity of solutions of such equations. This is a major open problem of elliptic partial differential equations and the PI proposes several possible new approaches to it that may give rise to new and interesting techniques.<br/><br/><br/>The notion of viscosity solution is one of the main tools of nonlinear partial differential equations and it has found applications in areas as diverse as optimal control, image processing, moving fronts and phase transitions, statistical mechanics, economics, mathematical finance. The motivation for studying some problems described in the proposal comes from optimal control,<br/>especially control of stochastic partial differential equations. Their theory is in a state of rapid development and is fueled by modeling questions coming from physics, population biology, chemistry, and economics and mathematical finance. The problem of optimal control of fluid flow  is one of the basic engineering problems and has numerous applications in areas like combustion theory, aero and hydrodynamic control, Tokomak magnetic fusion, ocean and atmospheric prediction just to name a few. Problems related to the Musiela model of interest rates come from the modern theory of option pricing.

Such systems<br/>play an increasingly important role in the rigorous mathematical foundation of<br/>statistical physics, so that the study of their chaotic (i. e. mixing)<br/>properties is getting more and more physical relevance. The project mainly<br/>focuses on a fundamental conjecture regarding this family of dynamical<br/>systems, namely the celebrated ""Boltzmann-Sinai Ergodic Conjecture"", which<br/>states that any finite system of (totally elastic) hard spheres moving on a<br/>flat torus is fully hyperbolic and ergodic, of course, on the level set of its<br/>trivial first integrals.

The third part of the project<br/>aims at the biggest open question in the topic of Wojtkowski's one-dimensional<br/>falling balls: Wojtkowski's still unsolved conjecture on the full hyperbolicity<br/>of the falling ball system with nonincreasing masses. (And such that not all<br/>masses are the same, of course.) Beside these, the question of ergodicity<br/>(possibly, under the condition that a strictly concave potential acts) is also<br/>posed and targeted.<br/><br/> The foundation of statistical physics (like heat theory, dynamical theory<br/>of fluids and gases) took place in the last third of the 18th century, mainly<br/>by the groundbreaking works of Boltzmann and Helmholz. That foundation was,<br/>however, based upon a strong hypothesis made by Boltzmann himself. That<br/>hypothesis claims that any physical system with a huge number of interacting<br/>particles (like molecules) has the property that for any fixed total energy<br/>and initial state, the system will evolve to any other state with the same<br/>energy. Although this conjecture, if taken literally, mathematically cannot<br/>happen, yet the precise mathematical formalism and its rigorous verification<br/>for different models of statistical physics bears a particular importance to<br/>the understanding the physics of the surrounding world.<br/><br/>"

For<br/>example, attempts to solve the Levy problem in complex analysis led to the<br/>development of deep results about hypo-elliptic partial differential<br/>equations, and these problems, in turn, led to developments in harmonic<br/>analysis on nilpotent Lie groups such as the Heisenberg group. Many of these<br/>related results dealt with integral operators that are modeled on the<br/>classical singular integrals such as the Hilbert transform and the Riesz<br/>transforms whose study goes back to the middle of the twentieth century. In<br/>recent years, it has become clear that new problems in complex analysis<br/>require the understanding of new kinds of operators in which the<br/>singularities of the kernel are considerably more complicated than the<br/>classical singular integrals. The research described in this proposal is<br/>directed toward understanding these more complicated situations. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

In these operators the integration is over surfaces of positive codimension, and we seek estimates reflecting curvature properties of the surface.  Suppose for example, for each point, P, in<br/>the Euclidean space we have a one dimensional curve emanating from P. From a given function, f, we form a new function Mf, called the maximal function, whose value at the point P is the supremum of the averages of f over the curve emanating from P.  This then defines a transformation from functions on the Euclidean space to functions on<br/>the Euclidean space.  We want to know for what curves and what values of p this transformation is bounded on the Lebesgue space of functions with integrable pth power.  Positive results here imply variants of Lebesgue's theorem on the differentiation of the integral.  Namely if<br/>the transformation from a function f to Mf is bounded on one of these Lebesgue spaces, then for every function f in that Lebesgue space and almost every point P, the value f(P) may be recovered as a limit of averages of f over small portions of the curve through P.  I am also<br/>interested in discrete analogues of these operators in which integration is replaced by sums over discrete sets of points.<br/><br/>A basic problem for over a hundred years of the branch of mathematics known as Classical Analysis is that of recovering a function from averages of that function.  This problem has been intimately connected with that of approximating an arbitrary function by a combination of<br/>simpler functions which in turn has been one of the main ways mathematics is applied to real world problems.  I plan to study the problem of recovering functions on Euclidean space of at least two dimensions, from averages over small pieces of one dimensional curves. For a continuous function this is an easy question, but for wildly discontinuous functions it is a subtle problem depending on curvature<br/>properties of the curves.  I also plan to study related<br/>transformations and discrete analogues of these transformations where the averaging process is over discrete sets of points.<br/><br/><br/>"

Moving away from the Hilbert space setting, an additional avenue of research will focus on obtaining a geometric characterization of interpolating sequences for the Bloch space. Yet another direction of research, suitable for experimental computer work by undergraduates who could search for useful evidence, involves the question of polynomial factors of harmonic polynomials in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimension.

Similarly, the exited states of a free charged particle are not stable. It is shown that photons which are not bound to the electron escape ballisticly while the particle relaxes to a state of minimal energy followed by a cloud of soft photons (dressed one-electron state) in which it propagates according to a reduced dynamics. The key problem in the case of an atom is to show that no infrared problem occurs. For a free charged particle an infrared problem does occure and one has to deal with nonequivalent representations of the CCR. - The proofs require as an ingredient good control over the spectral properties of the Hamilton operator and, in addition, asymptotic completeness of Rayleigh scattering and Compton scattering of the respective system. These prerequisites are established by methods and techniques inspired by similar methods and techniques in the spectral and scattering theory of $N$-particle Schr\""odinger operators, such as Mourre theory, propagationestimates, the construction of suitable propagation observables and others.

Furthermore the phenomenon of radiative decay (or the relaxation to the ground state) and the similar phenomenon of return to equilibrium at positive temperature play key roles in attempts to understand dissipative, irreversible behavior in the quantum theory of open systems. The mathematical methods which are developed apply equally to other physical systems such a particle in a crystal interacting with quantized lattice vibrations (phonons), and find currently application in the study of return to equilibrium of matter interacting with radiation at positive temperature.<br/>"

We have been attempting to understand the nature of noncommutative dynamics for many years, and our approach recently has been based on the theory of E_0-semigroups.  There has been exciting recent progress on several fronts, the full implications of which are still being sorted out.  In multivariable operator theory, we have introduced a ""curvature"" invariant which is somewhat analogous to the integral of curvature of a Riemannian manifold.  We have shown that it is an integer in many cases by relating it to another invariant, the Euler characteristic of a certain finitely generated module.  However, the key formula is valid only in certain cases, and we are now in the process of relating the curvature invariant to a more subtle integer invariant, essentially the index of a ""Dirac operator"" that can be associated with the given n-tuple of operators.<br/>In quantum theory the observable quantities are represented by operators.  The algebra of operators differs sharply from the algebra of numbers because the result of multiplying two operators A and B depends on the order in which they are multiplied: AB is not the same as BA.  This failure of the commutativity law has profound consequences, the most basic one being the uncertainty principle.  The flow of time in quantum theory is represented by certain transformations, each of which moves operators in subtle ways, and the dynamics of quantum theory is the study of such groups of transformations.  This ""noncommutative dynamics"" is very different from the commutative dynamics of classical physics.  Our approach is based on a certain notion of causality, which involves the technical idea of semigroups of endomorphisms.  Recent progress has been very encouraging - with the discovery of new connections with probability theory, in which one may now pass back and forth between noncommutative flows of time and certain random processes which can be thought of as ""off-white"" noise, in that they are close to white noise, but not exactly white noise.  In a different but related direction, our work on sets of (commuting) operators establishes significant connections between sets of operators and fundamental geometric ideas such as curvature.  At issue is a numerical invariant for sets of operators.  While this invariant appears to be a real number capable of taking on any value, it is in fact an integer.  What integer?  The answer that appears to be emerging now is that this number is the numerical index of a certain Dirac operator.  There appear to be significant connections with other parts of mathematics, including Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry.<br/>"

The problems that the PI would<br/>continue to work on include the geometric structure of level sets, in<br/>particular the nodal sets and the singular sets.

A new<br/>research trend is the study of the relation between the growth of nodal<br/>sets and the growth of solutions themselves. It is expected that they<br/>are closely related to each other. The second theme of this project is<br/>to study the isometric embedding of two-dimensional metrics in the three<br/>dimensional Euclidean space, both locally and globally. In general, the<br/>isometric embedding is based on the complicated Nash-Moser iteration,<br/>which requires detailed discussions of the linearized equations. Moreover,<br/>the global isometric embedding is expected to meet some topological<br/>obstacles. Difficulties arise when the Gaussian curvature changes its<br/>sign. Singular sets may appear even if the embedding exists.<br/><br/>The problems of the singular sets originate from the material science<br/>and the control theory.

The first group of questions on convergence which will be addressed concerns the mean convergence of averages of measurements made on a stochastic process at a random sequence of times that is chosen in advance. Other questions concern randomly generated times which yield to sampling along sequences with big gaps. The second group of questions concerns subsequence ergodic theorems for subsequences coming from members of Hardy fields, Results obtained by the PI in the previous grant periods suggest that in the context of Hardy fields, a meaningful characterization of the ``good'' sequences of measurements is possible.  Indeed, due to a significant advance in the previous grant period, a complete characterization of good sequences of measurements is at reach.  This work for one dimensional averages gives us confidence to start exploring possible higher dimensional results, therefore extending the work of Stein and Weinger. The third group of questions concerns upcrossings and related oscillatory behavior of the ergodic averages. This line of research was initiated by Bishop, Bourgain, Kalikow, B. Weiss and others. Wierdl and his collaborators discovered a fundamental connection between Ergodic Theory and martingales.  This discovery---which often manifests itself as a bounded squarefunction of the difference between<br/>ergodic averages and certain martingales---allows one to translate many of the results of Martingale Theory, such as squarefunction, large deviation or jump inequalities, to ergodic theoretical and harmonic analytical results. Part of the proposed work is to extend the investigations on upcrossings to other operators such as higher dimensional singular integrals and averages over various sequences of domains with an eye on possible extensions to group actions.  These investigations will reveal deep connections between ergodic theory, harmonic analysis and probability theory. Ergodic theory grew out of statistical mechanics, the statistical description of matter. This latter means, for example, that instead of describing the behavior of each individual water-molecule in a cup of<br/>water, one is satisfied with finding the average speed, energy etc. of the molecules. But then the fundamental question arises: how can we measure the average speed or energy. It is clearly impossible to measure the speed of each individual molecule and then take the mean of the data. The ergodic theorem says that it is enough to select a single molecule, measure its speed in each second, and if we make enough measurements and take the average of the data, the number will be basically the average speed of all the molecules in the cup of water. This amazing theorem has one drawback: it requires that the measurements are taken exactly at every second.  But in practice, the measurements might be made at, say, 1, 3, 4, 6, 11,... seconds or, even worse, at 1.1, 2.4, 2.9, 4.3,...  seconds instead of at 1, 2, 3,... seconds.  Obviously, we would like to know whether we still can compute accurately the average speed from the measured data. The proposed research addresses two basic questions about measurements: 1) What more practical sequence of times (other than 1, 2, 3,...) for measurements will still yield the average speed, energy, etc.? 2) How many measurements one has to make to get a useful approximation to the average speed, energy, etc.?  Note that the ergodic theorem just says ""if you make enough measurements, you get useful information about average speed, energy, etc."", but it does not say in any way how many is ""enough""?<br/><br/><br/>"

Effros and Ruan are continuing their collaboration on operator spaces. Effros and Ruan are particularly interested in studying the local theory of von Neumann algebraic preduals. Building on their earlier result with Junge that that all von Neumann preduals are locally reflexive, and that the injective preduals have a simple characterization, Effros and Ruan hope to prove that the general architecture of a von Neumann algebra can be described in terms of the local structure of the preduals. Effros also intends to look at the quantized analogues of rotundity. A number of Popa's research projects will be concerned with his axiomatization of the standard invariant for subfactors. In particular he plans to work on the most challenging problem in subfactor theory: finding techniques that would be applicable to the theory of subfactors of hyperfinite factors. He intends to continue his studies with Bisch of property T in the context of subfactors. In a very different direction, he will investigate the structure theory of C*-algebras based in part on his earlier work on the theory of local approximation by finite dimensional algebras, and of the relative Dixmier property for C*-algebras. Takesaki plans to continue his development of a canonical approach to the theory of type III factors. In the next stage of his research program, Takesaki and his collaborators intend to complete their studies of outer automorphism actions of a discrete amenable group on an approximately finite dimensional (or hyperfinite) factor of type III-lambda (lambda larger than zero) and he expects that the type III-zero case will yield to this analysis. He will continue his investigation into the most difficult problem in the area: the classfication of one-parameter groups of automorphisms. Takesaki expects to apply classfication principles learned from factor theory to the classification of certain classes of C*-algebras.<br/><br/>Operator algebraists study the mathematics of quantum physics. In 1926 Heisenberg discovered that the paradoxes of atomic particles could be resolved with a modified version of Newtonian physics. He showed that the equations of the classical theory were still valid, provided one reinterpreted their symbols. In the classical theory these variables stand for functions. Heisenberg showed one can predict the behaviour of atomic particles if one instead regarded the variables as representing possibly infinite arrays or ``matrices'' of numbers. A few years later, von Neumann gave a mathematically precise formulation of these quantum variable in terms of Hilbert space operators. He went on to suggest that since the classical notions of measurement and geometry that underlie so much of mathematics no longer correspond to our understanding of the real world, it was necessary to seek quantized versions of mathematics. As in physics, one must begin by replacing functions by operators. In the last fifty years, operator algebraists have succeeded in quantizing a remarkable number of areas of mathematics, including analysis, topology, differential and Riemanian geometry, probability theory, and the theory of symmetry. As in quantum physics, the quantum world of mathematics is remarkable in the completely new phenomena that occur. The theory has had profound applications to various areas, including knot theory and low-dimensional topology, index theory on foliated manifolds, the classification of dynamical systems, and most recently, mathematical frameworks for both the standard model of quantum field theory (Connes) and renormalization theory (Connes and Kreimer). In this broad framework, Effros is one of the founders of quantized functional analysis (operator space theory), Popa is a leading figure in the theory of quantum symmetries (subfactor theory), and Takesaki is internationally recognized for his work on the modern theory of non-commutative integration and its use in studying the structure of von Neumann algebras and their automorphism groups<br/>"

Even for the degree two, the upper bound is not yet found, and its existence is not yet proved. It makes sense to consider ""restricted versions"" of the Hilbert 16th problem. Namely, the set or all polynomial vector fields is replaced by a particular subset of by a similar class. The examples are Lienard and Abel equations (the latter ones are polynomial in the phase variable with coefficients 1-periodic in time). Even for these equations the problem of the number of limit cycles stays open. It is solved by the PI with an extra restriction: Abel equations, and Lienard ones with the polynomial of odd degree, are considered together with an upper bound for the magnitudes of  the coefficients; the upper estimate on the number of limit cycles depends on this upper bound of the magnitudes. This is the result from the prior NSF support. In the current project we try to get rid of this latter restriction, and to give an estimate of the number of limit cycles that depends on the degrees of the polynomials in the right hand side only; for Abel equations the coefficients should be trigonometric polynomials of given degree. We hope to use mighty tools of the theory of complex analytic foliations, growth and zeros theorems for holomorphic functions and methods developed under the prior NSF support. Another important problem to be studied is the infinitesimal Hilbert 16th problem. It requires to estimate the number of limit cycles generated by a small perturbation from the ovals of the Hamiltonian polynomial vector field; closed orbits of the latter field form continuous families. This problem is reduced to the estimate of the number of zeros of an Abelian integral, that is, an integral of a polynomial 1-form over the ovals of a real polynomial in the plane; the estimate should be given in terms of the degrees of the polynomial Hamiltonian function and of the integrand. This problem was investigated by the author since 69; later on by Yakovenko, D.Novikov, Horosov, Gavrilov, Petrov, Khovanski, Varchenko and others. Some progress was obtained by Glutsuk and the author for the restricted version of the problem when the Hamiltonian polynomial is taken of a special type and of arbitrary degree. One of the goals of this project is to get an explicit upper estimate that is expected to be an exponential of a polynomial of the degree of the Hamiltonian function, provided that the integrand has a smaller degree.<br/><br/>The theory of dynamical systems is the realm of determinism, on one hand, and of chaos, on the other hand. Vector fields in the phase space of dimension higher than two form the realm of chaos. This was understood in 1960's, and henceforth, this realm is the subject of the top interest for mathematicians, computer scientists and physicists. On the other hand, the classical subject of planar differential equations which may be called ""realm<br/>of order"" attracted the interest of researchers during more that one hundred years, beginning with Poincare and Hilbert. Hilbert's 16th problem is the main one in this domain. It persists the efforts of mathematicians during 100 years, and it is clear now that simplified ""restricted"" versions of the problem should be attacked first. The project suggests some concrete ways of this attack based on new ideas and the progress from the prior NSF support.<br/>"
