Fox University of Colorado  The project consists of three problems related to harmonic analysis and K-theory. The first problem is concerned with studying the structure of the representation ring defined by Kasparov for the general linear group over a local field. We are developing a method of ""induction"" from the representation ring of a maximal parabolic to the representation ring of the full group.  The main issue in this problem is an analytic one, involving the construction of an appropriate operator between G-representations that almost commutes , in the sense of Kasparov, with the G-action. The second problem concerns the explicit computation of multiplicity's of irreducible representations of compact groups in the kernel and cokernel of transversally elliptic differential operators. The third problem is to study the explicit decomposition of the quasi-regular representation for an algebraic solvable Lie group.  The main focus is to apply the fairly new results of Anoussis on orbital integrals for solvable Lie groups in conjunction with the Selberg trace formula.          The overall focus of this project is to use symmetry to study several complicated systems.  The notion of symmetry pervades the sciences and while it  is difficult to give a precise mathematical definition ( but such a definition does exist), we see symmetry every day. The ""squareness"" of a square or the ""roundness"" of a circle are two examples of symmetry. The reason symmetry is such an important idea is that it is systems that possess intrinsic symmetry that scientists  can analyze. The symmetry of a problem provides us with powerful tools for developing effective means of computation. As an example, one of the problems that this proposal is concerned with is finding effective means of calculating, very explicitly, the ""G- indices"" of certain differential operators: we are counting certain types of solutions of a problem where symmetry is present. This leads to the development of a type of Feynma n diagram  that incorporates both the differential operator as well as the underlying symmetries.  Feynman diagram techniques have proved to be very important both in academic science as well as applied science in industry. For example,  the General Motors Research lab outside of Detroit has mathematicians that specialize in Feynman diagram techniques, which are used to solve the mathematics behind very practical problems."

The main focus is on wave interactions that arise in transonic   flow, reflections of a shock by a wedge, multiphase flow through the porous   media and chemically reactive fluids. A benchmark problem for understanding   the interaction of nonlinear waves in two-space dimensions is the shock   reflection problem. Depending on the shock strength and the wedge angle   different reflection patterns can occur. Open problems regard the transition   criteria between different types of reflection, bifurcation diagram   describing two-dimensional elementary waves, and the existence theory  that would provide a solution space describing possible singularities.   This research project proposes a study of self-similar wave interactions  in two space dimensions as a first step towards understanding these issues.    The study is based on the nonlinear analysis of free-boundary problems for   transonic shock waves, on the wave curve analysis of quasi-one-dimensional   Riemann problems that arise in hyperbolic wave interactions, and on   numerical simulations of the corresponding wave structures. The results from   t his project would provide a fundamental contribution towards understanding   the nonlinear stability  of transonic shock waves and the development of a   general theory of two-dimensional wave interactions.      In one-dimensional systems of conservation laws, global existence and   uniqueness of weak solutions is still an open question. A delicate dependence   of weak solutions on the precise form of diffusion plays a crucial role in   distinguishing  physically relevant solutions (in oil reservoir modeling,   chemically reactive fluids, elastic plastic deformation, and in numerical   simulations). In this project an organized approach to the study of the   influence of the precise form of viscosity on the existence and uniqueness   of weak solutions has been proposed. Preliminary results surprisingly   indicate symmetry breaking solutions for some parabolic conservation laws.            Mathematical issues studied in this project derive from applications   such as high-performance computing simulations in oil recovery, and the   stability of transonic flow. In both applications (nonlinear) waves arise   naturally (e.g., propagation of an interface between water and oil   in oil reservoir simulations, formation and propagation of shock waves   around a wing in a supersonic flight, formation and interaction of waves in a   converging-diverging nozzle). Numerical methods used in computer   simulations of these phenomena are sensitive to certain parameters. For   example, numerical schemes that produce artificial (non-physical) diffusion   may produce misleading answers that may result in high production costs.   Therefore, understanding the dependence of solutions on the parameters in   a problem (called the stability of solutions) is crucial in devising efficient   numerical methods that would produce physically meaningful solutions.   This project focuses of the stability of nonlinear waves that   arise in a large class of models used in many areas of Federal  strategic interests. Two such appl ications are described above. Because   of the complexity of the problem, various state-of-the-art theoretical   techniques (e.g., nonlinear analysis of free-boundary problems, dynamical   systems approach to the influence of diffusion on weak Riemann solutions)   coupled with computer simulations, need to be used to tackle the problem.   Preliminary results indicate new phenomena that have not been studied before   (e.g., the occurrence of singularities in transonic flow and symmetry   breaking solutions in oil recovery). These results are crucial   in tailoring computer codes to capture the (""correct"") physical behavior."

A new approach to constructing good metrics for lower bounds for extremal distance will be applied to the Angular Derivative Problem of Ahlfors  1930 .  Secondly, he will investigate the accuracy of a promising new technique for the numerical computation of conformal maps. Thirdly, he will attempt to improve   constructions of interpolating functions for the Dirichlet space and its multipliers, using more natural linear combinations of reproducing kernels.     Conformal mapping has been used as a tool in science and engineering for many years. One way conformal maps are used is to transform a problem on a complicated region in the complex plane to a related problem on a ""standard"" region, such as a disk or half-plane, where known techniques can be used.  The solution on the standard region is then transformed by the inverse of the conformal map to a solution of the original problem on the original region. Classically, this method was used for problems related to Laplace's equation.  For example, temperature at equilibrium on a thin metallic plate satisfies Laplace's equation. There have been numerous non-classical applications of conformal maps developed in the last twenty five years, many of which are not governed by Laplace's equation. There are applications in electro-magnetics, vibrating membranes and acoustics, transverse vibrations and buckling of plates, elasticity, heat transfer, and fluid flow for example.  While early applications used explicit analytic representations for conformal maps, modern uses require conformal maps of more complicated regions which cannot be represented easily in terms of elementary functions. One must therefore resort to  numerical approximations to the desired conformal maps.  Marshall will investigate the accuracy of a new technique which rapidly computes conformal maps and their inverses.  This technique is fast  enough that it can be used for experimentation on a typical workstation. The angular derivative problem he will  investigate is about geometrical conditions on the boundary of a region that guarantee that certain conformal maps (defined inside the region) extend to be conformal at a point on the boundary.  Dirichlet functions on the disk are not conformal, but the image of the disk has finite area (counting overlaps). They arise from potentials with bounded total energy. The interpolation problems Marshall will study are closely related to constructing a temperature distribution on a thin metal plate with preassigned values at certain points on the plate, and with smallest possible total energy."

In particular, a finite set of polynomials is a stable set of equations in commuting unknowns in the following sense:  any approximate solution (a point in Euclidean space where those  polynomials take a small value) will be close to the solution set.  The  same set of polynomials can become unstable when applied to operator values. Indeed, they often become unstable even when only matrix values are allowed in the variables; there can be tuples of matrices upon which the polynomials take small values and which are far away from the matrix-valued solution set to the equations.  A primary goal of this project will be to determine computable invariants for differentiating such ""phantom"" approximate solutions"" from perturbations of true solutions.  These phantom approximate solutions can be misleading in the context of computer simulations of mathematical models.   A numerical linear algebra package cannot make exact calculations with matrices.  Until last year, for example, there was no way to tell if a matrix which almost satisfied the so-called normality equation represented an approximation of an actual normal matrix.  This is now known to be true.  Since much of the theory, and applications, of linear algebra must be changed when working with non-normal matrices, this is an important theoretical advance.  It adds to our confidence in our reliance on computer modeling.  By adding to the list of stability results that can be applied to linear algebra, this project should enhance that confidence."

Virtually every branch of mathematics, from algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry to applied analysis, Fourier analysis, and computer science, has its corpus of theory arising from the study of polynomials. This project intends to study polynomial inequalities and their applications in classical analysis, approximation theory, orthogonal polynomials, and number theory. The proposed research is about polynomials in a general sense, so it includes Chebyshev spaces, Markov spaces, Descartes systems, Muntz polynomials, rational function spaces, as well as polynomials with various constraints such as restricted zeros, integer coefficients, and nonnegative coefficients in various bases.  The project continues several years of successful work on a variety of topics and describes various new directions.            Polynomials are one of the most basic concepts of mathematics. Throughout history people have found problems concerning polynomials especially fascinating. Each of the ""three famous problems"" in the ""Heroic Age"" dealt with zeros of polynomials: squaring the circle, duplicating the cube, and trisecting an    angle. Historically, questions relating to polynomials, for example, the solution of polynomial equations, gave rise to some of the most important problems of the day. Besides the natural intellectual interest in them, polynomials, and in particular extremal problems involving polynomials, arise not only in almost every field of mathematics, but also in other sciences, especially in engineering. However, it is often the case that polynomials related to a practical problem belong to a restricted class. Depending on the nature of the problem, some additional pieces of information on the polynomial may be known. For filter design, polynomials with coefficients from {-1,0,1} are very useful, because, if they are used, then the filter can be implemented without the use of multiplications; their implementati on requires only additions and subtractions. This reduces the cost of implementation. The problem is to find such polynomials which have a ""lowpass"" behavior on the unit circle of the complex plane. Roughly, that is, they approximate 1 in a neighborhood of 1 and approximate 0 in a neighborhood of -1. The project plans to study extremal properties of polynomials with coefficients from {-1,0,1, {0,1}, and {-1,1}. Unimodular polynomials (with coefficients that are complex numbers of modulus 1) are also important in engineering. In some other problems related to physics, in particular electrostatics, information about the distribution of the zeros of the polynomial is known. ""Gaped"" polynomials (polynomials with a large number of zero coefficients) are used to analyze, for example, the time-optimal boundary controls for the one-dimensional heat equation. The proposal intends to explore further applications of polynomial inequalities as well as to offer a systematic study of naturally arising questions regarding polynomials subject to various constraints."

Banach space theory forms the natural framework for studying  geometries which are not Euclidean, while the theory of C* algebras is the  standard framework for quantum mechanics. Operator spaces are the  quantization (in the sense of quantum mechanics) of Banach spaces.  This  very new theory has already (e.g., in work of Junge and Pisier) had an  impact on C* algebras, and part of this work involves approaching other  classical problems in C* algebras/operator theory through operator spaces.   The nonlinear geometry of Banach spaces is also in a neophyte stage, but  work of Bourgain, Gorelik, Johnson-Lindenstrauss-Schechtman, and others  suggest that this subject is ready to take-off.  There is reason to hope  that the nonlinear theory of Banach spaces will have applications in  classical nonlinear analysis comparable to the many applications of the  linear theory to classical linear analysis."

Band-limited signals are functions obtained as superposition of periodic waves whose frequencies remain bounded. Most signals in applications are band-limited and they can be recovered from the knowledge of their values on a discrete set of instants in time.

In particular, the discrete character of wavelets and the techniques to be used make them amenable to numerical applications. Error estimates in approximations and the processes to minimize them  trans late into results about  compression of information.  Other related problems are found in tomography and  medical imaging. Transmission problems arise in physical situations in which an object interacts with the surrounding ambient space or when an object is composed of several different materials.  These problems require the simultaneous solution, inside and outside of a region in space, of a systems of differential equations that are coupled by  conditions on the boundary of the region. Effective tools for studying such problems in smooth domains are available, but it is very important to further develop the theory so it can adapted to domains that have corners or edges since they model realistic situation in the applied sciences."

It provides the mathematical foundation to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, which is the source of much of our understanding of the structure of matter. In a rich variety of circumstances the models based on the Schrodinger equation and its nonlinear   generalizations give the correct description of the physical reality. From the mathematical point of view, the Schrodinger equation is an unfailing source of deep and challenging problems. The proposed investigation, aiming at the analysis of the basic properties of solutions of linear and nonlinear Schrodinger equations, has  direct bearing on  some of the fundamental issues facing researchers in partial differential equations and harm onic analysis."

An approach based on the connection between embedding  of Banach spaces into Lp, positive definite functions and stable  measures was discovered by P. Levy in the 30's, and since then   has been under intensive development. The author's contributions  to this direction include a solution to the 1938 Schoenberg's   problem on positive definite functions, construction of common  subspaces of Lp-spaces, a Fourier transform criterion of isometric  embedding into Lp contributing to the 1937 P. Levy's problem,   a solution to the isometric version of the 1969 Kwapien's problem   on Banach subspaces of Lp with p less than 1. All these results   were obtained by using methods of Fourier analysis. The project   addresses open problems in this direction. The problems include   the description of positive definite norm dependent function,   the related question on the existence of isotropic measures   which are not mixtures of stable measures, characterization of   subspaces of Lp and zonoids, isomorphic versions of Kwapien's   problem and the problem on common subspaces, application of the  Fourier transform to computing the Banach-Mazur distance,  connections between the Fourier transform of norms and duality  of Banach spaces, and between the Fourier transform and the volume  of sections of the unit ball. The problem of extending the Fourier   transform technique to certain infinite dimensional situations   has applications to stochastic processes and electrical engineering.        The Fourier transform, as a method of decomposing a signal into   a combination of simple frequencies, has proved to be  an important tool in different areas of mathematics, physics,  engineering and statistics. The author has been working on  applications of the Fourier transform to the Banach space theory  for more than ten years, and  his contributions include a solution  to the Schoenberg problem on positive definite functions which had   been open since 1938, extension of the Fourier transform technique to   infinite dimensional situations, construction of common subspaces of Banach  spaces and other results. Work in this direction provides  important connections between functional analysis, harmonic analysis  and probability theory. For example, calculating the Fourier transform  of a norm one can find the volume of sections of convex bodies in  spaces of arbitrary dimension, or construct random variables  which are stable under summation. Situations where one has to calculate   the Fourier transform of the norm (distance) of a Banach space occur  in different applied areas. For example, if it is impossible to   measure a signal directly, and one only has the information about   the distance from the signal to fixed functions in the norm of a certain  Banach space, then one of the ways to identify the signal is to  solve a certain convolution equation involving the norm, which can  usually be solved using the Fourier transform technique. This happens  when, because of noise, one can only see the maximum of a signal   (the supremum-norm), which often happens in electrical engineering.  In the study of the strength of fibers, it is important   to find the frequencies of the main defects while one can not  measure the strength at every point and only knows the weakest  points of certain pieces of the material. Finding the spectral  function of the strength is an example of how the Fourier  transform of norms works for the study of materials."

The research in unique continuation is oriented towards semilinear problems and problems with unbounded potentials.  In the area of semilinear hyperbolic equations, the main effort will be directed towards the study of a class of weighted Sobolev spaces attached to (mostly) hyperbolic partial differential operators. These spaces adapted to the hyperbolic operator seem to be the natural setting for the study of semilinear equations; it appears that they are the key to further progress in the field.  A main goal is to understand the multiplicative structure of these spaces, including  null forms estimates.  The first aim of the research on hyperbolic boundary value problems  is to complete the ongoing PI's study of the trace regularity properties for solutions to such problems. This is a key step for the second part, whose goal is to  understand the Strichartz type estimates for solutions to hyperbolic boundary value problems, and subsequently, to use this in the study of semilinear hyperbolic  boundary value problems.  It is the PI's hope that in the long run this research program could also lead to progress in the study of quasilinear hyperbolic equations.    A partial differential equation is an equation which describes the relation between rates of change of quantities which depend on more than one variable.  Such equations are used to  model many phenomenas in physics, economics, etc. The aim of this project is to investigate some specific properties of solutions to certain partial differential equations.  Part of the work is motivated by problems arising in control theory and in inverse problems; there one tries to reconstruct information about either the state of a system or th e equations governing the system, based on partial observations.

One of the motivations for studying the infinite dimensional versions of these questions comes from the study of quantum field theories, a   certain class of mathematical theories used by physicists to describe sub-atomic particles. Quantum field theories deal with the same issues alluded to above and are closely related to the mathematical theories studied by the P.I..  The P.I.'s work may in fact ha ve future   ramifications for quantum field theories and hence particle physics."

The dilations and local coordinates relative to which the approximating systems are constructed can be naturally obtained from the Lie algebra structure of the vector fields defining the original system.  Also, an ASFC of appropriate homogeneous order for the approximating system is a local ASFC for the original system.  The method will be to extend the classical   linear, quadratic, regulator technique to a nonlinear, homogeneous regulator.  A first goal is to classify homogeneous, affine, systems which admit a smooth ASFC.  Linear, controllable, approximating systems   are divided into equivalence classes via the action of the linear feedback group, and canonical representatives of each equivalence class are well known.  Hermes proposes tho study the equivalence classes of small time, or large time, locally controllable homogeneous approximations having known smooth ASFC, under the action of a homogeneity preserving group of transformations, and to find canonical representatives of the equivalence classes.  The odd power integrators provide an example of such.  The above topics have implications to questions of regularity conditions for viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, another topic to be studied.    Many mathematical systems, e.g., an inverted compound pendulum, a robotic arm, a high performance aircraft, a communications satellite, either are, or are designed to be, unstable in their uncontrolled mode   of operation.  Stability of the system is achieved via the introduction of external controls.  In past decades, construction of stabilizing controllers was achieved via the use of linear approximations, which had   to be ""controllable"" for the method to work.  Many space age prob lems are basically nonlinear, have uncontrollable linear approximations, and their analysis requires high order approximations which retain relevant nonlinear behavior but are still amenable to analysis.  The high order, homogeneous approximations are such.  The goal of Hermes research is to use these for the construction of stabilizing controls."

In certain time varying domains Lewis and  Murray have shown that parabolic measure for  the heat equation is mutually absolutely continuous with respect to a certain projective Lebesgue measure.  This  investigation will begin with the study of a model pde whose prototype is the pullback pde obtained from the heat equation by way of a certain mapping onto the above time varying domain.  Since the  pullback pde has a parabolic measure that is mutually absolutely   continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure, the object of the investigation will be to determine what properties of the model pde are actually needed to guarantee mutual absolute continuity of the above measures. As for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems they are now well understood for square integrable functions defined on the boundary of the above time varying domains. The next step is to consider the Neumann problem for p th power integrable functions when  p is between 1 and 2. Again the above pullback pde   needs to be analyzed closely.     Many  phyical processes can be analyzed using partial differential equations. The most famous classical partial differential equations are  Laplace's equation, the heat equation, and the wave equation each of which originated in the 18 th and 19 th centuries and  found uses  in  the study of gravity, electricity, fluid flow,  electromagnetic waves,  to mention only a few topics.  My research  concerns problems of the following type : Given the   temperature on the walls of  a room, find the temperature at any place in the room at any later time ?  This problem is called the Dirichlet problem for the heat equation. The Neumann problem can be stated  similarly in terms of the rate at which heat is flowing out of the walls of the room.  Mathematically if the temperature on the walls of the room is fixed and nice enough (cont inuous), then the Dirichlet problem can be shown to have a unique solution.  Part of my research has been concerned with whether this problem  has a unique solution when the walls of the room and temperature on the walls is allowed to vary. This problem has now  been essentially completely solved and the corresponding   Neumann problem is being studied.  Possible applications of this research are to free boundary problems where the size and temperature of an object are constantly changing (ice melting, gases expanding, nuclear waste solidifying)."

Three basic areas are singled out for research:  magnetic fields in quantum theory, the quantum theory of constrained systems, and embedded eigenvalues.  The magnetic field problems of interest involve large magnetic field and the existence of a limiting behavior of the Hamiltonian operator (in particular its spectrum) in this limit.  Spin zero as well as spin 1/2 particles will be considered.  In classical mechanics, constraints in configuration space can be imposed by a limiting procedure, and as this limit is taken the orbit of the system in configuration space approaches the orbit of the constrained system.  In quantum mechanics, this is far from clear.  This research project is aimed at clarifying the situation.  Many researchers have shown that embedded   eigenvalues of quantum mechanical Hamiltonians are unstable.  They tend to disappear under perturbation.  Part of this project is to understand the manifold of perturbations which prevent the disappearance of these eigenvalues.    When a spinless quantum mechanical particle interacts with a magnetic field, it acquires a zero point energy just by virtue of its being in a non-zero field.  This zero point energy is large for large field and has the effect of excluding particles with reasonable energies.  Thus, the geometry of the regions where the magnetic field is zero is very important when the field is large.  This situation will be investigated in the spin zero case as well as   the spin 1/2 case (electrons) which is much more difficult.  Confining a particle to a surface in quantum mechanics can be a difficult procedure since the uncertainty principle would predict infinite momentum fluctuations perpendicular to the surface.  Yet constrained systems seem to exist.  This problem will also be investigated.  Finally, if a channel to freedom is open for a particle (even if it requires tunneling through a ba rrier), then only in very special situations will a particle be bound.  It is the purpose of part of this project to understand the structure of those barriers which will nevertheless bind a particle."

We    propose to extend our result that the functions in the family {f(z,c) = c  tan(z)} are dense to other finite dimensional families of meromorphic  functions; in particular, to families with no critical points and  finitely many asymptotic values.  ii - We shall extend our definition of Pleating Coordinates from one and  two dimensional spaces of Kleinian groups to arbitrary spaces of Kleinian  groups.  The advantage of pleating coordinates is that they give a direct  relation between the geometry of the  hyperbolic 3-manifold determined by  the group and complex analytic trace moduli for the group.   iii - We consider a family of two generator subgroups of PSL(2,C) with  one fixed parabolic generator and one parabolic generator depending on a  single complex parameter c.  We propose to extend the kind of analysis we  have used in our work on pleating coordinates to find necessary and  sufficient conditions on c for the groups to be discrete.     Research is proposed in three different areas.  The first involves extending previous work in the area of conformal dynamical systems. Such systems arise as models of various physical, economic and social phenomena.  A dynamical system may be described by a family of functions, f(z,c), depending on two variables. For each fixed value of c we are   interested in the orbits of a given point z; that is, we consider the set of points z, f(c,z), f(f(c,z)), and so on.  If a small change in the input data, z, changes the orbit only slightly, we say the system is stable, or predictable.  If a small change  in z, on the other hand, causes a drastic change in the orbit, we say the system is chaotic.  If the orbits satisfy   a certain technical condition, the system is called hyperbolic.  It would seem that hyperbolic behavior is the norm, but this is often difficult to prove.  We have proved that it is for a special class of functions and propose to extend this work to a larger class.  The second area of research involves studying a class of 3 dimensional objects called hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  They are so-called because they are endowed with a non-Euclidean geometry called a hyperbolic geometry. In such a geometry the sum of the angles in a triangle is less than a straight angle.  The hyperbolic 3-manifold may be varied so that the geometry changes, but remains hyperbolic.  In previous work, based on  careful analysis of examples generated by sophisticated computer programs, we found a good way to describe one and two parameter families of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  We propose to extend this work to families depending on a arbitrary number of parameters.   In the course of our work on 3-manifolds we encountered a class of algebraic objects called groups.  These groups arise in a number of different areas of mathematics and have been studied by many researchers. There are, however, still a number of open questions concerning them and for our third area of research we propose to extend our previous analysis of these groups to answer some of these questions."

Eight of the proposed problems pertain   to questions arising in non-linear PDE, and two problems are proposed  to study over-determined systems of linear partial differential   equations. The non-linear problems all arise from various situations   that arise in Physics and Geometry. There is a stronger focus in the   proposal on systems of PDE than on single equations. The problems  are selected in part because solutions to them and understanding them   require some understanding of classical Harmonic analysis.     Very often the behaviour of a physical system is described by partial   differential equations. Thus it is important to know how to solve   these equations. Very often there are many, many solution families   and thus one may really not know all the possible solutions.  However if by some technique we can cut down the list  of solutions and show that only solutions of a certain category are the   the only possibility then the task of determining all solutions become   easier. For example if an equation exhibits symmetry one could try to   show that all solutions of the equation will have this symmetry manifest.  This will automatically rule out large classes of objects and focus our study   on a small class which will then tell us everything about the equation.

In the second area, it is to investigate smoothness of solutions of SPDEs arising in filtering problems and population genetics in order to be able to guarantee certain rates of convergence of approximations to their solutions. In the third area, the aim is to get  estimates of the rate of convergence.    The project relates to investigations of probabilistic behavior of certain objects. Part 1 is aimed at better understanding of averaged quantities and is thought of as been important for parts 2 and 3. Part 2 aims at problems directly related to many practical issues such as image reconstruction or high-performance.  It is also vital in dealing with problems like evolution of bacteria populations, which may be important in biotechnology. Part 3 deals with problems of optimal control of random processes which arise, for instance, in finance."

The aim is to   establish minimal differentiability assumptions on the metric determining   the sound speed under which certain bounds on the solutions, known as the   Strichartz estimates, hold. Under previous NSF funding, the investigator   has shown that these bounds hold if the second order derivatives of the   metric coefficients are bounded, and that this is the best possible  condition of its sort that insures the validity of the Strichartz estimates.   The proposed research includes replacing this condition by sharper,   geometrically intrinsic ones. It is anticipated that the optimal condition   is that the metric posess one bounded derivative, and in addition that the   coefficients of the curvature tensor (certain combinations of second order   derivatives) be bounded. The investigator is also continuing research into   the development of function spaces adapted to oscillatory integral and   hyperbolic problems. Previous NSF funding supported the development of a   family of Hardy spaces adapted to fixed-time estimates for solutions of the   wave equation. The proposed research includes developing similar spaces   adapted to controlling time-averaged norms of solutions.      The study of waves travelling in media with rough sound speeds (that is,   where the speed may vary sharply from one point to another) is of both   theoretical and practical significance. The theoretical interest comes from   nonlinear equations, such as the Einstein equations for gravitation, in   which the wave speed depends on the solution under consideration. Since   rough solutions arise naturally, one needs to understand how waves travel   in rough media to show that solutions exist, and to understand their   properties. Physics predicts that energy should travel along geodesics,   curves that represent the shortest path between points. Our research is   sh owing that this is true even for rough sound speeds, under essentially   the weakest assumptions that assure that geodesics exist and are well   defined. The practical significance is that our research yields a   mathematical construction for solving the wave equation, which is valid  for rough sound speeds and stable under perturbations of the medium. It is   clear that a computational algorithm based on such a construction will be   inherently more stable than one requiring more restrictive conditions on   the media. Our research would help establish that such algorithms are both   stable and convergent."

Emphasis will be placed on the determination of the expansive sets, how the dynamics of one component of the expansive set may influence the dynamics in another, and how finite type assumptions may change the answers. He   will further probe the coincidence entropies of certain actions with the growth rate for spanning trees of related infinite graphs. He will also pursue a link with electrical networks suggested by his discovery of a new invariant for Markov shifts arising from consideration of spanning trees.

He will pursue the characterization of conjugacy classes for which the equations have solutions, the   possibility of improving the bounds by state-splitting, and the use of the inequalities in coding algorithms related to holographic data storage. He will also continue his analysis of Markov chains and their classifications, with emphasis on the development of dynamical   invariants and coding methods for handling near-boundary constraints.     Traditional problems of encoding data have focused on one-dimensional sequences, such as those found on computer disk drives or (in spiral form) on compact audio discs. In such situations physical constraints mean that, for efficient encoding, arbitrary data must be encoded into data subject to constraints. For instance data on a compact audio disk must have the property that between consecutive 1's there are at least two, but no more that seven, 0's. Symbolic dynamics provides that mathematical framework for discovering and   investigating methods of encoding that have practical implications.  More recently both industrial and research mathematicians have been studying higher-dimen sional versions of these problems.  Industry is interested, for example, in holographic data storage where   information is spread over a three-dimensional cube. Research mathematicians have been discovering fascinating new phenomena in this area, in particular some rich connections with the seemingly unrelated fields of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The investigators will continue their work with the higher-dimensional theory, with   emphasis on ways of measuring information and a study of periodic structures."

Write g and k for the complexified Lie algebras, respectively, and let X be a (g, K) module.  The objective of the investigator's research is to determine a non-combinatorial description for the set of K-types of X first in the case where X is a discrete series representation and second in the case where X is a cohomologically induced module.  This will be accomplished in three steps:  1) make precise the notion of an ""edge"" of the set of K-types; 2) identify the K-types that lie on an edge using cohomological methods; and 3) use the convex hull of the edge K-types to describe the entire set of K-types.  The investigator's methods are based on a conjecture of D. Vogan concerning a certain restriction map of cohomology. If q=l+u is a theta-stable parabolic with Levi component l,   Vogan's conjecture states that the image of the restriction map from u cohomology to u intersect k cohomology parameterizes the K-types lying on edges that are not contained in a Weyl chamber wall of K.  The ideas associated to this conjecture provide the main techniques for approaching the proposed objective.     From a global point of view, this project is motived by the existence of symmetry in the world.  This symmetry manifests itself in a variety of forms such as the lattice structure of certain crystals in chemistry, the behavior of subatomic particles in high energy physics, or the equations describing fluid flow in engineering.  In all these diverse applications, one of   the mathematical tools that is particularly powerful is known as representation theory.  In a broad sense, representation theory is the study of all possible symmetries of a given system.  The hope is to classify all symmetries and to provide detailed information about each one.  While great strides have been made towards this goal, many difficult problems   remain.  An important technique used to study these remaining problems is to examine somethin g known as the K-types of a representation.  In a broad sense, the set of K-types is a slight simplification of a complicated representation to something that is more manageable.  It turns out that the set of K-types is a very effective way to both construct representations and to deduce special properties of representations.  The investigator's research aims to provide a geometrical description of the set of K-types   that would make a more detailed analysis of representations possible."

Part I is the most significant. In Part I, Heinonen outlines a program of study of quasiconformal maps in metric spaces with little smoothness.  The goal of the project, joint with   Pekka Koskela, is to systematically develop a theory of quasiconformal maps on metric spaces that possess certain quantitative bounds on their mass and geometry. The motivation to  develop such a theory comes  partly from geometry and combinatorial group theory, where it is important to understand quasiconformal maps on boundaries of negatively curved spaces. Heinonen and Koskela have discovered that the validity of a  Poincare type inequality in a space is practically tantamount to the validity of a working quasiconformal theory. In Part II, Heinonen proposes  problems on the lower dimensional absolute  continuity properties of quasiconformal maps in Euclidean space. He has established that a quasiconformal map, defined on the unit ball of Euclidean space of any dimension larger than two, but not equal to four, has absolutely continuous boundary values if the boundary of the image domain has tangents almost everywhere with respect to the surface measure. The sharpness of this result is discussed, as well as the redundancy of the dimensional restriction. In Part III, Heinonen proposes problems, jointly with Seppo Rickman, related to the  structure of the branch set of a quasiregular map. Heinonen suggests a way to construct quasiregular maps with complicated branch set.     The proposal presents a shift from analysis to geometry via discrete methods in the theory of quasiconformal mappings. Here the word ""analysis"" means  the branch of mathematics that developed out of the Calculus; it is the study of continuous changes in infinitesimal data, from which  one wants to predict global conclusions. Geometry, perhaps the most fundamental part of all mathematics, is the study of space, its many forms and varieties, in many possible dimensions.  Discrete methods mean the opposite to continuous, or calculus methods, and involve more finite, ""counting"" ideas, such as those done by a computer, albeit in this work still of analytic and geometric flavor. The concept of quasiconformality enters the discussion in the most subtle way: it allows the space and its formation to be singular at times and in places, but not everywhere and not all the time. There is a certain control in the distortion, which perhaps looked  artificial to mathematicians 40 years ago when the research first in the field was conducted. Now quasiconformality is a ubiquitous phenomenon in mathematics. From work in the late  seventies we know that every space that locally looks like a flat space of Euclid has quasiconformal structure, albeit not a smooth structure in general; and that this is true in every dimension but four. Nevertheless, also in dimension four, it is conjectured that there is an infinity of spaces where one cannot do ordinary, smooth analysis, or calculus, but where one can do quasiconformal, nonsmooth analysis. The proposal addresses the need to develop more techniques, and more understanding, of this new calculus."

The   proposed research reflects the interplay between two main directions in   the development of the theory, namely that: while (on one hand) studying   the parallelism between freeness and independence is of intrinsic interest,   we have (on the other hand) that free probability is a powerful tool for   attacking hard problems on free products of operator algebras. The main object   of study, called the  R-transform, is a free non-commutative  analog for   the logarithm of the Fourier  transform of a (multivariable) probability   distribution. In recent work, the multivariable R-transfopm has emerged as  an elegant and at the same time far-reaching instrument in the study of the  freeness phenomenon; we present problems that naturally come in the   continuation of this promising direction of research. Problems related to a  remarkable interpolation, depending on a parameter q in  0,1 , between the  R-transform and its commutative counterpart; and problems related to an  asymptotic model for freeness, based on random permutations, are also discussed.        The notion of random variable, and the concept of independence for random  variables are basic elements in the language of probability theory. Random  variables can be added and multiplied together, and built in their definition  is the fact that the product of two random variables f and g does not depend on   the order in which they are considered (always fg = gf). In the field of free  probability, the latter assumption is dropped, and the concept of independence   is replaced by the one of freeness - a condition originally inspired from the   study of certain algebras associated to free groups. While free pr obability   was started in the 80's as part of an effort to approach some long-standing   problems in operator algebras, it is at present clear that we have to do with   a fertile mathematical theory, connected to other branches of mathematics   and science; recent contributions in the field were made, e.g., by quantum   physicists and algebraic combinatorists. The present project is concerned with   topics from free harmonic analysis - the `free analog' for the Fourier   analysis methods classically used in the study of random variables."

Sampling sequences make contact with the   modern theory of wavelets, which has broad applications to image processing, signal analysis, and data storage.  Conformal mappings have long been used to change coordinates in solving problems of fluid flow, heat conduction, and the like.  Harmonic mappings are significant generalizations of conformal mappings which share some of their properties but present many new phenomena.

For example, the Gehring plans to continue a joint study with G. J. Martin of the set of values which cannot be assumed by the trace of the commutator of pairs of elements of a nonelementary discrete group.  This study has already yielded a great deal of information about the minimum possible volumes of 3-manifolds and orbifolds and it should, in particular, allow one to prove that the orbifold associated with the 3-5-3 hyperbolic tetrahedral group has minimum volume among all 3-manifolds and orbifolds. The main tools for this study are: (1) complex iteration to identify big filled in Julia sets E for a special family P of polynomials, and (2) a covering argument using the family P and the filled in Julia sets E to obtain large regions D of excluded values for the traces of the commutators of pairs of elements.  The Gehring hopes also to study further the polynomial family P, an interesting collection of polynomials with one complex parameter which arise naturally in the study of Mobius groups.    Mathematics can be viewed as consisting of three main fields - algebra, analysis, and geometry - together with many other areas which are developments of the basic ideas in one or more of these fields.  Thus   algebra is the field which has developed from studying polynomial equations, analysis the field which has its roots in the calculus, and geometry the field that has developed from the ideas of Euclid and the Greeks.  It is particularly interesting and satisfying for mathematicians when ideas which belong to one of these fields can be used to solve problems in another.  This project concerns some problems which are   situated at a crossroads where all three of these fields meet.  In particular, one problem is to determine the smallest possible volume of certain g eometric objects using the theory of complex iteration and   Mandelbrot sets of analysis together with a polynomial family which arose from algebra. Work in such a part of mathematics can be quite fruitful since the solution of a crossroads problem usually has implications in all of the fields concerned."

The proposed treatment of these two problems is unified by the technique of variation of a metric within a conformal class.  Next, an open energy--minimization problem for a Ginzburg--Landau energy functional will be considered; here the solution ``ought'' to be a certain radial vector field, but the difficulty is that current rearrangement methods for vectors are decidedly inadequate.  Note that the methods to be applied to all these problems are mathematical, though every problem has physical meaning as well.    Problems of vibration and heat flow have been studied for thousands of years, since at least the time of the ancient Greeks.  Today, vibration and heat problems remain challenging and important, as scientists grapple with new and old materials on extreme scales and under extreme conditions.  The history of 20th century science shows, though, that progress on seemingly practical problems relies very often on the methods and insights developed in basic research.  This proposal addresses several questions in the basic theory of heat flow and sound vibration for which the ""answers"" seem intuitively obvious; these answers can even be confirmed by computer in certain cases. The puzzle, and the challenge, is that no-one can explain logically why these ""answers"" are correct.    Finding such a logical explanation of the answer is sure to profitably enhance our understanding of and capabilities with problems of vibration and heat flow.  To be a bit more specific, the first problem in the proposal deals (roughly speaking) with estimating how much heat remains in a region after the heat is allowed to dissipat e for a certain period of time.  The conjecture here is that a particular disk loses its heat   fastest.  (This conjecture can also be re-stated in terms of quantum mechanics.)  The next problem concerns the location of the loudest point in a sound wave, such as the road noise inside an automobile.  The conjecture is that the sound is loudest at the edge of the region,   rather than inside the car, say.  The third problem considered by the proposal is a simply--stated but still--unsolved problem arising from the theory of super-conductivity, an area of immense practical possibility of which we have a sadly incomplete theoretical understanding.  Finally, to those who say that theoretical mathematics is dead (or should be) in the age of the computer, one should respond that theoretical mathematics   consistently provides insight where computers fear to tread.  And what is more, theoretical mathematicians are often cheaper to operate."

These include: (1) The study of general multiple  variational integrals for vector valued functions, their Euler-Lagrange equations, the closely related Morrey's quasi-convexity condition and other notions of ellipticity, together with certain natural objects (semi-convex hulls) associated with these ellipticity conditions. These investigation should help to understand global properties of solutions of a number of non-linear systems.    (2) The study of Liouville-type theorems for the three-dimensional incompressible  Navier-Stokes equations and their applications to the study of (potential) singularities of solutions of these equations.    The motivation for the study of variational integrals comes from the very general and extremely important classical principle that many equations arising in engineering, physics, and also pure mathematics can be directly linked to minimization of (suitably defined) energy. For example, the basic equations describing deformations of materials under stress are very closely related to this principle. Although our mathematical understanding of   minimization is quite good in many important cases, there are also many situations of considerable practical importance where our understanding is rather poor. The above mentioned equations for deformations of materials give  a good example of such situation (except for the case when the stress in the material is relatively small).  I expect that the study of the first circle of problems proposed above will shed some light on open questions surrounding energy  minimization. It turns out that results related to these questions can also help to elucidate other mathematical problems which at first do not seem to be directly related to energy minimization (such as non-linear oscillations). However, a closer analysis shows that there are some unexpected  connections.  The understanding of mathematic al problems surrounding energy minimization is   also quite important from the practical point of view: if we simulate minimization on a computer, then non-trivial mathematical facts we know can potentially save us a considerable amount of computations we need to do. In fact, in many cases a good theoretical analysis can enable one to attack problems which at first seem out of reach of even the fastest computers. One can put forward similar arguments to explain the motivation behind the second circle of problems proposed above. In fact, in this case the need for good mathematical analysis is perhaps even more apparent: it is well known that in many cases of great practical importance, there is simplyno known method to reliably calculate  fluid flows (describedby the Navier-Stokes equations), even with the help of the fastest computers. I hope that the proposed investigations will increase our understanding of the behavior of solutions of  these equations."

Part 1 of the project deals with the estimates of solutions of linear equations which do not depend on the smoothness of coefficients.  Special attention is paid to the local boundedness of solutions and to the behavior of positive solutions which blowup at the boundary.  Uniqueness of such solutions is investigated under minimal assumptions on the smoothness of coefficients and on the structure of the boundary.  In Part 3, the results on the classical solutions of linear equations are extended to the fully nonlinear equations satisfying a Dini condition with respect to independent variables.    The estimates of solutions of linear equations with non-smooth coefficients are associated with certain properties of different processes in non-homogeneous environment, with many applications to heat-mass transfer, chemistry, porous media, traffic flow, biology, etc.  Such estimates also serve as a background for the theory of nonlinear equations.  The investigation of blowup solutions of semilinear equations is important in ecology, combustion theory, chemical and nuclear engineering.  Many phenomena in these and other areas can be treated in terms of a superdiffusion process which describes a cloud rising as the limit of a system of independent Brownian particles which die at random times, leaving a random number of offspring.  Fully nonlinear equations are closely related to the theory of optimal control of random processes where the optimal strategy can e found by solving of appropriate initial or bou ndary value problem for the corresponding nonlinear equation.

A major goal  will be an investigation of certain rings important for understan-   ding tensor products and related questions.

Expository Abstract: In mathematics, one is often interested in   objects which may be different, but may be equivalent for some   purposes. Thus, in elementary geometry there is the notion of   congruence: two triangles, or other figures, are congruent if one   may be moved so as to fit exactly over the other. In an industrial   context, congruence is the idea underlying interchangeable parts.   The idea of invariant theory is to provide numerical criteria for   two objects to be equivalent, with respect to whatever is the   relevant notion of equivalence. Thus, two triangles are congruent   exactly when the lengths of their sides are the same triple of   numbers. The numbers which may be used to determine whether or not   two objects are equivalent are called *invariants(it)*. Invariant   theory seeks to f ind invariants for geometric configurations. This   project seeks to apply invariant theory in new directions. It will  look for systems of invariants for some new classes of configurations,   and it will also attempt to find some new structure in some of the most   important systems of invariants. Symmetry will be heavily exploited,   and systems whose structure is very strongly determined  by symmetries will form the central objects of investigation."

These arise to describe the level spacing distribution functions for random matrix models. Other random variables  also have distribution function given by Fredholm determinants. The primary focus of this research is to describe the distribution function of random variables for different matrix models. In the classical case the operators are convolution operators, but for other models the operators are generalizations of the convolution type. The techniques already developed to study the classical Szego limit theorems will be generalized for use in the more complicated cases. If the random variable is of a certain discontinuous type, then the operators have singular symbols. The known theory for discontinuous symbols will be extended to apply in the more general setting. This will involve extensions of the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture.    Many physical systems possess such complicated behavior that exact predictions become impossible. However, it is sometimes still possible to describe the average or statistical properties of the systems. For   example in slow nuclear reactions it is important to understand the average properties of the energy levels of a compound nucleus. Quantum mechanics tells us that the energy levels of the system are simulated by   the eigenvalues of a large Hermitian matrix. A matrix is a square array of numbers and the eigenvalues are a set of fundamental numbers associated to the matrix. The purpose of the proposed research is to   study the statistical properties of the eigenvalues for different classes of randomly generated matriaes. The theory of random matrices also occurs in other areas of mathematics and physics, such as the distribution of  the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, the study of disordered conductors and chaotic systems."

This discrete theory is built using circle packings, which are, roughly speaking, collections of circles on Riemannian 2-manifolds with prescribed patterns of tangencies encoded in simplicial 2-complexes. The plan has three main objectives with strongly represented computational aspects. The first objective is to develop a notion of discrete meromorphic functions in such a way that discrete functions would possess main characteristic properties of their classical counterparts. Approximation issues and the development of a constructive algorithm for the approximation are also a part of this first objective. The second objective calls for the construction of a discrete analog of the harmonic measure via random walks induced by circle packings on their tangency graphs. This construction should utilize the geometry of the objects involved. Furthermore, algorithms for computing the discrete measure and for approximation of the classical harmonic measure by discrete counterparts are expected to be developed. The third objective is to obtain a complete discrete version of the Uniformization Theorem of Riemann S12urfaces. In particular, the complete classification of univalent and proper branched circle packings must be given according to certain properties from potential theory on networks.     In more general terms, the Dubejko's overall goal for this project is to create a discrete analog of the fundamental classical area of mathematics called complex analysis. The primary objects of the proposed studies are discrete, and as such they have the advantage of being more suitable for applications than their classical counterparts. Furthermore, they allow researchers to employ computer technology in various forms, for example, in computer experiments and visualization of geometric objects. In fact, the co mputational issues form an integral part of the project. It is hoped that a consistent new theory can be developed which will give an alternative look at problems in mathematics and other fields, provide new tools to deal with them, and play an important educational role."

With the advent of the  theory of operator spaces, also known as ""quantized functional analysis"",  general, not-necessarily-self-adjoint, operator algebras have achieved an  ontological status comparable to that held by the self-adjoint operator  algebras.  Although the non-self-adjoint theory is not yet as well developed,  from certain perspectives, the explosion of results that has taken place in  the last six years, or so, deserves to be exposed in a fashion that will  allow the uninitiated, particularly younger scholars, easy access to the  basics of the subject from the current perspective.  The objective of the  conference is to provide a series of short courses, that will be published,  designed to provide an overview of the theory of non-self-adjoint operator  algebras and its relation to other areas of operator algebra and modern  analysis.  The themes to be stressed are: non-self-adjoint operator  algebras, general theory; concrete operator algebras, particularly reflexive  algebras; multivariable operator theory and representations of function  algebras; metric variations on themes from algebra - Hilbert and operator  modules; operator spaces and their applications to Banach space theory and  harmonic analysis; operator algebraic approaches to quantum groups;  non-self-adjoint operator algebras and wavelets.     The theory of non-self-adjoint operator algebras plays a central role in the  mathematical underpinnings of a lot of mathematics applied to areas of  national need.  For example, in the area of signal processing, which is used  to transmit data and images involved in all fields of science - from space  observatories to tomographs of the brain - fundamental constructs, such as  the so-calle d Toeplitz matrices and wavelet transforms, obtain their deepest  significance and are most clearly revealed when viewed from the perspective  of operator algebra.  Operator algebra lays bare their basic algebraic  properties (how they are manipulated in practice) and metric properties as  well (how they are measured).  In oil exploration, which involves wavelets  and signal processing in a somewhat different fashion, operator algebraic  methods, known as commutant lifting play a fundamental role.  Also, in  control theory, particularly in the design of aircraft and noise abaters,  the mathematics involved is to a large extent operator algebra.  The  breakthrough that took place about six years ago, and alluded to above,  enables the practitioner of this field to bring to bare effectively the full  power of modern algebra to tackle the most basic and  fundamental structural  questions.  The advances in this field have been very exciting and more are  to come.  But it is time collect a summary of what is known, including  bibliographies, so that new people can enter this exciting, emerging field  of research."

Such operators, which transform functions on one space into functions on another (possibly different) space, have become  central tools in the study of linear partial differential equations which govern diverse physical phenomena, such as electromagnetic  fields and sound propagation. The particular  operators to be studied in this project arise in the scattering of  waves by potential functions, and in  tomography, the mathematical basis for a variety of medical imaging systems, such as CAT and MRI scanners. Thus, progress on the problems considered in this project will contribute to the theoretical underpinnings of procedures for reconstructing unknown quantities of physical interest from noninvasive observations. Despite the fact that they arise in d ifferent problems, the operators to be studied share several common features, which  involve more complicated geometry than is present in the  original versions of singular integral and Fourier integral operators. It is hoped that, eventually, improved understanding of these operators will lead to improved reconstruction techniques."

The primary quantum spin system that we will study is the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a ladder (2 sites wide, infinitely many sites long). This particular model contains several interesting quantum spin models as limiting cases and should help us understand the relationship between the variety of exotic phases that occur in these models. Weakly self-avoiding walks are nearest neighbor walks on the lattice with the probability of a walk reduced according to the number of self intersections it contains. The goal here is to develop real space renormalization group transformations for the usual model and for a model in which the energy penalty for a self intersection decays as the length of the loop formed by the intersection raised to a power. This latter model has interesting behavior even in one dimension. For classical lattice spin systems like the Ising model, we   will continue our study of real space renormalization group transformations like majority rule. When this transformation is applied to the one dimensional Ising model with a power law interaction, there is a nice simplication when the power is close to one. This simplification should be the start of a rigorous definition of the transformation. We will also work on establishing the existence of the transformation in various two dimensional models.    This project is devoted to the mathematical study of several systems that originate in physics - quantum spin systems, self avoiding walks and classical spin systems. Quantum and classical spin systems are models for the interactions of the spins of electrons in crystals. These systems contain a huge number of spins, but typically each spin only interacts with nearby spins. Nonetheless these microscopic local interactions can   produce macroscopic effects, e.g., magnetism and super conductivity. Self avoiding walks are models for very long polymers. Again, there are a large number of basic units, but the interaction is local - different sections of the polymer cannot occupy the same location. This local interaction affects how the size of the polymer grows as the number of basic   units making up the polymer increases. A common motivation for studying all of these models is to understand how simple local interactions in a mathematical model with a very large number of degrees of freedom produce global effects. One of the most remarkable discoveries in physics is that certain properties of these global effects do not depend on the details of the microscopic interactions. There are several quantifiable properties of   the macroscopic behavior know as critical exponents which are believed to be exactly the same for a wide variety of microscopic interactions. One of the goals of this project is to further our mathematical understanding of this ""universality."""

The above proposed works are based on problems arising in  dynamics of reacting flows, and lasers.  Understanding reacting flows is of tremendous practical importance,  and is related to industrial chemical processing, energy consumption,  as well as biotechnological remediation of environment.  In designing internal combustion engines or conducting industrial  chemical processes, one of the immediate concerns is to increase the efficiency of fuel burning, and so minimize the waste gas output  and reduce air pollution. It is known that well-mixed and strongly stirred reacting fluids have more effective contact area and their  reaction efficiency is much higher. On the other hand,  stirred fluids behave in an irregular and chaotic manner, and are not easy to control.  This motivates us to study the properties of  the irregular reacting flows in order to utilize them for our needs.        Mathematical models proposed here serve as a starting  point for pursuing such an investigation where both analytical and  numerical methods can be applied to advance our understanding.  Moreover, the techniques we develop can be very useful to other problems, such as bioremediation of polluted aquifer.  T here similar irregular or chaotic phenomena  exist due to the interaction of chemical species with bacteria  growth. Chaotic phenomena also appear in optical systems where  people try to produce high power laser output for  massively parallel optical computing and processing, image storage,  and high power energy sources. It is essential to be able to  achieve coherence and control of the laser output. Mathematically,  this amounts to studying stability and instability of  the special solutions of the laser system, analyzing the structures and finding good approximations of attractors. The two level laser  model we propose here is the first step towards this goal.   The progress made and the methodology developed in the systematic   study of the two level model will  greatly help us approach more complicated yet more appealing  semiconductor laser systems  in the future."

One of the   main themes in this project involves the study of  (so called) singular unitary representations using a   technique we call transfer which ""moves""  unitary representations between real forms of the same   complexification.  To implement this idea one must have   very detailed information on the restriction of   representations to (generally non-compact) symmetric   subgroups.

It will also lead to   confirmation of special cases of some remarkable   conjectures of B.  Gross and D.  Prasad.  Another key   direction of this research involves the continued study   of the module theory of the ring of invariant polynomial   differential operators on a reductive Lie algebra.  This   work has already led to a new interpretation of the   Springer correspondence.  The new direction here will   involve some sort of ""relative Springer correspondence"".

For   example the detailed analysis of one singular representation   (by Kostant and his coworkers) has led to new solutions to   Einstein's equations.  Representation theory of the type   studied in this  project is also an important ingredient in the   Langland's program of which one very small part due to Wiles   led to his (Wile's) proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."

The basic mathematical questions are: (i) Does one have local existence and uniqueness of solutions in a certain class? (ii) Does one have blow-up of solutions?  (iii)  What is the long time behavior of solutions?  Some of the main techniques to be used are (iv) Pseudo-Riemannian or Lorentzian geometry, (v) Fourier transform methods (vi) Energy-methods.   Lindblad proposes to carry out two projects related to these general questions, combining the techniques mentioned: (I) To answer certain questions  concerning low regularity solutions and small data.  (II) To study regularity of a free-boundary problem, that occur in nature, for the relativistic Euler equation. Solution to these questions would contribute to our knowledge of fundamental equations from physics. On the one hand we are combining the different techniques (iv)-(vi), and it has usually been the case that interesting and useful mathematics originates from interaction between different fields of   mathematics as well as between mathematics and other sciences. On the other hand, the study of Einstein's equations have to a large extent been neglected by mathematicians. It is e.g. perceivable that one could use gravitational waves as a means of observing the universe. To solve problem (II) we are developing completely new techniques, and we believe that it will be useful for studying many other problems as well, e.g. an interface between two fluids. Such a problem would have industrial applications. Lindblad is also using computers and numerical calculations in his research, which makes it more accessible for applied scientists.     The practical motivation for this research is that several of the important equations in physics can be written as a system of nonlinear wave equations.  There are examples of this in classical field theory and continuum mechanics as well as in classical physics, e.g. Einstein's equations, the Yang-Mills equatio n and the equations of nonlinear elasticity. For some equations, for example Yang-Mills, we expect the solutions to remain regular for all times. On the other hand, for Einstein's equations and the equations of nonlinear elasticity, the solutions blow-up for certain data. For Einstein's equation the blow-up occurs in nature (black holes in general relativity) whereas for the equation of nonlinear elasticity the blow-up is due to the fact that the equations no longer describe what is happening in nature accurately. In either case it is important to understand the mechanism of existence versus blow-up."

We intend to use stationary phase methods to accomplish this.    The projects are aimed at determining the effects a perturbation has on a medium and reciprocally, knowing the effects a certain ty pe of perturbation causes in a medium, determine the nature of this perturbation. These problems have their origin in Physics.   In project I the PI wants to determine the effects a perturbation in the medium has on the propagation of sound waves through that medium.  Project III is related to the question of determining the material inside a given object from measurements made only on the surface of that object.  The question the PI will study is if two objects have the same   measurements, made only on their surfaces, then they must be formed by the same material.  Project II is in gravitation theory, one would like to better understand certain solutions of Einstein's field equations.

Inverse spectral theory has significant applications in atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics and in areas as wide-ranging as computer tomography, acoustics, electromagnetics, resolution of structural/material properties of media, and aviation technology. Similarly, completely integrable equations play a vital role in nonlinear optics and especially in soliton-based optical  communications systems. Gesztesy' work can be expected to have an impact on these areas."

The important objects in this research are the harmonic analysis of the von Neumann algebras arising in connection with discrete groups and in deformation quantization theory. The main stream is to determine the structure of the von Neumann algebras that reflect the properties of (quantum) non commutative probability and to relate this structure with the representation theory of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups. The recent advances by Voiculescu in noncommutative probability theory have shown that the asymptotic behavior of random matrices is best represented by elements in the von Neumann algebras associated with free groups, whose spectral distribution is the Wigner semicircular law. In this research an important part is played by the problem of characterizing the factors of discrete groups by computing the invariants, defined by Murray and von Neumann, related to the fundamental groups of such an algebra. This is also based on some analytical aspects of number theory and the von Neumann algebras of discrete groups. The connection is realized by using a new representation for the algebra of the modular group and its subgroups. This representation is obtained by the identification of Toeplitz operators whose symbols are (arithmetic) automorphic forms with intertwining operators between different representations of the modular groups (or its congruence subgroups). In this context, the arithmetic Hecke operators turn out to be completely positive maps for which the associated subfactors (via Connes's correspondence theory) have unexpected higher relative commutant invariants.     Recently, in the last twenty five years, the theory of operator algebras and in particular its sub-theory, concerning the von Neumann algebras, has been proven to appear in almost any other branch of mathematics. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that (as  it was certainly first hinted by von Neumann) the operator algebras are concerned with the (hidden) symmetries of nature and in particular the symmetries and motion in the space-time as it was first envisaged by quantum physicists. The von Neumann algebras that are studied in this project have proven to be intimately related to some models for the atoms that were first studied by Wigner. One of the ideas in Wigner's approach was that a possible way to study those models, in view of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, is realized by the random matrices. A surprising discovery in the last five years was that this amounts to the study of certain properties of the algebras described above. The random matrices in themselves have numerous other applications in other branches of science like prediction theory or atmospheric science, and there is acknowledged hope that the better our understanding is on random matrices and the algebras associated with them-the better will be our understanding on the above natural phenomena."

It is concerned with problems related to certain operators and to certain oscillatory integrals which are naturally associated with those operators. The operators are given by convolution with measures on curves in Euclidean spaces. In the simplest case the oscillatory integrals are one-dimensional integrals with an   exponential integrand having polynomial phase function. These integrals arise naturally as the Fourier transforms of the measures defining the convolution operators. The questions of interest here have been fairly well understood in dimensions 2 and 3 since about 1985. The investigator has recently had some success with these problems in 4 dimensions. The goal of this project is to continue that work by extending the range and scope of the methods employed in dimension 4.     Pure mathematics is traditionally divided into the areas of analysis, algebra, and topology. This is a project in analysis. Very roughly, the roots of analysis are to be found in calculus. (The roots of algebra are found in high school algebra, and those of topology are in geometry.) The objects of study in calculus are functions, derivatives, and integrals.   The derivative of a function is an extremely important tool- when it exists. But not all functions have derivatives. The existence of a function's derivative is tied up with the idea of that function's smoothness. A smoothing operator is a device which transforms a function into a closely related but smoother function. (Applications of mathematics to the   real world, e.g., problems in fluid mechanics like airplane design, almost always make the tacit assumption that the functions involved possess a certain degree of smoothness. When, as is often the case, the actual function is not that smooth, it must first be passed through a smoothing operator. Smoothing operators are also extremely useful in communications theory, where they are associated with the processes of noise removal and image enhan cement.) Most smoothing operators are of a type known as convolution operators. The motivation for this project is the desire to understand better certain of these convolution operators. The oscillatory integrals of the title are just tools which aid in this understanding."

However, the infinite dimensional dynamical systems generated by, for example,  parabolic equations are not reversible and the phase spaces are not locally compact.  This characteristic creates difficulties not encountered in the study of finite dimensional dynamical systems and new methods need to be developed to understand the nature of these systems.  A theory of structural stability for scalar reaction-diffusion equations,  the Cahn-Hilliard Equation and Phase-Field System  has recently been obtained.  Techniques found by the PI in his previous works will be employed in  the current studies.  It is expected  that this work will  contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of the models of physical systems described by partial differential equations.    Mathematical models for the state of an evolving physical system are the subject of investigation of dynamical systems.  The main goal of the study of dynamical systems is to understand the long term behavior of states in the systems. In applications, the  mathematical models (say differential equations) approximately describe physical reality. To understand the qualitative properties of a physical system, one  needs to investigate not only the mathematical model but also the perturbations of the model. One  also needs to   study  how the qualitative properties of the perturbed  models are related to the  qualitative properties of the original  model. This is especially  important to the numerical computations for the models.  Because of round off error and numerical schemes, the  model studied by the numerical computations actually is a  perturbation of the original  model.The theory for dynamical systems has been considered by many mathematicians and scientists starting with Poincare, Liapunov, and Birkhoff.  One of the fundamental problems in the theory of dynamical systems is the structural stability of dynamical systems. For a structurally stable system, the qualitative properties  are preserved under small perturbations of the system. To understand the dynamics of a system, one needs to investigate the existence of invariant sets,  in particular,  such as equilibrium points, periodic orbits, invariant tori, and attractors, to study their structures and to know  what happens in their vicinity (do the nearby solutions approach  the invariant set, or stay nearby, or leave the neighborhood).  A fundamental problem is to  study the persistence of invariant manifolds and to study the qualitative properties of the flow nearby invariant   manifolds.  The theory of invariant manifolds and invariant foliations has become a fundamental tool for the  study of dynamical  systems."

The first is the study of the conjecture that in complex n-space any proper holomorphic mapping between bounded domains with real analytic   boundaries extends to a proper holomorphic mapping between neighborhoods of their closures. In dimension 1 this is a fundamental result known as the Schwarz Reflection Principle. For n>1 the conjecture has been proved only in special cases.  Pinchuk will use a geometric approach, which is based on the technique of Segre varieties, and is a powerful new tool to study various problems in domains with real analytic boundaries. The goal of the first part of the proposal is to develop the geometric reflection principle for higher dimensions and prove the conjecture above in general. The second direction is to   apply the technique of Segre varieties together with other geometric methods to study rigidity phenomena of holomorphic mappings. Namely, Pinchuk plans to describe domains with noncompact automorphism groups.  He will also attack the related problem that in rather general situations proper holomorphic self-mappings are biholomorphic. The third direction is the investigation of the so called Abhyankar Equations (AEs) with respect to the Jacobian Conjecture (JC). The JC (in the complex case, which is the principal one) claims that any locally inevitable (biholomorphic) polynomial mapping is globally inevitable.       The JC is one of the most intriguing problems in mathematics.  It has been intensively studied by many mathematicians (including very famous ones) since 1939. A number of partial results as well as   faulty proofs has been published.  Most of the experts believed and still believe that the JC is true. Therefore a recent counterexample to the real version of the JC, which was constructed by Pinchuk (using the Aes) came as a surprise.  The JC has equivalent formulations in different areas of mathematics. Among others, its resolution ( positive or negative) will have implications for the finiteness of inversion formulas, for the existence of global solutions of certain differential equations, and for singularities of algebraic sets.  The other problems of this proposal are natural, important, and known as hard problems in several complex variables. Their solution will became the essential part of the theory of holomorphic mappings."

The first project involves studying a certain complex which arises from the parabolic analog of the BGG resolution for affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras.  Non-existence of certain irreducible components in the homology of this complex will lead to an interesting geometric definition of the fusion product for positive-level integrable representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras. Also, this will lead to a proof of the explicit dimension formula of Verlinde for arbitrary semisimple simply-connected groups (known so far for the classical groups and G2). The second project involves proving a well known problem on complete intersections of curves in the three dimensional projective space, which translates into a  problem about the affine flag variety associated to SL(2). Let C be a smooth affine algebraic curve and G a semisimple group. The third project is concerned with proving a weak homotopy equivalence between the space Alg(C,G) of all the algebraic maps from C to G and the corresponding space Cont(C,G) of all the continuous maps (from C to G). Since the rational homotopy groups of Cont(C,G) are known, in particular, this equivalence would determine the rational homotopy groups of Alg(C,G). Finally Kumar is writing lecture notes for a course on ""affine Kac-Moody groups, their flag varieties and representation theory,"" which he intends to expand into a book covering the basic theory.     In several mathematical and physical phenomena (and similarly in many biological and chemical processes), symmetry plays an important role. To start with, the example of a sphere is illuminating. One basic property of any sphere is that it is a perfectly symmetrical object, in other words any two points on it ""look"" the same. This symmetry  was exploited  over a period of time to derive some rather intricate properties of spheres.  Similarly let us look at another example coming from physics (more precisely from  Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity). Einstein derived his very fundamental equations from the basic ""invariance"" postulate that ""the laws of physics are the same in all coordinate systems which move uniformly relative to one another"" (together with the invariance of the velocity of light). Various projects, which Kumar is proposing to work on, have one common theme: Exploit the symmetry underlying the problem at hand to find the solution of the problem. More precisely expressed, Kumar is trying to use the ""automorphism groups"" to solve different mathematical problems, which in turn will have important consequences in theoretical physics, particularly Quantum Field Theory."

One involves the further development of microlocal analysis as a tool in nonlinear partial differential equations.  A basic component of this theory is the paradifferential operator calculus, which allows one to represent a nonlinear function F(u) as the sum of a linear operator applied to u and a remainder.  Recent developments highlight the desirability of extending the scope of this theory, in ways which bear on the study of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations with low regularity.  The second involves the use of analysis on Morrey spaces.  Created originally to analyze solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations, Morrey spaces have proved useful for other sorts of equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations for viscous fluid flow.  Taylor plans to pursue a systematic study of the applicability of Morrey spaces to nonlinear PDE.  A particular example is the extension of the Morrey space analysis to Navier-Stokes equations on a region with boundary.  The third area concerns an inverse scattering problem: the problem of describing an unknown obstacle in terms of observations of how it scatters waves.  Microlocal analysis is brought to bear on the problem of describing features of such an obstacle, on a length scale comparable to the wave length used to illuminate the obstacle. The fourth area concerns analysis of diffraction of waves by a boundary.  In particular, various Airy operators arise in this study, and while many basic properties are well understood, a number of natural problems from mathematical physics, including propagation of electromagnetic waves, give rise to problems about the Airy operator calculus which need to be resolved.    A central theme in these studies is the propagation of waves, both linear and nonlinear.  A number of types of waves are considered, including sound waves, waves in water, light waves and other  electromagnetic waves, and vibrations in the ground and in other solids.  How these waves propagate through space and interact with objects, often in the form of boundaries, is a rich source of problems.  Of equal interest are inverse problems, how to tell about the space in which waves propagate, from a knowledge of the nature of their propagation.  Understanding these inverse problems is helpful in a variety of practical problems, ranging from nondestructive medical imaging to finding special structures under ground and under water."

(ii) Global regularity in the d-bar Neumann problem and for  the Bergman projection in the infinitely differentiable (but not finite type) category. (iii) Characterization of optimal exponents of Gevrey regularity for sums of squares of vector fields.  (iv) Local solvability of partial differential operators with double characteristics and smooth coefficients.  All these topics are related to certain eigenvalue problems that arise from limits and/or reductions of partial differential operators; key issues are whether eigenvalues exist, and the extent to which the limiting problems control the original   operators. The emphasis will be on low-dimensional problems, and on those connected to complex analysis in several variables and to harmonic analysis on Lie groups.    Since Isaac Newton's insight that the fundamental laws of nature should relate the rates at which observed quantities change, rather than describe those quantities directly, most basic physical laws have been formulated as partial differential equations. To understand such equations and their solutions has thus become one of the fundamental goals of mathematical research. Partial differential equations are rarely solvable by explicit formulas, except in very symmetric situations. On the other hand, in physical applications it is often useful to understand certain qualitative features of solutions: whether any solution exists (which in practice may mean that some situation is or is not physically viable), and what kinds of singularities, if any, solutions can exhibit (shock waves, vortices, and wave fronts are typical physical manifestations of mathematical singularities).   These issues can often be understand in situations  where formulas for the solutions cannot be constructed. However, partial differential operators vary greatly in character, and each type must be investigated on its own terms."

A differential inclusion is a generalization of an ordinary differential equation, and can be viewed as a multidirectional flow.  The practical uses of the formulation are motivated by issues in control theory, where it has been known for some time that a control system can be reformulated as a differential inclusion without losing information regarding its trajectories.  But as with any reformulated model, one must take care in analysing the precise transfer of assumptions from one to the other.  Part of the research in this proposal is aimed at bridging this gap between what is known in differential inclusions and control  systems under different sets of assumptions.  It is the contention of  the Wolenski that many issues in control theory will not be properly understood until the fundamental traits implying the desired behavior are brought out in the associated differential inclusion.  Specific topics Wolenski plans to address include a Hamilton-Jacobi type analysis in the minimal time problem, a detailed analysis of the boundary to a reachable set, an extension of the Hopf representation formula, a survey of the uses of semiconvexity in analysis and optimization, and a broadening of the theory of hereditary control systems.     Applications of control theory are prevalent in applied science, and its influence on our society will undoubtedly continue to expand.  From manufacturing to medicine to engineering to economics,   control systems are increasingly being introduced as models for describing complicated system behavior.  The many recent mathematical advances in control theory are finding their way into practice, and   this exposes the need for further mathematical understanding of control phenomena.  Nonsmooth analysis is a mathematical discipline that has developed rapidly in the last twen ty  years, mainly motivated   by its many applications to optimization and optimal control theory. It now contains a surprisingly complete body of results that both in method and substance extend most of the classical differential   calculus.  The present proposal is directed toward applying some of the more recent advances to topics in control  theory.  Since the influence of control theory in applied science can hardly be overestimated, and as more of the recent mathematical advances are finding applications throughout society, a need has  arisen for a greater understanding of the properties of control  systems.  The successful completion of this research will lead to a greater mathematical understanding of the evolution of control  systems, and could have significant consequences in the modelling  process by allowing the designer to focus on crucial elements of the design that would lead to an improved performance."

To classify extensions, he will classify monomorphisms  from an (abelian) C*-algebra to the corona algebra.

One particular  class that he will consider is direct limits of some  extensions of certain algebras.       The first example of a C*-algebra is the complex numbers.    It is proved to be the only C*-algebra that is also a field.    In fact, any finite number of copies of the complex numbers is   a C*-algebra.  One can also have infinitely many copies.  If   one glues together continuously an infinite number of copies, one  may arrive at the complex-valued continuous functions on an interval,  or even complex-valued continuous functions defined on a circle.  In  fact, every commutative C*-algebra (one in which AB=BA) turns out to  be the set of continuous complex-valued functions on some space.  By  contrast, matrices over the complex field provide noncommutative  C*-algebras.  Every C*-algebra is technically a normed-closed and  conjugate-closed subalgebra of all bounded linear operators on a  Hilbert space.  What this means is that C*-algebras may be viewed   as some kind of generalized complex numbers, and, as in the case   of complex numbers, C*-algebras have many important applications,   ranging from dynamical systems and quantum mechanics to other fields   of mathematics such as operator theory, linear algebra, noncommutative   geometry, group representations, and so on.  For example, C*- algebras   together with their groups of symmetries are often related to problems   in dynamical systems.  Recent results in C*-algebra theory have been   used to answer questions such as when two matrices commute.  This   project is to study, in a way, how many types of such algebras exist,   how to distinguish them from one another, how to construct new   C*-algebras from old ones, and to study relationships between these   C*-algebras and possible applications to other fields.

Oscillation inequalities have already played a key role in the theory of a.e. convergence problems   arising in connection with the pointwise ergodic theorem. In particular, oscillation operators give new information about upcrossing and jump inequalities. We hope to obtain new results in the case of a single transformation, and to extend several results to the multi-parameter case. We also continue the search for conditions on subsequences, both   in the single and in the  multiparameter case, which will imply a.e. convergence of the associated averages.   The techniques used to study the questions in the proposal will often be  from harmonic analysis, including Calderon-Zygmund methods and Littlewood-Paley theory. In addition,  certain ideas from probability, especially martingale theory,   can be expected to play a key role.    Classical ergodic theory is the study of the long term behavior of dynamical systems. For example, we might be interested in the distribution of a pollutant in a water supply, and how the distribution of that pollutant changes over time. The ergodic theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the strong law of large numbers. A special case of the strong law of large numbers occurs if we consider the sequence of heads and tails observed if we toss a fair coin. In such a case we have independent trials, and we measure the oscillation of the sequence of averages by looking at the variance. A measure of oscillation is   important because it provides a way of estimating how close a particular average is to the true (and in experimental situations, unknown) mean. In public opinion polls this measure of how close we are is usually referred to as the margin of error. In the more general setting, considered in this proposal, the trials are not independent. For example, the distribution o f a pollutant  at one time will certainly play a role in determining the distribution a short time later. This is in contrast to the case of tossing a fair coin, where the fact that we saw heads on a certain toss gives us no information about whether or not   we will see a head on the next toss. This proposal involves the study of the oscillation of ergodic averages, and measures of such things as how often the average values rise above some critical threshold. In experimental situations, because of equipment failure, or human error, we often find that some of the expected data is missing. In earlier work it has been shown that in some cases this leads to very misleading results, and in other cases we can still recover the correct result. The work in this area is very incomplete. We hope to be able to further classify the cases in which an experiment can still be salvaged, despite   missing experimental data. In these cases, a measure of the oscillation, or margin of error, is especially critical."

The recent breakthrough in the understanding of a complex (chaotic) dynamics of systems evolving in time (dynamical systems) was connected with the studies of nonextended (point) dynamical systems whose dynamics can be completely described by measurements   performed at a single point of a real (physical) space. Evolution of extended systems such as the flow of fluids and gases, large systems of interacting elements in electronics (e.g. Josephson junctions) needs to be studied in space and time simultaneously.  The purpose of this research is to pursue the adequate approaches to study such space-time evolution and to develop algorithms to evaluate quantities that characterize space-time dynamics. The other novelty is the study of systems with dynamics which have both random and deterministic components (but not small, random perturbations of deterministic systems or vise versa). Most of systems in applications are of this type, e.g. in chemistry, artificial intelligence, in the management of warehouses etc."

Two of these grow out of joint work carried out by Jerrard in collaboration with H.M Soner. Jerrad and Soner examined the dynamics of topological defects in solutions of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) systems taking values in the plane. They showed that, under an appropriate scaling limit and for appropriate initial data, the energy density of solutions concentrates around codimension 2 manifolds, and they characterized the evolution of these manifolds. In planar domains, these singular manifolds are simply singular points which evolve via a system of ordinary differential equations; in higher dimensional domains, one obtains in the limit manifolds which evolve via codimension 2 mean curvature flow. Jerrard now proposes to study a number of questions about dynamics of point defects of solutions of evolution equations of GL type, related to his earlier work.  In particular, he wants to look at dynamics of point defects in GL Schroedinger equations and in generalized GL systems in higher dimensions. Secondly, he plans to look at problems concerning the evolution of line defects or, more generally, singular manifolds of dimension greater than 1 and codimension at least 2. These would include questions about evolution of line defects in GL Schroedinger equations.  A third, completely different class of problems has to do with developing a framework within which one can make sense of level set equations in which certain standard monotonicity assumptions on the coefficients are violated. Heuristically, such an equation would specify that every level set evolves by some geometric rule, but that different level sets evolve by different rules. Such equations are of mixed parabolic/hyperbolic type. A notion of weak solution would need to combine viscosity solution techniques with entropy conditions, and would probably also require some other ingredients.    The problems described above are drawn from two areas: physics of superconductors and sup erfluids, and image progessing. Ginzburg-Landau systems are a widely-used mathematical model for certain kinds of superconductors and superfluids, and they   seem to agree quite well with experiment. Some classes of superconducting materials, including many high temperature superconductors, exhibit small islands of normal, nonsuperconducting behavior within a larger superconducting matrix. These islands are known as vortices, and they can have a negative impact on the performance of superconductors. A major focus of this propsal is to attempt to understand, from a mathematical viewpoint, the behavior of these Ginzburg-Landau vortices. Similar vortices are seen in superfluids, such as liquid helium. Finally, a major problem in image processing is to eliminate ""meaningless"" noise, while retaining contrasts that carry some significant information.  Many image processing schemes amount to finding a solution of some   differential equation, which takes a given image as the input and produces the processed image as a solution. In this framework, it is useful to try to have a well-developed mathematical theory for equations which have the effect of smoothing out small irregularities in the given image, while sharpening major contrasts. This is the other main area in which Jerrard proposes to work."

Monge formulated a question which occurs naturally in economics and   engineering: Given two equal masses at two locations X and Y, find the ""best strategy"" to move the mass from the first location to second one, where optimality is measured against a cost function. Monge conjectured that there exists a best strategy, i.e. the problem admits a minimizer and that there exists a scalar potential function u such that mass is transported from x in X to y in Y along the direction -Du(x). For about two hundred years, no rigorous proof of Monge's conjecture was given. Appell presented a formal   proof of the existence of the potential function u, where he introduced u as a Lagrange multiplier of Monge's problem. Kantorovich made Appell's proof rigorous by introducing a problem we call  the Monge-Kantorovich problem. The Monge-Kantorovich problem, which is a relaxation of the Monge problem, is based on a duality argument. In a work in progress with L.C. Evans, we study the original Monge problem and have great expectation that soon we will completely solve it. Recently, in a joint work with R. McCann, we proved that given a general cost function c(x-y) which is either strictly convex or astrictly concave function of the distance, the Monge-Kantorovich problem   admits a unique optimal solution which is a map, say T from X to Y. Among other things I would like to study the smoothness properties of the optimal map T for general cost functions. It is known that when the cost function is the square of the euclidian distance, the Monge-Kantorovich problem is obtained by discretizing the Euler equation of an ideal fluid. I expect to give existence results for the Euler equation in any dimensional space by   applying these techniques.    To illustrate the importance of the mass transport problem and the regularity of its solutions we consider two examples, the first one being related to environment. Here, the fluid we consider is water in motion in a lake, and we assume  that we know the state of the water at an initial time, say 0. We want to predict the state of the lake at a later time, say, 10 knowing what evolution laws govern the water. The later state of the water will depend on factors like the wind. The water consists of particles which will move from one location to another and will naturally spend the least energy for this process. We say that the motion of particles is made in an optimal way. When the motion involving the least work is hard to determine at the final time 10, one usually discretizes the problem by studying the state of the water at successive times, 1, 2, etc... 10. This discretization         corresponds to the Monge-Kantorovich problem. The smoothness of the solutions of the discrete problem will guarantee that a slight error of measurement of the initial state will not affect our prediction much. A second example we use to illustrate the importance of smothness of optimal strategies is in economics. Assume that we determine the cheapest way of transporting materials in a network between suppliers and customers. One of the issues  is to know if by removing one supplier and one customer we will be forced    to make a significant revision in our strategy of tranportation. If the know that the optimal strategy depends on the data in a smooth way then the revision needed would be slight."

Loeb from   Frankfurt, Germany where he is a visitor for the month of March.      Abstract of Peter A. Loeb's project      The proposed research will continue Professor Peter Loeb's work   on representing measures and ideal boundaries in potential theory.   In particular, Loeb plans to continue research on a Martin-like boundary   which is regular almost everywhere with respect to harmonic measure.   An important tool in this research is the technique developed with   J. Bliedtner that reduces the production of Radon-Nikodym derivatives   as limits to a special case. This reduction casts new light on   the martingale convergence theorem and significantly simplifies   measure differentiation theorems as well as the treatment of   fine limit theorems in probability and potential theory.   A major consequence is the existence of simple boundary approach   neighborhood systems which, after fixing a suitable normalization,   are the ""best"" possible in terms of producing Radon-Nikodym derivatives   as limits at the boundary. The existence of such ""best"" systems had not   been known even for harmonic functions on the unit disk. Indeed,   previous results in the literature suggested that no such system   could exist. In related, ongoing research, Loeb has improved the   celebrated Besicovitch and Morse  covering theorems from geometric   measure theory by strengthening the results and simplifying the proofs,   including a demonstration that for any norm, the best constant   (in terms of all known proofs) for the Besicovitch result is a   packing constant. In all of his research, Professor Loeb will continue   to employ nonstandard models. These are mathematical structures with   infinitely large and infinitely small numbers. Even when the use of   such structures  is removed from the final proofs of results, they are   extremely helpful in the discovery process. Loeb has recently used   nonstandard models to optimize the coverings of Besicovitch's theorem,   and with Bliedtner he is now using these methods to extend the  notion   of radial limits to general potential theoretic settings.    The results of this research that have been obtained to date,   and the results that will be established in the proposed research   all lie at the heart of mathematical analysis and probability theory.   These are fundamental areas of mathematics used by scientists and   engineers to form the conceptual models of the phenomena with which they   work. The thought process itself can only be couched in terms of   mathematics, and the mathematics being used in turn yields new insight   into the phenomena being studied. Therefore, the simplification and   extension of the basic mathematical tools achieved by the proposed   research will resonate in all of the areas of science and engineering   that use these tools. Of particular importance for future developments   will be the successful employment of mathematical structures with   infinitely large and infinitely small numbers. These structures have   a great deal to offer in all areas of science and engineering because of   the simplicity and power inherent in their use. An important construction   associated with these structures are measure spaces, now called   ""Loeb spaces"" in the literature, which allow the treatment of infinite   probability phenomena using methods appropriate for finite sets.   Researchers including Loeb have obtained new results with these methods   in areas such as the study of partial differential equations,   probability theory, research in economics, and the study in physics   of laws governing the motion of gases."

It is hoped that the results will be of real use to physicists, while remaining in the realm of rigorous and original functional analysis or differential-equations theory.  Many of the particular issues have to do with resonances and metastability, or with connections among geometry, operator algebra, and spectra.  The first specific topic in the proposal concerns the eigenvalues of Schroedinger operators where the potential energy involves curvature.  This sounds abstract, but it actually originates in the analysis of the shapes of phase regions of bistable metallic alloys.  The second topic looks at certain purely algebraic identities recently discovered by Harrell and Stubbe, which turn out to apply, sharply, to the partition function (= trace of the heat kernel), among other spectral expressions.  The third topic has to do with semiclassical analysis, an area in which Harrell has worked for several years, but new features include magnetic fields and time-dependent interactions.  The final topic has to do with local properties of eigenfunctions, such as their nodes, and some inverse problems involving them.  Mathematical machinery to be called upon ncludes perturbation theory, asymptotics, and variational analysis.         This project is concerned with the mathematical analysis of several problems in physics, especially the physics of atoms, molecules, semiconductors, and metallic alloys.  Many of the particular problems have to do with resonances and with metastable (slowly changing) phenomena, and others have to do with the role of geometry in these areas of physics.  The goal of the research is to produce something new and useful to working physicists and at the same time to elucidate the mathematical structure which the physical theory relies on. The first specific topic in the proposa l is to make estimates of the ""normal modes""   of an equation like those in quantum mechanics, but where the potential energy involves curvature.  This sounds like an abstract mathematical problem, but it actually originates in the analysis of metallic regions with two different stable phases, when one tries to find the shapes of the regions with one or other phase.  The second topic looks at certain purely algebraic identities recently discovered by Harrell and Stubbe, which turn out to apply to one of the central functions of statistical mechanics.  The third topic has to do with the   differences between the theory of quantum mechanics and the theory of classical physics,   which applies to our world on a larger scale.  Harrell has worked in this area for several years; new innovations include incorporating magnetism.  The final topic has to do with some poorly understood local properties of quantum mechanical wavefunctions, and how measuring them might establish what sorts of forces are present.  The methods used come from both pure and applied mathematics, and physics."

However, the infinite dimensional dynamical systems generated by, for example,  parabolic equations are not reversible and the phase spaces are not locally compact.  This characteristic creates difficulties not encountered in the study of finite dimensional dynamical systems and new methods need to be developed to understand the nature of these systems.  A theory of structural stability for scalar reaction-diffusion equations,  the Cahn-Hilliard Equation and Phase-Field System  has recently been obtained.  Techniques found by the PI in his previous works will be employed in  the current studies.  It is expected  that this work will  contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of the models of physical systems described by partial differential equations.    Mathematical models for the state of an evolving physical system are the subject of investigation of dynamical systems.  The main goal of the study of dynamical systems is to understand the long term behavior of states in the systems. In applications, the  mathematical models (say differential equations) approximately describe physical reality. To understand the qualitative properties of a physical system, one  needs to investigate not only the mathematical model but also the perturbations of the model. One  also needs to   study  how the qualitative properties of the perturbed  models are related to the  qualitative properties of the original  model. This is especially  important to the numerical computations for the models.  Because of round off error and numerical schemes, the  model studied by the numerical computations actually is a  perturbation of the original  model.The theory for dynamical systems has been considered by many mathematicians and scientists starting with Poincare, Liapunov, and Birkhoff.  One of the fundamental problems in the theory of dynamical systems is the structural stability of dynamical systems. For a structurally stable system, the qualitative properties  are preserved under small perturbations of the system. To understand the dynamics of a system, one needs to investigate the existence of invariant sets,  in particular,  such as equilibrium points, periodic orbits, invariant tori, and attractors, to study their structures and to know  what happens in their vicinity (do the nearby solutions approach  the invariant set, or stay nearby, or leave the neighborhood).  A fundamental problem is to  study the persistence of invariant manifolds and to study the qualitative properties of the flow nearby invariant   manifolds.  The theory of invariant manifolds and invariant foliations has become a fundamental tool for the  study of dynamical  systems."

This  will  make  it possible  to derive rigorously transport  laws   for  related  models  of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

The mathematical  theory  of chaos and  dynamical systems has grown dramatically over the past 40 years. It started with   foundations  of  statistical  physics  created  by Boltzmann, Maxwell in  the XIX-th century. It has covered basic biological models (dynamics of population), various problems in engineering,  earthquake prediction,  traffic   control,  neural networks  for computer  data  processing, optimization  of manufacturing and management tasks,  and has countless other applications where long-time behavior   of complex systems is in question.  Universal features of chaos exhibited by various processes in nature and society make it possible  to describe and predict  such phenomena   by the means of one theory.  In particular,  the concepts of attractors  and repellers  (as structures  or patterns determining  long-time ev olution  of complex systems) are basic  categories  in  the theory of chaos.  Mathematical theory of chaotic attractors  and repellers is still very young and quite different from the old, classical mathematics.   This  is one  of the areas  where mathematical research is currently not only most active but  serves the direct needs of other modern sciences and human activities."

When this is done, new orthogonality conditions arise, with an absolutely continuous measure replacing the discrete one.  The 9-j symbols are equivalent to orthogonal polynomials in two variables, but so far only the discrete orthogonality relation is known.  It is time to look seriously at these functions, to try to find a double rather than a triple series representation for them, and then to find the missing absolutely continuous orthogonality relation. The corresponding work for q-9-j symbols will also be studied.  In  addition to this work and other work on one variable hypergeometric and basic hypergeometric series, some differential equations with 4 regular singular points will be studied.  Lars Onsager's Ph.D. thesis from 1934 contained some interesting results for differential equations which are limits of these equations.  This thesis will appear in his ""Collected Papers"" later this year.  There are a number of interesting problems left open, including some on orthogonal polynomials that Askey will study.    The interaction between mathematics and physics can lead to new insights in both areas.  This has occurred in the quantum theory of angular momentum and in coding theory.  In both fields, certain functions arose which turned out to be identical.  These extended classical functions were studied extensively in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The most general of these functions has recently arisen in the study of knots.  The physics problems have been partly extended to several variables, but many open problems have not yet been solved.  In the one variable setting, a very important aspect of these function was only found when some mathematicians studied them, while other ways of looking at them were discovered by physicists.  Askey will be looking at these problems as a mathematician, and expects that this point of view wil l yield new information of use in both mathematics and physics."

Our model problems in this proposal arise from the study of various nonlinear phenomena, including pattern formation and population evolution (mathematical biology), the stellar structure in astrophysics and superconductivity (physics), the thermistor problem   (industrial mathematics) and the Yamaba problem (differential geometry).  It is, in studying classical partial differential equations, fundamental and essential to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions, which lies in the core of mathematical analysis.  This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness, shape and asymptotic behavior of solutions.  The proposed investigations in this proposal are to provide such studies for our model problems.

Rosay plans to work on several topics in function theory; more specifically, in several complex variables and in partial differential equations.  He is presently working with E.L. Stout on the basic question of boundary values in the sense of hyperfunctions, trying to develop a very concrete local intrinsic theory. He is extremely interested in questions related to uniqueness in the Cauchy problem, especially for the Lewy operator and its perturbations. This has of course a link with the study of abstract CR structures. Several   questions concerning automorphisms of C^n, and polynomial convexity will also be studied, in particular in collaboration with F. Forstneric.  He is presently working on the problem of separating (reducible) analytic sets, in connection with embeddings problems.    The field of several complex variables has applications to many areas of mathematics: approximation theory, Fourier analysis, and, most importantly,  partial differential equations. This latter area of partial differential equations is of central importance in physics  and engineering. In fact, partial differential equations are the natural tool for the study of many processes in physics and engineering; prediction and understanding in physics and design in engineering are often based on partial differential equations.   It is thus of great importance to have incisive knowledge of this area. There are many approaches to the study of partial differential equations, but one of the most important approaches is via several complex variables. The cultivation of several complex variables is thus important. The research proposed by Rosay will clarify several issues in several complex variables, and thereby advance partial differential equations. The applications of several complex variables are not as direct and immediate as those of some areas of mathematics. The history of mathematics, however, is replete with examples of mathematical results whose utilitarian valu e was recognized only many years after their basic development. In fact, this is often the case with the best mathematics--mathematics that avoids the esoteric and the frivolous, but is grounded in reality and persistently asks and attempts to answer the most basic and fundamental questions. It is for this reason that mathematics must be regarded as a long term investment."

The conference will  create   opportunities for cross-fertilization of ideas among workers in  two important   areas of classical mathematics.    Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole  numbers,   addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility  of one   whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of  mathematics and   was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within   the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in  diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,  and   communication systems. Harmonic analysis combines those elements  of mathematics   best  exemplifying the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to  decompose  complex   problems into fundamental components.  These components are then  analyzed for   their basic characteristics. Finally, the  solution is  reconstructed through a   recombination of the  components.The Fourier series and Fourier  transform are    examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other   representing   a continuous decomposition. Harmonic analysis is a surprisingly  useful tool in  studying whole numbers."

It is   expected to contribute in the areas of  Multivariate Splines, Multivariate   Polynomial Interpolation, Radial Basis Function Approximation, Wavelets,   and Gabor Expansions.  The first topic concerns polynomial interpolation.    Several years ago, the proposers came up with a scheme that assigns, to any   data on any finite discrete pointset in several dimensions, a polynomial   interpolant of least possible degree, and with various other desirable   properties. It is proposed to develop an error formula for  that scheme, in   preparation for its application in cubatures or in the construction of   trivariate finite elements. The second topic deals with applications of the   theory of approximation from shift-invariant spaces, a theory that was   developed by the proposers and others.  One suggested application, of a   theoretical  nature, but pertinent to wavelets, explores the (surprising)   connection between the smoothness of functions in a refinable space and the   approximation orders provided by such a space.  Another, very unexpected,   application of shift-invariant space theory is in the area of approximation to   scattered data from the span of translates of a radial basis function. The   suggested approach is based on a new conversion formula that allows the   extension of many approximation schemes on uniform grids to general   grids.  The last topic deals with the representation of functions in one or   more variables via  decomposition/reconstruction techniques.  A thorough   understanding  reached in prior research on general shift-invariant systems   is now used in the constructions of new wavelet and Gabor systems.    Special attention is given to exploiting the freedom offered by the   redundancy inherent in oversampled systems.    Computer solutions of physical problems (including the problems to be   att acked by high performance computing) require a description of the   various physical aspects of the problem in the only language a computer   understands, namely numbers. The resulting mathematical description (of a   car door or the human heart, of pictures taken from a  satellite,  of the   moisture content of air as a function of longitude, latitude and height above   sea level, etc.) is of necessity inexact, and this makes it very important to   develop efficient methods of representation, i.e., methods of acceptable   accuracy and using not too many numbers. The proposal concerns the   development of such methods (for  descriptions involving several   parameters) and of means for ascertaining their accuracy and efficiency."

Szarek  Case Western Reserve University      ABSTRACT            The project involves continued research on the geometric,  probabilistic and combinatorial aspects of functional analysis and  convexity theory.  Many of the problems considered are expressed in the  language of the asymptotic theory of finite dimensional normed spaces  or,  what is essentially equivalent, as ""isomorphic"" statements about high  dimensional convex bodies. Some questions have motivation in the theory of  operator algebras, mathematical physics, operations research,  computer  science or probability and statistics. Typical research topics include:  entropy of linear operators, existence of nontrivial linear operators on  general Banach spaces,  norms of random matrices,  some problems in the  ""local"" operator theory,  Gaussian correlation of convex sets,  balancing  vectors in normed spaces and other questions on the border of probability,  combinatorics and convexity.            On an elementary level,  analysis is a study of  ""functions"",  or  relationships, between quantities and the parameters on which they depend.  As it happens,  very many naturally appearing relationships are linear or  at least convex.   Thus a good understanding of convex functions  (and  consequently of convex sets)  is a prerequisite for understanding those  relationships.  Depending on whether the set of parameters is finite or  infinite  (the latter may also be an  ""idealization""  of  ""very large"";  real life problems usually do depend on very many parameters),  we are  dealing with either finite dimensional convexity  or infinite  dimensional functional analysis.  The  ""isomorphic"" asymptotic theory was,  over the last twenty years  or so,  quite successful in identifying and  exploiting ""approximate"" symmetries of various problems (involving high  dimensional convex sets) that could not be analyzed with earlier more  ""rigid"" methods.  One example of a specific link to applications is a   recent  advance (in computer science) in the area of efficient computation  of volume of high dimensional convex sets,  which utilized results and  ideas from the asymptotic theory."

Following upon the success of the index theorem in the 60's to    provide an analytic framework to compute topological invariants of    manifolds, beginning in the 1970's, spectral invariants were    associated to elliptic differential operators in an attempt to    formulate more subtle topological and geometric invariants of    manifolds in the language of analysis, i.e. differential equations,    on the manifold. The importance of these newer invariants is    underscored in their appearance in the emerging theory of the    fundamental forces by theoretical physicists. While these invariants    are difficult to compute for general spaces, for those spaces arising    from the action of a group, such as locally symmetric spaces, the    harmonic analysis coming from the well-developed theory of the    representations of the group provides a powerful tool to investigate    these invariants. The introduction of geometric zeta  functions serves    to connect in a not-yet-understood way the topology of the manifold,    via the fundamental group, to these invariants through the values of    the zeta function at distinguished points. The goal to understand    topological properties through differential equations then begins on    a formal level to make contact with number theory."

Circle packings are configurations of circles with prescribed patterns of tangency. Until recently Stephenson has concentrated on the development of connections with classical analytic functions, contributing to what is now a very comprehensive and geometrically faithful ""discrete"" analytic function theory. His attention has now turned in other directions --- partly in towards the geometric foundations and partly out towards applications. The current proposal concentrates on three main issues: (1) existence and uniqueness of branched packings on the sphere (equivalently, of branched hyperbolic polyhedra in the ball); (2) properties of and uses for tailored random walks on circle packings; and (3) circle induced geometries in combinatoric settings, such as combinatorial Riemann mapping, Grothendieck dessins, knot projections, hyperbolic groups, and graph embedding. Of particular note is the effort by the Stephenson and his collaborators to introduce ""inversive distances"" into circle packing. Also, he continues numerical and experimental  approaches to investigating phenomena in circle packing through use of a sophisticated software package, ""test bench"".     Circle packing is a relatively new topic in mathematics which involves the study of configurations of circles with specified patterns of tangency. It seems an odd and artificial topic at first, but turns out to be surprisingly rich. Without giving technical details, one can say that in a circle packing the local combinatoric information about contacts between circles turns into rigid global geometric information on the overall configuration. The unique value in this approach lies in the fact that these packings turn out to carry in ""discreet"" packets much of the key geometric information normally described via ""continuous"" equations and formulas. This is especially important as we  move towards the more discrete model of the world required by computers. Among the important areas of study are analytic and harmonic function theory -- crucial, for instance, in modeling of fluid flow, electrical circuits, diffusion processes, and so forth. Results are now being proven using circle packing which could not be established or were even unanticipated in the classical theories. Moreover, circle packing gives opportunities for new results and insights because it permits computer experimentation. Applications have begun to emerge in diverse areas of mathematics and in computer science; for instance, circle packings are good for graph embedding and for various computer visualization tasks, such as 3-D modeling.  And the classical and discrete mathematical theory which underlies these advances is of importance."

Strichartz will investigate problems related to self-similar measures, analysis on fractals, and an experimental approach to basic harmonic analysis estimates. The goal is to develop the theory of fractals using the tools of harmonic analysis, in the process enriching both areas.  By making the central object a self-similar measure (a mass distribution that has similar structure at all scales) rather than a set, it becomes plausible to consider analytic questions, involving Fourier transforms, convolution operators, etc., as well as purely geometric questions.  Analysis of functions defined on fractals (with respect to a self-similar measure) is an area of great interest in recent years.  It is now possible to define the analogs of Fourier series and wavelet expansions for such functions.  This project will extend this theory and answer some basic questions about these expansions.    Self-similiarity is an idea that plays an important role in three areas of applied mathematics that have received a great deal of attention in recent years: wavelets, fractals, and quasicrystals.  But the idea of self-similarity -- an object that can be broken up into pieces, each of which looks like a scaled down version of the whole -- can be investigated in a purely mathematical way that brings out its connections not only with these applications   but also older areas of mathematics such as harmonic analysis.

Given two distributions (f and g) of mass over a Riemannian   manifold M, the problem is to determine the most efficient way to rearrange   the mass of the first distribution to yield the second. Efficiency is   measured against a function c(x,y) which specifies the cost per unit mass   for transporting material from x to y --- so the problem can be formulated   as a linear program. However,  when the cost function is related to the   metrical distance between pairs of points on M, then the problem has a   rich structure and deep connections to geometry and non-linear partial   differential equations which have only begun to be explored. For costs   which are either convex or concave functions of this distance, the goal   would be to find a map from the manifold to itself which minimizes the   total transportation costs, among maps pushing the measure f forward   to g. Even on the line, this map can be intricate. Recent developments   in Euclidean space suggest some promising questions to explore: What   conditions guarantee existence and uniqueness of an optimal mapping?    What geometrical or analytic properties characterize the optimal maps?    Can this geometry be exploited fruitfully in applications?      The motivation for this research is illustrated by an example from   economics: Given a distribution of iron mines throughout the countryside,   and a distribution of factories which require iron ore, decide which mines   should supply ore to each factory in order to minimize the total   transportation costs. The mines and factories lie on a curved space M,    like the surface of the earth, but general enough to include barriers to   transportation such as lakes and mountain ranges; the cost per ton for   transporting ore from any mine to factory is determined by the distance   measured between them in thi s space.  Aside from industrial applications,    the solution to this problem should yield new understanding of existing   patterns in the economy, and may prove useful for infrastructure planning.   Because of its close relationship to several areas of pure mathematics, the   research promises to stimulate a fruitful exchange in two directions:   powerful mathematics will be brought to bear on problems from the real   word, while concrete solutions to those problems should provide new insight   into the mathematics."

In   particular, VN(G) is injective if and only if G is amenable. The proposer   and Uffe Haagerup have defined a property for locally compact groups   (called the approximation property, or AP) which is weaker than   amenability, and have shown that a discrete group G has the AP if and   only if VN(G) has the weak* operator approximation property (the weak*   OAP).  The weak* OAP is a normal matricial version (for dual operator   spaces) of the approximation property for Banach spaces. A dual operator   space has the weak* OAP if and only if it satisfies the slice map   property for arbitrary weak* closed subspaces of B(H), and so von Neumann   algebras with the weak* OAP behave well with respect to taking tensor   products with such subspaces. Notions of amenabilty have been defined for   homogeneous spaces, correspondences and Kac algebras. The proposer has   defined appropriate versions of the AP in each of these cases and during   this project will investigate a number of problems concerning the weak*   OAP and approximation properties for groups, homogeneous spaces,   correspondences and Kac algebras.    Von Neumann algebras are an important tool in the study of quantum   mechanics and quantum field theory, and also play an important role in   the study of group representations (which themselves are used in quantum   physics). The von Neumann algebras that arise in these applications are   usually infinite dimensional spaces. One way of obtaining information   about the structure and properties of such infinite dimensional objects   is to approximate them in an appropriate way by finite dimensional   objects. The approximation properties of von Neumann algebras that will   be investigated in this project are of this type. The weakest (least   restrictive) such property is weak enough that it is satisfied by a  large   class of von Neumann algebras, but strong enough that knowing it is valid   gives us important information about the von Neumann algebra. In the case   of discrete groups, much is known about the connection between properties   of the groups and approximation properties of the associated von Neumann   algebras. The theory of Kac algebras can be viewed as a generalization of   the theory of group representations. One of the goals of this project is   to investigate to what extent the results concerning approximation   properties for groups can be extended to the more general setting of    Kac algebras."

From work of Kohn, Boutet de Monvel, and Harvey and Lawson it is known that any compact strictly pseudoconvex CR-manifold of dimension 5 or greater can be realized as the boundary of a compact normal Stein space.  A CR-manifold with such a realization is called embeddable.  It has been known since the 1960s that the situation in 3-dimensions is quite different: the generic perturbation of an embeddable CR-structure is not embeddable. Our goal is to describe the set of embeddable CR-structures on a compact three manifold as a subset of the set of all CR-structures. For the case of deformations of the unit 3-sphere the small embeddable perturbations are essentially an infinite dimensional and infinite codimensional analytic submanifold of the set of all CR-structures.  The research outlined in this proposal is directed towards extending such results to more general classes of 3-manifolds. In earlier work the investigator introduced a stratification of the set of embeddable CR-structures. Locally the stratification is defined by formally analytic relations. A major thrust of the proposed work is to analyze these equations using methods arising from the Nash-Moser implicit function theorem. It is hoped that it can be shown that the strata have a transverse analytic structure. General position arguments and a generalization of a result of Kiremidjian being sought by the investigator and G. Henkin would then show that the stratification has only finitely many distinct strata. This would imply that the set of embeddable structures is a closed subset in a reasonable topology. Using extremal determinants analogous to those used by Osgood, Phillips and Sarnak it is hoped to define a natural exhaustion function for the space of embeddable structures.    The importance of mathematics in physics, economics, chemistry, engineering, etc. stems from the fact that EQUATIONS describe the rela tionships among the variables that arise in these fields. Making predictions is thereby reduced to solving the equations. One therefore needs criteria to determine whether the equations have solutions, and algorithms for solving them. In practice this can only be done approximately so it is important to have an estimate for the size of he errors one is making. In this proposal we consider a FAMILY of related equations that arise naturally in analytic geometry. These equations often do not have solutions. Even though the equations in the family are closely related, the property of solvability can change very wildly as one moves through the family. Our principal aim is to understand this instability and give criteria that describe the well behaved members of the family. There are similarities between the issues that arise in this analysis and problems encountered in image reconstruction techniques used, e.g., in CAT scans. It is hoped  that a better understanding of the case at hand will provide insight into other cases where similar instabilities arise."

The first area of the research is the study of evolution problems with pointwise gradient constraints, related to Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem. One such evolution problem arises as a model of collapsing sandpiles, and there are other examples, including models of compression molding and type II superconductivity. In   the joint work of the proposer with L.C.Evans and R.F.Gariepy, the collapsing sandpiles model was related to a geometric evolution problem where the velocity of a moving surface at each point is determined by both local and nonlocal geometry of the surface. This geometric problem possesses some ""parabolicity"" properties of nonlocal nature. The main idea of the proposed research is to construct  viscosity solutions of the geometric evolution problem, to study regularity and asymptotic properties of these solutions, and to study connections of the geometric evolution problem with the original variational evolution problem. The second area of the research is the study of another class of variational evolution problems with constraints - heat flows for harmonic maps. In the previous work the proposer has proved partial regularity for heat flows into spheres satisfying some stability condition - a variational condition of entropy type.  The next steps include the study of existence and uniqueness of such heat flows, and the study of heat flows into compact manifolds other then sphere. The third area of research is to try to extend some of celebrated results of L.Caffarelli on regularity of free boundaries in two-phase problems for linear equations to some classes of nonlinear elliptic equations. In previous work the proposer proved regularity for anisotropic two-phase problem with Lipschitz free boundary, i.e., in the case when the solutions satisfy two different linear elliptic equations in two subregions separated by free boundary.    Many problems  in science and engineering lead naturally to mathematical models that have the form of variational evolution problems with constraints. One class of such problems, the evolution problems with pointwise gradient constraints, includes models of collapsing sandpiles, of compression molding, of type II superconductivity. Qualitative properties of solutions of evolution problems are of interest by itself and with respect to possible   applications. Typical properties of variational evolution problems with pointwise gradient constraints include formation of moving free boundaries. The first area of the proposed research is the study of these moving boundaries by relating them to a geometric evolution problem for a moving surface and studying solutions of this geometric problem. Free   boundary problems arise also in the static case. In this case the free boundaries can be viewed as a model of the interface between two different substances. The second area of the research is the study of regularity (smoothness) properties of such boundaries for some nonlinear static problems. Another class of variational evolution problems with constraints is heat flows for harmonic maps. Such problems arise in geometry and their solutions have interesting properties. These heat flows represent one of the models of liquid crystals. The third area of the research is the study of existence and uniqueness of heat flows for   harmonic maps of certain classes."

In the past, he helped develop techniques which lead to the derivation of formulae for solutions to certain partial differential equations in terms of integrals over an appropriate path space.  He then used these formulae to obtain quite refined estimates on the solutions represented.  More recently, he has been trying to use related methods to gain insight into differential geometric problems suggested by recent physical considerations.  In particular, he hopes to learn how to construct and analyze diffusions on spaces of loops in a Riemannian manifold.    In the Newtonian picture of the world, physical objects were thought to follow definite paths, and the goal of physics was to predict the path that a particular object would follow.  In the quantum mechanical picture, physical objects are no longer thought to be so constrained.  Instead, they are thought to governed by physical laws which can, at best, predict the probability of their following a particular path.  The Newtonian and quantum picture are reconciled by the fact that, with overwhelming probability, a massive object will follow a path which is close to the one predicted by Newtonian physics.  On the other hand, when dealing with very small objects, the Newtonian prediction can be quite far off, and one can only make predictions by averaging over spaces of paths.  For this reason, it becomes important to understand how to average over paths.  The mathematical theory of averaging over various path spaces has been one of the central themes of  mathematics in this century.  Its applications are numerous and are not restricted to physics.  Indeed, over the past two decades, very sophisticated  path-space models are the basis on which commodities and financial instruments of all sorts have been priced.  Averaging over path spaces is the  central theme of the research proposed in  this project."

New  hierarchies of finite-dimensional algebras, generalizing the  Temperley-Lieb algebras in a natural way, will be used to study the  structure of subfactors.  These algebras capture, for instance, the  symmetry coming from an intermediate subfactor and can be viewed as a  certain minimal product of the standard invariant associated to two  subfactors.  A variety of new and interesting combinatorial structures  appears naturally in this process.  The technique of studying a  subfactor through its intermediate subfactors is very natural, since  it is on the classical level (i.e., the group level) just the analysis  of a given group through its subgroups.  It is planned to extend and  refine the available intermediate subfactors techniques by studying  the finite-dimensional algebras canonically associated to these  subfactors.  Popa systems, a certain natural system of inclusions of  finite-dimensional algebras of symmetries, will play a key role in  this analysis.  Computational aspects of these symmetries will be  examined, and it is planned to construct and analyze explicit examples  of subfactors and commuting squares.  Possible new interrelations of  the theory of subfactors with mathematical physics and low-dimensional  topology will be investigated.       John von Neumann introduced his algebras of operators on a Hilbert  space to study a variety of mathematical structures, some of which  arise naturally in theoretical physics.  In the early 80's, Vaughan  Jones initiated a Galois theory for inclusions of certain von Neumann  algebras and discovered that these inclusions are extremely  rigid.  They turn out to have a surprising braid group symmetry, which  led Jones to the discovery of his famous knot invariant, the Jones  polynomial.  Besides these profound connections of the theory  of  subfactors to knot theory and low-dimensional topology, there are also  deep relations to statistical mechanics, conformal field theory, and  algebraic quantum field theory that have been beneficial to the  understanding of naturally occurring structures in these areas.  ***"

One of the targets is the boundary theory of superdiffusion on a differentiable manifold  and related problems on the equation Lu=F(u) where L is the second order elliptic differential operator and F is a nonlinear function. Among the problems are the description of all positive solutions and their behavior at the Martin boundary, and criteria for removable boundary singularities in terms of the Martin capacity.  This part of the project has been prepared for by an intensive study, done in the last years,  of the case of a bounded domain with a smooth boundary in a Euclidean space. Another direction iq the investigation of the structure of the most general branching measure-valued process. Previous results have been obtained under an assumption that the second moment of the total mass is finite. There is a hope to remove or to weaken this restriction by using recent progress in the theory of linear additive functionals.  During the last decade branching measure-valued processes  also known as superprocesses  have attracted a great deal of effort from many investigators around the world.  Interest in these processes is motivated by their applications to biology, especially, to population genetics.

Another example is the space of ""suitably nice""   functions (so a point in this type of Banach space   is a function) with distance suitably clarified.    A practical application of Banach space theory is   compact disc coding; a sound signal is, roughly   speaking, a function in a suitable Banach space.   Unfortunately the sound signal contains too much   information to store on  the CD so the signal is   approximated by an element from the Banach space   that is close to  the true element (this is where   the notion of distance enters).

Many results in  analytical number theory are extendable to iet's.  For example, Boshernitzan's recent result, joint with  C.Carroll,  that minimal iet's over a quadratic field must be pseudo-Anosof  (self-similar)  can be viewed as an extension of the classical  Lagrange's result on the periodicity of the continued  fraction representations of quadratic irrationals.  Perhaps the most outstanding conjecture in this direction  is  obtained from an  attempt to extend  to iet's  the famous Roth's theorem on the rate algebraic irrationals can be approximated  by the  rationals. (The analogue of the corresponding  Liouville's theorem is true.)  One of the tools at  Boshernitzan's disposal in tackling the above problems is his recent discovery of a connection between the rate of recurrence of  typical orbits in dynamical systems and the Hausdorff dimension of the   space  (quantitative version of  Poincare recurrence theorem).  For iet's, this connection works both directions. The same is true in many other situations  (Y.Peres, D.Ornstein, B.Weiss).

The collection of all linear transformations in the three   dimensional space, and in any finite dimensional space,  is generated    by translations and certain rotations (via  addition, scalar   multiplication, and composition).

These elementary simple C*-algebras are fully   classified by the dimension of the space.  Many problems in the   quantum physics and in modern technologies (for example, computer   programming) are reduced  to the investigation of simple C*-algebras   of this sort, and more generally, a variety of simple C*-algebras   generated by certain linear transformations in the infinite dimensional   space.  The proposed project is concerned with the structure of   simple C*-algebras generated by some square matrices of infinite   size. In the process of increasing knowledge about these simple   C*-algebras, one important step is to understand their structure   and then to classify them. The proposed project is  especially   concerned with studying invariants that distinguish these algebras.   The classical dimension is no longer the distinguishing invariant,   and thus, finding and studying new distinguishing invariants   become two key problems. The proposed project aims at attacking these  outstanding problems in this area."

They are at the intersection of partial differential equations, classical harmonic analysis and mathematical physics. The principal areas include the study of several dispersive systems arising as approximate models in wave propagation problems. The emphasis is on the development of arguments and techniques, mainly from Fourier analysis, which provide a better description of the behavior of the solutions of such models.The second part of the project is devoted to the study of problems related to viscous flows. They include the long time behavior of solutions to the 2-D density dependent Navier-Stokes equations. Also the system for compressible ideal fluids under minimal regularity of the data is studied. In concrete problems the validity of these models as a good approximation of the physical phenomenon depends on specific properties of their solutions, mainly those describing their long time behavior. Thus, the qualitative features of solutions obtained through this research provide a benchmark against which numerical approximation schemes can be tested. This applied analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations is an equal partner with their numerical study and the modelling of the physical phenomena, all of which interact to give a full mathematical picture."

The focus of the research will be on the spectral and c*- algebraic properties of such n-tuples. The field of multivariable operator theory has become very active in the last ten years.

In the analysis of the relevant integral operators, harmonic analysis estimates will be used to analyze the oscillatory kernels. The known body of results concerning these equation deal mainly with the equation in the whole space. New ideas and techniques will be needed to handle the problem on domains with boundary. The fourth order equation will require an understanding of the Sobolev inequalities for higher order derivatives. In particular, a search for analogue of the positive mass theorem is required. All of the evolution equations mentioned above represent various models in materials science and fluid mechanics. For example, the collective response of a nearly collisionless plasma when the electron temperature is much greater than the ion temperature is dominated by electron plasma waves (Langmuir waves) and ion acoustic waves. Under appropriate conditions (energy density of the waves small compared to particle thermal energy densities, and characteristic scales large compared to a Debye length), Zakharov's model is a useful description of the nonlinear coupling of these collective models. Schrodinger equation can be understood as a limit case of Zakharov's model and can also be used to describe in certain regimes the Langmuir waves in a plasma, i.e., the time evolution of the envelope of the propagating electric field. Our main project is to analyze the solutions of the equations by using the tools of harmonic analysis. For example, we want to understand the development of singularity at certain time, which represents, in the Schrodinger models, how the Langmuir waves collapse. This typical proble m is understood when the models are on the whole physical space. Part of our work is to study the situation when the models are confined in a bounded region in the physical space. The other project we are working on is to study a non-linear problem in geometry. Here we are looking for a conserved quantity analogous to the total mass of a gravitational systems which will play an important role to the solvability of the equation."

Topics to be studied include the realization of quantum groups as groupoid C*-algebras, leaf-preserving and group-preserving deformation quantizations of concrete Poisson Lie groups, holomorphic foliation and deformation quantization, and the cancellation problem for group C*-algebras. The main tools to be used in this research will be from various mathematical branches like C*-algebras, Lie groups, differential geometry, and pseudodifferential operators. This research is motivated by the recent worldwide interest in the noncommutative aspect of geometry originated from the concept of quantization which links together several branches of mathematics and quantum physics. In the physical sciences, it is important to study the invariance of quantities under various symmetry group actions. The theory of quantum groups generalizes the classical theory of symmetry groups and provides new and promising directions in the study of quantum physics.

The synthetic environment will be constructed from and involve the integration of a number of exploratory data analysis tools some of which have already been created, some of which will be created under the scope of this research. Topic areas being explored include 1) a fractal-based grand tour, 2) 1-dimensional grand tour for images and random fields, 3) visualization using two- and three- dimensional wavelets, 4) exploratory signal analysis, and 5) visualization of huge data sets. Mathematical issues being addressed include a new method for constructing grand tours so that all the tour spends equal time in all regions of the multidimensional space and a new methodology for integrating multivariate (multispectral) image data into a single image. Computational issues being addressed include the establishment of a new metaphor for data exploration involving the creation of a data world and portals through regions of it. The research uses three-dimensional models extensively. %%% This research focuses on the exploitation of virtual reality techniques for the analysis of statistical and stochastic data. The thesis of this research is that virtual reality offers a better technology for human-computer interaction as it relates to exploratory analysis than does the desktop metaphor. Virtual reality technology not only offers a much more compelling visual focus than does a standard computer screen, but also a more complete engagement of the investigator with the data world. The major thrust of this research is to combine scientific visualization, exploratory data analysis and virtual reality into a new technology for exploring data. The plan is to create a data world made of analysis modules that can be accessed directly simply by moving from one domain within the data world to another domain via port als. As one moves seamlessly from one domain to the next through a portal, the current data set will be ported into the appropriate analysis or representation technique. The data explorer will be able to interact with the data in the current representation, either directly and/or by means of icons. The main task of this project will be to create a total synthetic environment for the exploratory analysis of data. The impact of this work should be wide ranging. The interactive focus on high-dimensional data analysis has immediate impact on settings where large amounts of multiattribute data are collected. Settings such as biotechnology (e.g. human genome), NASA's EOS-DIS and similar projects (e.g. monitoring global change), manufacturing settings in which many parameters are monitored in both the design and production processes, and materials science where optimization involving a large number of parameters of materials mixtures are examples of data amenable to the type of analyses being facilitated with this research. ***"

The core problem of approximation continues to be the development of efficient methods for replacing general functions by simpler functions. Some methods were invented long ago (methods based on Fourier sums, Taylor polynomials, best approximations by trigonometric or algebraic polynomials, etc.). More recently however, driven by several numerical applications, the directions of approximation theory have moved toward nonlinear and multivariate approximation. This includes the comparatively new subject of nonlinear m- term approximation, wavelets, approximation by ridge functions, bilinear approximation, etc. These have found applications in numerical integration, numerical solution of integral equations, image compression, design of neural networks, and so on. The purpose of this proposed research is to continue the investigations of several areas of multivariate approximation. Emphasis will be placed on nonlinear methods of approximation such as best m-term approximation, metric entropy, and bilinear, as well as their interaction with other fields of mathematics and applications. Keeping in mind the applications of nonlinear approximation in numerical analysis, Temlyakov will study some nonlinear algorithms of approximation, for instance, ""greedy"" algorithms. Approximation theory seeks ways to replace complicated object by simpler objects. This idea has proved to be fruitful in many applications to the real world problems. Among these applications are signal processing, image compression, analysis of contaminant flow, finance problems (for instance collateralized mortgage obligation), and many other. As one of the model problems, consider image compression. Take for example an image (picture) on a TV screen. Why should we approximate it? In many cases we cannot afford to transmit (or store in a computer memory) the whole information of an image, perhaps because of a high cost for transmission of a bit of information or limited channel capacity. This is exactly the point where an application of approximation theory can be fruitful. Clearly, when we replace an image by its approximant we lose the quality of picture: the more information we keep the better approximation to the original image we have. As a result we have an interplay between the reduction of information and the quality of approximation. We try to find the best (optimal) solution to this problem. The purpose of the proposed research is to continue the investigations of methods of approximation of multivariate functions which are motivated by these types of types of applications."

This award provides support dor a conference on the Langlands program. The objectives of the conference are (1) to bring the ideas of Langlands before a wide mathematical audience; (2) to describe recent developments in major areas of the Langlands program; (3) to attempt to anticipate future directions of work on the problems making up the Langlands' program. The Langlands program is part of number theory. Number theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have furnished a driving force in creating new mathematics in other diverse parts of the discipline. The Langland's program is a general philosophy that connects number theory with calculus; it embodies the modern approach to the study of whole numbers. Modern number theory is very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer science and coding theory."
