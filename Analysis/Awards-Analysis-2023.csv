The theoretical study of this problem has advanced greatly in recent years, and the results obtained have been applied successfully to a number of disciplines outside of mathematics, such as the design of lenses with specific reflection properties in Physics, modeling the atmosphere near the earth's surface in Geology, and creating optimal assignments in Economics, among others. This litany of applications makes the development of effective computational tools an ever more urgent matter, and it is important to have tools that can be mathematically guaranteed to exhibit outstanding performance. The project will develop novel computational methods based on nonlinear partial differential equations and establish rigorous mathematical results about these equations in order to guarantee desirable performance of the corresponding numerical algorithms. The work of the project involves individual and collaborative research by the Principal Investigators (PIs), and research mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, with appropriate problems having been identified for students. The PIs will also engage in outreach through co-supervising an undergraduate team in 2024 through the Lafayette College Summer REU program and in 2025 through the Summer Undergraduate Research Institute in Experimental Mathematics program at Michigan State University. Both programs aim to recruit students from schools with limited opportunities for undergraduate research, with an eye toward recruitment of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences.<br/> <br/>The project develops the theoretical foundations for establishing existence and characterizing long-time behavior of solutions to a class of degenerate-parabolic fully nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) in singular settings. These PDE are time-dependent variants of the classical Monge-Ampere equation. Significant progress has been made over the last few decades in developing a theory of classical solutions for time-dependent Monge-Ampere equations with smooth data and Dirichlet boundary conditions. By comparison, the theory of generalized solutions for such evolutionary equations is severely underdeveloped, especially in the context of optimal transport and geometric optics, where the natural boundary condition is a non-standard one. The current project will create a theoretical foundation for viscosity and weak solutions of a class of degenerate parabolic, fully nonlinear equations of Monge-Ampere type with oblique boundary data. The work will also establish quantitative rates of convergence for such equations; this will provide a promising numerical method for the design and construction of reflector surfaces arising in engineering problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory was initiated by Francis J. Murray and John von Neumann in the 1930s, and since then researchers have discovered a vast number of applications to mathematics as well as biology, physics, and engineering. The von Neumann algebras that occur naturally in physics (e.g. quantum statistical mechanics or relativistic quantum field theory) are typically what are known as non-semifinite von Neumann algebras. This makes them more difficult to study, and in particular they lie outside the scope of the majority of techniques developed for so-called semifinite von Neumann algebras over the past few decades. This project seeks to adapt some of these semifinite techniques to almost periodic von Neumann algebras, which straddle the boundary between semifinite and non-semifinite von Neumann algebras.  The project will also involve training and professional development for graduate students and postdocs.  <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to study von Neumann algebras that admit almost periodic weights, with a focus on the non-semifinite case. Specifically, the PI will develop a notion of von Neumann dimension for almost periodic von Neumann algebras and use this to generalize free Stein dimension and l^2-Betti numbers to the almost periodic case. These invariants would shed light on the structural properties of such von Neumann algebras, and an extended notion of l^2-Betti numbers has potential applications to non-unimodular groups and non-measure preserving equivalence relations. Additionally, the PI proposes to extend the notions of rigid and co-rigid inclusions from finite von Neumann algebras to von Neumann algebras equipped with almost periodic states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Turbulence plays a pivotal role in countless engineering and industrial applications such as the design of aircraft, where the production of turbulence must be understood to achieve energy efficient and effective technologies. It has long been believed that the inner workings of turbulence may be understood in terms of the differential equations that are being used to model fluid motion, including the Euler equations. However, the analysis of these equations has proved so difficult that much of the relationship between turbulence and solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics remains conjectural and unresolved. Recently, a new approach has been developed to analyze solutions to fluid equations that have rapid fluctuations comparable to what is seen in turbulence. This approach is intimately tied to questions in the mathematical discipline of geometry. This research project aims to push this new approach towards its fullest potential to improve the understanding of turbulence and to expand the frontiers of mathematical analysis. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>At a technical level, the PI will prove rigorous results on the structure of weak solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics, including the incompressible Euler equations. The results will address the extent to which such weak solutions can be shown to exhibit the properties observed or predicted of turbulent flows. One direction of research will relate to the phenomenon of anomalous dissipation of energy and generalizations of Onsager?s conjecture. The PI will also investigate fine properties of the dynamical structure of general weak solutions to the Euler and related equations. The research will implement and expand upon the method of convex integration, as well as introduce new tools of geometric or harmonic analysis as needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The various approximation properties in mathematical analysis refer to the capacity of an object, such as an infinite-dimensional vector space, to be approximated in useful ways, for instance, by finite-dimensional subspaces.  Such properties are central to a number of important fields, such as quantum probability theory, noncommutative geometry, and quantized calculus.

It states that among all the bodies with a given volume, the ball has the smallest possible surface area. This is the reason why soap bubbles are round - they minimize their surface pressure and thus assume the shape with the smallest surface area. In the recent years, it has become clear that under additional symmetry and convexity assumptions, many isoperimetric-type results become stronger. In this project, the role that symmetry and convexity play in isoperimetric-type questions in high dimensions and several other questions in this field will be researched. In addition to this direction, asymptotic questions about the geometry of high-dimensional spaces will be investigated. When the number of parameters increases, it seems that the question should become more complicated, and therefore, studying some precise questions in a high-dimensional space seems hopelessly difficult. However, it turns out that with many parameters comes beauty and simplicity, and things start behaving in some predictable way. A simple example of this phenomenon is the fact that polls usually exhibit behavior close to the normal distribution. Several questions in that vein will be approached, with potential applications in learning theory. A study of the behavior of large random matrices with so-called inhomogeneous profiles will be performed. This is a direction with potential applications in areas such as Statistics, Computer Science, Physics, and more. Other parts of this project will involve supervising postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, and organizing seminars and conferences.<br/><br/>The isoperimetric inequality is a consequence of the celebrated Brunn-Minkowski inequality, an important result which is used ubiquitously in convex geometry. Over the last 20 years it has become clear that the Brunn-Minkowski inequality is not the end of the story. If one deals only with bodies that have certain symmetries, much stronger inequalities should also be true. This yielded many conjectures such as the log-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture, the (B)-conjecture, and the Dimensional Brunn-Minkowski conjecture. Using isoperimetric-type inequalities via their local versions these fundamental open questions will be approached. In addition, several directions in Asymptotic Geometric Analysis are part of this project, such as creating a fast algorithm which learns a convex body with respect to a general log-concave measure. The ensemble of inhomogeneous random matrices will be studied, using the previously developed methods which involve a new efficient discretization of the unit sphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For dynamical systems, an important class of mathematical objects, the construction of invariants is very difficult. This project studies invariants of dynamical systems using abstract operator algebras (in particular C*-algebras). The specific invariant is the K-theory of the relevant operator algebra, which in turn is an invariant of the relevant dynamical system. The project will involve significant contributions from early-career researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students, who will benefit from training through research involvement.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will study the range of the Elliott invariant, which consists of K-theory and tracial information, for C*-algebras constructed from minimal and hyperbolic dynamical systems.

More generally, matrix inequalities are of great importance in engineering and other applications, since the stability of a system can often be expressed in terms of a complex set of matrix inequalities. The mathematical discipline of matrix analysis can be used to simplify or better understand questions about such inequalities. This project will continue the development of the systematic manipulation of matrix inequalities and study related mathematical questions in several complex variables, many of which are of independent theoretical interest. This project will also explore potential applications outside mathematics, including applications to engineering and economics, such as a search for unstable equilibria in models of trade restrictions, which may inform trade policy.<br/> <br/>A matrix inequality establishes the positivity of the eigenvalues of an expression involving some matrices. For example, matrix inequalities arise in the stability analysis of systems of ordinary differential equations where a matrix solution to the Lyapunov condition is needed. This project will contribute to the mathematical foundations of systematic algebraic and analytic manipulation for matrix inequalities. Recent development of the subject has concerned the study of free noncommutative functions, the natural class of functions used to perform such manipulations in a dimension-free way. A qualitative understanding of the free noncommutative functional calculus is important for applications; it is a tool to work around the fact that matrix calculations, such as inversion and multiplication, are computationally expensive and sometimes unstable. Much of the study applies techniques developed in systems and control engineering, such as realization theory and sums of squares, whose mathematical theory is currently undergoing a rapid development. This project is also concerned with the boundary behavior of analytic functions, which has played an important role in the manipulation of matrix inequalities and moment theory since the classical work of Nevanlinna and Loewner.

A basic example is physical distance between locations in space, and a modern one is to measure how similar two words are (which is how software autocorrects our typing). The mathematical notion used to encapsulate this idea is that of a metric space. Particularly interesting kinds of such spaces are those that arise from networks, that is, those for which the measure of distance between two nodes is given by the optimal choice of a path connecting them using the links in the network: there are no direct flights between Oklahoma City and Boston, so for travel purposes what matters is not the geographical distance between the two cities but rather how to get from one to the other using the available commercial flights. Such network-type spaces play an important role in Information Theory, the mathematical framework for communications where information is encoded in a string of 0?s and 1?s as in today?s computers. The project studies the shape of the corresponding quantum network-type spaces that arise from Quantum Information Theory, which models communication systems where information is now encoded in the state of a quantum-mechanical system. Better knowledge of the shape of these quantum spaces has implications for the understanding of the capabilities of the quantum processes that will be used by the quantum computers of the future. In addition, through outreach, mentoring of postdocs, and involvement in undergraduate research, the project will contribute to the growth and diversification of the body of students and researchers in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The project will focus on geometric questions arising from various models of quantization. It is divided into three parts. The first is about quantum graphs and other quantum metric spaces, with an emphasis on quantum expanders and the further development of a theory of the large-scale geometry of quantum metric spaces. The second part proposes to use Quantum Information Theory tools to study the nonlinear geometry of noncommutative sequence and function spaces. The focus is to study noncommutative versions of several generalized Mazur maps of interest in Banach space geometry, Operator Algebra Theory, Geometric Group Theory, and Theoretical Computer Science, as well as interpolation properties of a new generalization of weighted noncommutative Lebesgue p spaces. The third part is focused on operator spaces, which are a type of quantum Banach spaces. The study of their nonlinear geometry is a timely subject.

This decomposition was originally developed to prove the existence and study the properties of solutions to certain time-dependent partial differential equations (particularly the heat and wave equations) that are used to model physical processes.  With the demands of such applications as quantum mechanics, medical imaging, and signal encoding/compression, the field has expanded.  Approximating natural signals by mathematical functions, decomposing these functions as superpositions of simpler parts, modeling physical processes by mathematical operations on the parts, and, finally, reconstituting the parts by summation each necessarily leads to errors.  Theoretical harmonic analysis seeks to establish a general mathematical framework by which we can say that, provided the initial approximation and model are close to reality, subsequent errors introduced by the decomposition, mathematical operation, and reconstitution steps are small.  One mathematically proves that such approximations lead to manageable losses by ?bounding? certain linear operators, and it is also of interest to understand the corresponding ?reverse inequalities? by determining what kinds of data lead to the largest possible output. This project seeks to bound and study reverse inequalities for certain mathematical operators, called Fourier restriction and averaging operators in which the curvature of some underlying manifold plays an important role.  Such operators arise, for instance, in studying truncation methods for multidimensional Fourier series, as well as certain partial differential equations motivated by questions in physics.  Curvature causes these operators to behave better than would be predicted by simply counting the dimension of the manifold, and yet many open questions remain about precisely how much better.   The cases when the curvature goes negative or vanishes along some nonempty set or when the underlying manifold lacks the expected degree of smoothness are of particular interest.  These scientific endeavors are inextricably linked with the investigator's efforts to help train the next generation of mathematicians. This workforce development encompasses two main directions: advising and mentoring Ph.D. students in mathematics and creating opportunities for mathematicians at all career stages to meet and interact at conferences and other meetings.<br/><br/>This project will follow three lines of inquiry regarding Lebesgue space bounds for operators in harmonic analysis in which the curvature of some underlying object plays an important role. One is to prove new bounds for the restriction of the Fourier transform to manifolds whose curvature either goes negative or vanishes along some nonempty set; another is to prove new inequalities for linear and multilinear generalized Radon transforms; finally, is the use and development of concentration?compactness methods for such operators. The main part of this proposal considers such problems in pathological situations where the curvature of the manifold goes negative or vanishes along some nonempty set, with a particular focus on optimal estimates by using a measure that gives small weight to regions where the curvature is small or by changing the Lebesgue exponents under consideration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, the development of numerous real-life systems can be more accurately explained through the application of distinct maps, that is, of transformations that vary with time, rather than by repeatedly applying the exact same transformation. It is intuitive to examine these issues using typical sequences of maps, which brings us to the concept of random dynamics. Theory of random dynamical systems goes back to Ulam and von Neumann, as well as to Kakutani. Since then, it turned into a well-developed area of mathematics that has numerous applications. But what if the distribution and strength of the random factors itself does not remain constant, but changes with time? That can be modeled by non-stationary random dynamical systems, and the study of the properties of such systems and of their applications is the main goal of this project. Mentoring students will be an essential part of the project. Numerous questions closely related to the proposed project will be suggested to graduate and undergraduate students initiating and increasing their involvement in research in mathematics.<br/><br/>In the first part of the project the goal will be to show that a smooth random dynamical system, under an assumption of absence of invariant measures, must lead to almost sure exponential growth of the norms of random compositions, even in non-stationary cases. Also, moduli of continuity of stationary measures will be studied. The second part of the project will lead to a non-stationary version of the Furstenberg Theorem on random matrix products, that claims that there exists a nonrandom sequence, a non-stationary analog of the Lyapunov exponent, that almost surely describes the behavior of the norms of random matrix products. Non-commutative versions of the Central Limit Theorem, the Iterated Logarithm Law, and other limit theorems will be proven in non-stationary settings, for random matrix products, and, more generally, for random walks on Lie groups. The third part of the project will provide the proof of Spectral and Dynamical Localization for the non-stationary Anderson Model (including the Anderson-Bernoulli case). Besides, the questions on topological structure of the spectrum and essential spectrum of the non-stationary Anderson Model will be addressed. In particular, it will be shown that for a discrete Schrödinger operator with potential given by a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables plus a quasiperiodic background the spectrum must consist of a finite number of intervals, while for a periodic background it can have infinitely many gaps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Number theory deals with properties of whole numbers, such as quickly factoring large numbers into primes, and underpins computer security and behavior of black holes. Harmonic analysis can be viewed as mathematically making a sculpture out of unformed clay; this field takes a complicated function and breaks it up into simple pieces ? its harmonics ? and is central to medical imaging and quantum states. Imagining and building a new landscape where areas sometimes perceived as disconnected can harmonize is at the forefront of this project: Instead of exploiting known connections, new ones will be created centered around three distinct areas. Firstly, quantitative behavior of discrete operators with curvature will be undertaken; while relevant to many applications, the novelty here will be developing the infrastructure to use both analysis and number theory from the perspective of both fields. The second part will be a continuation of the discovery of hidden number theoretic properties in the framework underlying harmonic analysis, furthering this mathematical grid system in both areas. Finally, determining the behavior of a random object of algebraic interest, such as a polynomial, is a central problem in mathematics. By integrating Fourier analysis into this playing field, will enable a better prediction of this randomness in a wide variety of ways. Undergraduates will be heavily involved in research, especially in the second part, via a summer and semester research and training program. The multifaceted and network-building education plan further includes the teaching of a graduate class intitled ?Widening the margins: the experience of URMs in the mathematical sciences,? which will be developed in collaboration with the institution?s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion office.<br/><br/>The project consists of three main programs, all on the intersection between harmonic analysis and number theory. Firstly, operator bounds for discrete operators involving integration over curved submanifolds will be obtained. This is a delicate topic in continuous analysis and the discrete setting introduces new challenges and obstacles. A development of number theoretic tools in tandem with the analysis will dramatically push forward understanding of these objects. Additionally, these bounds are connected to lattice point counts and information on this front will be quantified via refined analysis of exponential sums, including discrete restriction problems for a variety of surfaces that are translation dilation invariant. Secondly, a continued uncovering of a hidden number theoretic structure and techniques in the realm of dyadic analysis will be pursued, leading to a myriad of structure theorems. Thirdly, the program in Fourier analytic techniques in arithmetic statistics will use novel insights from analysis to improve a variety of counts of algebraic interest, such as fields and polynomials. Prior investigations here have already been successful as recent results include a major step in resolving a conjecture of van der Waerden on Galois groups of random polynomials and counting number fields of bounded discriminant. Investigations along these lines will be continued.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the potential energy surface in quantum chemistry is the landscape of the dependence of an eigenvalue on the atoms' positions within the molecule; in this landscape, electrons seek out the lowest point, forcing the molecule into the corresponding configuration. Study of pattern-formation in reaction-diffusion systems can similarly lead to the question of optimizing energy (eigenvalue) of a partition of the available space; this question is known as the ?spectral minimal partition problem?. The common feature of these two examples is a very large number of parameters. The underlying idea of the present project is that when the number of parameters is sufficiently large, it is possible to obtain global information about the operator family from the local information about the eigenvalue behavior. A practically important consequence of this is the ability to certify an experimentally found local minimum as being globally optimal. Questions from this project will be used to mentor graduate and undergraduate researchers, and a WikiBook devoted to spectral analysis on metric graphs will be created and maintained.<br/><br/>The specific mathematical question to be addressed in the project is the eigenvalue dependence on the boundary conditions, which is directly related to the location of the partition boundaries in the ?spectral minimal partition problem?. On the operator-theoretic level, this will be expressed as variation of the self-adjoint extension of a fixed symmetric operator. The goal is to prove a link between the Morse index of the eigenvalue at a critical point and the spectral shift of the operator with respect to a reference operator. Since the Morse index describes local stability of the eigenvalue with respect to perturbations in the boundary conditions, this link will allow one to obtain global information in the form of the spectral shift. The knowledge of spectral shift will then lead to bounds on the energy landscape which, in turn, will certify the local minimum as being globally optimal. The tools used for establishing the link will include parametrization of self-adjoint extensions by the Lagrangian Grassmannian, the Krein-Naimark resolvent formula, Dirichlet-to-Neumann map and the Maslov index techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central topic will be a study of averages over prime numbers as they appear in an important class of generalizations of prime numbers, the abstract number field settings. This infinite class of prime number fields sheds light on the underlying principles that govern prime numbers. It turns out that the commonalities and differences in proofs about these questions in the number field settings give new insights into traditionally evasive questions about prime numbers. These questions include the so-called Goldbach conjectures, patterns that emerge in prime numbers, as well as related and new questions. The research will be conducted in parallel with a training program for a next generation of STEM students, and emerging researchers. For example, continued training of graduate students will take place, and as well lead a program instructing 700 High School students from about 70 High Schools across the state of Georgia in dual enrollment classes such as Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus.<br/><br/>A vigorous program of study in discrete harmonic analysis will be carried out. A range of questions in the number field setting promise new insights into even classical questions like the Goldbach conjecture in the number field setting. These insights come about by a delicate analysis of the Fourier transforms of averages over prime numbers, as the most accessible example. So, questions about Goldbach conjecture are then related to the second and third order convolutions of the averages. Further questions about multilinear averages in the number field setting will be pursued. Subject to research will be novel questions concerning averages over surfaces that combine important elements of continuous and discrete elements.

Matrices help us visualize how linear transformations act on vector spaces; determining their structure reveals important properties of the transformations. Hilbert space operators are infinite-dimensional (think infinite-size) generalizations of matrices. The generalization of a vector is often a function, and as a result, operators are frequently modeled as multiplications on spaces of functions. A main goal of this project involves finding such models for operators. Once that is done, many basic structural questions become natural. Beginning in the 1950s, the study of subnormal operators has been highly successful, and its theory has made key contributions to areas such as functional analysis, quantum mechanics, and engineering. The aim is to resolve several outstanding questions in so-called multivariable operator theory. The project also involves working with students and creating recruitment and retention opportunities particularly for women and minorities to pursue careers in mathematics and other STEM fields.  <br/><br/>The main idea/thrust of this project will be to utilize recently established connections between analytic geometry and analysis to study questions in multivariable operator theory. Attention will be focused on two principal areas: (i) truncated moment problems (TMP); and (ii) (joint) hyponormality and subnormality for commuting families of operators on Hilbert space. In the first area, algebraic conditions will be determined for the existence, uniqueness, and localization of the support of representing measures for TMP. Development of new solubility criteria in the case of moment matrices with column relations is to be tied to irreducible algebraic curves and cubic column relations associated with finite algebraic varieties. The second direction concerns operator theory over Reinhardt domains, with special emphasis on spectral and structural properties of multivariable weighted shifts.

Complex analysis is a mature subject with wide applicability ? from mapping the globe to understanding the runtime of algorithms.  Operator theory was originally created to study quantum mechanics and has since grown into a similarly mature field with applicability to engineering and optimization.  Part of the power of analysis is the ability to convert concrete tasks, such as designing a thermostat or understanding the distribution of prime numbers, into questions about mathematical objects called functions.  This project concerns modern fundamental research in these subjects with a focus on questions with an inherent multivariable nature necessarily requiring a deeper understanding of multivariable functions (and more specifically multivariable rational functions).  The research will be incorporated into educational roles at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and by mentoring of students on these modern and important areas of analysis.<br/><br/>This project focuses on three main areas: (1) characterizing the boundedness of rational functions on domains in several variables, (2) understanding the integrability of rational functions, and (3) systematically determining the asymptotics of coefficients of multivariable rational functions.  This research is also closely tied to the theory of stable polynomials, an area which has enjoyed numerous surprising applications in the last decade.  Development will be continued of the local theory of stable polynomials in old and new settings to get detailed information about the behavior of a rational function near a singularity.  In addition, certain polynomials and rational functions built out of natural operator theoretic constructions such as determinantal representations represent important special cases of interest both in applications and to operator theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The type of parts depends on the nature of the object at hand. This proposal is focused on questions amenable to a dyadic approach: the simpler parts are usually some variation of a small, square signal which takes only two values. Huge advancements have been made since Stefanie Petermichl?s discovery in 2000, that one of the most studied operators in analysis, the Hilbert transform, can be expressed in a meaningful way as an average of such simple operators. Central to this project will be the advancement of Petermichl?s work by relating it to several long-standing open questions in harmonic analysis. An especially exciting path will be building a bridge between two ?competing? methods in modern harmonic analysis, the Bellman function method and the sparse operator domination approach. This has the likelihood of becoming a new ?method? in its own, as it involves new ideas from two leading methods in harmonic analysis. The project further includes organization of activities in harmonic analysis, as well as working with and training graduate students.<br/> <br/>The starting point is an open problem on the dyadic square function which has baffled the field for quite some time. Here, weighted inequalities, specifically with Muckenhoupt weights, will be settled. These types of inequalities have recently dominated modern harmonic analysis, and the dyadic square function is one of the most important operators in the field - especially because it can be viewed as the starting point of Littlewood-Paley theory. The question to then tackle will be the sharp power of the Muckenhoupt characteristic in the weak norm in the Hilbert space setting (parameter p=2). All other situations except the Hilbert space setting (p not equal to 2) are known, which makes it even more strange that this question is still open ? usually, the Hilbert space setting is the ?simple? case one extracts all other values from. However, the nonlinear nature of the dyadic square function turns this all on its head, in a quite unique situation. The planned approach, to merge new ideas for Bellman functions with new ideas for sparse operators, has seen significant recent progress. Much broader applications of this approach are anticipated as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the focal points will be the non-linear Fourier transform (NLFT), closely related to scattering transform for the Dirac system of differential equations. The Dirac system is the quantum electrodynamical law governing spin ½ particles and should be thought of as a relativistic generalization of the Schrödinger equation. Better understanding of NLFT can lead to progress in several areas of mathematical analysis and non-linear differential equations. Questions of convergence and maximal estimates for NLFT will be studied. These are considered by the experts to be among the main problems of non-linear harmonic analysis. The second part will concern extensions and generalizations of classical results of spectral theory, which can be obtained via a new approach developed recently based on the use of so-called Toeplitz operators. Some related questions will be investigated jointly with graduate students. The materials of the project will be used in minicourses and a special topics course aiming at junior researchers and graduate students.<br/><br/>A large part of this project concerns problems of convergence of the scattering data for a Dirac system of differential equations. Scattering is commonly viewed as a non-linear version of the classical Fourier transform, which connects this project to the maximal estimates for NLFT. These connections lead to natural questions of establishing versions of the classical results of Fourier analysis in the non-linear settings of scattering. They have been appearing in various forms for most of the last century and remain an object of active research today. As an example, one can look at the non-linear version of Parseval's identity, which can be traced as far back as the work of Verblunski in the 1930s, and a non-linear analog of Hausdorff-Young inequality, which appears in more recent work of Christ and Kiselev.

A key idea behind harmonic analysis is to express a general function or operator as a sum of simpler parts. Harmonic analysis has countless practical applications in signal processing, tomography, quantum mechanics, etc. It is also a powerful tool to study many theoretical aspects of mathematics. Fourier restriction theory is a subfield of harmonic analysis, which asks if one can meaningfully restrict the Fourier transform of a function onto a hypersurface, for example, a sphere. One then studies how small pieces of a function with different frequencies interfere with each other. Fourier restriction theory is a central topic in harmonic analysis and plays a fundamental role in certain problems in number theory, differential equations, and geometric measure theory. Thanks to the development of new ideas and techniques in restriction theory, several new state-of-the-art results in harmonic analysis and related fields have been established recently. However, a large portion of the new results are still not sharp, or are unknown in the general dimensions. This project will further develop these new ideas and techniques in restriction theory, and push forward the current best results for related questions, especially in the high-dimension case. The project?s multifaceted activities will include a new component for the existing Northwestern Emerging Scholars Program, work with the Math Alliance, involvement in the Chicago Symposium series, as well as the initiation of a summer program: Harmonic Analysis Reading and Research in Summer (HARRIS).<br/><br/>More specifically, in the project weighted Fourier extension estimates (WFEE), and their variants and applications in partial differential equations and geometric measure theory, will be studied. One important case of WFEE is the boundedness of the Schrödinger maximal function. Such estimates are motivated by the recent proof of the almost everywhere convergence problem of Schrödinger solutions, a question which was raised by Carleson four decades ago. The full range of boundedness of the Schrödinger maximal function has been established when the spatial dimension is 1 or 2, but it remains open in higher dimensions. Another special case of WFEE that will be investigated is connected to a difficult problem in geometric measure theory: Falconer's distance set problem. The project will not only apply but also improve various tools and techniques from harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, incidence geometry, combinatorics, and other related areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such inequalities measure the oscillation and cancellation in the Fourier transform of various curved geometric surfaces such as the paraboloid, cone, or moment curve. These inequalities arise from studying partial differential equations such as the Schrödinger equation or wave equation and also from number theory through exponential sums, which can be thought of as Fourier series that encode certain arithmetic data. Over the years, tools in these two areas have developed somewhat independently from each other. One aim of this project is to bring more tools from number theory into Fourier analysis. The connections between these two areas will be studied with hopes of proving decoupling inequalities for a wider and more general class of surfaces and improving upon quantitative versions of these inequalities. Activities will further include organizing an online seminar, several undergraduate activities, and even presentations motivated by the research that are accessible to the public.<br/><br/>In 2015, Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth were able to prove a decoupling theorem for the moment curve from which the Main Conjecture in Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem (VMVT), a longstanding open question from 1935, followed as a corollary.

Decoupling and efficient congruencing developed separately and independently of each other. One objective of this project is to further study connections between them. Previous attempts at interpreting ideas from efficient congruencing from the perspective of decoupling have yielded fresh insights and new points of views. The project includes a continued study of progress on VMVT in hopes of uncovering new tools in harmonic analysis to use them to prove decoupling estimates for a more general class of surfaces. Other goals of this project are to obtain improved quantitative estimates for VMVT via decoupling over local fields which has applications, for example, to the Riemann zeta function.

C*-algebras arise naturally in connection with a variety of mathematical objects of interest, including groups, dynamical systems, and discrete graphs.  This project concerns the structure and properties of C*-algebras associated to quantum graphs.  A relatively recent generalization of the classical notion of a discrete graph, quantum graphs have proven to be useful in quantum information theory: just as classical discrete graphs encode confusion due to noise in a classical communication channel, quantum graphs encode confusion due to noise in a quantum channel.  The project will generate new methods for analyzing the structure of quantum Cuntz-Krieger algebras and their underlying quantum graphs, and explore their interplay with quantum information theory, a topic of growing global interest.  Educational opportunities for undergraduates will be provided through research projects, and a new, interdisciplinary certification program in introductory quantum information theory at the PI?s home institution.  Student researchers and visiting speakers will be recruited with a focus on diversity and representation.<br/><br/>Given a simple discrete graph, the Cuntz?Krieger algebra for the graph is a universal C*-algebra which encodes the graph?s edge relations. The Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states on a C*-algebra can be physically interpreted as states of thermal equilibrium for a quantum system. The KMS states on the Cuntz?Krieger algebra of a simple discrete graph were classified by Exel in 2003 using an isomorphism between the Cuntz?Krieger algebra and the graph?s Exel crossed product, which is a universal C*-algebra that encodes natural dynamics on the graph?s infinite path space. For a quantum graph, an analogue of its Cuntz?Krieger algebra, called a quantum Cuntz?Krieger algebra, was defined in 2021. The principal investigator and her collaborators have since constructed Exel crossed products for some classes of quantum graphs and shown these Exel crossed products to be isomorphic to a quotient of the corresponding quantum Cuntz?Krieger algebras. The first major objective of this project is to design a canonical construction of an Exel crossed product for an arbitrary quantum graph and study its relationship to the corresponding quantum Cuntz?Krieger algebra.

It is expected that the simplified existence proofs for Einstein's equations and for the stability of black holes will make it easier for students to get started on research in mathematical relativity. <br/> <br/>The project is concerned with the problem of existence, asymptotic behavior, and scattering of global solutions of Einstein's equations and other field equations. One goal is to study the asymptotic behavior of small solutions of Einstein's equations with various matter fields. The Principal Investigator (PI) has identified a weak null condition that the nonlinear terms in Einstein?s equations and many other physical systems satisfy, and it is important to understand how this determines the asymptotic behavior. The matter fields propagate slower than the speed of light and are hence concentrated in the interior of the forward light cone. The PI discovered that the gravitational field has one part consisting of a wave that travels with the speed of light and one interior part that is a homogeneous decaying function. It is interesting to find out how matter interacts with gravity. The project is developing a new, more explicit, way to construct solutions backwards from scattering data at infinity. Using the explicit expressions, a compatibility condition that scattering data has to satisfy was identified and it would be interesting to find out whether it is sufficient for existence. It is important to be able to compute gravitational waveforms emitted from compact binary systems, such as two black holes colliding, from far away. Those waveforms are being used to identify such systems from the data from gravitational wave detectors. The PI?s formulation in harmonic coordinates is particularly suitable for this and is being used by his collaborators in numerical relativity.

Their study connects with several areas within mathematics, as well as physics and other fields of science. This project is focused on groups of symmetries of dynamical systems, exploring how properties of the underlying system manifest in, and constrain, the structure of these symmetry groups. A key class of systems are the hyperbolic homeomorphisms, and the core of the project concerns a new stabilized framework for studying the collection of automorphisms of these systems. Symbolic systems, including shifts of finite type, also play a key role, and have important connections to other areas such as ergodic theory and information theory, and their symmetry groups exhibit a wide range of complexity. This project will advance the field by investigating new techniques and invariants for classifying symmetries of systems through the use of stabilization. The project also provides opportunities for graduate students to conduct research. <br/><br/>The project is aimed at a notion of reconstruction: the extent to which the structure of symmetry groups, and their stabilized counterparts, can be used to reconstruct various dynamical properties of the underlying system. The PI intends to further develop and apply various stabilized invariants, notable local entropy, to the study of such automorphism groups with the goal of recovering dynamical invariants, such as topological entropy and zeta functions. Such invariants have been used successfully in the symbolic setting, and one aim of the project is to extend this to certain smooth settings. One goal of the project is to study the question of whether the stabilized automorphism group of a shift of finite type is a complete invariant up to topological conjugacy. In addition, the project explores the extent to which stabilized results, and invariants derived from there, might be used to analyze the classical automorphism groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In quantum mechanics, this is wrong: if you measure momentum before position, you can get a different answer than if you do the measurements the other way around; this is a manifestation of the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Mathematicians call this phenomenon ? that order matters ? ?noncommutativity.?  Noncommutative systems are much harder to understand than classical ones.  The bulk of this project, which aims to better understand noncommutative systems, concerns the so-called ?universal coefficient theorem problem.? On a very rough level, it asks whether it is true that any (reasonable) noncommutative system can be replaced by a classical one, such that doing computations in the classical system gets the same results.  Other parts of the project concern direct applications of the same ideas to approximation problems in the study of geometry and symmetry.  The project will also involve both undergraduate and graduate students in research.<br/><br/>The project intends to use approximation methods to study the so-called universal coefficient theorem (UCT) problem, which asks if any separable nuclear operator algebra (potentially highly noncommutative) is equivalent on the level of K-theory to a commutative one.  The recent impressive successes in the Elliott program to classify simple nuclear C*-algebras have thrown this problem into sharp relief: it is now the only extra ingredient needed to get the best possible classification result.  The approximation methods should be useful in other areas: two projects building on these ideas study approximation properties of word hyperbolic groups and finite-dimensional models for elliptic differential operators on manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximation theory seeks to understand the extent to which the behavior of a general function can be effectively modeled by that of functions drawn from a more restricted class. Efficient approximation of functions is of relevance for numerical calculation. Since the only calculations that can be carried out numerically are the elementary operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in practical terms it is of importance to understand when the values of general functions are well approximated by the values of either polynomial or rational functions. In many situations, the values of the approximant resemble those of the general function only for a sampling of input values. What can be said about values of the approximant for other choices of input? This is the main question studied in this project, with the following application in mind: when a general function is iterated to produce a dynamical system, to what extent does the dynamical behavior of an approximant resemble the dynamical behavior of the original function? The project will also contribute to the development of human resources through educational outreach at the high school level as well as mentoring and training at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and will facilitate the interaction of different fields of mathematics through the organization of conferences and seminars.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator will study the approximation of analytic functions in one complex variable by polynomials, rational functions, and transcendental entire functions. Quasiconformal mappings will be a major tool in this study. The quasiconformal approach to this particular subject is largely unexplored, and affords control over geometric properties of the approximants such as location of critical points and critical values. Such control can be used to understand the intricate dynamics recently proven to exist for transcendental entire functions. Another anticipated application lies in an improved understanding of the geometries of lemniscates (level sets of polynomials or rational functions) which relate to the emerging field of pattern recognition as a tool to distinguish between different planar shapes. The PI also will investigate whether a better understanding of the geometry of polynomial or rational approximants yields new insight on the numerical implementation of root-finding algorithms which rely essentially on such approximants. Interactions between the different fields alluded to above (approximation theory, geometric function theory, complex dynamics, and numerical analysis) will be fostered via the organization of conferences, meetings, and seminars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It encompasses deep connections across many mathematical fields, including analysis, combinatorics, and number theory.  Structure theorems in ergodic theory, an essential tool in understanding the average behavior of dynamical systems over space and time, have been especially valuable in advancing the field over the past two decades. While most research on structure theorems has focused on systems with a single transformation, our understanding of systems with multiple transformations remains limited. In this project, the PI aims to establish new structure theorems for systems with multiple transformations, offering a fresh perspective on open problems in ergodic theory and combinatorics. The PI will introduce new courses and seminars, and provide guidance to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows. Additionally, the PI will engage in activities aimed at promoting mathematics to the broader community as well as reaching out to underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The project can be divided into two main parts. The first part aims to deepen our understanding of concatenation theory, a new tool introduced by Tao and Ziegler in recent years to study the intersections of different factors of a dynamical system.  A new framework for concatenation theory will be pursued which would apply in a wider range of settings, leading to new structure theorems.  The second part of the project will use the structure theorems developed in the first part to investigate two specific open questions in ergodic theory and combinatorics. The first question pertains to the joint ergodicity conjecture, which concerns the convergence of multiple ergodic averages.  Recent advances, including work of the PI, have established powerful tools for studying such questions.  The second question focuses on the geometric Ramsey conjecture, a long-standing open question in combinatorics which studies geometric patterns that cannot be destroyed by partitioning Euclidean space into finitely many parts. To address this question, methods from higher order Fourier analysis, along with newly developed tools derived from structure theorems, will be employed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dispersive/wave equations model wave propagation phenomena which are ubiquitous in nature. They also describe the basic laws of quantum physics, which is one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century. This project studies fundamental questions about dispersive and wave equations by introducing ideas from probability theory. The results of the project will advance the mathematical theory of wave turbulence, which has important applications to plasma physics, nonlinear optics, and oceanography, and the analysis of Gibbs measures for Hamiltonian systems, which plays a key role in quantum field theory and statistical physics. Due to its scope and connections to physics and science, the project will also promote interdisciplinary interactions. As part of the project, the Principal Investigator (PI) is training junior researchers and contributes to maintaining the diversity in STEM disciplines at University of Southern California.<br/><br/>This award supports work on five research projects (A-E). The first three projects are concerned with the mathematical theory of wave turbulence. In Project A, the PI extends the short kinetic time derivation of wave kinetic equation to longer kinetic times. This is a major step in the development of the theory, as it goes beyond the perturbative regime and will also shed light on the longstanding open problem of the long-time derivation of the Boltzmann equation. In Project B, the PI plans to generalize this derivation to cover the full range of conjectured scaling laws, which is physically well motivated and also leads to new mathematically interesting structures. New significant combinatorial structures and cancellations which are not present in the physics literature are expected to be discovered. Project C considers the wave turbulence problem for water waves, which has been studied since the 1960s by physicists. Mathematically, it is a quasilinear equation and substantial new ideas are required to obtain results similar to the ones available in the semilinear case. The last two projects concern Gibbs and other invariant measures in statistical physics and quantum field theory. Project D concerns the Gibbs measure for the 2D hyperbolic sine-Gordon equation, which is an important model that contains near-critical scenarios. Here, the goal is to further develop the random tensor theory introduced by the PI in earlier work. Project E investigates, through a combination of techniques from probability theory and integrable systems, the invariance of the white noise measure for the one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which is critical but also completely integrable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its practical applications span architecture, engineering, and spatial understanding, enabling secure designs, efficient structures, and effective navigation.  Rigidity results, which determine the stability and preservation of geometric objects under specific transformations, have played a pivotal role in modern geometry.  Among them, the study of rigidity under curvature constraints holds particular significance.  The scalar curvature is of primary interest in this setting because, in contrast to other notions of curvature, it exhibits both flexibility and rigidity under suitable circumstances.   A main objective of this project is to develop new approaches to address long-standing conjectures and open questions related to scalar curvature.  Various analytical methods, including techniques from index theory, will be instrumental in achieving the project?s goals.  Index theory provides a powerful set of tools for studying the rigidity of geometric structures by investigating the properties of differential operators and their associated indices.   Recent advances in index theory have led to significant breakthroughs in understanding the interplay between curvature and rigidity from an analytical point of view and have sparked a surge of interest and activity in scalar curvature, opening exciting new directions in geometry.  In addition to exploring this new landscape, this project offers training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, focusing on research in the fields of K-theory, index theory, and noncommutative geometry.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this project is to advance the development of index theory on ?singular? spaces (such as spaces with singularities, or spaces with incomplete metrics). In addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, index theory on singular spaces has two significant applications: scalar curvature problems in geometry and higher signature problems in topology (such as the Novikov conjecture). The principal investigator (PI), together with collaborators, has developed a novel index theory for manifolds with singularities. Notably, when applied to scalar curvature problems, this new index theory allows for comparisons of scalar curvature, mean curvature, and dihedral angles of Riemannian metrics on manifolds with singularities. The application of this theory has already yielded interesting results by solving important conjectures posed by Gromov on scalar curvature, including Gromov's cube inequality conjecture and Gromov's dihedral extremality and rigidity conjecture. In contrast to the classical index theory on compact smooth manifolds, the presence of singularities poses a significant challenge in formulating a coherent index theory on spaces with such singularities. Similarly, many geometric problems on incomplete manifolds encounter similar challenges due to the incompleteness of the metric. A major component of this project is to further develop index theory techniques to effectively address the challenges posed by both singularity and metric incompleteness. As applications, these techniques will lead to positive resolutions of some important conjectures of Gromov on scalar curvature, and the Novikov conjecture and the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for new classes of groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They provide a paradigm for characterizing physical theories across the spectrum, from high energy to condensed matter physics. Traditionally, symmetries are described by mathematical objects called groups. However, in recent decades, interesting quantum theories have emerged whose fundamental symmetries are not reversible, requiring an extension of our classical ideas of symmetry beyond groups. Quantum theories can be described in the language of operator algebras, and these new kinds of symmetry can be realized by mathematical objects called tensor categories acting on operator algebras. The goal of this project is to provide classification results for categorical symmetry of operator algebras with an emphasis on situations relevant to quantum spin systems. These results will, in particular, help provide a rigorous understanding of topologically ordered phases of matter.  This project will incorporate research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at North Carolina State University, with an emphasis on the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project has two main components. In the first, the principal investigator will provide a classification of approximately finite dimensional actions of amenable tensor categories on approximately finite dimensional C*-algebras in terms of K-theoretic invariants. Amenable tensor categories simultaneously generalize discrete amenable groups and the representation categories of compact groups, while approximately finite dimensional actions provide categorical generalizations of global symmetries of 1D lattice spin systems. The principal investigator will extend their previous results in this direction from the case of fusion categories to the infinite amenable setting and apply these results to obtain new classifications for topologically ordered spin systems. In the second component, the principal investigator will generalize their previously developed categorical chi invariant for von Neumann algebras to an invariant for group actions on von Neumann algebras.

Such geometric objects play an important role in pure mathematics, as well as in various areas of science and engineering. This project focuses on understanding metric and geometric properties of surfaces, i.e. notions of length and angle. Deforming the metric structure of a surface gives rise to so-called `moduli spaces?; each point in the moduli space represents a particular geometry on the underlying surface. The PI will continue to investigate two natural classes of surface geometry: (i) singular flat metrics, and (ii) hyperbolic (negatively curved) metrics. Improved understanding of flat metrics has led, and will continue to lead, to new results in dynamical systems. Hyperbolic metrics are, in a certain sense, the most natural metrics to put on these surfaces. This project will also investigate various structures on the moduli spaces of surfaces, notably measures, which provide for a well-defined notion of `random surface?. The PI will use and further develop analogies between the two types of metrics, as well as connections to graph theory, probability theory, spectral geometry, and algebraic geometry.  The broader impact of this project includes the generation of questions and topics suitable for graduate students. The PI will maintain an involvement with programs aimed at bringing together early-career researchers to work on problems in concentrated and collaborative settings.<br/><br/>In the flat metric setting, the PI has used the new multi-scale compactification of strata of translation surfaces to prove strong regularity of ergodic SL_2-invariant probability measures, verifying a natural heuristic about affine invariant manifolds. This result, and the techniques in its proof, have already been applied by others to study random Teichmuller geodesics and counts of pairs of saddle connections. In another joint work, the PI has proved restrictions on the type of equations that can define an affine invariant manifold near the multi-scale boundary, thereby providing a new proof of Wright's Cylinder Deformation Theorem and generalizing it to meromorphic strata. The PI will use the above results and techniques to study, via degeneration, the centrally important classification problem for affine invariant manifolds, as well as problems about the less studied k-differentials for k>2. The PI has also developed a research program concerning random hyperbolic surfaces, a young and active field. Together with Sapir, the PI has proved a conjecture concerning the relative number of simple versus non-simple closed geodesics for various notions of random surfaces, as genus tends to infinity.  There is a fruitful analogy between random hyperbolic surfaces and random regular graphs; the PI has solved, and continues to investigate, problems on both sides of the coin.

This litany of applications makes the development of effective computational tools an ever more urgent matter, and it is important to have tools that can be mathematically guaranteed to exhibit outstanding performance. The project will develop novel computational methods based on nonlinear partial differential equations and establish rigorous mathematical results about these equations in order to guarantee desirable performance of the corresponding numerical algorithms. The work of the project involves individual and collaborative research by the Principal Investigators (PIs), and research mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, with appropriate problems having been identified for students. The PIs will also engage in outreach through co-supervising an undergraduate team in 2024 through the Lafayette College Summer REU program and in 2025 through the Summer Undergraduate Research Institute in Experimental Mathematics program at Michigan State University.

As such, they are ubiquitous in the mathematical modelling of a host of systems in physics, engineering, and other scientific fields. This project will explore two salient issues related to the theory of partial differential equations, in the setting of higher-dimensional spaces defined via complex numbers. The first topic is the question of unique continuation, which ? in rough terms ? asks when infinitesimal data about the solution to a differential equation suffices to determine the behavior of the solution on macroscopic scale. The second topic is the regularity of solutions. In many physically relevant situations, partial differential equations exhibit a self-improving regularity property: solutions that are a priori assumed to exist within a broad class of functions with a weakly defined notion of smoothness, in fact can be shown a posteriori to satisfy a much more stringent smoothness condition. Such results are important both for the theory of partial differential equations and for scientific applications. The types of second order partial differential equations under consideration in this project are relevant for other equations of physical significance, such as the wave and heat equations, the Klein-Gordon equation, Maxell?s equation, and Schrödinger?s equation. The project will also contribute to the development of a scientifically literate workforce through graduate recruitment and training.<br/><br/>The primary focus of the project is on the theory of CR mappings between CR manifolds. CR mappings are a foundational concept in the theory of several complex variables. In this context, a general unique continuation problem asks when a CR mapping between two embedded CR manifolds, that vanishes to infinite order at a single point, must vanish identically in a neighborhood of that point. Very few sufficient conditions are known, even in simple special cases. This question will be investigated in concert with related unique continuation problems for solutions of second order subelliptic partial differential equations with real analytic coefficients. The second part of the project involves the regularity theory of CR mappings on embeddable and abstract CR manifolds, along with the regularity of CR functions on abstract CR manifolds. Such results have applications to the theory of solutions of systems of first order complex nonlinear partial differential equations. The current project will focus on understanding conditions on the underlying manifolds that guarantee smoothness of CR mappings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These enigmatic regions not only hold immense astrophysical interest but also bear relevance to profound theoretical questions such as the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture, which affirms the deterministic character of General Relativity. This project is aimed at the mathematical analysis of the Einstein equations within the interior of black holes, with the ultimate objective of providing a rigorous proof of the elusive Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture within the context of gravitational collapse, the process giving rise to black holes. By conducting a series of projects building up on spherically symmetric models, this research endeavor significantly contributes towards this goal and, more broadly, advances our understanding of the mechanisms governing the formation and stability of singularities within General Relativity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems can vary in complexity, ranging from the free motion of a simple mechanical system to the behavior of gas in a closed vessel. Hyperbolic dynamics studies the properties and long-term behavior ""on average"" of such systems. The project will address fundamental questions in hyperbolic dynamics that could potentially impact areas such as physics, chemistry, and engineering, where chaotic dynamical systems naturally arise. Additionally, the project has an educational component and provides support for the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The rigidity program in rank one dynamics aims to establish a stronger form of equivalence (such as smooth conjugacy) from a priori weaker forms of equivalence (such as orbit equivalence or topological conjugacy), assuming the vanishing of obstructions that are usually associated with periodic orbits (such as periods of periodic orbits or eigenvalue data at periodic points). Recent ideas proposed by the PI and collaborators open up a lot of new ground, especially for higher dimensional systems. The PI will explore these new avenues for rigidity in dynamics. Even more importantly, some of these ideas also enable progress in neighboring areas.

The particular class of ""fully nonlinear elliptic equations and systems"" is especially important from this perspective. For instance, such equations and systems turn up in the theoretical study of composite materials. This project contributes to a better understanding of fully nonlinear elliptic equations and systems, thereby providing scientists and engineers with sharpened insight into various physical processes and ultimately enhancing the quality of consumer products manufactured from composites. As part of the project, the principal investigator trains Ph.D. students, many of whom are expected to continue their careers as educators.

One part of the project concerns a long-standing open problem on the existence and compactness of solutions to a fully nonlinear Yamabe problem. This is equivalent to solving, on a Riemannian manifold, a fully nonlinear elliptic (but not uniformly elliptic) partial differential equation of second order. Closely related work includes a fully nonlinear Nirenberg problem and a fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem. There has not been enough understanding for such type of equations, especially comparing to that available for fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations of second order where the theory is much more mature. The study of the open problem should lead to better understanding of these elliptic, but not uniformly elliptic, equations. It will also lead to a better understanding of degenerate elliptic fully nonlinear equations of second order. This will provide new tools in the study of this and other important nonlinear partial differential equations arising from geometry and physics. Another part of the project concerns elliptic equations and systems arising in the study of fluids and composite materials.

Mathematically, such optimal shapes are interpreted as solutions to free boundary problems, a kind of generalized differential equation where the edge of the shape is one of the unknowns being solved for. Free boundary problems are a classical but difficult topic in mathematical analysis, and the goal of this project is to develop more robust tools for understanding the local and global characteristics of wider classes of such equations.

It is now a vital and growing area of research in mathematical analysis with connections to a broad range of subjects, including geometry, number theory, and combinatorics.  The main purpose of this project will be to develop new tools in harmonic analysis and combinatorics to investigate questions central to ergodic theory and convex geometry.  In ergodic theory, the PI will consider a variant of the widely studied Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture, for dynamical systems with the underlying structure of nilpotent groups.  In harmonic analysis, maximal operators over high-dimensional convex bodies will be investigated in connection with the isotropic constant conjecture, a major open problem in convex geometry.  The educational component of this CAREER project will contribute to the training of students and postdoctoral fellows while promoting mathematics to the broader community and encouraging the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups.  The PI will continue to supervise undergraduate and graduate students and run his widely subscribed Ergodic Theory and Analysis online seminar series.  The PI will also organize five online, one-week workshops, which will combine research training with professional development for undergraduate and graduate students interested in pursuing further education and academic careers in mathematics.  <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project aims to develop new methods in harmonic analysis, number theory, and probability to understand central problems in ergodic theory and convex geometry.  The primary focus in ergodic theory will be to understand norm and pointwise convergence phenomena for linear polynomial ergodic averages, toward the goal of proving a linear variant of the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture in the context of all nilpotent groups.  The project will also investigate the maximal functions corresponding to the Hardy-Littlewood averaging operators associated with convex symmetric bodies.  The longstanding question of whether dimension-free estimates may be obtained for these maximal functions is related to the isotropic constant conjecture in high-dimensional convex geometry, which in turn has inspired deep and unexpected connections to many challenging questions in convex geometry, Banach space theory, and beyond.  Describing the optimal constant in the Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality in this setting would establish a new link between the dimension-free conjecture and the isotropic constant conjecture, and a new point of view on the latter problem, which has not yet been explored using tools from harmonic analysis. In addition, the project will develop tools in Fourier analysis and additive number theory toward a study of Weyl-type inequalities in the nilpotent setting and their applications to a nilpotent Waring problem as well as to a dimension-free variant of the classical Waring problem for squares.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these models, the objects aiming to describe reality are functions defined in regions of space-time and satisfying certain partial differential equations. The research carried out by the PI focuses on the equations arising in the context of fluid mechanics. The solutions of partial differential equations are usually described by an infinite number of parameters. This is a complication, but the reward is that the resulting models are in some sense canonical. For example, once we make a small number of very reasonable assumptions about fluid motion, we necessarily end up with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. There is essentially no ambiguity about what the model should be, and the Navier-Stokes equation is widely used in science and engineering, from airplane design, weather prediction, and climate modeling to computations of various water flows. To be able to perform computer simulations of the equations, it is necessary to reduce the continuum models to models described by finitely many parameters. However, this step is not canonical, there are many reasonable ways of doing it. When the continuum model is well-understood mathematically, its reductions to finite-dimensional models and their relations are relatively well understood. Of course, one should not overstate this - even in that case there are still many interesting open problems. However, our mathematical understanding of the Navier-Stokes equation is quite incomplete, and that makes the interpretations of the results from its finite-dimensional reductions harder. One way to think about the research in this project is that it aims to contribute to filling this gap in our knowledge and ultimately make our modeling more efficient. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, this project focuses on the following topics: (i) Well-posedness, (non)-uniqueness, backward uniqueness, and critical situations for basic equations. In recent years, important advances have been made concerning well-posedness and non-uniqueness for the Navier-Stokes and related equations, but important basic questions still remain open. For example, can the solution operator be continuously extended from smooth solutions to spaces with topologies generated by natural physical quantities such as energy? Are regularity estimates in two-dimensional domains with boundary saturated by some solutions? (ii) Steady-state solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation and deformations of Serrin?s swirling vortex. The study of steady-state solutions, in addition to being of independent practical interest, provides insights for improving our understanding of time-dependent solutions. In this project, the focus is on deformations of certain known classes of solutions (due to Serrin) with symmetries to solutions with fewer symmetries. It is worth pointing out that both Serrin's solutions and the deformations envisaged here have connections to tornadoes; (iii) Liouville Theorems and related linear problems. Liouville theorems aim to describe global bounded solutions in all space-time and are closely related to open regularity questions about the equation. In this project, they are studied mostly in the steady-state setting. Their study also leads to interesting linear problems that will be addressed; (iv) One-dimensional models, including the study of possible avoidance of singularities by generic forcing for the quaternionic Burgers model and the global well-posedness and more detailed solution behavior for the De Gregorio model. There are many open problems even at the level of the one-dimensional models. These problems should provide good steppingstones towards improving our understanding and eventually applying the lessons learned from studying these models to higher dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This occurs in many natural systems, such as the human heart, fluid flows, and global weather patterns.  The PI plans to develop a general framework and new approaches for understanding chaotic behavior in a large class of dynamical systems.

Whereas the groups themselves have no explicit concept of distance and therefore also no explicit geometry, the project is devoted to unveiling the implicit geometry that can be defined from their algebraic and topological structure. The mathematical problems proposed bring together ideas stemming from mathematical logic, analysis, and metric geometry, while at the same time their solution will develop a tool set applicable to other areas such as geometric topology. The project will also contribute to US workforce development, through the training of students and post-doctoral scholars, and to community building in the mathematical sciences through targeted conference and workshop organisation.<br/><br/>Apart from their topological and algebraic structure, topological groups carry well-defined large scale and small scale geometries in the form of canonical coarse and uniform structures that may or may not be instances of underlying large or small scale Lipschitz geometries on the group.

One facet of the proposal is exactly to make progress on this problem by constructing an appropriate Banach?Lie algebra for groups admitting small scale Lipschitz geometry and perhaps ultimately characterise them as closed subgroups of Banach?Lie groups. Other problems in the proposal concern liftings of bounded sets in Polish groups, non-commutative analogs of coarsely proper actions on locally compact spaces and new constructions of groups admitting coarsely proper and cocompact on said spaces.

The principal investigator plans to classify obstructions to classical asymptotic expansions, and to develop new tools applicable in cases where the classical expansions fail. A second topic to be considered is exponential mixing. Sharp limit theorems for exponentially mixing systems will be studied through an exploration of geometric structures in the associated phase space. Next, the principal investigator will study flexibility of statistical properties through the construction of dynamical systems with exotic properties. A final topic under consideration is averaging theory. The principal investigator has previously made several contributions to the study of averaging for systems with hyperbolic fast motion.

Such integrals appear systematically in the context of harmonic analysis, a field of mathematics which studies properties of functions via their decomposition into components according to a suitable notion of vibrational frequency. The study of singular integrals is characterized by delicate cancellations which occur between positive and negative contributions. Some key questions to be considered in this project involve commutators. A commutator is the difference A*B-B*A of two products taken in the opposite order. The commutation property A*B = B*A is rare in general, and the size of the commutator gives a measure for the degree of non-commutativity. Classical examples are related to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The project will advance state of the art commutator theory involving singular integrals. This includes problems on curves with a geometric flavor and higher parameter variants of recent key estimates with applications to partial differential equations. Part of the project deals with an important singular integral, the Beurling?Ahlfors transform, and particularly with questions related to weighted estimates. Weighted estimates are generally desirable due to their wide use throughout harmonic analysis and its applications. Methodologically, discrete methods involving probability have recently become central in related problems, and such methods will be further developed in combination with new geometric constructions. In addition, the Principal Investigator will supervise graduate students on topics related to the proposed research, and will organize a research workshop for early-career researchers and a separate online conference for undergraduate research.<br/> <br/>This project revolves around the study of singular integrals, harmonic analysis, and commutators. Among the topics to be considered are weighted estimates for higher powers of the Beurling?Ahlfors transform, an important exemplar of the class of singular integrals. The relevant theory has recently been advanced by the discovery of counterexamples showing the failure of the famous A2 conjecture in this context, but the precise bounds are not completely understood. The investigator will also advance the theory of commutators by studying singular integrals on curves and bi-commutator analogues of recent commutator characterizations. Such commutator problems are also related to weak variants of sparse domination in the multi-parameter setting. Sparse domination methods have been central in the past decade for related problems but up to now have remained a one-parameter tool. On the methodological side, the project will further develop the method of approximate weak factorizations, which has been responsible for many recent breakthroughs, and will combine that method with other novel tools. The project will utilize dyadic-probabilistic analysis, fine-tuned counterexamples, and geometric factorizations to develop applicable harmonic analysis methods suitable for these and other questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fractals are spaces that possess either a degree of self-similarity, or roughness, or both, and randomness refers to uncertainty in these patterns. Non-uniform geometry here means that the geometric features of the given objects do not adhere to the same quantitative standards across all locations and scales. Within mathematics, substantial interest in the study of fractals comes from their applications in the theory of dynamical systems. Outside of mathematics, fractals have numerous applications, for instance, in antenna design, terrain analysis, and target recognition. This project revolves around questions and problems regarding surface uniformization and simultaneous conformal welding, in particular, in the presence of randomness. The principal investigator will adapt and extend conformal uniformization and welding techniques to new non-uniform and fractal dynamical settings. The investigator also intends to mentor students at various levels, from high school to Ph.D., and foster research in the actively evolving field of fractal geometry and dynamics.<br/> <br/>The geometrically non-uniform objects considered in this project are metric curves and spaces that are not quasisymmetrically equivalent to circles, equilateral triangulations, etc. Examples of such spaces are abundant in the dynamics of quadratic polynomials, in conformal welding problems, and in random uniformization. One specific goal of the project is to introduce a new class of random surfaces spread over the sphere and to consider the type problem for surfaces of this class. In the case when such surfaces are (almost surely) parabolic, the value distribution properties of associated functions, particularly the order of growth of such functions, will be investigated. Another goal is to develop simultaneous conformal welding tools and techniques that in turn will extend recent results on merging reflection groups with critically fixed anti-rational maps. The methods to be employed are complex analytic in nature. Success in this project will result in new contributions to the growing literature on random surface uniformization and conformal welding, will raise new questions in random value distribution, and will develop new tools which go beyond those employed in current methodology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A potential benefit of success in this project lies in the possibility to bring tools from one mathematical field to bear on other fields, thereby increasing the interactions between areas of mathematics. The project also provides opportunities for collaboration and for the mentoring and training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The project focuses on three subjects within the broad field of nonsmooth analysis, geometry, and probability. First, spaces of Sobolev functions and functions of bounded variation will be considered on general metric measure space. The theory of Sobolev spaces on abstract metric measure spaces has attracted substantial attention over the past few decades. In this context the upper gradient approach has proved to be one of the most successful approaches. However, due to the lack of sufficient connectivity, the approach via upper gradients fails to be effective in many fractal spaces. This project will explore an alternative approach to Sobolev spaces, building on prior work of Korevaar and Schoen, which is more effective in fractal settings. A second direction of research involves fractional Gaussian fields and the parabolic and hyperbolic Anderson models on Dirichlet metric measure spaces. A key goal here is to develop a general theory of fractional Gaussian fields and Anderson models on general Dirichlet spaces, including fractals. Motivation arises from mathematical physics, and challenging properties such as intermittency and localization will be investigated. Finally, the project takes up the study of random matrices and symmetric spaces, exploring how Riemannian fibrations of symmetric spaces enable the construction of integrable random matrix functionals. Integrable here is understood in the sense that the Laplace transforms of such functionals can explicitly be expressed using special functions.

They model many types of behavior, from animal neurons to epidemics to weather modeling.  In some cases, we have a classification of the simplest types, and know how they are arranged.  For example, we have now a good understanding in the real quadratic case. This achievement was the result of work by many researchers from different fields. It remains a central challenge to give a classification of examples beyond the real quadratic setting.  This project takes up this challenge using tools from several different areas of mathematics.  It focuses on systems that involve complex numbers, and on more general types called conformal.  The conformal dynamical systems studied in this project include newly discovered, more exotic examples.  Though our understanding of those more general systems is poorer, we have many new tools, from algebra to analysis, with which to study them.  The project applies techniques from the well-developed theory of mapping class groups to the classification problem.  Mapping class groups are symmetries of two-dimensional objects and are studied by both mathematicians and physicists. This project generalizes the notion of a mapping class group in a way that includes these two-dimensional complex dynamical systems.  It also applies new tools from the recently developed theory of self-similar groups. This research area has an abundance of accessible problems.  Students who engage with these topics will come to appreciate the essential unity of mathematics and the excitement of research. This will contribute to the development of a pool of mathematical talent that is broadly trained.  Special software designed for this study allows for rich experimentation and the development of technical skills.   <br/><br/>The combinatorial foundations of complex dynamical systems were laid by A. Douady, J. Hubbard, and W. Thurston. The lack of a sufficiently natural algebraic framework delayed progress on fundamental problems until new techniques were introduced by L. Bartholdi and V. Nekrashevych in 2006. These selfsimilar group techniques are now standard. The recent developments in this new field are paralleling those in the theory of mapping class groups. The natural objects?branched self-covers of the sphere whose forward orbits of branch points form a finite set?may be fruitfully regarded as representing branched mapping classes in a countable semigroup. That this semigroup is in addition a biset over the pure mapping class group makes the combinatorial structure immensely rich. Just as with mapping class groups, on the semigroup side, there are similarly very deep connections to Teichmueller theory, dynamics, geometry, and algorithmic questions. The fuller exploration of these connections is the focus of this project. Basic dynamical finiteness results, and the development of an appropriate notion of relative hyperbolicity, are currently lacking. Intriguingly, the notions of relative hyperbolicity seem to lead naturally to connections with both coarse geometry and arithmetic dynamics on Berkovich spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematically, many such wave propagation phenomena can be described in terms of nonlinear dispersive equations. While waves typically spread out and decay, a striking feature of these nonlinear evolution equations is that they may admit particle-like solutions, often called solitons, whose shapes persist as time goes by. The mathematical understanding of their dynamics is still far from complete. The main research goal of this project is to investigate, in the context of classical topological field theories that arise in mathematical physics, how nonlinear waves can form particle-like structures and how these structures interact with each other. The educational component of the project seeks to enhance the training of graduate students and postdocs by organizing minicourses and workshops related to the research of the project and by providing professional development opportunities with an emphasis on presentation skills.<br/><br/>This project focuses on soliton dynamics for several well-known classical topological field theories in mathematical physics. Three prime examples of topological solitons are at the center of the investigation: kinks, vortices, and skyrmions in one, two, and three space dimensions, respectively. Heuristically, these solitons owe their stability to their topological underpinnings. However, the mathematical justification of this intuition is still rather poorly understood and mostly open. The overarching goal of the project is to establish asymptotic stability results for these classical topological solitons, and thus to rigorously justify the heuristics for their stability. Over the course of the project the investigator also plans to move towards studying multi-soliton configurations in these and related settings. Beyond the intrinsic interest in the fundamental problems at the center of this project, their resolution will have significant impact on the analysis of strong nonlinear interactions between solitons and radiation in the context of many other nonlinear dispersive equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is an active and growing area of mathematical research that is vital in its own right, and has profound interactions with many other fields.  Dynamical systems can model a variety of phenomena, from the motion of the human heart to the spread of disease within a population.  Since systems often demonstrate chaotic behavior, it is natural to study them through the lens of their underlying geometric structure and dynamical invariants.  By studying flexibility and rigidity phenomena in dynamics, the PI will investigate various relationships between these invariants and structural properties, thereby revealing new features of smooth dynamical systems and the geometry of manifolds.  Thus, structural aspects of dynamical systems will be clarified with the goal of making the tools of dynamics more readily applicable in other areas of mathematics, as well as other scientific fields.  As part of the proposed project, the PI aims to involve undergraduate and graduate students in exploring the behavior of some low-dimensional systems with computer experiments in the context of flexibility and rigidity.<br/><br/>The main goals of the project split into two distinct directions. First, the PI will develop techniques to construct uniformly hyperbolic systems, such as geodesic flows on negatively curved manifolds and Anosov volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, in a fixed class with a particular collection of invariants such as entropies and Lyapunov exponents. Concurrently, the PI will determine the natural restrictions on those invariants in a fixed class and search for relations that imply new instances of dynamical and/or geometric rigidity. The second main goal is to produce natural measures that encode dynamical behavior and have good statistical properties in new cases with a focus on non-conformal repellers and geodesic flows on CAT(0) spaces.

Some of the proposed research questions arose in the context of earlier work of the principal investigators, where Fourier analytic approaches were used to study inequalities involving volumes and mixed volumes. These approaches have proved indispensable in the solution of longstanding problems in convex geometry and geometric tomography. Many natural questions in convex geometry involve relationships between volumes of pairs of convex sets; among these is an open question posed by K. Mahler in 1939.  Another source of inspiration is the so-called `Scottish Book?, an informal collection of about 200 problems in mathematics which originated in the 1930s. Stanislav Ulam?s 19th Problem, taken from the Scottish Book, asks for a characterization of the convex sets of a fixed density (less than one) which float in an equilibrium position in every orientation (in water, of density one). Surprisingly, round balls are not the only such sets, due to a recent result of one of the principal investigators of this project. Part of the current project involves a further study of Ulam?s 19th Problem in relation to the properties of sections and projections of convex bodies.

By using a minimizing movement scheme, one studies its connection to the generalized Brakke flow. A related problem for such coupled equations in geometry is to understand the blow-up mechanism of the harmonic Ricci flow.

Wave motion through water, sound waves in air, seismic waves through the earth?s crust, radiation traveling in the vacuum of outer space (satellite communications), pollutants diffusing through groundwater, heat spreading through a machine part, and quantum waves or particles moving at subatomic scales ? all these and more are analyzed by equations involving the same mathematical object, a ""second order rate of change"" operator called (in honor of the 18th century scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace) simply the Laplacian. The ""eigenvalues"" of the Laplacian represent frequencies of wave motion or radiation, rates of spreading for pollutant, speed of heat transfer, and energy levels of particles. This research project promotes the progress of science by discovering new mathematical properties of eigenvalues of the Laplacian for waves, diffusions and particles living in spaces that are not flat like our usual three-dimensional space but are instead curved positively like a sphere or else negatively like a saddle. Problems include the identification of shapes supporting the fastest vibrations, an explanation of why a mysterious ""zeta function"" of eigenvalues depends increasingly on the curvature, understanding how scaling invariance persists in curved spaces through an eigenvalue monotonicity relation, and finding the largest eigenvalues among deformed-sphere surfaces. The project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The project advances mathematical knowledge at the intersection of analysis, partial differential equations and geometric analysis. Conjectures are addressed for extremal frequencies, energies and diffusions, offering theoretical insights and practical applicability. Conceptual and technical challenges are overcome by synthesizing modern analytic techniques into a suite of tools including variational principles, metric perturbation and monotonicity, conformal mapping, probabilistic coupling, and elliptic partial differential equations (PDE) symmetrization, applied on regions of positive, zero or negative curvature. Free membrane frequencies on the sphere are maximized by differing techniques depending on the presence or absence of holes. Curvature-driven monotonicity of the spectral zeta function is to be derived from new properties of the heat kernel on the spatial diagonal in hyperbolic space and the sphere. On higher dimensional projective space, the third eigenvalue is conjecturally maximized by constructing appropriate trial functions, while for the fourth-order biharmonic landscape function, extremality is investigated by a new kind of two-ball optimization under elliptic symmetrization. The unifying emphasis on maximization of eigenvalues is designed to yield both computable bounds and qualitative insights into the behavior of waves, diffusions and particles in curved geometric spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though ubiquitous, wave-type equations are far from well-understood. The goal of this project is to understand how waves are affected by interference with themselves or with their environment. The research seeks to learn when and why some waves disperse, other waves persist, and still others collapse. Knowing how waves behave drives technological progress - smaller microchips, faster data transmission, and deeper insights into the fundamental physics of the universe. The project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The investigator studies the long-time dynamics of solutions to nonlinear wave and dispersive equations, focusing on equations that admit topological solitons, which are used to model the physical phenomena described above. Solitons are localized solitary waves with a nontrivial topological invariant. They were introduced by Skyrme in the 1960s as candidates for particles in classical field theories. They have properties required from a particle in classical mechanics - one can define their position, momentum, and energy - and viewed from a distance, configurations of multiple solitons resemble systems of interacting particles. The investigator's work on multi-soliton dynamics makes this connection with classical mechanics explicit, reducing the dynamics of strongly interacting solitons to underlying n-body problems for their positions, momenta, scales, etc. A guiding principle in the analysis of soliton dynamics is the Soliton Resolution Conjecture, which predicts that generic solutions decompose near the final time of existence into a superposition of finitely many solitons and a term capturing the radiation, often a solution to the underlying linear equation. The investigator will work towards proving the conjecture in certain settings and going beyond it in others by considering three categories of problems: (1) the soliton resolution conjecture for evolution equations without symmetry assumptions, starting with the harmonic map heat flow in two dimensions, which is a long-standing open problem; (2) the unique continuation problem for singular nonlinear waves past the blow-up time;  and (3) the question of giving asymptotic descriptions of multi-soliton solutions and their collisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is particularly interested in such rigorous derivations in the case where the many particles are interacting with singular forces, such as the Coulomb force, which is the fundamental electric force of nature. Understanding the statistical behavior of such systems, as well as their dynamical laws, is directly related to fundamental questions in several areas of physics and applied science: the Coulomb gas in statistical physics, models of plasmas in astrophysics and plasma physics, quantum mechanics models, analysis of random matrices (itself initially motivated by the analysis of the spectrum of large atoms), phase transitions in condensed matter physics (superconductors and superfluids), but also collective behavior in biology, social sciences, and neural networks. Recent progress has been made bringing forward new tools from analysis and probability to analyze such questions, with or without randomness, but much remains to be done. The project focuses in particular on two directions. The first is obtaining convergence results for dynamics that are valid for all time and with an explicit error rate, thus useful in practice. The second is in understanding the famous Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in the so-called ""two component plasma"". This is a two-dimensional gas made of positively and negatively charged particles with electrostatic interaction. Positive particles and negative particles attract and, depending on the temperature, they pair into collapsed dipoles (at low temperature) or behave as free charges (at high temperature). What was an initial surprise is that, according to the Nobel-prize winning prediction of Berezinsky, Kosterlitz, and Thouless, a third, intermediate and new state of matter exists, with quite unusual behavior that is explained by the formation of vortices. Much remains to be rigorously analyzed about this phase transition, and the project hopes to advance this theoretical understanding. The broader impacts of the project stem from its mentoring and training component, expository work, communication and outreach to broader audiences, as well as involvement with the community in various roles. <br/> <br/>The effective or mean-field behavior of systems with singular interactions, in particular Coulombic ones, has been understood for several situations of dynamics and statistical mechanics. In the case of equilibrium statistical mechanics, this consists in examining the behavior of the particle density under the canonical Gibbs measure, and this has been understood via large deviations techniques and potential theory. In the purely repulsive Coulomb case, much more has been understood, including the fluctuations around the mean-field limit and the microscopic behavior of the points. The project further extends this understanding by proving the connection to the Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos in the 2D Coulomb case, and by analyzing non-Coulomb Riesz repulsive interactions, which present further challenges. Much less has been understood about the case of a neutral plasma of oppositely charged particles (which then attract), which makes sense as a two-dimensional system. In particular, the project will turn to understanding the fine behavior of such a two-component Coulomb gas, in which a very particular phase transition, the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, is predicted to happen. Bringing in an electrostatic and large deviations-based approach to this topic will provide a new approach to such problems, alternate to the renormalization methods of quantum field theory, and allow to understand the model below and above the critical temperature, with characterizations of the formation of dipoles and multipoles which explain the phase transition, and analysis of the fluctuations. The last main part of the project turns to gradient flow, conservative dynamics and Newtonian dynamics of systems with Coulomb or Riesz repulsive or attractive interactions. Thanks in particular to the recent modulated energy and modulated free energy methods, the mean-field limit can be derived, but much less has been understood beyond this than in the statistical mechanics setting. The project will allow us to understand whether and when global-in-time convergence holds, questions of instability in the case with attraction, and fluctuations and large deviations away from the mean-field behavior, thus providing much more precise information on such dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For systems that evolve with time, one aims to determine which perturbations will preserve the system?s long-term behavior and which perturbations will lead to radically different outcomes. This project concerns stability and bifurcations in the setting of complex algebraic dynamical systems. Such systems are defined by polynomial formulas in one or several variables. The algebraic nature of the defining equations connect the dynamical study with the rich theory of algebraic geometry. Moreover, in the case of examples where all of the defining polynomials have, for example, integer coefficients, the relevant dynamical stability questions have surprising connections to number theory and to the Diophantine geometry of the underlying equations. The project will extend the theory of dynamical stability for complex analytic examples to new settings that arise naturally in arithmetic geometry and complex dynamics. The project also provides research and training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>This project develops the theory of stability for analytic families of maps on projective spaces, in both a complex analytic setting and in the setting of non-archimedean-valued fields and p-adic analysis. It was recently discovered, in earlier work of the PI and of other researchers, that certain questions about height functions and arithmetic intersection theory can be analyzed using complex dynamics. In a series of recent breakthroughs in arithmetic geometry, especially concerning uniform bounds for numbers of rational points on families of algebraic varieties, stability theory played a crucial--if somewhat hidden--role. This project aims to shed new light on the role of stability theory and to push the theory further. Many of the proposed problems and applications of the theory are related to the occurrence of `unlikely intersections? in families of abelian varieties or in more general families of polarized dynamical systems. Specific goals of this project include (1) to characterize positivity properties of certain bifurcation currents and measures; (2) to provide bounds on the geometry of invariant subvarieties for algebraic dynamical systems; and (3) to formulate a theory of bifurcations in the setting of p-adic analytic families of maps.

The overreaching goal of the project is to understand how the frequency function controls various local characteristics of the solution and its gradient. The work on quantitative properties of solutions of elliptic equations has numerous applications in other areas of mathematics, including spectral geometry, geometric measure theory, control theory, and mathematical physics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. The principal investigator (PI) is active in disseminating the new ideas and results obtained as part of this project through series of lectures and minicourses on the frequency function method. As an educational initiative within this project, the PI will prepare an expository article based on these series of lectures. <br/><br/>The frequency function was introduced by Almgren and was applied to quantitative unique continuation for solutions of elliptic equations by Garofalo and Lin.

These results and the geometric combinatorial method on which they are based open up new possibilities in the study of analytic, geometric, and topological properties of solutions to second order elliptic PDE. One of the goals of the project concerns the study of solutions to elliptic equations with bounded frequency and their applications to Laplace eigenfunctions, which includes restriction estimates and localization properties of eigenfunctions. Another goal is to introduce a new framework to study random harmonic functions of bounded frequency and investigate the typical behavior of such functions.

However, objects in the real world are usually not smooth. One of the insights of modern mathematics is that many non-smooth objects can be studied and understood just as thoroughly as their smooth counterparts. Even more, such study tends to clarify and simplify previously known classical theory. Research in geometry, in both the smooth and non-smooth settings, typically involves curvature?a measure of the ?bending? of a space?as a fundamental notion. The aim of this project is to understand the structure of geometric spaces in maximum generality, without relying on curvature and other standard assumptions. Such an undertaking has intrinsic interest and is also motivated by neighboring subjects such as complex dynamics and geometric group theory where these spaces naturally arise. Non-smooth geometry also arises in a variety of applied fields, including theoretical computer science and data science.  This project also incorporates a range of questions that will provide opportunities for undergraduate research.<br/><br/>This project is rooted in the classical uniformization theorem developed by Klein, Poincaré and Koebe, among others, which states that any smooth surface can be mapped conformally onto a surface of constant curvature. This theorem gives a simple yet comprehensive picture of the geometry of surfaces and is the culmination of a large portion of 19th century mathematics. The project has two main goals: first is to develop versions of the uniformization theorem for potentially non-smooth metric spaces: to determine when one space can be mapped to another under a map with good geometric properties, such as a quasiconformal, quasisymmetric or bi-Lipschitz map. This continues earlier work of the principal investigator using a novel polyhedral approximation scheme as the main method. This approximation scheme has further potential applications which will be explored. The second goal is to investigate a variety of additional problems related to the different geometric classes of maps. These include the factorization of bi-Lipschitz maps and extensions of Lipschitz and quasisymmetric maps.

Such objects appear in nature as coastlines, mountainous landscapes, river networks, lightning bolts, snowflakes, growth models of plants and crystals, and soap films. The questions the PI plans to study have applications whenever storage of three-dimensional information (landscapes, faces, human brain surface) in a two-dimensional image is desired without loss of information. While in the case of smooth objects (the opposite of fractals) the corresponding mathematical theory is well understood, this is not the case for fractal objects, which require the development of new techniques. Another focus of this project is on rigidity problems, asking whether it is possible to deform a fractal object that is made out of a flexible material into another fractal object, with controlled distortion. Also, fractal sets appear sometimes as boundaries of otherwise smooth objects; another rigidity problem concerns whether these fractals are removable, in the sense that their presence can be ignored for transformation purposes. Rigidity problems on fractal sets have applications in mathematical problems that require ""gluing"" together two functions, or two dynamical systems, or two surfaces, and could result in the better understanding of dynamical systems in physics. This project will also incorporate the training and professional development of graduate students. <br/><br/>The main focus of the project is on two interrelated types of problems on fractals: uniformization and rigidity problems. The uniformization problem asks for geometric conditions on a fractal metric space so that it can be transformed to a smooth space with a well-behaved transformation that preserves the geometry, such as quasiconformal or quasisymmetric maps. Major progress has been made recently towards the quasiconformal uniformization problem with the involvement of the PI. The current project expects to develop an analytic theory for two-dimensional surfaces of locally finite area under no other assumption; the classical approaches in the field of analysis on metric spaces require instead several additional and restrictive geometric assumptions. Specifically, the PI will study the quasiconformal classification of non-smooth surfaces, the embedding of fractal surfaces in Euclidean space, the uniformization of 2-dimensional spheres of infinite area, and potential theory on fractal surfaces. Regarding rigidity problems, the PI will work on the problem of conformal removability, which asks whether a given compact subset of Euclidean space is negligible from the domain of a conformal map. The PI in recent works has displayed several new examples of removable and non-removable planar sets and has found a striking connection between the problems of uniformization and removability. Moreover, the PI has identified a new general class of sets that he conjectures to provide a characterization of removable sets. The PI will study this conjecture, as well as several related removability and rigidity problems in complex dynamics, geometric group theory, and circle domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physical properties of particles are interpreted as infinite matrices which evolve in time and can be organized as algebraic structures of linear operators acting on Hilbert spaces. Just like geometric spaces, operator algebras may feature important symmetries corresponding to intrinsic properties that are preserved under groups of transformations. The principal investigator will study discrete finite-dimensional approximations that capture topological properties of these infinite-dimensional structures and their stability properties. In a different direction the principal investigator will study topological invariants arising in the bundle theory of operator algebras.   An educational component of the project is devoted to the training of students in an area of operator algebras that has direct connections to group stability and testability problems in computer science and the theory of topological insulators from solid state physics.  <br/><br/>Three projects concerned with analytical and topological aspects of operator algebras will be investigated.  The purpose of the first project is to study the stability of discrete groups with respect to the operator norm and topological obstructions to group stability in various contexts. The second project is devoted to finite-dimensional approximation properties of non-amenable discrete groups, with a focus on quasidiagonality as a tool in the construction of almost flat vector bundles and group quasi-representations that carry topological information.  The third project is concerned with invariants of continuous fields of C*-algebras and their applications to C*-dynamical systems and higher twisted K-theory.

Roughly speaking, microlocal analysis keeps track of the position and frequency, or momentum, of waves (or more generally, functions, such as the amplitudes and phases of waves) simultaneously. The planned applications are to wave propagation and other related phenomena, as well as inverse problems related to determining the structure of a material from surface measurements as well as to imaging by cosmic background radiation. Although the project concerns their mathematical theory, these problems are closely connected to the physical world. Wave propagation is ubiquitous in nature, with light and gravitational waves being important examples. Scattering theory of quantum particles is another subject governed by microlocal analysis: these aspects enter into the description of quantum waves at large distances. The inverse problems under study are also of broad significance: applications of the theory developed here include the determination of an unknown variable speed of elastic waves in an object via the measurement of travel times of waves, as well as the development of the universe through cosmic microwave background data. Many of the projects are suitable for research by doctoral students, and the PI strives to contribute to the education of a new generation of mathematicians and scientists.<br/><br/>Parts of the project describe the long-time or far field behavior, including existence, of waves, such as electromagnetic or gravitational waves, on curved space-times. The microlocal approach to analysis on these spaces has made breakthroughs possible in the PI's (in part collaborative) work on linear and nonlinear problems on asymptotically hyperbolic spaces as well as Kerr-de Sitter (KdS) space (rotating black holes in a cosmological spacetime), culminating in the proof of the stability of slowly rotating KdS spaces with Hintz. More recently, with Hafner and Hintz the PI extended some of these tools to the vanishing cosmological constant case (Minkowski, Kerr). The aim here is to extend these tools to further spaces, such as fast rotating KdS and perturbations of Kerr spacetimes. Other parts of the project study basic objects in quantum field theory, in particular the Feynman propagator. A novel direction, with Tripathy and Zimet, is construction of Ricci flat metrics on K3-type surfaces. Another main area is inverse problems, where the PI, together with Uhlmann, has introduced new tools for the spatially localized inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform, and with Stefanov and Uhlmann extended this to the boundary rigidity problem. A project with the PI's former postdoc Wang studies the light ray transform with potential applications to imaging by the cosmic background radiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such sets arise naturally in mathematics, and have applications to a diverse array of problems in science and engineering.  Harmonic analysis emerged in the late 20th century as a tool for the study of the geometry of fractal sets, and in return fractal geometry has motivated many interesting questions in harmonic analysis. This event brings together researchers to find new synergies between existing methods and to formulate new approaches to build on recent progress at the intersection of these fields.<br/><br/>The focus of the conference is on geometric properties of fractal sets using tools from harmonic analysis. A classical problem in this area is the Falconer distance problem, which asks how large the Hausdorff dimension of a compact set must be to ensure that it determines a positive Lebesgue measure set of pairwise distances.  More generally, one may inquire when high dimensional sets determine more complicated patterns, leading to a host of fascinating questions about finite point configurations.  These problems can be studied via bounds for convolution operators, bringing to bear tools from harmonic analysis. Another classical example is the Kakeya problem, which asks when sets containing a line segment in every direction must have full Hausdorff dimension. The Kakeya problem, in turn, is closely tied to Fourier restriction theory.

This versatile framework includes a vast array of models in the natural sciences, for example, the dynamics of populations of animals and plants in an ecological system, and the shape and form of a turbulent wake behind a passing ship. The work in this proposal concerns chaotic behavior of dynamical systems, signified, for instance, by sensitive dependence on initial conditions ? a phenomenon also known as ?the butterfly effect,? in which tiny changes to the initial preparation of an experiment lead to drastically different outcomes as time progresses.  Chaos is nearly ubiquitous in systems of practical interest.  An example from everyday life is weather prediction: sensitive dependence explains, for instance, why the predicted path of a hurricane widens as one forecasts further into the future, as small imprecisions in our measurements of the present weather system are ?amplified? as time progresses. This CAREER grant will integrate the PI?s research work into educational programs, including directed reading programs and research opportunities for undergraduate students; the introduction of new undergraduate and graduate courses on the treatment of chaotic dynamical systems using tools from probability theory; and a summer school for graduate students in mathematics helping to bring them to the research front of this compelling and rapidly evolving field.  <br/><br/>Chaos is a nearly ubiquitous feature of dynamical systems of practical interest, from low-dimensional toy models to high-dimensional systems, including a wide variety of infinite-dimensional dynamics proscribed by evolutionary PDE such as the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations governing the motion of a viscous fluid.  The tools of smooth ergodic theory provide an abstract framework for understanding chaotic behavior in dynamical systems through the study of their statistical properties, such as the decay of correlations.  However, it remains a major challenge to apply this collection of abstract tools to many systems of practical interest.  For instance, despite considerable supporting numerical evidence, it remains an open problem to prove that the Chirikov standard map has a positive Lyapunov exponent on a positive-volume subset of phase space.  Recent work of the PI and others has uncovered that a small amount of nondegenerate noise is ?amplified? by the presence of stretching in phase space, rendering tractable the problem of determining whether the dynamics is chaotic.  This principle has been applied by the PI to a variety of dynamical systems relevant to practical applications, such as fluid dynamics.  For instance, it was shown by the PI and collaborators that passive tracer (Lagrangian) flow in an incompressible fluid ? such as the motion traced out by a mote of dust suspended in a fluid ? is chaotic in the above sense. This led to a mathematical proof of Batchelor?s law, a quantitative prediction of the formation of small-scale structures in the concentration profile of a solute, such as the billowing patterns formed by drops of milk poured into a cup of coffee.  This project seeks to build off these successes by applying smooth ergodic theory to more complicated dynamical systems, e.g., the evolution of an incompressible velocity field by the Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of noise (the so-called Eulerian dynamics of a fluid). A long-term goal along these lines is a detailed, mathematically rigorous investigation into the transition from laminar and ordered behavior to chaotic and unpredictable dynamics seen in many fluid systems as Reynolds? number is increased.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is concerned with understanding how the solutions to such equations behave. The Laplace equation is the prototypical elliptic PDE, and it is used to model steady-state homogeneous systems. This equation is studied in the fields of PDE, complex analysis, harmonic analysis, geometry, and engineering; and therefore, the behavior of its solutions (known as harmonic functions) is very well-understood. However, many questions remain regarding the behavior of solutions to more complicated equations like those that model quantum behavior, systems with microscopic structure, and systems that are changing in time. The investigator?s knowledge of harmonic functions will be used to answer these questions, thereby advancing knowledge in the areas of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. Motivated by the goal of increasing participation from underrepresented groups, as well as addressing common issues with retention in academia, this project integrates an inclusive workshop in PDE and harmonic analysis. The target workshop audience will include junior mathematicians who are at difficult transitional stages in their careers, especially those from historically underrepresented groups. Speakers will be chosen to reflect the demographics of the student participants and the potential for greater diversity in our discipline.<br/><br/>The Laplace equation is a PDE that models steady-state phenomena in a truly uniform environment. Since the world that we live in is not an isotropic vacuum, the mathematical equations that govern many natural phenomena are often more complicated than Laplace?s equation. For example, the Schrodinger equation describes the behavior of quantum-mechanical waves, while its generalizations describe even more complex settings. As such, there is a need to understand the properties of solutions to general elliptic PDEs. One component of this research project revolves around using known properties of harmonic functions to gain a better understanding of solutions to elliptic equations. Specifically, the investigator will explore how the presence of variable coefficients and lower-order terms affects the behavior of solutions to elliptic equations. This line of inquiry will be addressed through the perspectives of unique continuation and homogenization theory. Given that parabolic equations like the heat equation model the evolution of systems that are changing in time, it is also important to understand how the solutions to such PDE behave. Therefore, in another direction, the investigator will use elliptic theory to tackle problems related to parabolic PDE. More specifically, the investigator will construct a framework for using elliptic theory in high-dimensional settings to understand the properties of solutions to parabolic equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
