Depending on the setting, it can lead to a significant speed up of combustion or to the quenching of the flame.  The main goal of this project is to improve fundamental understanding of this important phenomenon.  In particular, this work explores analytically how the geometry, scaling, and intensity of the velocity field determine the effect advection has on combustion.  A primary goal is to determine the optimal geometry for the fastest extinction of the flame, or for the most effective speed up.  The models to be studied include passive reaction-diffusion equations with physically-motivated reaction terms, systems of reaction-diffusion equations, and active scalar models with feedback of temperature and concentration on fluid velocity.  The methods of analysis include maximum-principle-based techniques, estimates on solutions of partial differential equations, and functional inequalities, as well as some methods of harmonic and spectral analysis. <br/><br/>The influence of strong fluid advection on combustion plays a crucial role in many important combustion processes in technology and in nature.  Strong fluid advection may drastically enhance the rate of burning, leading to higher efficiency, or, in some situations, extinguish the flame. This question has been extensively studied by engineers, physicists, and mathematicians alike. However, until very recent work of several research groups, there were few rigorous results on the topic. Building on the technique developed in earlier works, the project seeks to deepen the understanding of this phenomenon, in particular relating the geometric characteristics of the fluid flow with the effect it has on combustion. The potential impact of the project is an improved knowledge of combustion processes in settings as diverse as internal combustion  engines and stars. The research may lead to direct suggestions on the most efficient ways of flame suppression or enhancement.  In addition, the techniques developed for tackling this problem may prove useful in analyzing other partial differential equations.  <br/><br/>"

In previous work by the PIs a technique<br/>for estimating Calderon-Zygmund operators on spaces with<br/>non-doubling measures was developed, and a novel <br/>method of Bellman functions was introduced for problems<br/>in Harmonic Analysis. These techniques will be applied to <br/>solve several open problems in harmonic analysis and <br/>operator theory and to investigate new directions,<br/>which previously were deemed untractable because of the <br/>lack of technical tools. Special attention will be paid <br/>to uncovering new relations between Operator Theory, <br/>Harmonic Analysis and Stochastic Control.  Among<br/>the main directions of the proposed research are:<br/>- Spectral theory for perturbations of normal operators <br/>and related problems in Harmonic Analysis: two weight <br/>estimates for Hilbert Transform and embedding theorems for <br/>the co-invariant subspaces.<br/>- Non-homogeneous T(b) theorems and their applications to <br/>generalizations of analytic capacity (electric intensity <br/>capacity); the role of curvature in higher dimensions.<br/>- Bellman function method in stochastic optimal control<br/>and in harmonic analysis; functions with matrix arguments<br/>and their applications to non-commutative problems.<br/><br/>Harmonic analysis investigates complex processes by <br/>representing them as a sum of elementary ones (sinusoidal <br/>waves, wavelets) with well understood behavior.  A central<br/>part of modern harmonic analysis deals with ""singular<br/>operators"" of one type or another.  Such operators are <br/>pervasive in the scientific landscape: they turn up in <br/>mathematical physics, probability, engineering, image <br/>processing, etc.  A new way to treat multivariate signals<br/>will be discussed. The main difficulty here is that the <br/>mathematical objects arising in such problems are <br/>non-commutative: the product depends on the order of terms,<br/>and that complicates things immensely. A new method based<br/>on Bellman functions, which originating in the stochastic <br/>optimal control, will be exploited in harmonic analysis. <br/>One important direction of research is the spectral theory <br/>for the perturbation of normal operators: results in this <br/>direction would have important consequences in mathematical <br/>physics.  Another direction deals with non-commutative <br/>harmonic analysis, i.e. with treating multivariate<br/>signals.   <br/>"

The investigator is especially interested in generalizing the classical results of elliptic theory for compact manifolds, including index theory. Little can be said about all non-compact manifolds in general, but results of Bismut, Beunning, Cordes, Mazzeo, Melrose, Meuller, Shubin, and others have singled<br/>out a class of manifolds that is more amenable to study: the class of manifolds with a uniform structure at infinity. The local theory (regularity, local existence) for these manifolds is the same as for compact manifolds, so our methods will necessarily be global. Thus, in addition to the methods of Partial differential equations and Differential geometry used by the above mentioned authors, methods from Operator algebras have come to play an increasingly important role in the study of non-compact manifolds with<br/>a uniform structure at infinity, as is seen from the work of Connes, V.F.R.

The results of the proposed research will have, in the long run, applications to all these domains. The main methods that are proposed belong to Analysis, especially Partial differential equations, Operator algebras, Spectral theory, and K-theory. A main technical tool will be provided by algebras generated by differential<br/>operators on non-compact manifolds with a uniform structure at infinity. By using Sobolev spaces, one can reduce many of our basic questions to questions about algebras of bounded operators. A novel feature of this proposal is the study of boundary value problems for manifolds with a uniform structure at infinity that have Lipschitz boundaries, as in the work of Mitrea and Taylor on such compact domains.<br/>"

Noncommutative geometry is a field of mathematics situated on the crossroads between analysis, geometry, and mathematical physics.

The definition<br/>of the norm of these vector fields depends on which<br/>application the fields are used for. One norm comes from<br/>looking at vector fields as tangent vectors to the<br/>Teichmuller space of the given closed set.  This norm,<br/>called the Teichmuller norm, is suitable for applications<br/>in holomorphic motions and complex dynamics.  It turns the<br/>space of vector fields into a space of all initial<br/>velocities of holomorphic motions of the closed set. Since<br/>the holomorphic motions of the fixed closed set are defined<br/>by an intrinsic condition on the closed set, it is natural<br/>that there is a criterion that guarantees that the vector<br/>field has bounded norm, and which is expressed purely in<br/>terms of the values of the vector field on the closed set.<br/>Such a criterion was found recently by considering the<br/>velocity of the cross ratio for every possible quadruple<br/>in the given closed set.  The velocity is measured with<br/>respect to the Poincare density of the Riemann sphere<br/>punctured at three points. This leads to an alternative<br/>norm on vector fields, called the cross ratio norm. The<br/>cross ratio norm is equivalent to the Teichmuller norm,<br/>and the equivalence constant is universal and independent<br/>of the closed set or vector field.  Hence, a vector field<br/>is a derivative of some holomorphic motion if, and only if,<br/>it has bounded cross ratio norm.  This equivalence led to<br/>the introduction of a new canonical density on any Riemann<br/>surface. The new density is equivalent to Poincare density,<br/>and this equivalence has several important applications of<br/>the vector field theory to hyperbolic and conformal geometry.<br/>It provides a link between, on the one hand, hyperbolic<br/>geometry, Riemann surfaces, and geometric function theory,<br/>and on the other hand, Teichmuller theory, quadratic<br/>differentials and h olomorphic motions with their<br/>applications to complex dynamics.  <br/><br/>For many years the analytical and geometrical techniques<br/>developed in dynamical systems and Teichmuller theory have<br/>been applied to a number of important nonlinear problems<br/>with broad impact on ecology, economics, and genetics.

The principal investigator is interested in the nature of <br/>the quantum Hall edge-currents, and the nature of the <br/>electron states for regions with two-edges, such as a strip. One of the tools for studying these systems is the density of states that provides a measure of the number of electronic<br/>states per unit volume.

As regards (b), I would like to investigate whether very weak overdetermined boundary conditions for solutions to certain <br/>p-Laplacian type equations in a domain D imply that the boundary of D satisfies a  regularity condition similar to uniform rectifiability.  Finally under (c) I would like to know if an extrapolation technique, used by the author and co-authors on some parabolic measure and Kato problems, could be applied to other Kato type problems. <br/> <br/>Many physical problems can be described in the language of partial differential equations (PDE's). Well known examples of such equations arising in the 19 th century are Laplace's equation, the heat equation, the wave equation, Maxwell's equations, and the Navier- Stokes' equation. Without question knowledge derived from a theoretical study of these equations led to many fundamental technological advances during the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Three questions often asked by those who study PDE's are (a) does there exist a solution, (b) is it unique and (c) does it possess nice properties or is it regular?  As concerns  (a) and (b) one is often concerned with so called boundary values or boundary conditions for a solution in its domain of existence. So called overdetermined boundary value problems have no solution whereas such classical problems as the Dirichlet and Neumann problems have solutions if the boundary of the given domain and the boundary conditions are sufficiently nice (smooth). My work is concerned with how much one can relax these assumptions and still get meaningful theorems. For example, my co-authors and I have obtained nearly optimal results, which show that certain boundary value problems for Laplace's equation can only be solved if the given domain is a ball. As another example of my work, classical theorems for the Laplacian in smooth domains have been shown to hold in a class of rough domains called Lipschitz or sawtooth domains.  More recent work has generalized these results to nongraph domains satisfying `uniform rectifiability' assumptions.  My co-authors and I have obtained the analogue of Lipschitz and uniformly rectifiable domains for the heat equation. Our work provides a model for certain free boundary problems such as ice melting (the Stefan problem). <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

One application of this work is to well-posedness<br/>for quasi-linear hyperbolic equations with initial data of low Sobolev<br/>regularity. In joint work the investigator has established a best possible<br/>result for general quasi-linear equations with quadratic growth in the<br/>inhomogeneity; proposed work investigates relaxing the regularity assumption<br/>in special cases such as the Einstein vacuum equation, where a null condition<br/>indicates that better results should hold. Wave packet techniques are<br/>also being used to establish norm estimates for eigenfunctions on<br/>Riemannian manifolds with metrics of limited differentiability.<br/>The proposed research includes establishing best possible bounds<br/>for compact manifolds with Lp pinched curvature. The investigator<br/>is also adapting the above methods to establish norm estimates<br/>on solutions to mixed-type wave equations with Dirichlet conditions on a<br/>convex obstacle. This is carried out by reflecting the metric across the<br/>boundary to obtain a Lipschitz metric on an open set. The geometry of<br/>the resulting geodesic flow suggests that wave packet techniques can be<br/>used to establish the same norm estimates on solutions as hold in the<br/>non-obstacle case.<br/><br/>The proposed research involves the study of waves traveling in rough media;<br/>a rough medium being one where the physics which governs the speed of waves<br/>changes abruptly from point to point. By studying the properties of a<br/>special family of localized solitary waves, the investigator is able to<br/>answer questions about the possible concentration of energy that can occur<br/>for general waves traveling in such media. This work has important<br/>applications in the study of nonlinear wave equations; that is, situations<br/>where the wave can be considered to interact with itself. One such example<br/>is the gravitational field equation arising from Einstein's general theory<br/>of relativity, where the geometry of space itself is the object of the<br/>equation. Rough solutions, and thus a rough media, necessarily arise when<br/>considering what kind of singularities the theory can lead to. The research<br/>also has implications for investigating the fundamental vibrational modes<br/>in rough media. It is known that refraction in such media can lead to high<br/>concentrations of energy that can be detected by examining these modes.<br/>Work is being done to relate the possible degree of concentration of energy<br/>to the roughness of the underlying media. The research finds applications<br/>as well in studying the reflection of waves off obstacles.

A traveling wave is given by the equilibrium of this flow that will be identified from the positive limit set corresponding to a bounded solution. This will be achieved by extensive investigation of the property of a positive limit set and analysis of the spectral property for the variational equation associated to a global solution contained in the positive limit set. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it will provide information on both the asymptotical behavior of a solution and the existence and stability of a traveling wave solution. The method will also have the potential of application to other problems, such as the existence of traveling wave solutions for spatially discrete systems and the existence of heteroclinic solution for the delay differential equation arising from singular perturbation problems. The techniques of spectral analysis developed in this research will also be a contribution to the spectral theory of operators in Banach space.<br/><br/>Traveling waves have been observed in many models in the fields of biology, ecology, chemistry, and physics. In particular, the existence of the existence of stable traveling waves provides the most important information on the asymptotical behavior of a dynamical system or identifies the target pattern that describes the most interesting phenomenon. The functional differential equations studied in this proposal include a large class of models found in the literature. These models address questions of interest to ecologists and epidemiologists that include competition, dynamics of disease transmission and persistence, and that how the time delay and diffusion<br/>jointly affect the existence of traveling waves. Results from the proposed research will increase our understanding of mechanisms responsible for observed patterns and the common feature of<br/>wave propagation in nature.

Conlon, University of Michigan<br/>DMS-0138519<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>                   <br/>   This project is concerned with elliptic and parabolic partial differential <br/>equations and their applications in statistical mechanics. The first part of the<br/>proposal is concerned with elliptic and parabolic equations in divergence form <br/>where the coefficients are random variables. The author intends to study the <br/>regularity properties of the expectation value of the Green's function, and the <br/>rate of convergence of the solution of the equation to the solution of the <br/>homogenized equation. The second part of the proposal is concerned with the <br/>application of ideas from the theory of divergence form parabolic equations with<br/>random coefficients to Euclidean field theory. The relationship between elliptic<br/>and parabolic equations with random coefficients and Euclidean field theory was<br/>discovered recently by Helffer and Sjostrand. It was then more fully developed <br/>by Naddaf-Spencer. The author intends to apply some ideas he and Naddaf have <br/>developed for random elliptic equations to the Euclidean field theory situation.<br/>In the third part of the proposal  the author proposes to study nondivergence <br/>form elliptic equations with random coefficients, in particular an<br/>equation corresponding to Brownian motion with a random drift. It has been<br/>shown by Sinai that in one dimension diffusion with random drift is strongly<br/>subdiffusive for large time. It has been conjectured that in dimension larger <br/>than 2 the scaling limit of diffusion with random drift is Brownian motion. The <br/>author has found a connection between this conjecture and certain combinatorial<br/>problems concerning the existence of cycles in graphs. He plans to continue his<br/>program to solve these combinatorial problems. The final part of the proposal is<br/>concerned with uniformly elliptic equations with deterministic coefficients.<br/>The coefficients can oscillate arbitrarily rapidly however. The author plans to<br/>continue his work to obtain estimates on the underlying diffusion which are<br/>independent of the degree of oscillation of the coefficients. This part of the<br/>proposal is related to the previous parts since random equations have<br/>coefficients which are rapidly oscillating.<br/>   The goal of the proposal is to understand properties of the solution to a<br/>partial differential equation when the only information one has is that the<br/>coefficients of the equation are bounded in some  way. Within this goal there<br/>are two sub-themes: (a) understanding worst possible behavior, (b)<br/>understanding ""on average"" behavior -given our knowledge of the coefficients.<br/>The sub-theme (a) is the subject of the final part of the proposal. It is<br/>intimately related to problems of stochastic control theory. Examples of<br/>stochastic control theory abound in the world of engineering and finance. To <br/>take a financial example, consider the problem of valuing a stock option. The<br/>classic work of Black and Scholes shows that the value of the option depends<br/>only on the stock volatility. For a stock with constant volatility they have a<br/>formula for the value of the option in terms of the volatility. The formula is<br/>the solution to a partial differential equation in which the volatility is a<br/>coefficient. (a) is therefore related to the problem of estimating worst<br/>possible scenarios for option values when one can only assume some bounds on <br/>stock volatility. The sub-theme (b) has similar applications to (a). The most<br/>exciting of these to this author is that it offers a way of beginning to<br/>understand the problem of turbulence in fluids. Turbulence is roughly speaking<br/>the onset of random behavior in the velocity of a fluid.  It is well known that <br/>a fluid will undergo turbulent behavior when subject to a sufficiently large<br/>disturbance. The mathematical problem of understanding turbulence is well<br/>defined. One simply needs to understand the solutions of a partial differential<br/>equation known as the Navier-Stokes equation. To date there is not even the<br/>beginnings of an understanding how to derive turbulence in a mathematically<br/>rigorous way out of the Navier-Stokes equation. The reason is that the fluid<br/>velocity is a coefficient of the equation. In the turbulent regime therefore<br/>the Navier-Stokes equation is like a partial differential equation with a<br/>random coefficient. The sub-theme (b) is then concerned with the ""typical""<br/>behavior of the fluid velocity in this situation. <br/>  <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

In this context, approximately twenty years ago, P.Baum and A.Connes conjectured a formula for the K-theory of the (reduced) C* algebra of any locally compact topological group. At the present time no counter-example is known to the conjecture and-due to the work of many mathematicians-the conjecture has been proved for several very interesting classes of groups (e.g. real Lie groups, p-adic algebraic groups, adelic algebraic groups, discrete hyperbolic groups, amenable groups). Also established is that the conjecture, when valid, has many corollaries (e.g. Mackey analogy, Atiyah-Schmid construction of the discrete series, Novikov higher signature conjecture, stable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture, Kadison-Kaplansky conjecture). This project aims to discover and develop further corollaries of the conjecture in representation theory and in geometry-topology.<br/><br/>Analysis is the branch of mathematics based on calculus. The fundamental ideas of calculus (differentiation and integration) were introduced by Newton and Leibniz and played a central role in the scientific revolution of their era. Topology is the most basic form of geometry and was founded by such eminent nineteenth and twentieth century mathematicians as Riemann, Poincare and Lefschetz. A major theme in modern mathematics has been the interplay between analysis and topology. For example, Maxwell's equations for electricity-magnetism are formulated via analysis, but many of the implications are topological. This project continues the interaction of topology and analysis by using and applying a new synthesis of analysis and topology known as ""non-commutative geometry"".<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>"

In operator algebras no geometrical structure of subfactors has been previously found.  The proponent has found the natural link between  subfactors, the subgroups of quantum SU(2) and the classical and quantum Lie groups, showing that the information for building a simple Lie group comes naturally from the fusion structure on representations of a quantum subgroup of SU(2). The bridge between these two areas of research is a new crystallographic property of homology theory, wherein for instance six term exact sequences correspond to regular hexagons.  These methods yield a natural elementary construction of a canonical basis of the quantum enveloping algebra of the  semisimple Lie groups.  The link  found between quantum subgroups and root lattices extends beyond SU(2) and the classical Lie groups. The proponent found new unimodular root systems  in weight lattices associated to general quantum subgroups, which are  not connected to any known structures. The proponent considers the development  of the higher analogs of simple Lie groups corresponding to the new root systems a priority.  These are likely to be essentially new mathematical objects with natural many-to-one laws, which have potential applications in  constructive QFT in a physical (3 or 4) number of dimensions, while the usual binary laws produce naturally 2-dimensional field theories.<br/>The project is centered around the construction, classification and study of the properties and manifestations of the quantum subgroups of Lie groups. The quantum deformations of the semisimple Lie groups have, when the quantization parameter is a root of unity, subgroups which are the analogs of the finite subgroups of the classical Lie groups. The proponent has introduced this structure over the years, starting with the classification of the algebraic structure of small index subfactors in the noncommutative Galois theory for operator algebras. Other manifestations of these structures appear in topological quantum field theory, where they provide boundary extensions of numerical invariants for 3-manifolds , conformal field theory, and modular invariants. The quantum subgroups of SU(2), SU(3) and SU(4) are now classified by the proponent, and show that the quantum world is very different and apparently nearly unrelated to the classical world, with a markedly simpler situation for the exceptional quantum subgroups than for the corresponding classical subgroups. The project introduces geometrical structures associated to quantum subgroups, with the quantum subgroups of SU(2) producing the roots weights and canonical bases for the simple Lie groups, while the other quantum subgroups give raise to essentially new generalized root systems in weight lattices.  It is hoped that the new structures produced by the project could play a role in constructing models of quantum field theory in a physical number of dimensions.<br/>"

Most of these problems are in the sub-field of non-linear<br/>PDE, and some in linear PDE. The non-linear problems<br/>arise naturally from Physics and<br/>Geometry and the interaction of Physics and Geometry. <br/>The linear problems are also tied in with<br/>Geometry and Physics. There<br/>is a strong focus in this proposal on various qualitative<br/>features of solutions to PDE, their level lines, nodal lines<br/>of eigenfunctions, smoothness of solutions and so on. <br/>We have selected the problems in part because we view many of them as having very natural connections with classical Harmonic analysis, and in fact we have made some start on solving them using techniques from classical Harmonic analysis. This is described in the body of the proposal. Some of the problems that arise from Physics in our proposal are connected with the phenomena of<br/>vortices. Here we continue work that was funded by previous grants.<br/>The vortices we study are those that arise from fluid flow on<br/>two-dimensional spheres and on the plane. Taking the continuum limit of the <br/>point vortex distribution leads us to a new technique for solving the prescribed <br/>Gauss curvature equation which also gives a tremendous insight into conformally invariant PDE's. Problems are also posed<br/>that stem from the Schrodinger equation and Geometry and its<br/>influence on the spectrum of elliptic operators.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We single out an important component of the proposed research<br/>proposal. In todays environment it has become important to<br/>study so-called smart materials, more principally composites.<br/>Because of their lightness they are preferred materials<br/>to use for their strength and lightness. In this proposal<br/>we study as one problem the vibrational characteristics<br/>of composites. In particular how should one build objects using<br/>composite materials so as to minimize their basic vibrational characteristics.<br/>Intuitively the larger the natural frequency with which<br/>an object vibrates, the more it is susceptible to stress<br/>and breakage. For example one question one can ask is, if we need to <br/>build a symmetric object like a washer does it<br/>mean the composite has to be arranged symmetrically respecting<br/>the symmetry of the washer? We find that in our research for example that<br/>this necessarily does not minimize the stresses that can be caused by vibration<br/>and we need to arrange the composite in a non-symmetric way<br/>to construct the washer.

Several very <br/>different aspects of the subject will be studied.  Part of the project deals with the special <br/>periodic solutions of the n-body problem arising from central configurations.  It is a <br/>long-standing open problem to determine how many central configurations are possible, or <br/>even if the number is finite.  Techniques from algebraic geometry and computational algebra <br/>will be used to attack this question.  A second part of the project involves the <br/>construction of isolating blocks in the phase space of the three-body problem.  It is known that <br/>it is possible to find simple, explicit isolating blocks at the collinear Lagrange points <br/>of the restricted three-body problem.  These blocks can be used to study the complicated <br/>invariant set nearby.  The project is to carry out such a construction near the <br/>collinear central configuration of the unrestricted three-body problem.  Here the <br/>dimension of the phase space is higher and the geometry is much more complicated.  A final part <br/>of the project is concerned with understanding the mechanism of Arnold diffusion for <br/>Hamiltonian systems. The approach taken here is based on the construction of an invariant <br/>Cantor set of annuli and subsequent analysis of the resulting dynamics.<br/><br/>The gravitational n-body problem remains an active topic for mathematics <br/>research three centuries after Newton proposed it.  Over the years it has been a <br/>stimulus for the development of new mathematics of wide applicability.  It is the classic <br/>example of a nonlinear mechanical system and its solutions include orderly cyclical <br/>motions, multi-body collisions, and irregular, chaotic behavior.  The simplest <br/>solutions are the rigidly rotating orbits arising from the central configurations.  <br/>Central configurations are special arrangements of the masses such that the gravitational <br/>forces can be exactly balanced by centrifugal forces when the configuration rotates.  Although <br/>these solutions are dynamically very simple, the problem of finding or even counting the <br/>central configurations turns out to be very difficult when there are four or more masses <br/>involved.  Part of this project is about how to deal with very complicated algebraic problems <br/>such as this, perhaps using the help of computers.  The central configurations are <br/>important landmarks which provide a starting point for further analysis.  It turns out that <br/>there are many other interesting solutions near the simple, rigidly rotating ones.  One <br/>way to trap and study these nearby orbits involves the construction of so-called <br/>isolating blocks. The geometry of these blocks provides qualitative information about the <br/>solutions inside and can also form the basis of numerical methods for approximating these <br/>solutions. Finally, there is the problem of understanding chaotic dynamics in <br/>mechanical systems and how such behavior can lead to large-scale instability.  Instability in <br/>celestial mechanics can give rise to such phenomena as the slow drifting of the orbital <br/>parameters of planets or asteroids.  It also occurs in a variety of other mechanical systems.  <br/>This phenomenon of Arnold diffusion is only partially understood at present.  The new <br/>approach which will be pursued here seems promising but much work remains to be done before <br/>it can be applied to complex systems like the n-body problem.<br/><br/>"

Jensen, Co-PI: Emmanuel N. Barron<br/><br/>Abstract: <br/><br/>The study of nonlinear essential supremum functionals is the focus<br/>of this project. In variational problems with such functionals the<br/>natural questions of interest are existence of an absolute (or<br/>local) minimizer, i.e., a function which minimizes the functional<br/>on every subdomain, necessary conditions for the minimizer leading<br/>to very nonlinear differential equations, and regularity of the<br/>minimizer. In contrast to the classical calculus of variations,<br/>even under very strong assumptions, regularity beyond continuous<br/>differentiability is not expected, but even this much smoothness<br/>is unknown. Virtually every question posed in classical<br/>variational analysis can be posed for supremum functionals--<br/>constraints, relaxation, homogenization, duality--and this can be<br/>done for both scalar and vector valued problems where the results<br/>are more difficult. This subject has placed a new focus on<br/>viscosity solutions for fully nonlinear equations, and a new<br/>emphasis on an old area of convex analysis, quasiconvexity. The<br/>motivation for the study of such problems comes from consideration<br/>of physical problems in which the use of the typical energy norm<br/>is not adequate, that is, one must design for the worst case.<br/>Supremum norm functionals lack strong differentiability and the<br/>subsequent difficulties associated with this lack must be dealt<br/>with using all forms of nonlinear analysis.<br/><br/>The use of variational analysis in engineering, physics, medicine,<br/>economics, and other fields is well established. Extreme value<br/>engineering is an area in which one seeks to consider the worst<br/>case in order to properly design or build some mechanism. In this<br/>project these two disciplines are merged to apply variational<br/>analysis in order to accomodate a worst case analysis. In certain<br/>areas, such as medicine, or structural engineering, it is clear<br/>that the worst case analysis is the only realistic design. For<br/>example, an oncological treatment cannot seek to minimize the<br/>average tumor load, but must minimize the maximum tumor load. A<br/>bridge should not be designed to minimize average stresses but<br/>maximum pointwise stresses. Many control mechanisms implemented<br/>only when a maximum indicator is triggered. These are all problems<br/>which are applications of the project considered and in which many<br/>new techniques must be developed. The basic and fundamental<br/>results of this area of variational analysis, including existence<br/>and the determination of criteria sufficient to determine the<br/>optimal function, will be studied. The analysis leads to the study<br/>of nonlinear partial differential equations and systems of such<br/>equations.<br/>"

The aim of this research is to <br/>determine concrete conditions on the moment data which permit the desired <br/>extension. Much of this research concerns, specifically, the multivariable <br/>truncated K-moment problem, where the support of a representing measure is <br/>required to be contained in a prescribed closed set K. For K an algebraic <br/>variety, this research concerns a new conjecture for solving the moment problem <br/>in terms of concrete algebraic and geometric invariants closely related to the <br/>moment data. For K semi-algebraic, this research seeks to apply the abstract <br/>solution of the truncated K-moment problem due to Curto-Fialkow  to specific <br/>semi-algebraic sets such as the closed unit disk. A direct application of this <br/>study concerns the multidimensional cubature problem in Numerical Analysis. By <br/>applying the moment matrix extension technique in the context of cubature, this <br/>research seeks to construct minimal cubature rules for sets such as the disk, <br/>square, triangle, or annulus.<br/><br/>One aspect of this research, the Quadrature Problem, concerns the efficient <br/>measurement of the size of an irregular area, or the measurement of the weight <br/>of a volume whose density is unevenly distributed. We seek to identify a small <br/>number of test points (or nodes) within the body in such a way that by measuring <br/>the density just at these few points, we may closely approximate the overall <br/>size or weight of the body. In the case of a linear body, such as a thin rod, <br/>the quadrature problem was solved with the fewest number of test points by the  <br/>mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), using a technique now known as <br/>Gaussian Quadrature. At the present time, surprisingly few minimal-node <br/>quadrature rules are known for shapes in the plane or in 3-dimensional space, <br/>even for basic sets such as a disk or sphere. In order to study the Quadrature <br/>Problem, we actually study a more general problem, the Multidimensional <br/>Truncated Moment Problem. Many real-world systems can be described by a sequence <br/>of physical attributes called moments, such as mass, weight, momentum, etc., <br/>which relate to the physical space underlying the system. The truncated moment <br/>problem asks whether a system is uniquely determined by its sequence of moments, <br/>and also whether the moments of a system can be computed by studying the system <br/>at just a finite number of nodes in the underlying space. In this research, we <br/>develop algorithms for recognizing when such a sequence of nodes exists, and for <br/>efficiently computing them. In this way, we may describe a system in terms of <br/>just a finite number of points in the underlying space. <br/>"

So far, in <br/>collaboration with Jean Bourgain and Michael Goldstein, the author has <br/>considered quasi-periodic potentials given by ergodic shifts on tori, <br/>potentials obtained by means of the skew-shift on the two torus, as well as <br/>potentials defined in terms of strongly mixing dynamics, such as the doubling <br/>map on the circle or hyperbolic automorphisms on the two torus. In each of <br/>these cases, positivity of the Lyapunov exponent, regularity  of the <br/>integrated density of states, and Anderson localization were studied. <br/>At this point, we are planning to address several remaining questions, <br/>including the following ones:<br/>1) Is the Lyapunov exponent positive in case of skew-shift potentials <br/>   for small disorder ? <br/>2) Is it possible to obtained detailed information on the nature of the <br/>   eigenfunctions in the quasi-periodic case assuming only positivity of <br/>   the Lyapunov exponent ? In fact, do the non perturbative techniques<br/>   allow the definition of the essential support as described in the <br/>   perturbative regime by Sinai and Froehlich, Spencer, Wittwer ? <br/>  These questions are intimately linked with Y.

Sinai's recent work on <br/>   ""anomalous transport in quasi-periodic media"", and would provide better<br/>   and more precise information on the subdiffusive behavior of the random<br/>   walk considered by Sinai. <br/>3) Is it possible to extend the  nonperturbative methods to strips, or the <br/>   two-dimensional plane ?<br/>4) Is the integrated density of states Holder continuous in the case of <br/>   several frequencies or the skew-shift ? <br/>5) What can be said about the statistics  of the level-spacings of the eigen<br/>   values for the case of the skew-shift ?<br/><br/>Historically, the study of random Schroedinger operators started with Phil<br/>Anderson's work in the late 1950's, for which he received the Nobel prize.<br/>Before his work it was believed that small random impurities in a crystal<br/>would not significantly change its conductance. Anderson, however, showed <br/>that this is not the case: Arbitrarily small random impurities occurring<br/>independently at each lattice site turn a conductor into an insulator. Since<br/>his work, which was not mathematically rigorous, the development of a precise<br/>theory of ""Anderson localization"" has been pursued by many mathematicians. <br/>It turned out that there were connections with deep results from several <br/>areas of mathematics. For example, Fuerstenberg's theorem on products of <br/>random matrices was a crucial tool in the development of the theory. <br/>These works attracted the attention of physicists, particularly experts in <br/>statistical mechanics. To this day, there is an active and fruitful exchange <br/>of ideas between mathematicians and physicists in this subject. In fact, the <br/>interest in random phenomena and methods has intensified quite notably in <br/>physics in recent years, as many important problems posed by statistical <br/>mechanics have proved to be rather deep mathematical challenges whose <br/>solution has lead to significant advances of probabilistic techniques.<br/>It is our hope that the projects set forth in this proposal will further<br/>advance our insight into the models of statistical mechanics as well as <br/>providing useful tools for mathematicians working in ergodic theory, analysis, <br/>and mathematical physics.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

In harmonic analysis, it involves dropping the K-finite condition in Paley-Wiener theorems for rapidly decreasing functions on a real reductive group.  This analysis will be applied to proving a version of the Casselman-Wallach theorem depending on parameters.  This theorem will imply a meromorphic continuation of non-K-finite Eisenstein series.

In this first decade of the twenty first century the theory has returned to its roots.  The nineteenth century invariant theory emphasized concrete questions on binary forms with algorithmic solutions. These problems have reemerged and are now being generalized to apply to quantum computation.   Early quantum mechanics studied puzzling and weird measurements involving photons, electrons etc. These phenomena led to the Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics. The philosophical debates of the early quantum mechanics have reemerged as quantum information technology.  The Hilbert space approach also gave birth to representation theory, which has as one of its main applications in number theory. The Langlands program has established a goal for the twenty first century to establish a non-commutative class field theory (Wile's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is actually proof of a special case of the Tanayama-Shimura conjecture which is a special case of the Langlands program).

The novel planar algebra techniques will be used to investigate and construct subfactors through a generators and relations approach to the associated planar algebras. This will build on prior work of Bisch and Jones in which a complete classification of singly generated planar algebras subject to a certain natural dimension condition was given. For instance, the Fuss-Catalan algebras of Bisch and Jones, whose representations have been used to construct new integrable lattice models in statistical mechanics, appear as an important part of this classification program.  Annular Fuss-Catalan algebras will be investigated with the ultimate goal of using them to answer questions related to intermediate subfactors.  Obstructions for compositions of subfactors and rigidity properties of subfactors will be analyzed. Potential applications of subfactor ideas and techniques to statistical mechanics and quantum information theory will be investigated.<br/>Ideas from operator algebras and non-commutative geometry have gained increasing importance in conformal field theory, string theory and quantum information theory. It has become clear that the symmetries of non-commutative spaces and quantum physical systems can no longer be understood through classical mathematical objects alone (such as groups).  A subfactor can be viewed as a mathematical object that captures these new symmetries and operator algebra techniques can be used to analyze and understand them. A particular intriguing structure that appears naturally in this context are the planar algebras, a structure that allows one to compute with very abstract mathematical objects by simply manipulating planar diagrams topologically. Such a formalism is tailor-made for applications in statistical mechanics and new solvable models based on these ideas have already been constructed. One of the founders of the theory of operator algebras was John von Neumann who in the 1930's discovered that certain algebras of operators on a Hilbert space are the natural framework for understanding symmetries of quantum physical systems. His ideas play an important role in quantum mechanics and fundamental laws of nature such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle appear as a natural consequence of von Neumann's abstract theory. The theory of subfactors, which is based on von Neumann's concepts, had an important impact across several fields in mathematics and physics with profound applications to knot theory, low dimensional topology, statistical mechanics and conformal field theory to mention just a few.<br/>"

He will concentrate on the harmonic analysis of the von Neumann algebras arising in connection with discrete groups, free probability and in deformation quantization theory. The goal is to determine  the structure of the von Neumann algebras that reflect the properties of  non commutative probability, and to relate this structure to the representation theory of Lie groups  and their discrete subgroups. Radulescu intends to investigate the problem of  characterizing the factors of discrete groups by computing their invariants, using ideas  of Murray and von Neumann, related to the  fundamental groups of such an algebra, the set of all index values for subfactors or the structure of convex sets of non-commutative moments. He will investigate also Connes embedding conjecture via tensor products on operator algebras.<br/><br/>The aim of this research is to discover  non-commutative aspects of the real word  hidden in ""quantum"" structures. Non-commutativity is a true aspect of the nature: for example two matrices do not necessary commute when multiplied. The famous Heisenberg's Uncertaneity principle reveals the same non-commutative aspect of nature. Von Neumann has developed a class of ""continuous"" matrices, that, while keeping some of the properties of usual matrices, are subtle enough to encode many of the aspects of quantum mechanics.  Recent developments by Jones have proven that aspects of  such von Neumann algebras are intimately related to aspects of topology, knot theory and ultimately biology. Likewise recent work by Voiculescu has proven that the there is a non-commutative probability theory encoded by the same type of objects. The aim of this research project is to contribute to the understanding and classification of some of the structural aspects of von Neumann algebras.<br/>_________________________________________<br/><br/><br/>><br/><br/><br/>-- <br/>"

He will develop and refine singularity detection algorithms (including limited data Lambda CT and wavelet methods) and apply them to electron microscopy and limited data industrial and medical X-ray tomography, with the goal of testing the algorithms on<br/>real data and using them in scanners.  Professor Quinto will continue to develop a boundary detection method that is applicable to Sonar in shallow water, and he will begin to develop these methods for synthetic aperture Radar.  The theoretical underpinnings will be based on Professor Quinto's pure mathematical research.  Radon transforms have an intimate relation to harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and complex analysis, and he will use integral geometry to prove theorems in these fields.  The principal investigator will prove uniqueness and support theorems for Radon transforms defined by spreads of polynomials, including spherical<br/>transforms in Euclidean space and other settings.  He and Professor Agranovsky will use these results to characterize zero sets of solutions of the wave equation on crystallographic domains and other sets.  Zero sets, where the solution is zero for all time, are important and difficult to characterize.  He will prove uniqueness theorems for Radon transforms on spheres and other surfaces and use these to solve Morera and mean value problems on manifolds.  He will<br/>prove support theorems for X-ray transforms.<br/><br/>This research encompasses both applied and pure mathematics: tomography and integral geometry.  The pure research will be used to develop, understand, and justify the applied<br/>algorithms, and the applied problems will motivate much of the pure research.  Computed tomography (CT) algorithms will be developed for the nondestructive evaluation of rockets and other objects.  The algorithms will allow scientists to detect cracks in rocket bodies, air pockets in rocket fuel, and delaminations in rocket exit cones. Limited data algorithms will be developed for electron microscopy as a part of a joint industrial project.  The goal is to produce an algorithm that reliably produces accurate pictures for a SIDEC electron microscope.  He will develop pure mathematics that will show how well the algorithms work and where their limitations might show<br/>up.  These pure mathematical underpinnings are required to ensure that his (or any other) reconstructions are correct and are not lucky guesses.  SONAR data can be modeled as averages over spheres (the spherical wave fronts of the sound) and Professor Quinto will prove<br/>theorems about these averages.  He will use these theorems to develop simple algorithms to map the ocean floor and to find boundaries of objects in the ocean and to apply to Radar.  This pure mathematics is intriguing in its own right.  Professor Quinto will prove theorems about spherical averages which will be used to understand the wave equation (the equation that describes how sound and light behave). The wave equation describes the motion of a drum head, and he will<br/>specify which points on the drum do not move at all.  Finally, he will prove theorems he will apply to complex and harmonic analysis, fields in pure mathematics.<br/><br/>"

The purpose of the research is to obtain a better understanding of the underlying physical phenomena through the study of the qualitative behavior of the solutions of the PDEs.  The first objective is to obtain the nonlinear stability of shock profiles for hyperbolic systems with relaxation, including fully dissipative systems and those containing one non-decaying wave in a linearly degenerate field (systems of composite type).

By including viscosity, heat conduction, electrical resistivity, excited internal structures of molecules, chemical reactions, and so on we focus on mathematical models that are closer to the real world than the traditional ideal ones.  The project has three specific objectives.  The first objective is to understand the stability properties of shock profiles in, for example, high-temperature gas flows when the internal structure of molecules and chemical reactions are no longer negligible.  This problem arises, for example, at the reentry of a space shuttle into the atmosphere and is quite different from the traditional supersonic flight of an airplane.  The second objective is to better understand gas flows near a solid surface.  The third objective is to study more complete wave patterns in several cases.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Two types<br/>of manifolds will be investigated: loop spaces of finite<br/>dimensional compact complex manifolds and Stein manifolds. One<br/>(longer term) goal will be to prove a Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch<br/>type index theorem on loop spaces, another to discover an<br/>appropriate class of sheaves for which cohomology can be proved<br/>to vanish on infinite dimensional Stein manifolds (generalization<br/>of the notion of coherent sheaves). I will also work on solving<br/>the inhomogeneous Cauchy--Riemann equations in pseudoconvex<br/>domains in Hilbert spaces.

The research will impact upon several areas of mathematical research, such as the theory of Hankel determinants pioneered by Szego some 70 years ago, the theory of 2 dimensional quantum gravity, and approximation theory. In approximation theory, McLaughlin will investigate new connections (recently discovered by McLaughlin and collaborators) between the asymptotic analysis of Riemann-Hilbert problems and rational approximation.

In other instances, statistical theories with great amount of randomness are developed to understand complex phenomena. Three examples: laser beams in optical fibers can<br/>explode, or signals they carry can degrade due to noise or the onset of violent oscillations. Waves in the ocean can organize themselves into ""trains"" transporting energy. In the 1950s, nuclear resonance level experiments indicated a new type of universality, whose mathematical explanation has only recently been explained.  Scientists' ability to predict dramatic behavior<br/>through the analysis of such general nonlinear partial differential equations, or statistical theories, is limited. However, there is a class of canonical models, under the heading ""integrable models"", for a wide variety of physical settings. Their singular behavior is a guide for the understanding of some complicated phenomena in nature. Some of these are partial differential equations, others are statistical models, but the unifying feature of these integrable models is that researchers<br/>are making great progress in their analysis.

Whereas the cohomological invariants of a space (commutative C*-algebra) will determine the space at most up to homotopy equivalence, in the class of nuclear simple C*-algebras, the objects are often determined up to isomorphism by their K-theoretical invariants.  Elliott's conjecture states that, far from being an accident, this is always the case for the entire class of separable nuclear simple C*-algebras. (Tracial invariants are needed if the real rank is nonzero.)  The proposed research aims to uncover and explain rigidity properties of nuclear  C*-algebras.  The basic idea beyond the classification program is that that the simplicity and the stable or real rank conditions for a nuclear C*-algebra translate to certain internal dynamical properties of the algebra which forces a behavior typical to that of a combinatorial object. The C*-algebra becomes a rigid object built around its K-theory skeleton.  The ramifications of the classification theory into the structure theory of C*-algebras will be explored with emphasis on dynamical systems and group C*-algebras.  The investigator will analyze the impact of the recent advances around the Baum-Connes conjecture on the classification theory with the long term goal of formulating and exploring a Baum-Connes type conjecture for general nuclear C*-algebras.  This is closely tied with the universal coefficient theorem problem in KK-theory and deformation theory of C*-algebras.<br/>Geometry was developed in an attempt to describe the ambient physical space. Its history has seen a series of remarkable achievements from the Euclidian geometry to the non-Euclidian geometries which culminated with the Riemannian geometry  providing a successful model for large-scale spacetime in general relativity.  The noncommutative geometry of Alain Connes is a far reaching generalization of the Riemannian geometry, well adapted for the study of a variety of large and small scale structures. The theory can be viewed as a significant development in the quest of quantizing of mathematics following the successful quantization of physics.  As in quantum physics, the coordinates in this theory are no longer ordinary numbers but noncommuting operators acting on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.  The ordinary spaces are being replaced by algebras of operators. The proposed project aims to contribute to the extensive effort of a community of researchers to extend the mathematics of commutative spaces to operator algebras.<br/><br/>"

Redundant systems have already had a serious impact in signal and image processing and upon Approximation Theory in general. The research community is currently developing two forms of redundant systems. The first deals with libraries of bases such as the wavelet packets and cosine packets. The second major thrust has been to study dictionaries such as the Gabor functions and neural networks.  The focus of our investigations is toward dictionaries of a different nature, which fall in two categories:<br/>(i) Dictionaries consisting of shifts and dilates of infinitely smooth, rapidly decaying functions which include the Gaussian, radial partial fractions, or more general anisotropic systems consisting of certain transformations of such functions.<br/>  (ii)         Collections of piecewise polynomials generated by multilevel dyadic partitions of the <br/>               pace, multilevel nested triangulations, or simplex partitions.  <br/>The primary goal of project is to understand nonlinear and highly nonlinear processes. In particular, we must develop an understanding of the nature of the smoothness conditions <br/>(specified by specific spaces) which govern the rate of approximation in a collection of important metrics. The second major effort of the project is to develop algorithms which are grounded in fundamental analysis, capable of achieving the rate of the best approximation (i.e. compression), and are practical to implement.<br/><br/>This project is actively coordinating its investigations with collaborators involved in the analysis and presentation of data for a wide range of application fields, including digital elevation maps and associated imagery arising from geographical information systems (GIS), signal and image analysis, computer aided geometric design (CAGD), graphical rendering and visualization of large scale numerical simulations. In each case, the objective is to analyze complicated data and signals in the context of prescribed dictionaries and to decompose them into basic elements which are natural for the physical system under investigation. The amplitudes associated with the base elements, whether they be wavelets, a multiresolution redundant system, or anisotropic systems, provide inherent information about the data and ideally lead to the maximal entropy encoding of classes of  signals (data). This encoded representation of data is important for the storage, transmission, fast query, visual display, correlation, or registration against data from other modalities. The primary motivation of this project is to make substantial contributions to the underlying theoretical foundation for these investigations.   <br/>"

Recently, a particular kind of nonlinear approximation, namely, greedy approximation attracted a lot of attention in both theoretical and applied settings. Greedy type algorithms proved to be very useful in various applications such as image compression, signal processing, design of neural networks, and the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations. The theory of greedy approximation is emerging now: some fundamental convergence results have already been established; many fundamental problems remain unsolved. The purpose of the proposed research is to continue investigations of greedy approximation. We propose to continue to study greedy approximation with regard to bases, where substantial progress has been achieved recently. We propose to place emphasis on studying the efficiency of greedy algorithms with regard to redundant systems (dictionaries).  Redundancy on the one hand offers much promise for greater efficiency in terms of approximation rate, but on the other hand gives rise to highly nontrivial theoretical and practical<br/>problems. We note that there is a solid justification of importance of redundant systems in both theoretical questions and practical applications.<br/><br/>Approximation theory is a branch of Mathematics that studies methods of  replacing complicated objects by simpler objects. This idea has proved to be fruitful in many applications to the real world problems. Among these applications are signal processing, image compression, finance<br/>problems, and many others.  As one of the model problems consider image compression.<br/>Take for example an image (picture) on a TV screen. Why should we approximate it?  In many cases we cannot afford to transmit (or store in a computer memory) the whole information of an image, perhaps because of a high cost for transmission of a bit of information or<br/>limited channel capacity. This is exactly the  point where an application of approximation theory can be fruitful. Clearly, when we replace an image by its approximant we lose the quality of picture: the more information we keep the better approximation to the original image we have. As a result we have an interplay between the reduction of information and the quality of approximation. In approximation theory we try to find the best (optimal) solution to this problem. The purpose of the proposed research is to continue the investigations of methods of approximation   which are motivated by these types of applications. We note that nonlinear <br/>approximation is at the current frontiers of approximation theory. Nonlinear approximation is the only hope at present for the increase in available approximation power still needed to handle problems of real practical interest.<br/><br/><br/>"

An important goal is to<br/>effectively merge the various approaches, and develop new ways of<br/>thinking about multi-scale problems. To this end, this project focuses<br/>on investigating five interdisciplinary problems, using ideas from<br/>functional analysis, geometry, topology, matched asymptotics and<br/>scaling arguments, in conjunction with numerical simulations. These<br/>problems are (1) Generalized crumpling: Combining functional analytic<br/>methods with geometric/topological ideas to study singularities and<br/>microstructure; (2) Blowup in Parabolic PDEs: Applying Morse theory to<br/>the dynamics of blowup solutions; (3) Dynamics of microstructure:<br/>Studying global bifurcations involving the change of microstructure in<br/>a model system; (4) Pattern formation and non-equilibrium phase<br/>transitions: Investigating multiple scale behaviors in nonlinear<br/>systems in the presence of noise; and (5) Topological transitions in<br/>fluid interfaces: Using tools from PDE to investigate topological<br/>transitions in 2 fluid systems.<br/><br/>Many real world systems are interesting precisely because they exhibit<br/>different behaviors on different scales. This is certainly true for<br/>living organisms, geological and geophysical systems, technologically<br/>important composite materials and even social structures and<br/>hierarchies. Thus researchers across many disciplines grapple with the<br/>following two questions, which are the essence of multiple scale<br/>analysis: (1) How does the large scale (macroscopic) behavior emerge<br/>out of the collective behavior of the small scale (microscopic)<br/>units?, and (2) What are the rules governing the large scale behavior,<br/>and how does this influence the behavior of the small scale units? The<br/>research component of this project studies these questions in a<br/>mathematical setting through problems that arise in material science<br/>and in physics. The overall goal is to meld together a variety of<br/>techniques to develop tools that can successfully handle complex<br/>real-world multiple scale problems. This is combined with an<br/>integrated approach to pedagogy, that features a strong involvement in<br/>undergraduate and graduate research, development of research<br/>opportunities for groups that are under-represented in mathematics and<br/>the physical sciences, curriculum development both at the graduate and<br/>the undergraduate level, and development of materials for scientific<br/>outreach to the general public.<br/><br/>Date: December 17, 2001<br/>"

The rotation set is a compact and convex subset of the plane that roughly collects all the average winding vectors (frequencies) exhibited by the orbits of the system.  The PI's goal is to establish results on a priori degeneracy<br/> of the rotation set to a single point and to understand the extent to which <br/> the dynamics must then be equivalent to that of the rigid rotation.  The tools involved include the number theory of the rotation set, hierarchies of dynamical tilings, geometric topology, quasi-conformal estimates, and renormalization techniques.  Cocyclic subshifts are a new class of algebraically defined dynamical systems obtained as the supports of locally constant matrix cocycles on the full shift over a finite alphabet. They generalize sofic systems and <br/> play a role in the symbolic dynamics based on the Conley index similar <br/> to the role of subshifts of finite type in the context of Markov partitions.<br/>  The PI will study the interplay between the algebra of the cocycle and the<br/> dynamics of its subshift.<br/><br/> Nonlinear oscillatory behavior is typical of many systems encountered in science and<br/> technology. The examples include plasma particles (in magnetic fields of the sun<br/>  or plasma containment devices), electrical currents (in electronics or living tissue),<br/> Belousov-Zhabotinsky type chemical reactions, convection currents (in a heated fluid),<br/> and planets of our solar system. Many realistic models are impossible to solve<br/> analytically and may  be accurately followed on a computer only for a limited time. <br/> The theory of rotation sets tries to remedy this problem by studying the fundamental<br/> properties of systems of coupled oscillators in an abstract setting so that qualitative <br/> predictions of the long time behavior can be made for broad classes of models.<br/> Symbolic dynamics deals with infinite sequences of zeros and ones <br/> and is motivated by problems of telecommunication, where  routinely <br/> data is encoded by such sequences and the volume is huge enough<br/> to justify the idealization to infinite sequences.  Loosely speaking, the main goal is to understand the relation between the properties  of the sequences and the design of the (mathematical or physical) device generating  them. The cocyclic subshifts arise from a new kind of device capable of matrix  multiplication. They generalize the so called subshifts of finite type, which are<br/> generated by finite state automata and are a standard tool in coding information<br/> for magnetic recording.  Cocyclic subshifts are also used to detect chaos in dynamical systems.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

DMS-0200732<br/><br/>Abstract:<br/><br/>The main interest of the PI is the study of quantum mechanics from the<br/>mathematical point of view, and of its many manifestations in the theory<br/>of partial differential equations and geometry. Specific current interests are <br/>the classical/quantum correspondence, resonances, geometric scattering, and<br/>non-hermitian quantum mechanics. More precisely, the PI is interested in resonances, <br/>which are mathematical objects modeling states which have certain frequencies of <br/>oscillations (or rest energies) and rates of decay, such as unstable molecules or <br/>classical system responding to resonant forcing terms. Despite a long tradition and a <br/>lot of recent progress our understanding is still very limited. Current experimental<br/>and numerical advances provide new stimuli for our studies. Another interest of the PI is<br/>non-hermitian quantum mechanics, which deals with systems in which energy is not conserved.<br/>That is almost always present when we localize a part of a system and the global <br/>conservation of energy disapears. In a subtle way resonances already fall into this <br/>category of phenomena. The mathematical problems present here are the stability of <br/>eigenvalues and measuring the size of the resolvent of non-self-adjoint operators. <br/>That leads to the study of ``pseudospectra'' which is then related to <br/>many interesting phenomena in PDEs.

It consists of three parts. Part I is a joint project with Ilkka Holopainen and Nageswari Shanmugalingam. Certain conformally invariant compactification operations arise naturally in the context of nonlinear potential theory. Understanding the structure of these compactifications should have important consequences for the boundary behavior of quasiconformal maps. These questions will be explored in the setting of metric spaces of bounded geometry, which is a general framework encompassing both smooth and nonsmooth examples. In Part II, Tyson will consider quasiconformal geometry and analysis on Dirichlet spaces. The goal is to relate the already well-developed theory of Dirichlet forms to the recently developed theory in the bounded geometry case. Work of Kigami, Strichartz and others has shown that Dirichlet spaces include various nonsmooth, fractal-type objects which are not covered by previous developments in quasiconformal analysis on metric spaces. Part II is joint work with Pekka Koskela and Shanmugalingam. In Part III, Tyson will consider specific applications of nonlinear potential theory in sub-Riemannian spaces, specifically, Carnot groups. These applications include sharp constant questions for geometric inequalities as well as strong A-infinity deformations of geometry. Part III is a joint project with Zoltan Balogh.<br/>This proposal is part of a larger investigation into nonsmooth analysis which is being carried out by a number of research groups worldwide. In informal terms, analysis is the mathematical study of motion and change; its historical roots lie in the development of the Calculus by Newton and Leibniz. The modern subject of analysis can be traced back to the pioneering work of Laplace, Cauchy and Poincare (among others). The classical setting for analysis is flat Euclidean spaces; this is the subject typically covered in multi-variable calculus. The Euclidean theory serves in turn as a model for analysis on curved spaces (surfaces and higher-dimensional manifolds); here the smooth structure of the underlying Riemannian space permits one to transport the Euclidean theory directly. In contrast, the proposed research focuses on nonsmooth and fractal-type settings. In extending the theory to this more general context the principal difficulties are twofold: first, the relevant concepts and definitions must be reformulated in an intrinsic manner suitable for such an extension, and second, new techniques and ideas must be introduced to prove basic results in the absence of the usual ambient Euclidean structure. The motivation for carrying out such an extension stems from the desire for better mathematical models for the nonsmooth and disordered media which arise in applications. Put simply, although classical smooth calculus has served for many years and throughout the sciences as an essential tool in the mathematical study of physical processes, it is reasonable to expect that further insight will be gained if the underlying mathematics is developed a priori on spaces of minimal inherent smoothness."

The major difference between operator spaces and Banach spaces is that one must consider operator matrix norms and completely bounded maps in the category of operator spaces. This was first realized by William Arveson in 1969 and was characterized by the PI in his Ph.D thesis in 1987. Since then the theory has been quickly developed into a very exciting research area in modern analysis.  This remarkable development is mainly due to the contributions of D.Blecher, E.Christensen, E.Effros, M.Junge, E.Kirchberg, C.Le Merdy, G.Pisier, V.Paulsen, H.Rosenthal, R.Smith, A.Sinclair and the PI.  Recently, the PI's research has been mainly centered on the 'local theory' of operator spaces and their applications. One of his main goals is to find the appropriate quantization of classical results in Banach space theory, and to apply these results to C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, as well as to some other related areas such as non-commutative harmonic analysis and locally compact quantum groups.  In this proposal, the PI plans to continue his investigation in this direction and proposes the following four research projects.  (1)  Investigate the local properties of non-commutative Lp spaces and their applications to operator algebras.  (2) Investigate the local structure of the operator preduals of von Neumann algebras and the operator duals of C*-algebras.  (3) Investigate the further applications of operator spaces to Kac algebras and locally compact quantum groups.  (4) Investigate the geometric structure of the 'matrix unit balls' of operator spaces, and investigate the possible applications of operator spaces to non-commutative probability and free probability.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The most profound distinction between classical and quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's principle that one should represent the basic variables of physics by operators rather than functions. The work of J. von Neumann emphasized that it is important to pursue the 'quantized' forms of mathematics. Collaborating with F.J. Murray, von Neumann succeeded in quantizing integration theory during the 1940's. Since then, mathematicians have tried to quantize many other areas of mathematics such as topology, differential geometry, analysis and probability theory.  The theory of operator spaces is a natural quantization of functional analysis, which is a very important field in modern analysis. During the last fifteen years, the PI together with his colleagues has established the foundation of operator space theory and has also discovered a number of far-reaching applications to some related areas in mathematics. In this proposal, he plans to continue his work on operator spaces and their applications. He expects that the solutions the proposed research projects will make important contributions to related fields.<br/> <br/>"

The mass transportation problem <br/>was first introduced by G. Monge in 1781 and consists into finding the optimal <br/>way for moving a pile of dirt with a prescribed distribution to holes with prescribed distributions. Optimality is measured against a prescribed cost function. The original Monge problem deals only with measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measures, and so, it makes sense to talk about distribution functions. We show that one can interprete the <br/>kinetic Fokker-Planck equations (KFPE) as the gradient flux of the entropy with <br/>respect to manifolds that vary in time. These manifolds are sets of probability <br/>densities for which the first moments and the standart deviation are prescribed. <br/>That restriction on the probability densities are needed to ensure conservation <br/>of total energy for the solutions constructed. This conservation law is a big <br/>deal in kinetic theory for inhomogeneous equations. Our investigations, in a <br/>special case, the so-called Maxwellian model of (KFPE),  show that the <br/>Monge-Kantorovich distance is an appropriate tool for studing these problems. <br/>The cost function used here is the square of the euclidien distance. We intend <br/>to investigate the implication of our results in the study of hydrodynamic <br/>equations. To deal with measures such as combination of dirac masses, in 1945, <br/>Kantorovich generalized the Monge problem to measures that may have singular <br/>parts. This generalization by Kantorovich turned out to find applications in <br/>various fields, including  shape recognition, where one wants to compare how two <br/>curves living in the space look alike. In that case, clearly, the curves can be <br/>represented by one-dimensional measures and so, have singular parts. Other <br/>applications that are relevant to this proposal are the semigeostrophic systems, <br/>introduced by Hoskins in 1975. The semigeostrophic systems are approxamations of <br/>the celebrated Euler equations of incompressible fluids in a system, rotating <br/>around a fix axis. These system where introduced in meteorology as models which <br/>develop fronts. There is a complete lack of analytical results on these models, <br/>and so, there is a need to develop a theory that would confirm or infirm  <br/>previsions made by meteorologists. We show that these systems are infinite <br/>dimensional hamiltonian systems with respect to the Monge-Kantorovich distance, <br/>whose cost function is the square of the euclidien distance. In this proposal, <br/>we intend to extend results obtained in previous works with collaborators or <br/>graduate students.  <br/><br/>The Monge-Kantorovich theory became central in many fields of mathematics <br/>including meteorology, kinetic theory, and shape recognition. Over the past few <br/>years, it has been noticed that a class of problems in various fields, including <br/>the study of evolution of gases, can be realized by minimizing a free energy <br/>functional under the penalty that one should not pay to much to change the state <br/>of the system. Based on preliminary investigations, we believe that in this <br/>proposal, we can use the Monge-Kantorovich theory to solved problems that are <br/>considered important in the kinetic theory of gases. We start our study with the <br/>Fokker-Planck equations, a class of equations similar to the Boltzmann <br/>equations, that are fundamental in kinetic theory.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Yu. Karpeshina  showed  that  most of generalized eigenfunctions of the multidimensional periodic Schroedinger operator  in the high<br/>energy region are close to the unperturbed ones: for every  sufficiently large energy there is an extensive set of  solutions of the Schroedinger equation which are close to plane waves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The PI will prove that even in the almost-periodic situation a lot of generalized eigenfunctions of the multidimensional  Schroedinger operator are close to unperturbed ones in the high energy region: for every sufficiently large energy there is an extensive set of  solutions of the Schroedinger equation which are close to plane waves. The main difficulty  to overcome is the small denominator problem, which is much more intricate in the case of almost-periodic potentials then in the periodic case, due to particularly complicated nature of wave propagation processes  in solids with non-local deviations from regular  structure.  The PI suggests  an effective approach to the small denominator problem. The methods developed by the  PI for the multidimensional periodic Schroedinger operator will be combined with basic ideas of the KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) theory in order to produce a new technique which works  for almost-periodic potentials.  Schroedinger operators with almost-periodic potentials are used in physics to describe solids with non-regular inner structure, e.g. alloys, ceramics, glasses, polymers. The spectral study of these operators leads to understanding of the mechanism of electrical conductivity in such materials. The goal of the project is to understand the  phenomenon of the insulator-metal transition.  The  insulator-metal transition means that a material behaves as an electrical insulator  if it stays below a certain temperature and abruptly starts to act as a conductor when  the temperature surpasses a certain value characteristic for a given material. The understanding of the phenomenon of insulator-metal transition is extremely important for applications, particularly in electronics industry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The P.I proposes to study a class of free boundary problems of interest in flame propagation. The model is obtained via an asymptotic method that simplifies a complicated system of conservation laws describing the process of combustion on the basis of physically sound approximations. The very way the problem is derived suggests viewing it as the limit of regularizing problems. One of the main objectives of the proposed research is to determine conditions under which limit solutions of the approximating problems converge to classical solutions to the original one, and to prove optimal regularity properties of the free boundary. Another area of interest is the optimal regularity of the solution and of the free boundary in the subelliptic obstacle problem. The necessary tools from harmonic analysis and pde's for the study of these problems will be developed concurrently. The P.I. has also a program aimed at developing the regularity theory of minimal surfaces in Carnot groups, and at investigating the validity of the Bernstein property in this setting. Such program entails the study of several basic questions. Among these, we mention the existence and characterization of traces on lower dimensional manifolds of Sobolev or BV functions. This question is instrumental also in the study of boundary value problems for subelliptic operators. In particular, the P.I. plans to investigate the solvability of the Neumann problem for sub-Laplacians, and to determine the optimal regularity of solutions. <br/><br/>Free boundary problems naturally arise in physics and engineering when a conserved quantity or relation changes discontinuously across some value of the variables under consideration. The free boundary appears, for instance, as the interface between a fluid and the air, or water and ice. One of the proposed projects aims at studying regularity properties of the free boundary in burnt-unburnt mixtures. The results of this investigation will lead to a better understanding of the models, to the improvement of simulation methods, and ultimately to a description of how flames propagate in non-homogeneous media. The P.I. has also a research program that lies at the interface of calculus of variations, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory. The focus is on the study of analytic and geometric properties of solutions to variational inequalities and pde's involving a system of non-commuting vector fields. The problems described in the proposal not only arise in a variety of mathematical context (e.g. optimal control theory, mathematical finance, and geometry), but are also of interest in other fields such as mechanical engineering and robotics.<br/>"

The unifying theme for these topics is their relation to homogeneity statements.  At their most basic level, homogeneity questions ask: given two distributions, what is the largest set of functions on which the two distributions will agree?  The first topic concerns the homogeneity question for invariant distributions supported on the compact elements in the group.  This is the last unproven (in general) homogeneity statement, and it has implications for the ""fundamental lemma"" (which is a conjecture).  The second topic concerns questions of stability for distributions supported on the unipotent set.   The final topic concerns the meaning of the constants occurring in the Harish-Chandra-Howe local character expansion.<br/>The topics discussed above fall under the rubric of harmonic analysis on Lie groups.  This area of mathematics, which is solidly rooted in physics, was pioneered by Harish-Chandra beginning some fifty years ago.  Since the 1970s, much of the work in this area has been directed toward questions which arise naturally in the Langlands program (which seeks to relate, in a strong sense, number theory, representation theory, and harmonic analysis).    For example, Harish-Chandra studied the distributions which arise when one integrates over a conjugacy class.  From the perspective of the Langlands program, it is also important to study the distributions which arise when one integrates over certain stable conjugacy classes, that is, classes which become conjugate over an algebraic closure of the ground field.  The investigator hopes his program of research will contribute to future progress in this area.<br/><br/>"

My theory includes an analog of the classical Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces. I gave several applications of these ideas, notably to the convergence of matrix algebras to coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups. I propose to continue to strengthen this theory, and to apply it in several directions suggested by the many situations in the physics and mathematics of quantization where one has a sequence of quantum spaces which appear to be converging to another space, either quantum or classical. As a major new direction I will try to develop an analogous theory for the quantum versions of the superstructure of vector bundles, connections, Yang-Mills actions, etc. I will also try to extend my theory beyond the quantum analog of locally compact spaces, so as to attempt to deal with the approximations of quantum field-theory models, especially those of integrable systems, say by quantum lattice models. <br/>Our nation's technological and economic success has at its foundation the mathematical models of the world around us which scientists develop in order to understand how to use the flood of data which flows from the laboratories of the experimental scientists. But human beings and computers can only deal with finite collections of numbers at a time.  Thus in applying these mathematical models it is almost always necessary to approximate the infinite variability of our world by finite collections of numbers. It is then crucial to understand how valid any given approximation is. With respect to individual calculations this matter has received extensive study. But less study has been made of how complex models as a whole can be approximated well by simpler models as a whole. Relatively little is known about such ""global"" approximations in the case of the models of quantum physics, which is the part of physics which governs chemical and biochemical reactions, the functioning of semi-conductors, and many other key technologies. In the classical realm there is an important form of global approximation called Gromov-Hausdorff distance. I have developed a quantum analog of it, and successfully applied it to a few examples. I propose to strengthen this theory, and to apply it to a broader class of examples, so as to better understand how to effectively approximate various models of quantum phenomena of current interest.<br/>"

Higher-dimensional shifts of finite type are symbolic<br/>dynamical systems whose points are arrays of symbols from a finite<br/>alphabet satisfying certain adjacency rules. While there is a<br/>well-developed theory for one-dimensional shifts of finite type, the<br/>general situation for higher-dimensional shifts has been very<br/>unclear. Recently a number of organizing concepts have started to<br/>emerge and it is hoped that these will lead to a satisfactory theory<br/>for at least some reasonable collection of higher-dimensional systems. <br/>Birkhoff's theorem is concerned with the effects of averaging a<br/>sequence of measurements of a system taken at equal time<br/>intervals. The result then states that in the case of a<br/>measure-preserving transformation, for almost every initial condition,<br/>the time averages are convergent. Further, the limit is identified if<br/>the transformation is ergodic. The work will focus on variations to<br/>this scenario where the measurements are taken at varying<br/>intervals.<br/><br/>The higher-dimensional shifts of finite type that will be studied are<br/>of relevance in designing efficient data storage schemes. Due to<br/>physical restrictions on storage media, in many cases certain patterns<br/>of binary digits cannot be reliably written and read back from digital<br/>storage media. In these cases, it is necessary to encode the data so<br/>as to ensure that the encoded data does not contain any of the<br/>forbidden patterns of binary digits.  This applies to magnetic tapes, but also to conventional hard disks, where data is stored in a number of tracks, all separated from<br/>one another. It is likely that in order to continue the growth in the<br/>amount of data that can be stored on a single device, it will be<br/>desirable or maybe even physically necessary to consider<br/>two-dimensional storage schemes. Efficient methods for doing this<br/>will depend on a good understanding of the properties of<br/>higher-dimensional shifts of finite type. The almost everywhere <br/>convergence results lie at the intersection of a<br/>number of diverse areas of mathematics: probability, dynamical<br/>systems, ergodic theory, number theory and harmonic analysis. It is<br/>hoped that progress made in this area will have knock-on effects in <br/>the other disciplines.<br/>"

This encompasses such apparently distant areas as many-body scattering and the Laplacian on symmetric spaces. Powerful geometric techniques recently adapted from the study of hyperbolic<br/>equations have already played a major role in the detailed study of many-body scattering, which describes how quantum particles interact, e.g. in an accelerator. The proposed project will employ these microlocal techniques to explore new problems in many-body scattering, and to bring<br/>insights to analysis on symmetric spaces. These problems include the detailed study of the behavior of particles at threshold energies, which are energy levels where new configurations of particles become accessible. For many chemical phenomena Planck's constant, h, may be considered small, motivating the study of semiclassical many-body phenomena. A particular example is the spectral shift function, which has been the subject of an ongoing joint project of the PI with Xue Ping Wang. Another area of proposed research, joint with Gunther Uhlmann, is finite energy inverse many-body scattering, i.e. whether one can determine the interaction between particles from the scattering matrices, which are objects describing the outcome of scattering experiments. Perhaps surprisingly, there are very algebraic objects which are analogous to many-body problems, namely higher rank symmetric spaces. The structure<br/>of so-called flats in these spaces is very similar to the structure of the configuration space in many-body scattering, with the walls of the Weyl chambers playing the role of collision planes. In a joint project, Rafe Mazzeo and the PI plan to use the constructive techniques from many-body<br/>scattering to obtain the full asymptotic behavior of various analytic objects on these spaces, showing that many of the phenomena observed there have their counterparts in much greater generality.<br/><br/>Indeed, many people are familiar with the following two descriptions of the propagation of light. First, in geometric optics, light propagates in straight lines, reflecting from surfaces according to Snell's law. That is, the angles of incidence and of reflection are the same, as if light<br/>consisted of little billiard balls. Second, light can be described by the wave equation, its propagation thus being similar to that of water waves.  There is a close relationship between these two viewpoints. Namely, for solutions of the wave equation, the propagation of sharp signals (or `singularities' of signals), which are the signals used to carry information, is precisely described by the simpler geometric optics picture. There is a similar correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics in many-particle interactions. Namely, for quantum particles the<br/>evolution of wave functions `at infinity' is almost described by the classical picture, as was proved previously by the PI. The only divergence between the classical and the quantum pictures is the emergence of bound states. For example, for a system consisting of two protons and two<br/>electrons, one of the protons and one of the electrons can form a hydrogen atom -- which may in turn break up if an electron with high energy hits it. In this proposal the PI will in part use these results, and related tools, for further investigation of many-body phenomena, such as examining the quantum-classical correspondence more precisely for small Planck's constant, and analyzing whether one can determine the interactions between particles from the result of a scattering experiment, and in part to extend such results to more geometric settings. These results are thus related to important questions in physics and chemistry. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The novel planar algebra techniques will be used to investigate and construct subfactors through a generators and relations approach to the associated planar algebras. This will build on prior work of Bisch and Jones in which a complete classification of singly generated planar algebras subject to a certain natural dimension condition was given. For instance, the Fuss-Catalan algebras of Bisch and Jones, whose representations have been used to construct new integrable lattice models in statistical mechanics, appear as an important part of this classification program.  Annular Fuss-Catalan algebras will be investigated with the ultimate goal of using them to answer questions related to intermediate subfactors.  Obstructions for compositions of subfactors and rigidity properties of subfactors will be analyzed. Potential applications of subfactor ideas and techniques to statistical mechanics and quantum information theory will be investigated.<br/>Ideas from operator algebras and non-commutative geometry have gained increasing importance in conformal field theory, string theory and quantum information theory. It has become clear that the symmetries of non-commutative spaces and quantum physical systems can no longer be understood through classical mathematical objects alone (such as groups).  A subfactor can be viewed as a mathematical object that captures these new symmetries and operator algebra techniques can be used to analyze and understand them. A particular intriguing structure that appears naturally in this context are the planar algebras, a structure that allows one to compute with very abstract mathematical objects by simply manipulating planar diagrams topologically. Such a formalism is tailor-made for applications in statistical mechanics and new solvable models based on these ideas have already been constructed. One of the founders of the theory of operator algebras was John von Neumann who in the 1930's discovered that certain algebras of operators on a Hilbert space are the natural framework for understanding symmetries of quantum physical systems. His ideas play an important role in quantum mechanics and fundamental laws of nature such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle appear as a natural consequence of von Neumann's abstract theory. The theory of subfactors, which is based on von Neumann's concepts, had an important impact across several fields in mathematics and physics with profound applications to knot theory, low dimensional topology, statistical mechanics and conformal field theory to mention just a few.<br/>"

The geometric consequences<br/>are most interesting in low dimensions: for example, we<br/>have developed a technique for constructing large families <br/>of conformal manifolds which admit metrics with positive<br/>Ricci curvature,<br/><br/>The interaction of geometry and analysis dates back<br/>to at least the eighteenth century, and yet continues to be<br/>an important and highly active field of mathematical research.<br/>The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to<br/>understand certain properties of the physical world, and<br/>differential geometry was developed to understand the <br/>geometry of curved spaces--for example, the curvature<br/>of the surface of the earth, or the curvature of space <br/>by matter predicted by general relativity. <br/>In the same way that Descartes realized that plane<br/>geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential<br/>geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis,<br/>especially differential equations.  This research in this<br/>proposal involves several such problems from Riemmanian<br/>and conformal geometry, whose analysis requires techniques<br/>from various fields within mathematical analysis.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Hall, University of Notre Dame<br/>DMS-0200649<br/><br/>Abstract:<br/><br/>The PI's research concerns the quantization of certain<br/>special classical systems, those whose classical configuration<br/>space is a compact symmetric space, such as a sphere. The<br/>simplest physical example of such a system is (the rotational<br/>degrees of freedom of) a rigid body, whose configuration space is<br/>the rotation group SO(3). The phase space of any such system,<br/>namely, the cotangent bundle of the compact symmetric space, has<br/>a natural complex structure that makes the phase space into a<br/>Kahler manifold. Thus the quantization of such a system can be<br/>done in two ways, one using the usual position Hilbert space and<br/>the other using a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions. The<br/>latter space generalizes the classical Segal-Bargmann space. The<br/>two possible quantum Hilbert spaces are related by a unitary<br/>transform, the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform, developed by<br/>the PI and M. Stenzel. The unitarity of this transform can be<br/>re-formulated as a resolution of the identity for the associated<br/>""coherent states,"" as shown in detail by the PI and J. Mitchell.<br/>These results have been applied to the quantization of<br/>two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory and to the classical limit of<br/>Thiemann's quantum gravity theory. The PI is continuing to<br/>investigate several aspects of the theory, including the<br/>semiclassical localization properties of the coherent states,<br/>properties of the associated quantization schemes (generalized<br/>Wick, anti-Wick, and Weyl quantizations), and the relationship of<br/>the theory to geometric quantization. <br/><br/>Broadly speaking the PI's research is in the boundary<br/>region between classical and quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics<br/>is the theory that governs the world at the atomic scale.<br/>Although classical (Newtonian) mechanics works well for<br/>macroscopic phenomena, it cannot account for the structure of<br/>atoms and molecules--at this level the quantum theory takes over.<br/>For the two theories to be consistent with one another the<br/>predictions of quantum mechanics must pass smoothly into those of<br/>classical mechanics as the scale passes from microscopic to<br/>macroscopic. On the other hand, the mathematical structure of the<br/>two theories is very different, so it is challenging to<br/>understand how this quantum-to-classical transition takes place.<br/>The PI's research concerns a reformulation of quantum mechanics<br/>which is equivalent to the usual one but which brings the<br/>description of quantum mechanics closer to that of classical<br/>mechanics. Specifically, the PI's work takes one standard<br/>reformulation of quantum mechanics, the Segal-Bargmann transform,<br/>and extends it to apply to systems with more complicated degrees<br/>of freedom, such as rotations. This work has been applied in a<br/>simplified model of the strong interaction in particle physics<br/>and in an ambitious program of T.

It aims at studying the behavior of <br/>nonlinear waves arising in geometry, ferromagnetism and gauge field theories; <br/>and that of functions along vector fields whose integral curves lack <br/>sufficient curvature. In the first part the focus is in geometric partial <br/>differential equations. Of special interest are Schroedinger maps, <br/>Wave maps and other gauge field theories such as the Yang Mills equations<br/>in Minkowski space-time. All of these equations model `wave like phenomena'. <br/>Their solutions arise as minimizers of the corresponding energy functionals. <br/>To conform with natural physical situations, it is of interest to study their <br/>existence, uniqueness under minimal regularity assumptions. These are <br/>difficult issues because the nonlinearities of these equations involve not <br/>just the solutions but also their derivatives. Nahmod will address these <br/>questions and plans to show that in the scale invariant set up solutions to <br/>the Cauchy initial value problem exist globally provided that the data is <br/>sufficiently small when measured relative to the critical regularity norm. <br/>She also plans stability issues; e.g. whether such a system remains close to <br/>its initial state as time evolves when the data has small energy. From a <br/>physical viewpoint the latter models whether such systems are close to <br/>equilibrium. The techniques exploit geometric aspects of these equations to <br/>extract crucial information -such as special structures in the nonlinearity-  <br/>which is then used in the analysis. The method combines deep Fourier analysis <br/>with gauge theoretic geometric tools. The goal of the second part is the <br/>study of the Hilbert transform along vector fields and its associated <br/>maximal operator in two dimensions. Their treatment departs from the classical <br/>study of singular integrals for in the present situation, the singularity <br/>lives on some variety that is changing at each point. Nahmod will <br/>investigate how to develop time frequency techniques to study operators under <br/>no curvature assumptions. This is the case, for example, in studying <br/>differentiability properties of functions along vector fields. <br/><br/>Partial differential equations are the mathematical models to the laws governing much of the phenomena in our physical world. The wave equation models the propagation of different kind of waves -such as light waves- in homogeneous media. Nonlinear models of conservative type arise in quantum mechanics while other variants appear for example in the study of vibrating <br/>systems and semiconductors. The nonlinear Schroedinger equation arises in various physical contexts in the description of nonlinear waves- such as propagation of a laser beam in a medium whose index of refraction is sensitive to the wave amplitude, water waves at the free surface of an ideal fluid as well as in plasma waves. Some of the interesting questions are those about local and global existence of solutions, uniqueness as well as long time behavior of global solutions. The role of mathematical analysis is to understand the behavior of the solutions to these equations, provide the tools to extract their quantitative and qualitative information and <br/>lay the foundations upon which methods to accurately approximate the solutions are developed. Fourier analysis and more generalized adapted frequency decompositions such as time-frequency analysis' consists in decomposing complex objects via `modulated waveforms' into basic building blocks which are localized and easy to understand, and then piecing them back together in a straightforward manner. It works very similarly to a musical score. The modulated waveforms have four attributes: amplitude (loudness), scale (duration), frequency (pitch) and position (instant it is played). The objects could be speech, radar signals, as well as oscillatory <br/>expressions arising in optics, AC ousting scattering, wave propagation and other phenomena of nonlocal nature."

The PI plans to study this correspondence and see if these representations go to interesting Zuckerman functor modules under this map. In addition, the PI will also work on a program already in progress in collaboration with David Vogan. The problem they want to solve is the following conjecture: There is a bijection between the set of unitary representations of a Lie group G, whose lowest K type is associated to a fixed parameter, and the set of unitary representations of a special subgroup with lowest K types associated to the same parameter.<br/>Lie groups have connections in many areas of applied Mathematics like <br/>Materials Science, Quantum Field Theory, Particle Physics, Control <br/>Theory and Robotics and Biology.
