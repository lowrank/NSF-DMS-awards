The project is particularly focused on interactions between fluid and structural bodies--so-called fluid-structure interactions--which are omnipresent in nature. For these fluid-structure dynamics, as well as for other physically relevant coupled PDE models, a nonlinear theory is generated which will culminate in: (i) The derivation of control laws for these interactive models which can be successfully invoked so as to stabilize or steer both the fluid and structural components; (ii) numerical algorithms so as to approximate the profiles of the fluid-structure variables, for either controlled or uncontrolled regimes. In this part of the project, it is anticipated that a major role will be played by nonstandard implementations of the Babuska-Aziz and Babuska-Brezzi ""inf-sup"" theories. By means of such variational formulations, the coupling between fluid and structure components on the boundary interface will be resolved; resolution of this coupling is at the very heart of fluid-structure analysis.<br/> <br/>The qualitative and quantitative information gleaned from this project will provide a better understanding of the various physical phenomena which can described by interactive PDE models. For example, a fluid-structure PDE can be invoked to model the immersion of red blood cells within the plasma component of blood.  These continuous and numerical approximation studies for modeling PDE dynamics would render it practicable to more accurately predict and simulate such blood flow dynamics. In particular, the project will culminate in the derivation of numerical algorithms which will be based upon the aforesaid Babuska-Brezzi variational formulations. As such, these algorithms would presumably have a higher degree of rigor than current available numerical methods. Moreover, the control laws we intend to consider in the project may lend insight into possible control engineering methodologies for the physical interactions governed by systems of coupled PDE's."

The principal driving theme<br/>will be the notion of classification, both as a framework for the investigation of internal structure and as an external viewpoint where questions about the prevalence of certain phenomena and the complexity with which they occur can be addressed using the tools of descriptive set theory.  This program will bridge to activity in Banach space theory, geometric and combinatorial group theory, convex geometry, set theory, and algebraic topology.  One of the main goals in the investigation of mathematical structure is to classify the variety of possibilities that may occur, and indeed many of the significant results in mathematics are classification theorems of one form or another.<br/>It has become apparent however that there can be limits to classifiability when one is dealing with infinite-dimensional phenomena such as those that arise in classical and quantum mechanics. These issues of classifiability themselves comprise a theory which, despite its abstraction, involves the very notions of symmetry and chaos that one often sees in physical systems.  The aim of the project is to study the limits of classification for various types of infinite-dimensional structures that have their origin in the geometric and probabilistic aspects of classical and quantum physics"

Values of operator functions do not commute in general, which makes the analysis of such functions and, in particular, their approximations much subtler than in the classical case. Under certain assumptions, traces of the remainders of the first and second order approximations can be represented via spectral shift functions, which originate from Lifshits' work on the quantum theory of crystals in 1952. While higher order Taylor-type approximations are also of interest in applications (for instance, in perturbation theory for Schrodinger operators with long-range potentials), very little is known about the structure of their error terms. The project will concentrate on the study of the higher order Taylor-type approximations, in particular, on testing Koplienko's conjecture of 1984 on existence of higher order spectral shift measures.<br/><br/>Perturbation theory has originated as mathematical modeling of some problems of quantum mechanics, where physical quantities are described by self-adjoint operators acting on a separable Hilbert space. The change of a value of an operator function under a perturbation of its argument is reflected in the spectral shift functions. A comprehensive theory with various applications, including those to perturbation theory for Schrodinger operators, scattering theory, and spectral flow, has been constructed for these functions. Finding higher order analogs of the spectral shift functions is one of the goals of the project. Many operators can be naturally affiliated with von Neumann algebras (for instance, the integrated density of states for some operators can be expressed in terms of the corresponding von Neumann algebras). We will work in both the original and the von Neumann algebra setting of the perturbation theory."

Dynamical entropy theory began with the work of Kolmogorov (1958) who used it <br/>to study actions of the group of integers. In the seventies and eighties, entropy theory was extended first to actions of the integer lattice, and then to actions of amenable groups. Until winter 2007-2008, none of the basic results of entropy theory had been extended to any non-amenable group. Then, the PI discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups is not widely known, but it contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all amenable groups and all linear groups. This was used to solve a long-standing open problem: the classication of Bernoulli shifts over a free group up to measure-conjugacy. After Kolmogorov's initial work, the next major development was Ornstein's creation of a powerful machine, based on entropy, for determining whether two given actions of the integers are measurably-conjugate. This was extended to amenable groups (Ornstein-Weiss) but no comparable theory exists for nonamenable groups. A major research goal of this proposal is to fill this gap by taking advantage of the new entropy theory. In the special case of free group actions, there are close connections to probabilistic combinatorics (especially random regular graphs) and statistical physics models that the PI intends to exploit for the benefit of all three subjects. <br/><br/>The PI plans to hold a workshop at the University of Hawai'i, MAanoa focussed around classication problems in ergodic theory and dynamical systems. This workshop will support the intellectual goals of this proposal, disseminate the most current research ideas in the field and introduce these topics to young researchers and students. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the mathematical community to encourage the diverse student population of the university, especially the native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders. This proposal provides directly for the training of a graduate student. It should be particularly easy to attract one because the new entropy theory requires very little background and provides ample unexplored open problems that could have signicant impact in ergodic theory and other areas.<br/>"

In previous work, the PI has developed the machinery of polynomial families associated to Free Probability theory. He now proposes to use this machinery to obtain a number of applications in free probability and related fields. Specific projects include the investigation of von Neumann algebras coming from special tracial states on polynomials, the study of the free Fisher information of these states, as well as their connection with multi-matrix models in the theory of random matrices. He will also investigate operator algebras arising from Gaussian pairs of states in the two-state free probability theory, for which polynomial families provide extra structure. Conversely, the PI plans to use probabilistic techniques to investigate combinatorial properties of polynomial families, such as their linearization coefficients. He will also explore the issue of whether further classes of polynomial families have probabilistic interpretations. <br/><br/>It is a fundamental property of matrices that they may not commute. Since the beginning of quantum mechanics, probability theory of non-commuting objects has been an important field of research. In the 1980s, Voiculescu started the investigation of free probability theory, a theory of this type which also has numerous (sometimes spectacular) applications to operator algebras and the theory of random matrices, itself playing an increasingly important role in physics and signal processing. On the other hand, polynomials are ubiquitous in mathematics, although polynomials in variables which do not commute are less familiar. This proposal applies fundamental techniques of non-commutative polynomials, combined with methods from free probability, to the study of operator algebra and random matrices. Parts of this project are well-suited for undergraduate research, which encourages interest in mathematics among students. The PI will continue to organize a seminar, which provides opportunities for young researchers to disseminate their work and meet colleagues. Finally, the PI will organize a conference on topics covered in the proposal, with the goal of bringing together researchers from different fields of mathematics, resulting in mutually beneficial interactions."

In particular the PI plans to investigate: (1) Regularity theory for variational problems for mappings between manifolds with a particular emphasis on problems with nonlinearity of the critical growth (n-harmonic mappings and H-surface system). (2) Degree and homotopy theory for weakly differentiable mappings between manifolds in the case in which regularity of mappings is not enough to guarantee integrability of the Jacobian. Connections to the topological structure of manifolds. (3) Classes of mappings that arise in the nonlinear elasticity. (4) Lipschitz approximation of Sobolev mappings into metric spaces and between metric spaces. In particular, approximation of mappings from the Euclidean space into the Heisenberg group. (5) Continuous, Sobolev and smooth surjections onto metric spaces. Construction of differentiable Peano-type mappings. In particular existence of smooth surjections between Carnot groups.<br/><br/>At the beginning of XXth century, with a classical notion of differentiable functions, the theory of partial differential equations and calculus of variations came to a dead end.

With the increasing variety of areas to which the theory of Sobolev spaces applies there are new possibilities to built bridges between different areas of mathematics, engineering and physics. One of the aims of the project is to develop such connections between fields of analysis, calculus of variations, geometry and topology. Collaboration with researchers from different institutions and countries is an essential part of the project. This will strengthen the cooperation of scientific institutions and give unique opportunity for the graduate students involved in the project not only to work in open problems at the frontiers of the contemporary mathematics, but also to establish contacts with researchers from all over the world. The outcomes of the project will be presented on conferences, workshops and schools.

A main theme of this proposal is the investigation of certain ``coordinate systems'' for Banach spaces, e.g. bases, frames, and dictionaries. One of the problems considered is an old one from harmonic analysis, which asks whether the space of square integrable functions has a basis formed by translates of the same element. It is intended to attack this problem with tools from the theory of Banach spaces.  Another prominent question deals with the structure of the (complemented) subspaces of the space of p-integrable functions. The PI intends to bring to bear here the method of infinite asymptotic games, which he has developed in collaboration with E. Odell.  Several parts of this proposal deal with other issues originating from signal processing and data compression. Here one looks for bases, frames, or, more generally dictionaries of spaces, in which (certain) vectors can be approximated by vectors with few nonzero coordinates, using easily implementable algorithms, so that the representation satisfies certain stability conditions, and/or can be ``quantized''.<br/><br/>Banach spaces, their geometric and topological structure provide a natural framework for studying dynamical systems, differential equations, multi-resolution analysis, in particular if one wants to model complex and high-dimensional structures.

The proposed work could also spur further development in these areas.<br/>"

The common link can be described as studying the set where two squared norms of holomorphic maps are equal, and relating the CR geometric information of the solution set of this equation to the complexity of the maps.  The PI proposes to prove that the singular set of a Levi-flat hypervariety is Levi-flat,  to classify algebraic Levi-flat hypervarieties in complex projective space, to study the regularity of Levi-flat hypersurfaces with boundary, to extend the work on complexity of proper maps between balls, and finally, to further develop computational methods to help in gaining insight into the combinatorial aspects of the proper maps of balls and related problems.<br/><br/>Study of several complex variables, of which CR geometry is part, is central to the understanding of modern mathematics, physics and other applied sciences.  For example, to understand behavior of differential equations, one must understand the geometry of the space where the equation lives.  The theory of singularities and complexity in CR geometry is not well understood currently, and there is great interest in the CR geometry community in building proper foundations in this area.  Furthermore, there is fertile ground to build connections with other areas of mathematics.  The study of proper maps of balls has already yielded unexpected connections with number theory, combinatorics, linear algebra, and has computational aspects that may perhaps yield advances in symbolic and numerical computation.  Many of the methods applied in this research are easily accessible to beginning graduate and even advanced undergraduate students.  The project will therefore not only advance the understanding of this new area in complex analysis, but may serve to involve young researchers."

The first problem is about how well such operators can be approximated (in their mixed moments with respect to the trace) by operators on finite dimensional spaces.  We will attack this problem by examining eigenvalues of sums of operators.  The second problem is about the possibility of decomposing operators on infinite dimensional space by restricting them to invariant subspaces.  In some recent progress, Haagerup and Schultz have proved the existence of such subspaces for a large class of operators, and we will focus on some specific operators for which this question is unresolved.<br/>"

Recently, several classical results from probability theory have been extended to the broader setting of these measures.  These new results appear to be out of reach of the classical probabilistic reasoning based on independence which is replaced by the geometric notion of convexity. The PI intends to further investigate the geometric parameters of high-dimensional measures and in particular the geometry of   generalized centroid bodies associated to these measures. With this approach and applying techniques from local theory of Banach spaces, classical convexity,  probability and information theory, the PI wishes  to attack various open problems related to log-concave measures such as small ball probability estimates and the hyperplane conjecture, as well as, various conjectures in the theory of convex bodies such as the regularity of the entropy numbers and the optimal bound of the minimal mean width. <br/><br/>There is a general principle that underlies the research in this proposal: the tendency of high dimensional systems to congregate around typical forms.

The first set of problems is about free boundary problems (FBP) on Riemannian manifolds. One major task is to prove regularity results for the free boundary or the solution of the FBP. For this purpose it is important to establish some monotonicity formulas to describe the asymptotic behavior of the solutions near the free boundary. For FBP in Euclidean spaces Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman and Caffarelli-Jerison-Kenig have established some celebrated monotonicity formulas, which play a central role in the regularity theory. As their first goal, the principal investigator and E. Teixeira seek to establish the analogues of these formulas for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Riemannian manifolds. The second set of problems is related to finding a metric on four-manifolds with constant Q-curvature. This geometric problem can be translated to an existence problem for a certain fourth-order partial differential equation. The principal investigator and M. Ould Ahemedou seek to solve this existence problem completely by using arguments of Lin-Wei, Weinstein-Zhang, Bahri-Coron, and others to handle various major difficulties presented by this equation. The third set of problems concerns the blow-up solutions for certain systems of two-dimensional elliptic equations, namely, the Liouville and Toda systems. In comparison with scalar Liouville-type equations, the blow-up phenomenon for these systems is very poorly understood. The principal investigator and C.S. Lin seek to develop the necessary tools for obtaining a thorough understanding of blow-up for these two systems.<br/><br/>In the first set of problems, the so-called monotonicity formulas should provide a major new tool for the study of regularity theory for free boundary problems defined on Riemannian manifolds, the more general and meaningful context for such problems from the viewpoint of applications. Moreover, these new formulas will provide motivation for people to extend to the Riemannian setting many other important results that are known currently only in the realm of Euclidean spaces. The second set of problems reviews strong interplay between analysis and geometry. On one hand, these problems exhibit some major analytical difficulties, the overcoming of which will require new ideas and methods. On the other hand, the deep and rich geometric meaning of these problems is a great source of inspiration for people to try to understand and surmount such analytical difficulties. Thus, solving the second set of problems will not only provide new tools for investigating other partial differential equations with similar complications, but also lead to a better understanding of many related open problems in geometry. The problems in part three are rooted in various fields of physics, chemistry, and ecology, as some important models in these fields are described by the Liouville- and Toda-like systems. Solving the challenging mathematical questions related to these systems will likely impact the aforementioned fields and expose the deep connections between them."

The first set of problems is about free boundary problems (FBP) on Riemannian manifolds. One major task is to prove regularity results for the free boundary or the solution of the FBP. For this purpose it is important to establish some monotonicity formulas to describe the asymptotic behavior of the solutions near the free boundary. For FBP in Euclidean spaces Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman and Caffarelli-Jerison-Kenig have established some celebrated monotonicity formulas, which play a central role in the regularity theory. As their first goal, the principal investigator and E. Teixeira seek to establish the analogues of these formulas for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Riemannian manifolds. The second set of problems is related to finding a metric on four-manifolds with constant Q-curvature. This geometric problem can be translated to an existence problem for a certain fourth-order partial differential equation. The principal investigator and M. Ould Ahemedou seek to solve this existence problem completely by using arguments of Lin-Wei, Weinstein-Zhang, Bahri-Coron, and others to handle various major difficulties presented by this equation. The third set of problems concerns the blow-up solutions for certain systems of two-dimensional elliptic equations, namely, the Liouville and Toda systems. In comparison with scalar Liouville-type equations, the blow-up phenomenon for these systems is very poorly understood. The principal investigator and C.S. Lin seek to develop the necessary tools for obtaining a thorough understanding of blow-up for these two systems.<br/><br/>In the first set of problems, the so-called monotonicity formulas should provide a major new tool for the study of regularity theory for free boundary problems defined on Riemannian manifolds, the more general and meaningful context for such problems from the viewpoint of applications. Moreover, these new formulas will provide motivation for people to extend to the Riemannian setting many other important results that are known currently only in the realm of Euclidean spaces. The second set of problems reviews strong interplay between analysis and geometry. On one hand, these problems exhibit some major analytical difficulties, the overcoming of which will require new ideas and methods. On the other hand, the deep and rich geometric meaning of these problems is a great source of inspiration for people to try to understand and surmount such analytical difficulties. Thus, solving the second set of problems will not only provide new tools for investigating other partial differential equations with similar complications, but also lead to a better understanding of many related open problems in geometry. The problems in part three are rooted in various fields of physics, chemistry, and ecology, as some important models in these fields are described by the Liouville- and Toda-like systems. Solving the challenging mathematical questions related to these systems will likely impact the aforementioned fields and expose the deep connections between them."

Sobolev and Poincare inequalities are classical examples of such inequalities, properties like non-exactness or Kazhdan's property (T) can also be viewed as generalized isoperimetric conditions. The main objective of the project is to broaden the understanding of isoperimetric inequalities with coefficients in a C*-algebra on which the group acts by automorphisms and of their geometric implications. In particular, the problem of finding explicit, natural examples of groups carrying such inequalities will be addressed. This will lead to a better understanding of the geometry which lies behind recent progress towards the Novikov  and the Baum-Connes conjectures in which exactness and a-T-menability played major roles. <br/><br/>The isoperimetric problem is one of the most fundamental problems in mathematics dating back to antiquity. In its simplest form it amounts to finding the largest area on the plane enclosed by a closed curve of fixed length. This classical case has been studied extensively and has numerous applications in analysis and geometry. It is therefore natural to ask for generalizations in which ""area"" and ""perimeter"" are replaced by more flexible notions, allowing to implement ideas from the classical case to a more demanding setting. These problems lie at the intersection of several major branches of mathematics and one of the main goals of this project is to foster interactions between the underlying algebraic, analytic and geometric structures.<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/>"

More specifically, the PI will pursue (1) Sharp distortion examples for K-QC maps. (2) Sharp sufficient conditions for removability of sets under bounded quasiregular (QR) maps (related to sharp QC distortion theorems.) (3) Buffon needle probability (Favard length) for Cantor sets (4) Questions involving uniformly rectifiable sets and harmonic measure. (5) Problems on distance sets relating Fourier analysis and geometric combinatorics. The unifying method to be employed is an underlying geometric-combinatorial vision which often manifests itself through multiscale analysis (i.e. the analysis of a problem on different scales.) This method will be applied in the contexts of K-QC mappings (mappings sending an infinitesimal circle/ball to an infinitesimal ellipse/ellipsoid with eccentricity controlled by K), geometric measure theory (GMT, which analyzes sets and measures on them -these are generalizations of length, area and volume-), harmonic analysis (decomposing a signal into elementary pieces of wavelike character), and potential theory (study of Coulombic potential and related topics.)  <br/><br/>With regards to contextualizing the proposed research within a broader mathematical and scientific framework, note that the mathematical objects involved have found abundant applications in other disciplines, so the problems proposed will advance knowledge in those areas and hence impact other areas of mathematics, science, or engineering. More specifically, fractals (geometric measure theory) appear naturally in electrodeposition and Diffusion Limited Aggregation. The internal structure of lungs has a high fractal dimension (to capture more oxygen.) Fourier analysis is often applied in signal and image processing. Quasiconformal maps are solutions to problems in non-linear elasticity, and have found applications in string theory. Uniform rectifiability appears in minimizers of the Mumford-Shah functional (originally used for image segmentation.) Geometric combinatorics is used for fair division and voting problems in the social sciences, and for phylogenetic trees models in biology. Distance sets are used in industry to study the dimensionality of data sets. In terms of human resource development, the PI will continue preparing students for the Putnam Competition, participating in the Math Club, and mentoring graduate students informally in the context of graduate courses. Fractals and geometric combinatorics are excellent areas for promoting teaching and training of undergraduates and postdocs. The basic notions of multiscale analysis, dimension, combinatorics, etc. are deep enough to convey some flavor of research yet can be successfully explained in an elementary way. Research results will be disseminated via participation in US and international meetings, which will facilitate collaborations with both established and young researchers."

The goal is to establish diffusive propagation of waves in a weakly disordered medium over arbitrarily long times.  There is a rich non-rigorous theory of wave diffusion in the physics literature, based on heuristic analyses and uncontrolled perturbation theory, which suggests that diffusion occurs and predicts the leading order asymptotic behavior of the diffusion constant.  In spite of the obvious importance of this problem, we are far from having a rigorous analysis of the mathematics involved.  The PI will consider the problem from a number of view points, in particular using an ``augmented space"" representation such as has proved useful in the analysis of random walks in random media and homogenization.  Additionally the PI will consider related problems in the theory of random matrices, specifically random band matrices, with entries that vanish outside a band around the diagonal, which have been suggested as a model of a so-called metal-insulator transition as the bandwidth is moved from the matrix size down to one.<br/><br/>What are the effects of disorder?  This is a fundamental question in regards to any model of physics, even one in which disorder is not explicitly included.  After all, any real world system is subject to a small amount of noise, and experience shows that even weak disorder may have a profound effect on the behavior of the system.  Despite the fundamental nature of this subject, aspects of it remain poorly understood and it is not at present incorporated in the curriculum in an accessible way. This program seeks to bridge this gap as follows: 1) through the development of courses for undergraduates on the basic models of statistical mechanics and random matrix theory; and 2) by focused research on aspects of the question relevant to wave motion and semi-conductor physics.  The goal of such work is to use analytical tools to further basic understanding of models of theoretical physics and applied mathematics.  Such advances impact areas outside of mathematics and theoretical physics in the short run by yielding ideas for constructing new and better models useful in applications. In the long run, however, the impact will be even greater, as mathematical work illuminates those parts of physical theory that are truly fundamental."

Problems related to the quasiconformal and bi-Lipschitz Jacobian problems, the characterization of certain quasiconformal mappings with convex potentials in terms of their Monge-Ampere measure, and the corresponding extensions to the subelliptic case will be investigated.<br/><br/>The Monge-Ampere operator is the nonlinear cousin of the omnipresent Laplace operator, whose enormous importance for physics and engineering has long been well documented. As a nonlinear operator, the Monge-Ampere operator is far more complicated than the Laplacian. However, when acting on convex functions, it produces geometric and measure-theoretic objects that help to clarify its workings. For a long time, the Monge-Ampere operator has played a key role in differential geometry and optimal mass transportation. Somewhat more recently, it has found applications to the design of reflector antennas and to so-called quasiconformal mappings. Another exciting aspect of the Monge-Ampere equation comes from its linearization, which has applications in its own right to Lagrangian models of front formation and fluid dynamics. The linearized Monge-Ampere operator is a challenging object, for it does not fall into the category of the well-known ""uniformly elliptic"" operators."

This project is devoted to understanding real-Hardy spaces and the Littlewood-Paley theory in the noncommutative setting. The PI will apply the results to operator algebra/noncommutative geometry as well as to classical analysis. One of the goals is to understand Fourier multipliers on noncommutative groups. It requires a combination of different tools from Hp theory, operator space theory, and noncommutative Lp-spaces. A major challenge is to find noncommutative techniques replacing the use of certain crucial geometric properties of Euclidean spaces. The PI's work on operator-valued Hardy spaces took an initial step in the direction of the proposed research. The proposed project will provide a theoretical counterpart of the recent work by Pisier/Xu, Junge, and Junge/Xu of noncommutative martingales and will complement Arveson's work on noncommutative analytic-Hardy spaces. It will also improve the understanding of the semigroups of (completely) positive operators on von Neumann algebras.<br/><br/>Quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle allow for many noncommutative generalizations (=quantization) of classical mathematical theories following Von Neumann and Murray's pioneering work on noncommutative integration theory. Very interesting new phenomena and difficulties arise in the effort of adopting classical concepts to the noncommutative framework. For example, using the language of von Neumann algebras, it is now possible to talk about the expected exit time for a noncommutative domain although we can never see the ""points"" of this domain. This project will continue this long term quantization effort and will explore and strengthen the deep links between different branches of mathematics and physics. In turn, it will make valuable contributions to prediction theories, H-infinity control, signal and image processing, statistics, and quantum mechanics as well."

The study of resonances in a geometric context is driven by a few basic questions:  How many resonances are there? How are they distributed? What does their distribution tell us about the underlying geometry?  The PI will study the spectral geometry of complete, infinite-volume Riemannian manifolds modeled on hyperbolic spaces.  These spaces are natural models of chaotic quantum scattering.  The specific research goals of this project include: (1) Studying the resonance counting function and separating contributions from conformal poles from the true resonances, (2) developing spectral tools such as determinants and trace formulas in cases where intrinsic regularizations of these objects are not available, (3) inverse scattering problems - deducing geometric structure from the resonance set, scattering phase, etc., (4) perturbation problems - understanding the behavior of resonances under perturbations of a hyperbolic metric.<br/><br/> The research in this proposal is motivated by one of the core issues in modern physics, which is to understand the relationship between the structure of a physical system, e.g. its underlying geometry, and its response to oscillatory stimulus such as light or sound waves.  Perhaps the most fundamental examples of this relationship are the human senses of vision and hearing.  Eyes and ears are receptors for oscillatory signals, and the mind perceives images and sounds only because of the brain's remarkable ability to decode them.   Other cases of the same basic relationship abound, from modern physics experiments involving particle beam collision to medical procedures such as the CAT scan to astronomical phenomena such as red shift.  In all of these situations the observational data consist of oscillatory signals, and mathematical analysis is required to extract information about the underlying structure.  ""Spectral theory"" is the title given to the corresponding field of mathematics.  Expressing these problems in an abstract mathematical setting emphasizes the universality of the fundamental relationship and fosters the cross-fertilization of ideas from different areas.  Advances in abstract spectral theory have led and will continue to lead to applications across a broad range of scientific disciplines.  The PI has written one book and has plans to write others, which will help make the results of this research available to a broad research audience, including both physicists and mathematicians.  The PI currently has two doctoral students."

Boundary value problems in non-smooth domains have received extensive study in the last 30 years. However, very few results are known for elliptic equations and systems with rapidly oscillating periodic coefficients, which arise in the theory of homogenization. The dilation-invariant property of the family of elliptic operators and that of the class of Lipschitz domains make problems to be investigated very interesting and challenging.

A highlight of the project is a summer school for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students. The school will consist of two three-week courses that introduce students to current research techniques in IPDE. Topics will include both theoretical models and numerical tools. These courses will be supplemented by week-long guest lecturers, who will give talks that complement the main topics. The summer school will be coordinated with the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at UW that is run by co-PI James Morrow. The budget includes funding for three UW students to attend the REU program, and for a teaching assistant to offset the increased workload. The IPDE group will additionally institute a Visiting Academic and Industrial Internship Program for its graduate students. Advanced graduate students will be offered the opportunity to work with senior researchers at institutions in the US and abroad. Past IPDE students have profited from such visits to other universities, as well as to research laboratories at Chevron and Lawrence Livermore. RTG funding will allow the IPDE group to systematize this practice and make it available to all IPDE students. A significant portion of the grant is to provide for the support of graduate students and postdoctoral assistants. Funding is included for a total of eight years of postdoctoral fellows at 50% support and for an average of seven graduate students in graduate traineeships each year of the grant. Graduate students will be supported for two quarters of the academic year, as well as for the summer quarter. Postdoctoral fellows will receive their remaining salary through teaching a 50% normal load. Travel funds are included for both graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Undergraduate stipends are also provided to fund undergraduate research projects and internships in local laboratories. The IPDE seminar series will be enhanced through a preseminar series of lectures, and funding is provided for extended visits to the department by seminar speakers.<br/><br/><br/>IPDE is an active field that encompasses research in seismic exploration, medical imaging, and models arising in physical theories. The RTG grant provides significant support for graduate education in this area during a period of reduced local funding for teaching assistant positions. The average of fourteen quarters per year of graduate traineeship support in the budget will allow the department to sustain a vital graduate student population, and provide US citizen and permanent resident IPDE students with release time from teaching duties to devote to research. These graduate students will receive funding under the budgeted Academic and Industrial Internship Program for extended visits to other universities and research laboratories. They will establish contacts with potential employers and build relations with additional academic mentors. These contacts will be created at stages in their careers before they have the responsibilities of academic positions and will assist them throughout their early careers. The funding for postdoctoral associate positions will allow IPDE members to leverage department and college funds to form a viable group of postdoctoral researchers. The 50% teaching load will provide additional time for postdoctoral associates to devote to research; travel funds will allow for visits to other institutions. The summer school will attract advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students from across the country and introduce them to current research topics in the field of IPDE. The department will be able to identify potential students to recruit to its graduate program, and the graduate support funds will allow us to attract top candidates. Support for the REU program will sponsor the participation of three students each year from UW. This program attracts applications nationwide, and there are many more qualified applicants than can be currently funded. A number of strong applicants come through the honors undergraduate courses at UW and will be recruited for the REU program. Funding for an additional TA position to assist with running the REU will benefit all participants and provide an advanced undergraduate or graduate student with support during the summer. The collective activities of the RTG grant will strengthen the IPDE program at UW at all career levels, and introduce students nationwide to this important area of research."

The core of this proposal addresses three questions. The first one aims to understand domains in higher dimensional Euclidean spaces in terms of their harmonic measure as it has been done in 2 dimensions with great success. The underlying thesis is that in higher dimensions GMT plays the role that complex analysis does in 2 dimensions. The second question is that of the existence and regularity of minimizers for variational problems stated in terms of H\""older continuous metrics rather than smooth metrics. This problem includes the understanding of the structure of the corresponding free boundary.  A by-product of this, is a question concerning the regularity of quasi-minimizers of the functional studied by Alt and Caffarelli. The third question goes back to a long term interest of the PI concerning the existence of good parameterization for subsets of Euclidean space. A remarkable feature is that this last project, which is purely in geometry, was motivated by an attempt to answer a question in potential theory. <br/>The cross-pollenization between harmonic analysis and GMT has been clearly beneficial to both areas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The theory of calculus of variations has been the main theoretical tool used in the study of variational problems often concerning energy minimization.  Energy minimization methods are used to understand the equilibrium configuration of molecules. The basic idea is that a stable state of a molecular system should correspond to a local minimum of their potential energy. The proposed research provides new outlets for GMT, a field of Mathematics that has contributed greatly to the development of the calculus of variations and geometric analysis. The transformative aspect of this grant is the invigoration of this fundamental area of Mathematics. In the last few years, the number of students going into GMT in the US, has greatly diminished while it has increased in Europe. An important feature of the proposed work is that, while some results have already been obtained, there is great potential for expansion. In particular, we expect the active participation of graduate students and junior mathematicians. The field, which has been one of the pillars upon of which some areas of geometric analysis have been built, offers the theoretical framework to study a wide array of variational problems coming from different venues of science."

The Loewner equation has as input an arbitrary continuous function and produces a continuous family of conformal mappings. Marshall plans to investigate properties of the solutions of Loewner's equation under various assumptions on the driving function, and conversely to investigate how properties of the boundaries of the associated regions are reflected in the driving function. This is a classical problem where progress has been made only recently. The Loewner equation is also related to an algorithm for numerical conformal mapping discovered by Marshall and K\""uhnau.  Marshall will analyze convergence and error-estimates for the ""zipper""' algorithm and improve the speed of convergence using ""generational""' techniques. <br/><br/>Conformal mappings have been used as a tool in science and engineering for many years. They are often used to change coordinates from a complicated region to a simpler region like a disc. A partial differential equation on the complicated region is then changed to a similar equation on the disc, a setting where it is easier to solve. Classically, this method was used for problems related to Laplace's equation, such as electrostatics and two dimensional fluid flow.  Numerous non-classical applications have been developed in the last three decades such as electro-magnetics, vibrating membranes and acoustics, transverse vibrations and buckling of plates, elasticity, and heat transfer.  The Loewner differential equation was introduced in 1923 to study extremal problems for conformal maps in the unit disc. Schramm's recently invention of stochastic Loewner evolution SLE, the fusion of Loewner's differential equation and probability, has formed a bridge between the important areas of conformal mapping in mathematics and conformal field theory in physics. It has led to the discovery of new results in percolation and random walks, for example, as well as the discovery mathematical proofs of results known to the theoretical physics community.  This project is likely to increase the understanding of solutions to Loewner's equation, as foundational work, which should increase its usefulness in understanding stochastic processes. Broader impacts include the continued improvement and dissemination of the conformal mapping computer codes, which have been used by a number of investigators not in mathematics, as well as by mathematicians. Greater speed and new knowledge of convergence should lead to wider applicability and use of this algorithm. The mentoring of postdoctoral scholars and graduate students through our complex analysis  ""working seminar"", has supported the work of several women. Support of our research increases the number of students interested in pursuing a career in this direction."

(1) The infinity Laplacian operator arises from minimizing the L-infinity norm of the gradient and a two person differential game called ?tug-of-war?. The PI intends to solve several problems from the?tug-of-war? game. One of the important questions is to see how we can use the game theory interpretation to understand more about the infinity Laplacian equation, a highly degenerate nonlinear elliptic equation. The PI also intends to characterize asymptotic behaviors of principle eigenfunctions of p-Laplacian operators as p goes to infinity.  Other problems concern properties of classical solutions of the infinity Lapalcian equation and uniqueness of absolute minimizers from minimizing more general norms of the gradient. (2) The aim of the weak KAM theory is to use pde approaches to study the Aubry-Mather theory. Our major goal here is to find a variational method to identify the Aubry set. (3) It was known that generalized solutions of Monge-Ampere equations from the optimal mass transfer problems might have singularities. The PI plans to use some tools developed with P.  Cannarsa to explore the regularity of the set of singularities. (1) Equations involving the infinity Laplacian operator are very different from elliptic PDEs that people knew before. On one hand, they are second order. On the other hand, the infinity Laplacian operator is so degenerate that those equations sometimes behave as first order PDEs, for example, their solutions even possess some sort of characteristics.  Proposed problems in this topic require new methods and ideas which will enhance people's knowledge of elliptic PDEs. Beside its extreme mathematical interest, the infinity Laplacian operator also has important applications in practical issues, for example, to restore images with poor dynamical range, to determine the optimal strategy in the tug-of-war game which is applicable to economic and political modeling, etc. (2) Very little has been known about the structure of the Aubry-Mather set when the dimension is bigger than two. The research proposed in the weak KAM theory part may provide a numerical method to approximate the Aubry set. (3) Monge-Ampere equations from optimal transfer problems have interesting applications in meteorology. The semigeostrophic equations from meteorology can be formulated as a coupled Monge-Ampere/transport problem. The results about the set of singularities of generalized solutions of the Monge-Ampere equation should help people understand how fronts arise in large scale weather pattern."

The first part of the project deals with hyperbolic sets generated by a conservative homoclinic bifurcation. These hyperbolic sets have large Hausdorff dimension, and that leads to a series of applications. In particular, this phenomenon can be applied to study the oscillatory motions in the three-body problem. A motion in a three-body problem is called ""oscillatory"" if for an unbounded increasing sequence of times the diameter of the system appears as bounded, while for another unbounded sequence of times the diameter of the system goes to infinity. Oscillatory motions are directly related to homoclinic pictures and invariant hyperbolic sets. The goal of this part of the project is to demonstrate the existence of homoclinic bifurcations in some restricted versions of the three-body problem and to show that the set of oscillatory motions has full Hausdorff dimension for many parameter values. Another part of the project is an application of the theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems to spectral theory. Namely, using the hyperbolicity of the so-called trace map and estimating some quantitative characteristics of its invariant sets, one can derive new properties of the spectrum of the discrete Schrodinger operator with Fibonacci potential. That will provide new insights on the properties of quasicrystals. <br/><br/>Many of the problems considered in the project were initially formulated by physicists, and results may have applications to the theory of quasicrystals,  to comet dynamics within the solar system, and to a number of other problems in physics, chemistry, and astronomy.  Various problems closely related to the project will be suggested to graduate and undergraduate students at UC-Irvine, thereby initiating them into or increasing their involvement in scientific activities. The principal investigator considers such educational and training aspects to be central to the project."

The Cauchy-Riemann equations are the fundamental differential equations in several complex variables, and their study involves tools from potential theory, complex geometry, and boundary value problems in partial differential equations.  This project will address qualitative questions, such as compactness for the solution operator, and quantitative questions, such as regularity in Sobolev spaces.  Much is known about these questions when the boundary is smooth (although many open problems remain), so this project will focus on the behavior of the solution near corners.<br/><br/><br/>Because so many phenomena in modern physics are best described using the language of complex analysis, the Cauchy-Riemann equations are a crucial tool for mathematical physics.  In addition to physical applications, they are also significant as models of partial differential equations which behave with great regularity in the interior of a domain but lose regularity at the boundary.  Hence, results for the Cauchy-Riemann equations provide a natural starting place for a much larger class of equations with even greater applicability.  These equations have been studied extensively when the boundary of a domain is smooth, but in mathematics as in the physical world, many domains have corners, so it is important to understand how the properties of a solution change near the corners of a non-smooth domain.  Because these problems are related to harmonic analysis, complex geometry, partial differential equations, and mathematical physics, the potential for collaboration is high."

These are smooth systems characterized by exponential expansion in some directions and exponential contraction in the other directions. Stability, rigidity, and classification of hyperbolic systems are among the central issues in smooth dynamics. These problems have been extensively studied, and many of them were solved for systems with one-dimensional invariant foliations. The situation is much more complicated for systems with higher-dimensional foliations. The main part of the proposed research is to study higher-dimensional hyperbolic systems. The principal investigator is particularly interested in properties related to local rigidity (i.e., regularity of conjugacy under a small perturbation) and global rigidity (i.e., existence of a smooth conjugacy to an algebraic model). Investigating properties of invariant foliations and geometric structures plays an important part in the proposed research.<br/><br/>The field of dynamical systems is a modern branch of mathematics that grew out of the study of physical and mechanical problems.

So-called hyperbolic systems have been one of the main objects of study in what is known as ""smooth"" dynamics. The exponential contraction and expansion in these systems produce chaotic behavior with complex orbit structure. This results in a rich theory with applications in various areas of applied and pure mathematics, including geometry and number theory.

For example, Elliott's classification program took a dramatic turn when counterexamples were constructed by Rordam and Toms.  However, recent work of Winter strongly suggests that the classification of algebras which are ""finite dimensional"" (in a suitable noncommutative topological sense) should be classifiable.  We will investigate the classification problem for these algebras, but utilizing a different invariant  -- one that turns out to be functorially equivalent to the classical Elliott invariant, but formally carries much more information.  In a W*-direction, we will continue our study of topological spaces associated to II_1 factors which admit microstates (in the sense of Voiculescu).  These topological invariants haven't yet been systematically investigated, so it's quite natural to explore them. <br/><br/>One very successful idea in mathematics is that we can learn about complicated objects by approximating with simpler objects, then passing to a limit. For example, in calculus we compute the area under a curve using rectangular approximations, then refining the approximations over and over. Operator algebras are (usually) infinite dimensional objects which provide the natural framework for quantum mechanics, for example. Moreover, deep and unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics such as geometry, topology and probability were discovered over the years. As such, a solid understanding of the structure of operator algebras is important. The general philosophy of using approximations by simpler objects becomes especially relevant here since the objects of interest are infinite dimensional. The investigator will continue an established tradition of trying to use finite dimensional approximations to better understand some fundamental infinite dimensional objects."

The core of the project is a precise description of boundary value problems at the singular locus and the investigation of well-posedness under suitable ellipticity conditions. As a direct application of the theory, the project will study natural elliptic complexes such as the Dolbeault complex of a compact analytic variety whose singular locus is smooth. The principal investigators expect that the techniques to be developed here will also increase our understanding of the Dolbeault complex in the case of more general singularities. The project will pave the way for a spectral analysis (resolvents, zeta functions, etc.) of elliptic operators associated with incomplete wedge geometries. In the context of complex analysis, the project has the potential to shed some light on the study of the cohomology in more general classes of compact analytic varieties. <br/><br/>The theory to be developed will provide a theoretical underpinning for the analysis of applied problems in engineering, mathematical physics, and quantum chemistry.

Dynamical entropy theory began with the work of Kolmogorov (1958) who used it <br/>to study actions of the group of integers. In the seventies and eighties, entropy theory was extended first to actions of the integer lattice, and then to actions of amenable groups. Until winter 2007-2008, none of the basic results of entropy theory had been extended to any non-amenable group. Then, the PI discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups is not widely known, but it contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all amenable groups and all linear groups. This was used to solve a long-standing open problem: the classication of Bernoulli shifts over a free group up to measure-conjugacy. After Kolmogorov's initial work, the next major development was Ornstein's creation of a powerful machine, based on entropy, for determining whether two given actions of the integers are measurably-conjugate. This was extended to amenable groups (Ornstein-Weiss) but no comparable theory exists for nonamenable groups. A major research goal of this proposal is to fill this gap by taking advantage of the new entropy theory. In the special case of free group actions, there are close connections to probabilistic combinatorics (especially random regular graphs) and statistical physics models that the PI intends to exploit for the benefit of all three subjects. <br/><br/>The PI plans to hold a workshop at the University of Hawai'i, MAanoa focussed around classication problems in ergodic theory and dynamical systems. This workshop will support the intellectual goals of this proposal, disseminate the most current research ideas in the field and introduce these topics to young researchers and students. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the mathematical community to encourage the diverse student population of the university, especially the native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders. This proposal provides directly for the training of a graduate student. It should be particularly easy to attract one because the new entropy theory requires very little background and provides ample unexplored open problems that could have signicant impact in ergodic theory and other areas.<br/>"

The PI and G. Neumann proved a conjecture by the astrophysicist S. Rhie that this number depends linearly, rather than quadratically; on n. (This result reduces substantially the number of relevant calculations for large n.) The PI, jointly with his student E. Lundberg, is planning to extend these ideas to a more realistic situation when the lensing effect is produced by an elliptical galaxy with an isothermal mass distribution of gas. Another main theme of this project develops further recent results of the PI obtained jointly with Bell, Ebenfelt and Shapiro, and, more recently, by the PI's student Lundberg, dealing with algebraic properties of solutions of the boundary value problems in potential theory. One of the main novel tools being developed in the project is the extension to the complex space of a notion of a ""lightning bolt"" pioneered by Arnold and Kolmogorov in the 1950s in their solution of the 13th Hilbert problem on superpositions of functions. Complex lightning bolts turn out to be precisely the obstacles preventing global analytic continuation of harmonic functions in two-dimensional complex space.

The PI is continuing popularization of some aspects of his research and is planning several articles directed at a wide audience.

The PI continues his fruitful collaborations on some parts of the project with researchers from underrepresented groups. The PI is also actively involved at various levels in organizing multiple events (conferences, workshops, etc.), on the research topics discussed in the proposal and in bringing together mathematicians and physicists in order to uphold the strong momentum of collaboration on several problems in this project."

Variational inequalities provide an effective means to <br/>derive properties of solutions of evolution equations and likewise, evolution equations can be used to derive variational inequalities. Exploiting this interplay has been very fruitful in the past, and the investigators plan to approach various problems using this perspective. One is to find correction terms of various examples of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality by exploiting a surprising connection to the porous medium equation and to the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. In particular, a correction term for the logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality will lead to an improved understanding of the solutions of the Keller-Segel model describing the chemotaxis of certain bacteria. A similar philosophy applies as well to certain problems in kinetic theory, with the plan to derive quantitative estimates on speed of approach to equilibrium for some inhomogeneous master equations of Kac type. These investigations tie in with analogous questions in quantum mechanics. Here the PI's plan to prove hypercontractivity estimates for Lindblad operators that describe dissipative quantum mechanical systems, with the aim to obtain quantitative estimates on the speed of approach to equilibrium as well. Another circle of problems is proving Lifshitz tails in the random displacement model. The aim there is to understand the conductivity properties of materials. <br/><br/>Many phenomena in science and technology can be modeled by evolution equations. An interesting example, treated in this proposal, is the Keller Segal model, that models the aggregation, or the absence thereof, in the motion of bacteria. Understanding the behavior of solutions of these equations is both biologically and mathematically interesting. Likewise, it is widely observed thatn systems of many interacting particles, either classical or quantum mechanical, evolve toward an equilibrium, and they do this at a certain speed, often largely independent of the number of particles. Understanding this, and determining this speed is one of the objects of this research. Another question of great interest is what distinguishes a conductor from an insulator. There are simple models in quantum mechanics that are supposed to exhibit these kind of behavior. While it is impossible to understand these phenomena by exact computations, using mathematical techniques notably from analysis, the PI's aim to understand these processes better. Conversely, applied problems, e.g., the porous medium equations that describes the seepage of water in dams, can be used to find interesting mathematical facts, which in turn lead to improved understanding of other problems. It is this interplay of pure and applied mathematics that is the focus of the PI's research and it has been an excellent way to educate graduate students as well as undergraduates, and to draw them into mathematical research. <br/> <br/>"

The PI considers the nonlinear Schroedinger equation on one and three dimensions. For attractive nonlinearities localized in space solutions may exist, which can then move without dispersion,  until they are perturbed. These class of equations play now a a critical role in describing optical devices, Bose-Einstein condensate fluids and other nonlinear dispersive problems in fluid dynamics and plasma physics. The equations being nonlinear, requires new techniques to understand the large time behavior of the solutions of this class of equations.  Using the hydrodynamic formulation of Schroedinger equation it was possible to analyze in detail a completely new type of situations, in which a soliton solution is created through tunneling from a potential well. The prediction and the details of this soliton formation will be further studied. In particular, the method offers a new way of proving a-priori estimates on the solutions of nonlinear Schrodinger equation which are  not of the standard energy estimates. A second part of the research involves the detailed decay in time of solutions of the wave equation on Schwarzschild and Kerr manifolds. In particular the decay rates as a function of the angular  momentum of the initial data is pursued. This will provide a rigorous proof of a classical conjecture of  Price in the theory of General Relativity.<br/><br/><br/>New processes involving optical devices are studied in detail. In particular one considers a situation in which light energy is located in a potential well, inside a properly active dielectric material. Then, the development of the localized energy is derived by a new mathematical  formalism adapted to this situation. It is shown that soliton waves can emerge from the well, and the theory is capable of determining their size and speed. As such, it allows, by tuning the shape of the potential well and the incoming energy to produce solitons with desired profile, sometimes referred to as soliton guns. This approach has already been observed in some experiments based on previous works by the PI. A second part of the research is the mathematical analysis of wave propagation and decay on manifolds generated by black holes. The approach to this problem led a to a new, more general theory of solving integral equations of the Voltera type, and also led  to a rigorous mathematical verification of some classical conjectures in the physics literature concerning the behavior of radiated waves off a black hole."

These problems have been chosen because they are not technical and confined to narrow areas but are interdisciplinary in spirit. For example, the problems on composite materials are derived from engineering questions. As the principal investigator has done in the past and expects to continue to do now, he will rely for the resolution of these problems on techniques and tools from several areas of mathematics (e.g., partial differential equations, geometry, the calculus of variations, mathematical physics). Some of the problems under investigation are also amenable to numerical simulation. This, the principal investigator hopes, will provide additional insight.<br/><br/>The chief impact of this project on areas outside of mathematics lies in the set of problems that focus on the design of composite materials. Lightweight and strong composites are playing increasingly important roles in fields such as aerospace engineering, medicine, etc. Theoretical studies like those to be undertaken in this project, in which one tries to maximize rigidity, should furnish valuable insight into the fabrication of such smart materials. There could, of course, be other areas of application. For instance, a survey of the literature reveals that the principal investigator's earlier work on composites has found use in ecological studies."

The basic question to be addressed is how positive solutions reflect   the symmetry of the  equation.  For  elliptic equations,  there  are  classical  theorems on  symmetry  of  positive solutions  and some  motivations  for symmetry  problems in  parabolic equations  stem from  these  theorems (when  viewing  solutions of  an elliptic  equation as  steady  states of  the corresponding  parabolic equation).  Other very interesting and challenging symmetry problems are specific to parabolic equations. Such are, for example, problems concerning the asymptotic symmetry of positive solutions as time approaches infinity. The principal investigator will continue his research in this area with the goal of obtaining a better understanding of the manner in which positive solutions approach the space of symmetric functions.  Results in this vein would be instrumental in using the asymptotic symmetry of solutions to study their temporal behavior.  The principal investigator will also continue his research concerning parabolic Liouville theorems.  Such  theorems state  that certain  very  specific parabolic  equations  do  not have  nontrivial solutions  in a class  of admissible  functions.  Liouville theorems, when available, are very powerful tools for the qualitative analysis of parabolic equations.  In combination with scaling arguments, they can be used, among other things, for the derivation of a priori estimates and for establishing blow-up and decay rates of solutions. The goal  of this project   is  to prove  new  Liouville   theorems  and   pursue further applications  of Liouville  theorems in  various classes  of nonlinear parabolic  problems. Liouville theorems, as well as results on symmetry of solutions, will play important roles in another part of the project, which concerns threshold solutions. Such  solutions appear as separatrices  between  solutions  exhibiting  two different  kinds  of behavior, such  as the decay  to zero and  blow up in finite  time, or decay to zero and locally uniform convergence to a positive steady state. Solutions of this type are  studied, for example,  in   connection  with  quenching  and  propagation phenomena in  models from  combustion theory and  population genetics. Up to now, existing theorems mostly treated one-dimensional equations or problems with a variational structure, thus excluding important equations  that  involve   advection   terms   or explicit   time dependence. The project will focus on these nonvariational problems.    <br/><br/>In less technical terms, the project can be characterized as qualitative or geometric analysis of solutions of a certain type of nonlinear evolution equations. Such equations are widely used in models in applied sciences, in particular, chemical engineering, combustion theory, and ecology. Understanding qualitative properties of solutions is important for the internal development of the mathematical theory of partial differential equations as well as for improvement of their modeling relevance.  The present project addresses questions that concern geometric properties of solutions (such as their symmetries when viewed as functions of spatial variables), as well as their behavior with respect to time (periodicity properties, stabilization to equilibria, blow up in finite time). Development of new mathematical techniques for addressing such questions is an integral part of the project."

The principal investigator is interested in the existence and regularity theory for such problems, and special attention will be paid to investigating the asymptotic behavior of the solutions (such as the long-time behavior and  homogenization limits). Another direction of research concerns nonlocal elliptic and parabolic equations, mainly equations involving fractional Laplace operators. In particular, the project will investigate the effects of the nonlocality of these differential operators on well-known phenomena such as front propagation and homogenization. Finally, part of this project is devoted to certain nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations of third and fourth order. The analysis of such equations is still poorly understood, mainly because of the lack of a maximum principle and other basic properties that their second-order counterparts possess. Developing existence and uniqueness theories for such equations will be one of the main challenges of the project.<br/><br/>Nonlinear partial differential equations have applications in physics, biology, economics, engineering, and other areas of science. Free boundary problems, for instance, typically arise in the modeling of physical phenomena that involve interfaces (between two materials) that are changing with time (a good example is the study of the melting of a block of ice). Some free boundary problems discussed in this proposal turn up in the modeling of gas combustion and in the study of fluid flow. A better understanding of the effects of small inhomogeneities in the properties of the medium (for instance, impurities in the ice) is the goal of the ""homogenization theory"" mentioned earlier. Ultimately, this theory will allow the development of more accurate models to describe a great variety of phenomena. Nonlocal diffusion equations are another type of equation that are  commonly used to model a broad range of phenomenon. The principal investigator proposes a new approach to deriving these equations using so-called microscopic (kinetic) models, for which the parameters can be easily related to simple physical quantities. This will lead to better accuracy in the models used by physical scientists. Finally, applications of higher order elliptic and parabolic equations are also numerous. The equations discussed in this proposal have some applications to the modeling of hydraulic fractures (which are used, for example, to propagate rock fractures in oil and gas reservoirs so as to enhance oil recovery) and to the study of biological membranes."

Part one concerns multi-parameter Fourier analysis, the higher dimensional (or product) theory with origins in the theory of several complex variables, convergence of multiple Fourier series and analysis on symmetric spaces. Some of the modern questions proposed here are related to singular integrals, Hardy spaces, averaging, bilinear operators, and reach into probability theory through multi-parameter martingales, and higher dimensional Brownian sheets. Part two of this proposal concerns the theory of second order elliptic partial differential equations, in both divergence and non-divergence form.  The questions are mainly centered on the fine properties of the elliptic measure associated with the solvability of boundary value problems and are posed in two settings: when the operator itself has non-smooth coefficients,  or for smooth operators in domains whose boundary  is less regular yet satisfies some geometric conditions (Lipschitz, chord-arc, Reifenberg flat, for example).<br/><br/>In 1811, Joseph Fourier proposed a mathematical theory of heat which took the point of view that heat was a ``flow"" and should be described by differential equations. This was the starting point of the theory now called Fourier analysis, a field which has an impact on every area of mathematics and the physical sciences.  In this proposal, we consider some basic open problems related to such differential equations, and try to understand how their solutions depend on boundary conditions. Solving these problems may lead to a better understanding of how to obtain approximations to solutions (using computational tools) when it is impossible to write down a formula which describes them exactly.  This grant will partially support graduate students and undergraduates in this field by providing them the opportunity to do research in this area (individually and in teams) and to travel to conferences where they can present their own results."

The Johns Hopkins Mathematics Department has cooperated fruitfully, since 1988 with JAMI to foster collaboration in mathematical research through broadly based programs in mathematics and to promote in general, interaction among mathematicians. This program  plans to investigate, with the organization of several mini-courses, lecture series, seminars, a proceedings book and a final conference on March 2009 a number of topics pertaining to the rich interconnection between the fields of Noncommutative Geometry, Number Theory and Mathematical Physics. The interaction between the aforementioned fields is a quite new area of mathematics, which has matured rapidly in the past few years and has produced very exciting results. It seems very timely at this point to organize an extended program on these topics with the aim to pursue a wider exploration of this area of research and also with the goal to analyze the major advances that have been obtained in Noncommutative Geometry in the recent past. In view of very recent developments obtained as a joint project by the PI's, particular attention will be given, during the whole program and at the final conference, to the topic ``Noncommutative geometry, the Riemann zeta-function, motives and the field with one element.'' In the weekly NCGA seminars (noncommutative geometry and arithmetic seminars) and at the final conference main emphasis will be given to describe the link that has recently emerged connecting a well-known quantum statistical dynamical system in noncommutative geometry (the BC-system), the corresponding noncommutative motive (BC-endomotive) and a newly developed algebraic-geometric theory of schemes  over the absolute point.<br/><br/>The direct impact of NSF funding is that of supporting and training  a significant number of junior U.S. researchers (junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students), who will gain the opportunity to participate in the program. Mentoring and training of junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students is a central part of every JAMI program, as is helping these individuals develop networks that include the world's leading researchers. To accomplish this, the PI's have  recruited a broad and diverse participant group, paying particular attention to women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. In light of several very recent results, which reveal surprising new connections between the fields of Number Theory and Noncommutative Geometry,  the PIs  expect that the research broadcast by this program will have a major impact on the development of these fields, under a unified methodology. The rapidly increasing interest in the area of ``Noncommutative Arithmetic Geometry'' has led the PI's to the organization of several recent workshops, which generated collaborative work between theoretical mathematicians and physicists and have attracted the interest of an impressive number of  graduate students and young researchers across different fields.<br/>"

First, the PI will continue her study of the Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) equation, and address questions related to generalized orbits and multi-Hamiltonian structures for the finite system, as well as their connection to the analogous Toda lattice problems. She is also interested in finding the solution of AL with periodic boundary conditions, and in the study of critical phenomena for the NLS equation, viewed as a continuum limit of the AL equation. Second, building on her work on matrix models for general beta-ensembles, the PI plans to investigate the asymptotic properties of these models via the approach of Adler and van Moerbeke. This describes various eigenvalue statistics of the model as solutions of completely integrable systems; so far, only the cases with beta equal to 1, 2 or 4 have been studied, and general beta-ensembles have never been used in this context. Finally, the PI plans to investigate, jointly with P. Deift, the question of long-time asymptotics for solutions of the water-wave problem with rough data, in the small amplitude/long wavelength regime. In their investigation, they will treat the problem as a perturbation of a completely integrable PDE, the KdV equation, and use the associated scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert techniques to control the perturbation. In particular, a first step in this project is the rigorous treatment of the long-time asymptotics for the KdV equation with Sobolev initial data. <br/><br/>The research described in this proposal concerns classical problems in two of the most active fields in mathematics, random matrix theory and integrable systems. One of the most fascinating scientific developments over the last fifty years has been the discovery that a wide variety of mathematical and physical phenomena are modeled by the eigenvalues of a random matrix. In particular, random matrix theory describes the scattering of neutrons off large nuclei, the statistics of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line in the complex plane, as well as problems in the ""real world"", such as the bus scheduling in the city of Cavalierness in Mexico, or distances between cars on the freeway. The goal of the PI's proposed research is to describe the asymptotic properties of certain matrix ensembles which model some of the phenomena described above. Another part of the proposal is concerned with studying the properties of two remarkable evolution equations: The first is the Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) equation, which is a discrete version of the well-known nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS). Beyond their theoretical interest, both of the aforementioned equations have numerous scientific applications, one of the most important of which is in optics. The PI approaches the study of the AL equation using the methods from the theories of orthogonal polynomials and completely integrable systems. Finally, the PI proposes to study the water wave equation in a regime which can be used to model tsunamis, by further developing the method of nonlinear stationary phase used in the treatment of Riemann-Hilbert problems. <br/>"

Firstly, he intends to further elaborate on the structure theory of large Polish group and, in particular, automorphism groups of countable first order structures. The PI's main <br/>interest in this domain is the existence of generic representations of countable discrete groups in such automorphism groups and its uses in investigating the dynamics and algebraic structure of the automorphism group. <br/>Secondly, the PI will be working on the classical problem of J.P.R. Christensen <br/>of whether any universally measurable homomorphism between Polish groups is continuous. Again, this problem is tightly connected with the geometry and dynamical properties of Polish groups and very likely to leads to new techniques and concepts of value outside of the study of automatic continuity. <br/>Finally, Rosendal will be continuing his collaboration with V. Ferenczi on the <br/>rough classification of separable Banach spaces, a programme initiated by W. T. Gowers in the course of the solution to the homogeneous space problem. This programme heavily relies on Ramsey theoretical and game theoretical methods from descriptive set theory and thus enriches both descriptive set theory by developing new techniques and functional analysis by contributing to one of the most central problems of Banach space theory. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In recent years, there has been a growing collaboration and sharing of ideas between researchers working in dynamical systems and descriptive set theory. Initially, this was largely fostered by work on Borel equivalence relations but has lately also come to include topological dynamics. The principal objectives of descriptive set theory consists in studying the definable subsets of the real line, showing that these are much better behaved than arbitrary subsets. This has developed into a large structure theory of such sets which gives a solid framework within which most of mathematical analysis takes place, and as such, the use of descriptive set theoretical techniques in parts of functional analysis is continuously expanding.<br/><br/>"

A nice feature of the Wasserstein space approach is its ability to handle singular data and singular solutions. In addition, there is also a possibility of handling discrete and continuous models with the same formalism. The core of this program lies in the development of an appropriate theory for calculus of variations and Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the Wasserstein space. In this project, the principal investigator will investigate the following topics: minimizing the action functional for certain physically meaningful Lagrangians defined on the set of absolutely continuous paths in the Wasserstein space of probability measures; existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the Wasserstein space; and homogenization of these Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Some of the most challenging aspects to these problems are the lack of local compactness in the space of probability measures and the presence of strong singularities in the Lagrangians and Hamiltonians.<br/><br/>Calculus of variations and Hamilton-Jacobi equations play a central role in many areas of sciences including physics, economics, and engineering. In particular, they are the main object of study in classical mechanics. It is expected that the properties of solutions of the variational problems and the Hamilton-Jacobi equations to be studied in this project will provide a significant step in understanding the dynamics of some infinite-dimensional dynamical systems arising in fluid and quantum mechanics. The principal investigator's Wasserstein formalism approach is also expected to give a unifying framework in which both classical and quantum behavior of particles can be described. The proposed activity will provide a fruitful interaction with some other disciplines of theoretical and applied mathematics such as optimal mass transportation, hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, probability theory, and infinite-dimensional optimal control theory."

New techniques have emerged for studying the dynamics of solitons and finite-time blow-up solutions, such as local virial estimates, new Lyapunov functionals, and concentration compactness machinery.  The principal investigator will seek to implement and develop these techniques further in the investigation of several scientifically relevant problems.  The dynamics of solitary waves in the presence of an external potential or under the influence of a time-dependent nonlinear coefficient for single and multiple bright and dark solitons will be considered. The ability of a strong confining potential in one direction to produce an effective reduction in dimensionality will be explored. New criteria on initial data for predicting finite-time blow-up of solutions will be developed, and the PI will seek to construct new types of singular ring blow-up solutions recently observed numerically. Long-time behavior of global solutions will also be studied.<br/><br/>The equations studied in this project arise as important physical models.  Solitons appear as well-localized stable structures, while blow-up is associated with a sharp focusing of a wave and ultimate break-down of the physical model.  For example, the nonlinear Schroedinger equation is the wave function for a collection of ultracold atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate.  Since its Nobel-prize winning realization in the laboratory in 1995, further experiments have produced solitons and finite-time blow-up, and there is now a large body of physics literature motivating many of the problems the principal investigator intends to consider.  The problems proposed bring together physicists, numerical analysts, and pure mathematicians. They also serve as an excellent educational tool, since they can be tailored to students at the undergraduate and graduate level.  To stimulate interest among such students, the principal investigator will give talks in the undergraduate seminar and teach an advanced topics course at Brown University.  Web demonstrations of this research could be produced, for example, through a summer undergraduate project funded by this grant.<br/>"

The first problem concerns optimal decay estimates for oscillatory integral operators in two dimensions. In the second, degenerate versions of the Carleson-Sjolin estimates will be pursued. The third project involves a linearized inverse problem for wave equations arising in seismic imaging which leads to analysis and composition of degenerate Fourier integral operators. Finally, analysis on singular spaces will be used to understand the theoretical limits to cloaking and other transformation optics designs.<br/><br/>Progress on these problems will add to the understanding of partial differential equations, the operators which are used to solve them, and the behavior of their solutions. Many laws of nature are expressed as partial differential equations, which govern physical quantities of interest, such as electromagnetic field strength,  pressure exerted by acoustic waves or the quantum-mechanical probability that a particle will be found in a particular place. The techniques to be developed in this project are applicable to equations that govern various kinds of wave propagation and are based on a geometric point of view in understanding and manipulating the singularities which are present. In particular, the third project has the potential to facilitate seismic exploration in situations where images are distorted by the presence of multiple rays connecting seismic source to receiver. The fourth project concerns theoretical underpinnings of the recently emergent field of transformation optics, which has the potential to produce unusual effects on various kinds of waves (e.g., electromagnetic, acoustic, quantum mechanical) using artificially structured materials known as metamaterials.<br/><br/>"

The PI will establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Schur-class function with a prescribed jet (finite or infinite) of values for boundary derivatives at a given point on the unit circle.  The main difficulty here is that in a generic case, the data set does not satisfy positivity conditions which are needed to apply the existing function- and operator-theoretic interpolation methods to full extent.  These methods will be supplemented and combined with explicit constructions from geometric function theory. The project will also include implementable algorithms for constructing rational Schur-class functions of the minimally possible MacMillan degree with finitely many prescribed Taylor coefficients at a given boundary point.  The construction will be used to study spectral theory of Fredholm operators in algebras generated by the shift operator and the composition operator with a Schur-class symbol.  Another application will be found in complex dynamics: a similar construction carried out for positive real functions will eventually produce a one-parametric semigroup of composition operators with prescribed boundary behavior near the boundary Denjoy-Wolff point.  The scalar-valued single-variable results will be extended in the following four directions: (1) to the multi-point case where the jets of boundary derivatives for the unknown interpolant are prescribed at finitely or countably many points on the unit circle; (2) to operator-valued Schur-class functions, whose values are contractive operators mapping one Hilbert space into another; (3) to meromorphic functions with the boundary values essentially bounded by one on the unit circle; (4) to various multivariable extensions of the Schur class including in particular, Schur-Agler functions of the polydisk and contractive multipliers of the Drury-Arveson space.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses the problems in the norm-constrained interpolation theory which has traditional connections with control theory, system theory, and signal and image processing.  Besides obtaining concrete results, the objective of this research is to advance the understanding of the interaction of operator theory and complex function theory in the present boundary framework.  The multivariable case is still much less studied and therefore, is of particular interest.  To study this case, the functional-model canonical realizations for Schur-Agler functions will be constructed, which in turn will establish the bridge to multivariable system theory as well as to model theory for various tuples of Hilbert space operators.  The results obtained in this project will be published in scientific journals and reported at research conferences.  The project contains several problems reserved for undergraduate students who will be engaged in intensive research by the PI."

The study of operator algebras is often viewed as the study of ""non-commutative measure theory"" or ?non-commutative geometry?. Over the last seventy years, this has turned out to be a rich and fertile field of study. Non-commutative probability theory (or free probability theory) in the context of non-commutative measure spaces was developed by D. Voiculescu in the 1980's. Several important problems in the area of operator algebras were solved by the tools from non-commutative probability theory. In this project, the PI wishes to further develop free probability theory; with a view to attacking other problems in the area of operator algebras. In particular, he will study Voiculescu?s topological free entropy theory for unital C*-algebras; to search  C*-algebras whose BDF-extension semigroups are not groups; to compute Voiculescu?s free entropy dimension for more finite von Neumann algebras; and to study the generator problems for von Neumann algebras.<br/><br/><br/>The theory of operator algebras was introduced to obtain a more rigorous mathematical formulation of the basics of quantum mechanics. From a probabilistic point view, free probability theory has surprising applications in the area of operator algebras. This project aims to develop new tools in free probability theory aiming at problems in the area operator algebras. The solutions to these problems will provide us with new ways to classify von Neumann algebras and C* algebras. The significance of the project lies in the fact that new developments in the theory of free probability and operator algebras have always had profound applications to several fields in mathematics and physics such as statistics and quantum mechanics. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activities: The project is the continuation of principal investigator's prior work in free probability theory, in BDF-extension semigroups, and in generator problem of von Neumann algebras. Broader Impact of the Proposed Activities: The project will take place at a location that strengthens the broader impacts of research development in the University of New Hampshire.

The geometric function theory, whose goal is to obtain qualitative characteristics of investigated objects when quantitative approach fails, is represented by several topics. (1) Studies of quotients of holomorphic loop spaces on complex manifolds, which are responsible for several intrinsic properties of the manifolds.  Introducing different equivalence relations it is possible to construct objects ranging from holomorphic fundamental groups similar to classical fundamental groups to expansions of complex manifolds, where all holomorphic and plurisubharmonic functions can be extended. The initial work in this direction has shown an interesting mixture of analysis, geometry and topology. (2) Pluripotential theory on compact sets. In this setting such major tool as the Monge-Ampere equation does not work, while many classical questions have a natural reduction to the compact case. In particular, it is a problem of the existence of pluriharmonic fibrations of maximal plurisubharmonic functions. Since it is known that, in general, fibrations by complex curves do not exist, the PI will look for fibrations by compact sets such that the restrictions of a maximal plurisubharmonic function to these sets are pluriharmonic. (3) The theory of Hardy and Bergman spaces on hyperconvex domains. This is another topic that can be approached by geometric methods. Here the primary goal is the connection of the Poisson kernels with the geometry of the domains and applications to composition operators. As applications of the geometric function theory the PI is going to study such related subject as: uniform algebras, algebraic dependence of entire functions and approximation theory.<br/><br/>If the major advances in mathematics achieved in 19th and 20th centuries were due to our better quantitative skills, the modern mathematics became too complicated to be described by formulas. For example, such important objects as fractals cannot be described by any equations. This project intends to study complex mathematical problems using geometry. Geometry, as a part of mathematics, aims to describe qualitative, rather than quantitative, links between different objects. However, the geometric links can provide quantitative information about the subjects of study. The main goal of the project is to develop tools which can allow us to find geometric links between properties of functions and properties of their domains when complex numbers are involved. In its turn the knowledge of these links will lead us to better understanding of other areas of mathematics such as: the geometry of complex spaces, the transcendental numbers and the theory of approximation of functions by polynomials. As a broader impact, funding for this project will support the infrastructure of the Syracuse University's analysis group, which has historically been very strong. Some of the questions raised by this research will lead to PhD dissertation topics for graduate students, and others will provide an opportunity to involve undergraduate students in mathematical research. The funds will be used to allow PhD students to attend conferences for learning and disseminating their own achievements. A textbook which will be written as a part of the proposal will allow students in mid-size universities to access this important subject."

A unifying theme is that at its core lie plurisubharmonic functions and positive closed currents, either as main objects of investigation or as main tools to be employed. One direction of research deals with problems in pluripotential theory on compact complex manifolds, where there are new interesting phenomena, different from the local setting. The main goals are the study of the complex Monge-Ampere operator and of the corresponding Green functions. Another direction is concerned with problems from pluripotential theory in the complex Euclidean space. The questions to be considered involve geometric properties of positive closed currents and their approximation by analytic varieties, the study of pluricomplex Green functions and their connection to problems in algebraic geometry. A third direction of research is to analyze the behavior of polynomials along transcendental analytic varieties and to study the algebraic independence of entire functions. It is expected this will continue to have applications to transcendental number theory. The project also contains problems from complex dynamics, concerning polynomial automorphisms of complex Euclidean spaces, where pluripotential theory provides important tools.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Complex analysis and potential theory are central areas of Mathematics. Over the years, they have provided methods and powerful tools that helped solve many important problems from other fields of pure and applied Mathematics, as well as from Physics, Biology, etc. Thanks to the powerful methods of complex analysis, it has been often the case that progress is made in the study of concrete problems by formulating them first in the context of complex numbers. This project deals with the developing and further applications of new techniques from complex analysis and potential theory to problems in several important areas of modern Mathematics, such as number theory, complex and algebraic geometry, dynamical systems, as well as possible applications to Mathematical Physics. The problems to be studied belong to the main stream of current research in several complex variables. Making progress on these problems will contribute to the advancement of knowledge and understanding in the field. The proposed research will impact human resources development through summer funding of two graduate students. They will work for their dissertation under the investigator?s supervision on topics related to this project. In this way the project integrates research and education."

In some cases one may take this metric space as a high dimensional Euclidean space, and in some cases even this is too restrictive an assumption.  A standard task or challenge which one faces is finding a faithful representation of this collection  of points  (or a big portion of it) as a subset of a low dimensional Euclidean space. The meaning of the words faithful, big, and low is clearly context dependent, and it is often the case that winning a little more in one of these three categories yields a loss in the other two.  In many cases it   makes sense to assume something about the geometry of the data set.  This task has thus far yielded much attention from computer scientists and applied mathematicians using  a wide range of approaches. The PI proposes to use and develop  harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory techniques to attack these problems. In particular, the theory of quantitative rectifiability (a quantitative approach to geometric measure theory stemming from  harmonic analysis)  and diffusion geometry (the study of geometry through diffusion processes, heat kernels eigenfunctions etc.) will be used. <br/><br/><br/>We are at an age where one has the ability to collect large amounts of data in a reasonable time, but in many cases we do not have the ability to make full use of this data since the mathematical tools are not sufficiently well developed.

It asserts that the chaos observed in typical systems can be successfully described with probabilistic methods. Only for one-dimensional systems has this conjecture been proved. The long-term goal of this project is to prove the conjecture for the Henon family, which consists of two-dimensional systems. The essential part of a system is concentrated in its attractor. In particular, the probabilistic behavior of a system is closely related to the microscopic geometric properties of the attractor. Renormalization is a method to study this microscopic geometry. A central theme in dynamics is the exploration of renormalization beyond the theory of one-dimensional systems, where it has been instrumental in making progress. This project concentrates on the development of a renormalization theory for Henon maps.  Renormalization has already been successful in improving the understanding of Henon maps that are at transition to chaos, dissipative maps at the accumulation of period-doubling-type. The immediate goals of the proposed research are the following: first, to extend the period-doubling renormalization theory to more general combinatorial types in the Henon family; second, to refine the theory for the dynamics of Henon maps at the accumulation of period doubling; and finally, to use the renormalization results to establish the Palis Conjecture at the accumulation of period doubling.<br/><br/>Dynamics is the study of processes. This can mean processes generated by mechanical systems (e.g., the solar system), but also chemical, biological, or even sociological processes. An underlying idea is that the chaos observed in such systems can be understood qualitatively with the aid of a limited number of mechanisms. One goal of dynamics is to help engineers and scientists by explaining the mechanisms that are at play in their chaotic systems. Indeed, dynamics has led to many industrial applications. The processes dynamics studies are deterministic. Thus, if the positions and speeds of all the planets in the solar system were known now, dynamical theory could predict with great precision what those quantities will be next month. The future is, in principle, determined. Unfortunately, when a system is chaotic it becomes practically impossible to predict its future precisely. During the last fifty years it has become clear that, in order to describe deterministic chaos, science needs probabilistic methods. It has also become clear that chaos is in a quite real sense ""very well organized."" This organization is reflected in its probabilistic behavior. We all have seen the ""bell curve"" being used in many applications. It is always the same bell curve, an aspect of the organization within chaos. The relevant probabilistic laws are the phenomena observed in chaos. The explanation of these laws is intrinsically related to the microscopic properties of what scientists know as ""attractors,"" which contain the essential aspects of the observed  behavior of systems. Renormalization is a method to study this microscopic geometry. The organization of chaos becomes clearly visible exactly at this microscopic scale. Dynamics is very far from a complete understanding of chaos, but renormalization has been instrumental in the most sophisticated theories available at the present time. This project will explore further applications of renormalization. In particular, it will concentrate on systems that are related to the creation of chaos, the so-called Henon systems."

This project will address qualitative questions, such as compactness for the solution operator, and quantitative questions, such as regularity in Sobolev spaces.  Much is known about these questions when the boundary is smooth (although many open problems remain), so this project will focus on the behavior of the solution near corners.<br/><br/><br/>Because so many phenomena in modern physics are best described using the language of complex analysis, the Cauchy-Riemann equations are a crucial tool for mathematical physics.  In addition to physical applications, they are also significant as models of partial differential equations which behave with great regularity in the interior of a domain but lose regularity at the boundary.  Hence, results for the Cauchy-Riemann equations provide a natural starting place for a much larger class of equations with even greater applicability.  These equations have been studied extensively when the boundary of a domain is smooth, but in mathematics as in the physical world, many domains have corners, so it is important to understand how the properties of a solution change near the corners of a non-smooth domain.  Because these problems are related to harmonic analysis, complex geometry, partial differential equations, and mathematical physics, the potential for collaboration is high."

Having postulated in 1807 the theory that essentially arbitrary functions can be expressed as sums of basic sinusoidal waves of various frequencies, Fourier resisted fervent theoretical objections to paint a landscape full of applications to concrete problems. Since then, the development of analysis has furnished new perspectives that have resulted in extraordinary accomplishments in several fields of mathematics and the sciences. Recent techniques include sensitive decompositions localized in both space and phase, which take into consideration directional aspects of the problems. Such decompositions have led to solutions of long-standing conjectures such as the almost everywhere convergence of Fourier series, and the boundedness of the bilinear Hilbert transform. The principal investigator proposes to embark on an extensive study of problems in Fourier Analysis and applications that have a common feature: they require a delicate balance between space, frequency, and direction. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the historical value of the problems studied, many of which have naturally arisen over time and have a reputation for their difficulty. This proposal consists of three parts: positive theory, quest for counterexamples, and concrete applications. Proposed work on the positive theory includes extension of the range of boundedness of the bilinear Hilbert transform and other rough singular integrals and a study of m-linear orthogonality and Littlewood-Paley theory. Geometric aspects of frequency decompositions play a crucial role in this study. Counterexamples are sought for the bilinear disc multiplier in the nonlocal square-integrable case and the Carleson-Hunt operator on certain spaces of functions. Concrete applications focus on directional sensitivity in computerized tomography.<br/><br/>Fourier Analysis provides decompositions of functions in parts that have common spatial, frequency, and directional characteristics. Just as symphonic music can be analyzed as a finite union of simple notes, certain complicated operations can be represented by their actions on a spectrum of frequencies. Irregularities of signals and images are better located once they are decomposed into small pieces that can be studied individually. The alteration of frequency via multiplication by a typically nonsmooth function, such as intermittent television transmission, calls for a systematic study of preservation of information contained in a signal. Preservation of integrability under frequency alterations serves as a good model to study preservation of information and is the main focus of the theoretical part of this proposal. The broader impact of this proposal is exactly this point, i.e. to provide a solid theoretical foundation or groundwork for modeling protection against the loss of information contained in a signal or image. Applied problems addressed in this project focus on improved results in computerized tomography based on frequency decompositions sensitive to direction. Such applications may lead to sharper computerized tomography images for moving subjects during standard MRI tests.<br/>"

A random matrix is used  to model a typical behavior in many problems arising in high-dimensional convexity, functional analysis, as well as in physics and computer science. In all these areas the size of a matrix, i.e. the available number of degrees of freedom is very large, but fixed. This project aims to investigate the spectral phenomena which arise with high probability, and obtain explicit probability bounds. One of the central questions here is evaluation of the probability that a large random matrix is non-singular, and obtaining quantitative characteristics of non-singularity. To this end, the project brings into play a wide array of tools, ranging from classical probability, to asymptotic geometric analysis, and additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>The theory of random matrices is currently undergoing a period of rapid development. In a large part this is due to the demand for explicit probabilistic estimates arising in various problems of computer science and engineering. This includes, among others, the wireless communication, where random matrices are used to model interactions between antennas and obstacles on the ground. The study of random matrices is also of importance for internet privacy protection, since certain kinds of random matrices became tools of choice in constructing hacking algorithms. The project will develop explicit quantitative spectral bounds, which are required for the aforementioned problems.<br/>"

Random dynamical systems arise in the modeling of many phenomena in physics, biology, climatology, economics, etc. when uncertainties or random influences are taken into account. The applications for this project will center on the dynamics of spike states, viewed as defects, for the Allen-Cahn or Cahn-Hilliard equation of materials science, oscillations in membrane potential and ionic concentrations within cells, and the motion of the molecular motor kinesin and its interactions with microtubules, all of which are subject to stochastic fluctuations. From the theoretical standpoint, Infinite-dimensional random dynamical systems may be generated, for example, by stochastic partial differential equations and random partial differential equations. The study of random dynamical systems involves both stochastic analysis and geometrical theory of dynamical systems. The investigator and his collaborators are establishing much of the basic geometric framework for multiscale, stochastic dynamical systems. In particular they are developing (i) The theory of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds for stochastic dynamical systems including the persistence and the existence of random stable and unstable manifolds and foliations; (ii) The stochastic Exchange Lemma for fast-slow systems; (iii) The theory of approximate normally hyperbolic manifolds in a noisy environment. These are linked with concrete analysis of nonlinear partial differential and integral equations of evolutionary type, with particular attention paid to the persistence and dynamics of coherent structures. <br/><br/>While many physical, biological, and financial processes appear to be subject to random or stochastic forces, there are also coherent structures underlying these processes which give some measure of predictability.  This project is laying the groundwork for the determination of these hidden structures and for analyzing specific situations arising in several applications.  Among these is a fundamental transport process within each cell of the body.  Here, molecular motors attached to rod-like fibers carry essential chemicals and waste products to and from active sites within the cell, allowing for growth, rejuvenation, mobility, and communication.  Understanding this process brings understanding of and perhaps therapies for debilitating and chronic diseases.  Likewise, understanding the mechanisms that produce coherent structures in complex materials can lead to the design of advanced materials with particularly useful magnetic, semiconducting, superconducting, or biomechanical properties."

The project will investigate interactions between differential geometry and nonlinear partial differential equations. In particular, it will explore (A) regularity for certain classes of nonlinear Hessian equations and (B) geometry of special Lagrangian submanifolds of Euclidean space,  Calabi-Yau manifolds, and certain pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. A recent counterexample shows that regularity for the special Lagrangian equation does not hold in lower phases. Work of the principal investigator with Yuan Yu then completes the picture in three dimensions, but there is still a gap in what is known for dimensions larger than three. The PI and his collaborators are also looking for regularity of other related symmetric Hessian equations. Recent and ongoing developments in the theory of optimal transportation demonstrate that regularity of the optimal transportation map is related to the geometry of certain maximal calibrated submanifolds of a pseudo-Riemannian space. The project's goal is to apply the machinery of calibrated manifolds to obtain novel results in optimal transport, in the process developing a nice geometric picture.<br/><br/>String theory is an exciting developing branch of physics, which many hope will lead to an understanding of the fundamental interactions of the universe. In the late 1990s, leading mathematical physicists asserted that, in order to obtain a better understanding of string theory, one should first try to understand objects called ""special Lagrangian submanifolds.""  These objects are minimal surfaces that have special properties and are governed by a nonlinear equation. This project attempts to answer questions such as when these surfaces are smooth, when they are flat, and when they are discontinuous. The answers to such questions will have an impact on the study of the underlying physics. The optimal transport problem asks the question of how to transport materials most cost effectively between two locations. The answers are directly applicable in many areas of science, including economics, medical imaging, fluid mechanics, and meteorology. Perhaps the biggest question asks the following: When is the optimal transportation continuous? Recently, the principal investigator has found a connection between the problem of finding the optimal transportation map and the problem of describing a certain type of special Lagrangian minimal surface. The smoothness of minimal surfaces has been intensely studied by mathematicians for decades. This project now seeks to apply some of the ideas from geometry to the theory of optimal transport."

Many of the ideas to be developed in this project are new, and they promise to bring new results to bear on applications to diverse problems in both pure and applied mathematics. These applications involve the development of models to describe various phenomena that are studied in physics and engineering, including heat transfer, mass transfer, and fluid flow. The proposed research is tightly integrated with the teaching of graduate students and the interaction of the principal investigator with a network of researchers worldwide, which promotes the exchange of results and ideas between diverse scientific communities."

Though significant progress has been made in the case of multidimensional scalar conservation laws, there is currently no general theory for multidimensional systems of hyperbolic conservation laws. One of the main difficulties is that solutions can develop singularities in finite time, regardless of the smoothness of the initial data. These singularities are known as shock waves. For the strictly hyperbolic one-dimensional system, it can be shown that if the initial data has sufficiently small total variation, then there exists a global entropy solution in the space of functions of bounded variation. However, solutions of conservation laws are not in general functions of bounded variation. Moreover, it has been shown that the space of functions of bounded variation is mathematically insufficient for describing solutions of multidimensional systems of conservation laws. These shortcomings in the state-of-the-art theory for systems of conservation laws have motivated the principal investigator to develop a theory for divergence-measure fields. Divergence-measure fields provide a more general framework for characterizing solutions of systems of conservation laws. The principal investigator conjectures that solutions of systems of conservation laws have a special structure, in the sense that the shock waves are supported on a codimension-one rectifiable set where the solution has strong traces. Outside the shock waves, the solution is conjectured to be approximately continuous. This project will investigate these questions by analyzing the blow-up limits of the rescalings of the solution directly on the equation given by the entropy inequality. This plan hinges on the analysis of divergence-measure fields in that the existence of strong traces of the solution are related to the existence of weak normal traces of divergence-measure fields. Moreover, the analysis of divergence-measure fields provides information on the entropy dissipation measures. The project will also explore the structure of solutions to degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equations, for they relate to divergence-measure fields in the same fashion as the solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws.<br/><br/>Conservation laws and their associated vector fields govern physical processes from broad scientific disciplines, including fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, acoustics, chemistry, and electromagnetism.  Shock waves are ubiquitous in physical systems, occurring in aerodynamics, biological systems, and chemical processes, yet their mathematical structure is not well understood. The analysis of the structure of solutions of systems of hyperbolic conservation laws will open new doors to the understanding of shock waves. The analysis of the space of divergence-measure fields, which is larger than the space of so-called bounded variation vector fields and is the focal point of this project, will provide new tools to research other equations where ""weakly differentiable vector fields"" appear. The research plans of this proposal are tightly integrated with the mentoring of graduate students and cross-collaborations. This will encourage research dissemination through collaboration among students, postdocs, and faculty who will be interacting with the principal investigator. She will also integrate her research plan with activities intended to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, as she has done in the past."

The overarching theme of its complex dynamical part is using Thurston laminations to describe the combinatorial model for the boundary of the cubic connectedness locus, to extend the Fatou-Shishikura inequality, and to construct the finest topological/combinatorial dynamical models for Julia sets. In the part on plane dynamics the project seeks to replace holomorphic tools from complex dynamics with tools based upon the expansiveness of maps and use this idea to study plane maps called ""expanding polymodials."" In particular, the project will investigate ""c-tent"" plane maps that combine the expansive properties of tent maps with properties of complex quadratic maps. As such, they should play the same role for quadratic complex maps that tent maps play on the interval. In the realm of one-dimensional dynamics, the project pursues research in two directions: (1) the principal investigator wants to determine all points on the interval such that small perturbations around them change the dynamics of the map (this serves as a pointwise version of stability, is new even for unimodal maps, and requires original tools); (2) the project will develop further the rotation theory for interval maps, complex quadratic maps, and billiards.<br/><br/>This project will use combinatorial methods to study dynamical systems and their related sets. An appropriate model of an intricate planar set (e.g., a fractal set) should shed light upon its structure, allowing one to predict its properties. The research will also investigate the connection between critical phenomena in dynamics (normally easy to observe) and long-term phenomena that are not so obvious (such as convergence to periodic behavior in the future). Thus, these two topics aim at predicting properties of sets and dynamical systems, information that is necessary for understanding many concrete physical phenomena. In addition, the connection between various types of planar dynamical systems will be explored, such as systems that are locally compositions of shrinking/expansion and rotation or systems that locally expand the distance between points. The principal investigator will also study points such that small perturbations around them drastically change the underlying system, as well as periodic points at which a system exhibits rotational properties, as part of a more complicated scheme than a rotational dynamical system. All these topics require new techniques and can be used as a basis for theses, and thus for the development of human resources."

One of the biggest challenges of contemporary applied mathematics is high-dimensional problems.  High-dimensional problems with dimensions of hundreds, and even thousands, arise naturally in finance, quantum chemistry, biology, medicine, and other areas.  Typical problems of this kind are numerical integration and statistical estimation.  The fundamental question is how to construct good methods of numerical integration (cubature formulas) and statistical estimation.  Recent investigations show that greedy type approximation methods are good for different high-dimensional problems, including problems from numerical integration and learning theory.  The investigator and his colleagues study application of greedy approximations in numerical integration and learning theory.  Preliminary investigations show that greedy type approximation methods work well in high dimensions and can be considered as a constructive deterministic alternative to some powerful probabilistic methods.  The greedy approximation has potential to become a transformative concept of numerical integration andlearning theory. <br/><br/>     Understanding intelligence and how it learns and assimilates information is one of the great scientific challenges of this decade.  It is key to designing systems to efficiently analyze data and extract essential information.  The scientific discipline that studies this aspect of intelligence is called learning theory.  It has a myriad of existing and potential applications in both the defense and civilian sectors.  For instance, managing large data bases such as security data bases obtained through surveillance requires classification of the data sets in order to speed up extraction of significant features or specific information.  Learning theory discovers rules that allow the classification of new data from past data that have already been classified.  A prototypical application is the search through a large data base (for example emails) to determine which of these have possible links to terrorist activities.  It is the goal of this project to utilize fundamental concepts in approximation and statistics to clearly define and quantify the learning challenge and design new, more efficient techniques (greedy algorithms). <br/>"

This project is concerned with several different types of differential equations, with potential applications of Fourier analysis to them, and with fundamental issues internal to Fourier theory. The most challenging mathematical issues around differential equations today concern nonlinear equations, which model self-interacting physical systems. Basic nonlinear interactions are multilinear, e.g. one physical quantity multiplied by the rate of change of another; these appear for instance in the Navier-Stokes equations describing viscous fluid flow, and in the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, describing quantum optics in certain situations. Multilinear Fourier analysis is potentially a valuable tool in this context, yet is only partially developed and presents challenges. In one part of the project,  multilinear Fourier operator integrals themselves are the object of study. In another, the PI will focus more narrowly on the behavior of solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, and will employ multilinear Fourier integrals  as tools with the hope of analyzing stable and unstable behavior. As an integral part of this project, the PI will  mentor individual PhD students in both research and teaching, so that they can in turn become productive researchers and college/university level teachers."

He proposes to work on four projects. The first project aims at settling the following problem on complete intersections raised by Kollar and Peskine in 1988. Let C(t) be a family of complex smooth curves in the three dimensional projective space such that the general member is a complete intersection. Then, is the special member also a complete intersection? The PI has converted this problem into a problem of the nonexistence of equivariant morphisms from the three dimensional affine space minus the origin to the instanton moduli space of<br/>SU(2) connections on a rank two bundle over the four dimensional Euclidean space modulo the based gauge equivalence. This moduli space has been extensively studied and the PI expects to use these results to solve the above problem. Let G be a semisimple algebraic group over the complex numbers and let s be a diagram automorphism of G with fixed subgroup L. <br/>The second project aims at determining the eigencone of L as well as the tensor product decomposition for the representations of L in terms of that of G. The PI and Belkale have formulated some precise conjectures to determine this. Once solved, it would give an optimal solution of the saturation problem for non-simplylaced groups provided the saturation holds for simplylaced groups. The third project (jointly with Arzu Boysal) aims at determining the fusion algebra explicitly. Let g be a simple Lie algebra. Fix a positive integer k (called the level). Let R(g) be the representation ring of g. The fusion ring R(g;k) (at level k) is a quotient ring of R(g) under a ring homomorphism f. Gepner determined its kernel for the special linear Lie algebra and it was subsequently determined by Bourdeau-Mlawer-Riggs-Schnitzer and Bouwknegt-Ridout for the symplectic Lie algebras. The PI and Boysal have come up with explicit conjectural description of the kernel of f for other classical groups as well as for the exceptional Lie algebra of type G(2). The PI proposes to prove this conjectural description and also find an analogous description of the kernel of f for all other exceptional groups. The fourth project aims at writing a book on ``Verlinde formula, its complete proof and consequences."" E. Verlinde gave a conjectural formula in 1988 for the dimension of the space of conformal blocks. This space appears as a basic object in Rational Conformal Field Theory. In the special case of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model, the space of conformal blocks admits an interpretation as the space of generalized theta functions arising in the theory of moduli of vector bundles on projective curves. This interpretation opened a completely new horizon for the study of the moduli of vector bundles (more generally, principal G-bundles) on projective curves. These developments leading to the proof of the Verlinde formula as well as various applications are scattered through the literature and there is no single source containing these. The proposed book would fill this void in the literature.<br/><br/>The proposed projects underline the theme of unity in mathematics as they are expected to derive ideas from several areas of mathematics including Topology, Combinatorics, Algebraic Geometry, Representation Theory and Mathematical Physics. These projects suggested by the PI represent some of the very difficult and important problems of current interest which, if solved, should also help clarify the results in the existing known cases. <br/>In addition, it is expected that the solutions will spawn a lot of activity in the area. The PI has considerable expertise in the techniques he is proposing to use. The PI's proposed book on ``Verlinde formula, its complete proof and consequences"" would be the very first book on the subject. It is expected that it will serve as a basic source for graduate students and professional mathematicians alike thus substantially promoting teaching and learning. The two books written earlier by the PI (one coauthored with M. Brion) have become standard texts on the subject. <br/>The PI has successfully supervised six PhD students."

More precisely, the principal investigator considers global well-posedness and scattering questions for nonlinear Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon, and (modified) Korteweg-de Vries equations for initial data belonging to critical/low-regularity Sobolev spaces. Critical-regularity problems for the nonlinear wave (NLW) and Schrodinger (NLS) equations have attracted considerable attention over the past few years. These works have developed a powerful set of tools and techniques meant to address NLW and NLS at conserved critical regularity. The main purpose of this project is to strengthen and broaden this toolbox. Immediate goals include treating the focusing (low-dimensional) energy-critical NLS and the defocusing/focusing mass-critical NLS, problems that lie a little beyond the reach of existing techniques (except in the case of radial data). Second, the principal investigator wishes to test the robustness of the toolbox developed thus far against new difficulties, such as problems for which the critical regularity does not correspond to a (coercive) conserved quantity or problems with broken symmetries.  The last part of the project is concerned with the global well-posedness question for the (modified) Korteweg-de Vries equation for initial data in low regularity spaces. Thanks to complete integrability techniques, this problem is understood better in the periodic case than in the nonperiodic one.  The principal investigator proposes to revisit these new advances due to Kappeler and Topalov from a purely partial differential equations point of view in the hope of discovering an appropriate gauge that would allow the treatment of the nonperiodic case at low regularity.<br/><br/>The equations under investigation in this project have a rich history. They have been studied by mathematicians and physicists alike because they capture important facets of certain physical behaviors, while maintaining an attractive simplicity.  As such, they serve as breeding grounds for new analytical techniques for studying partial differential equations. Although the equations to be investigated are drastically oversimplified relative to the needs of science or industry, the principal investigator believes that the study of these equations will foster the development of tools with much broader applicability, while even the tiniest hastening toward an era when supercritical equations such as the celebrated Navier-Stokes equation can be treated would be very beneficial indeed.

These models involve nonlinear partial differential equations such as reaction-diffusion equations, which may be coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics.  The proposed research aims at improving our understanding of the effects of fluid motion on combustion and has two main goals.  The first is a continuation of current work on passive combustion in periodic media as well as development of new techniques applicable to general disordered media.  The questions to be addressed include the effect of geometric properties of periodic flows on speed-up of propagation of reaction as well as the phenomenon of quenching.  We will also investigate propagation of reaction in disordered media, in particular, the existence of traveling front solutions and asymptotic approach of arbitrary solutions to these special ones.  The second main goal is the study of active combustion with direct feedback of reaction on the fluid motion via the buoyancy force.  Models incorporating such feedback, particularly relevant in highly turbulent combustion regimes, involve reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid dynamics equations and are inherently very complex.  We will focus our efforts on the existence and stability of traveling fronts, bounds on the speed of propagation of reaction, and gravity-induced mixing.  In addition, we intend to apply the developed techniques to the study of phase transitions in a related model of liquid suspensions. <br/><br/>The problems addressed by the project involve rich and subtle mathematics but also have an interdisciplinary character.  Reaction processes such as burning in internal combustion engines, nuclear reactions in stars, forest fires, and production of ozone in the atmosphere are ubiquitous in nature, science, and engineering.  Motion of the underlying liquid or gaseous medium often plays a crucial role by either speeding up reaction or quenching it.  The proposed research aims at a better mathematical understanding of the effects of various properties of the resulting turbulent flows on reactive processes.  It is relevant to branches of science such as astrophysics, biology, environmental science, and chemical engineering, and may provide useful qualitative insights in real life phenomena.  The principal investigator also plans to teach an undergraduate-level course as part of the Research Experience for Undergraduates summer program at the University of Chicago, as well as a specialized graduate-level course in reaction-diffusion equations."

For complex phenomena, it is also very common to have only \statistical? (random) and not \exact? (deterministic) information. In addition, incorporating the <br/>fluctuations of several physical quantities leads to equations with \singular? (white noise type) dependence on some of the variables. In this context, random homogenization and stochastic pde become the natural mathematical objects. The randomness is associated with singular dependence on the state variables and lack of compactness both giving rise to challenging mathematical problems. Overcoming them requires the development of new methods and techniques. Viscosity solutions of nonlinear rst- and second-order pde have become a classical tool for the study of many applications. It is therefore important to improve the understanding of their qualitative properties. In biology, recent experiments at the molecular scale have led to new sophisticated mathematical models. Novel tools and ideas are needed to study these problems further and to identify all the relevant regimes/scales of the parameters affecting the experimentally observed behavior. The PI proposes to continue his program to develop methods to study nonlinear deterministic and stochastic pde arising in continuum and statistical physics, biology, engineering, etc.. The emphasis of the proposal is on (i) the development of theories for weak (stochastic viscosity) solutions of fully nonlinear, (degenerate) parabolic stochastic pde, and the homogenization of nonlinear, parabolic/elliptic and hyperbolic pde in spatiotemporal random media, (ii) the study of problems related to viscosity solutions (rates of convergence, averaging, large deviations in infinite dimensions, etc.), and (iii) the analysis of models for motor and concentration effects in mathematical biology.  <br/>First- and second-order, stochastic pde and stochastic homogenization arise in models for a wide variety of phenomena and applications including turbulence, phase transitions and front propagation in random media with/out random velocities, nucleations in physics, macroscopic limits of particle systems, stochastic control theory, stochastic control with partial observations, financial mathematics, etc.. The theory of stochastic viscosity solutions is important. It allows for the study of a completely new class of fully nonlinear stochastic pde. As the theory develops further, it is expected that it will play a crucial role in applied areas by providing the necessary <br/>tools to analyze previously intractable models. There has been resurgence of interest in homogenization in random media. The novel tools proposed to be developed are expected to become the standard methodology in the field. Providing a unified (analytic) treatment, based on viscosity solutions, to a class of large deviation problems in infinite dimensions will lead to a better understanding of an important area with applications to particle systems, random matrices, phase transitions, etc.. In mathematical biology, the proposed work is expected to enhance the understanding of concrete phenomena like bio-motor behavior and concentration effects.  <br/>"

Variational inequalities provide an effective means to<br/>derive properties of solutions of evolution equations and likewise, evolution equations can be used to derive variational inequalities. Exploiting this interplay has been very fruitful in the past, and the investigators plan to approach various problems using this perspective. One is to find correction terms of various examples of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality by exploiting a surprising connection to the porous medium equation and to the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. In particular, a correction term for the  logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality will lead to an improved understanding of the solutions of the Keller-Segel model describing the chemotaxis of certain bacteria. A similar philosophy applies as well to certain problems in kinetic theory, with the plan to derive quantitative estimates on speed of approach to equilibrium for some inhomogeneous master equations of Kac type. These investigations tie in with analogous questions in quantum mechanics. Here the PI's plan to prove hypercontractivity estimates for Lindblad operators that describe dissipative quantum mechanical  systems, with the aim to obtain quantitative estimates on the speed of approach to equilibrium as well. Another circle of problems is proving Lifshitz tails in the random displacement model. The aim there is to understand the conductivity properties of materials.<br/><br/>Many phenomena in science and technology can be modeled by evolution equations. An interesting example, treated in this proposal, is the Keller Segal model, that models the aggregation, or the absence thereof, in the motion of bacteria.  Understanding the behavior of solutions of these equations is both biologically and mathematically interesting. Likewise, it is widely observed thatn systems of many interacting particles,  either classical or quantum mechanical, evolve toward an equilibrium, and they do this at a certain speed, often largely independent of the number of particles. Understanding this, and determining this speed is one of the objects of this research. Another question of great interest is what distinguishes a conductor from an insulator. There are simple models in quantum mechanics that are supposed to exhibit these kind of behavior. While it is impossible to understand  these phenomena by exact computations, using mathematical techniques notably from analysis, the PI's aim to understand  these processes better. Conversely, applied problems, e.g., the porous medium equations that describes the seepage of water in dams, can be used to find interesting mathematical facts, which in turn lead to improved understanding of other problems. It is this interplay of pure and applied mathematics that is the focus of the PI's research and it has been an excellent way to educate graduate students as well as undergraduates, and to draw them into mathematical research."

Noncommutative analysis is about functions and their properties in the realm of non-commuting variables. The most important example here are matrix-valued functions. The theory of classical analysis, such as Fourier analysis or harmonic analysis has a lot to say about functions, and as this proposal intends to show, also about matrix-valued functions.

The goals of this proposal is to establish and explore new connections between integrable systems, orthogonal polynomials, heat equations and Lie algebras, closely related with each other and mysteriously linked to the bispectral property. The first part of the proposal aims at the construction and the classification of multivariable classical orthogonal polynomials; their duality properties (between the continuous and the discrete variables) and relations to integrable systems and algebraic geometry. Another part of the proposal explores the connection between rank one bispectral operators and dynamical systems of particles on the line (such as Calogero-Moser and Ruijsenaars-Schneider). The bispectral property in this case leads to the construction of new interesting W-algebras and their representations.  The PI has also proposed a new approach to study heat equations based on soliton equations (such as KdV and Toda lattice) and Sato?s Grassmannian, and to use this approach to characterize the bispectral operators by a finiteness property of the heat kernel.<br/><br/>The classical (one dimensional) orthogonal polynomials have played a crucial role in mathematics and physics in the last centuries. The construction and the classification of such polynomials in more than one variable is an old and important problem and its solution will have numerous applications in both pure and applied mathematics. The connection with algebraic geometry and integrable systems serves as a useful bridge which translates powerful techniques, explains the bispectrality from duality and leads to various extensions. Heat equations, arising in many physical applications, can be studied in a uniform way, by connecting them to soliton equations. The characterization of bispectrality in terms of representation theory of Lie algebras brings the purely algebraic side of the proposal.

Using a new recent diffusive random process, the PI expect to give a precise description of such transport.  (ii) To extend this mathematical description to solids more complex, namely those which are neither random nor rigid, and for which the number of local patches of a given size can be infinite. An example of such solids could be amorphous silicon. (iii) To describe electronic transport at very low temperature, such as the so-called Mott's variable range hopping transport, which is responsible, in particular, for the unusual accuracy of the measurement of the resistance standard in the Quantum Hall Effect.<br/><br/>This proposal is the continuation of a 30 years program intending to develop the mathematical tools allowing the study of such solids. Because of the lack of translation symmetry, the usual tools of calculation in Solid State Physics cannot be used anymore and require the development of more sophisticated methods. Examples of solids covered by this study are semi-conductors at very low temperatures, or quasi-crystalline. The PI has used successfully Non-commutative Geometry, a theory developed by the Field Medalist Alain Connes, in several aspects of this program since 1980.  At the interface between Mathematics and Physics, this program requires the use of a broad list of mathematical tools including Number Theory, Algebraic Topology, Analysis, Probability Theory, and should be applicable to a broad list of materials that cannot be studied by usual theoretical methods."

Primary examples of such PDE are equations of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-type (HJB) that are associated with optimal control of deterministic and stochastic PDE. The theory of PDE in infinite dimensional spaces has been studied from the point of view of mild, regular, weak, and viscosity solutions and has established itself over the last two decades as one of the modern tools of infinite dimensional analysis. In particular, in addition to optimal control of PDE, the theory of viscosity solutions of such equations has found applications in areas such as the study of large deviations of infinite dimensional diffusions, the theory of bond markets and other aspects of mathematical finance, and stochastic invariance. In this project the principal investigator focuses on two emerging areas of infinite dimensional PDE that are wide open. The first is integro-PDE in Hilbert spaces. The goal is to develop a viscosity solution theory for fully nonlinear first- and second-order integro-PDE in Hilbert spaces and study its various applications. The interest in such equations comes primarily from their association with infinite dimensional jump-diffusion processes, in particular with stochastic PDE driven by Levy processes. Regarding applications, the theory will be used to develop a PDE approach to large deviations for solutions of stochastic PDE with small Levy noise intensity and to study infinite dimensional Black-Scholes and Black-Scholes-Barenblatt integro-PDE coming from the theory of bond markets driven by impulsive noise. A second area of emphasis is PDE in the space of probability measures, which finally seems open for development owing to recent advances in the theory of mass transport and abstract gradient and Hamiltonian flows. This new area is extremely interesting and important, and the project will concentrate on its applications to large deviations and statistical mechanics. Other problems contained in the project include the use of HJB equations to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality for optimal control of PDE and investigations into maximum principles.<br/><br/>The project contains a pioneering program of research that is aimed at the development of new tools in partial differential equations and infinite dimensional analysis. The proposed research spans areas as diverse as nonlinear partial differential equations, functional analysis, probability, stochastic processes, stochastic partial differential equations, mathematical finance, optimal control, game theory, statistical mechanics, mass transport, and calculus of variations. In particular, it will provide analytical techniques for the study of infinite dimensional jump diffusion processes that are used in stochastic modeling of various phenomena in which random and violent events can occur. Beyond mathematics, the project should have impact and stimulate research in fields such as engineering, physics, finance, and economics. The broader impacts of the project will also include attracting and training graduate students and postdoctoral scholars."

These models are: the Navier-Stokes  and Euler equations, which describe hydrodynamics phenomena;  polymeric equations, which  model  noninteracting polymer chains; the two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic (2DQG) equations, which describe meteorological phenomena; and, finally, the damped Boussinesq system, which models the propagation of  water waves in shallow water. Part of the project relates to the central questions for nonlinear partial differential equations, namely, regularity, formation of turbulence, and the possible construction of explicit solutions. Specifically, the principal investigator is concerned with the construction of special solutions  to the Euler and Platak-Keller-Segel equations (the latter is a well-known model for chemotaxis phenomena) or, in the other direction, with establishing that such solutions cannot exist.  It is clear that such constructions are physically meaningful. A central part of the proposal is concerned with the stability of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. The work proposed in connection with the other three fluid models: the  Polymeric, the 2DQG,   and the Boussinesq equations is expected to yield new information on the long-time behavior of the solutions.<br/><br/>All of the models considered  in this project have the potential for  interesting applications. The principal investigator's interest in these models stems from the possibility of working on a more applied side of the subject than she has in the past, in particular, to be able to have an interdisciplinary interaction with other scientists. In what follows  the discussion focuses on two of the main models mentioned above:  the Navier-Stoke equations and the polymeric equations.  The main attraction with respect to the  Navier-Stokes equations is that, as a model for viscous flows, it is used to study,  among many other things, blood flow. The hope is that a broad theoretical  understanding of the equation will lead eventually to the ability to test for the behavior of the real  flow, and perhaps predict its long-time behavior. The polymer equations in its original form is obtained by coupling the Navier-Stokes equations with an equation that describes the time evolution of the probability density function of the position of a particle. A polymer is a substance composed of a large molecular mass consisting of repeated structural units (monomers) connected by covalent chemical bonds, which exist due to the sharing of electrons between atoms. The attraction-repulsion stability that is caused by the common electron is what characterizes the covalent bonding. The idea of covalent bonding between long chains of atoms was introduced in a ground-breaking and controversial paper by Hermann Staudinger in 1920 (Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, 1953). The simplest model to account for noninteracting polymer chains is the so-called dumbbell model. A dumbbell consists of two beads connected by an elastic spring.  One can imagine that in this model the beads represent the atoms, while the elastic spring plays the role of  the covalent bond. This simple model is what the project will seek to understand first. Here again the stress is on the long-time behavior of the motion that the dumbells undergo. All the problems considered in this proposal can be used as basis for work with undergraduate students and for Ph.D. projects."

In particular, it seeks to develop basic tools for studying the calculus of variations and the Monge-Kantorovich theory. In the process of discovering new results in the variational problem realm, it will hopefully unearth new connections with other areas of science and mathematics. In the project, Hamiltonian systems that consist of finitely many particles and possess underlying Poisson structures are considered.  When the number of particles becomes infinite, these finite dimensional systems may converge in an appropriate sense to infinite dimensional systems that are encoded as partial differential equations. Much work has been devoted to identifying the Poisson structures for such limiting infinite dimensional systems.  Born and Infeld, and independently Pauli, started to develop a quantum field theory in which the commutator operator is analogous to the Poisson bracket studied by Chernoff,  Marsden, Weinstein, and many others. In joint work with collaborators, the principal investigator has examined physical systems with no electric or magnetic fields. In this simplified model, they obtained many rigorous results that can be used to handle a class of partial differential equations involving singular measures. Some of the concepts developed by the principal investigator and others are useful in formulating problems such as the formation of coherent structures in connection with the constrained Navier-Stokes equations that has been considered recently by Caglioti, Pulvirenti, and Rousset. The project will investigate these equations and their implications for the two-dimensional Euler equations of incompressible fluids.<br/><br/>The ideas that underlie this project are not difficult to explain.  Consider a physical system that consists of finitely many particles evolving on a finite-dimensional torus (think of the surface of a doughnut) and assume that the forces applied to the system are derived from a periodic potential. One of the central issues in dynamical system is the search for periodic orbits and so-called invariant measures. In the simple case where there is no force, the periodic orbits and invariant tori can be described explicitly.  The celebrated KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) theory ensures that, if the potential is small, then for certain initial conditions one can describe the solutions of the system explicitly in conveniently chosen new coordinates. It is well-known that the existence of these suitable new coordinates is equivalent to the existence of solutions of a ""cell problem"" that arises in the theory of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.  The graph of  the latter solution tells one what the ""good"" initial conditions are.  The KAM theory identifies parameters, called rotation vectors, for which smooth solutions (twice-differentiable, say) of the cell problem exist. The ""weak"" KAM theory considers a larger class of rotation vectors and for each one of them establishes the existence of solutions of the cell problem that are not quite smooth (i.e., that are only ""Lipschitz"" functions). The principal investigator plans to continue his investigation on the limiting systems where the number of particles becomes infinite. He anticipates his study will shed new light on our understanding of stability issues for partial differential equations. The project will pay special attention to the training of students and the promotion of mathematics in colleges."

The project develops a new approach to the design of hyperbolic billiards that will allow one to prove hyperbolicity  for more a general class of billiards. This approach is based on a new general characterization of absolutely focusing curves, which are the only admissible focusing components of hyperbolic billiards, in terms of continued fractions. A long-standing problem on whether one can smooth the boundary of a stadium billiard will be resolved. The project will also shed new light on the question of where the border lies between completely chaotic billiards in convex domains and billiards with divided phase spaces into chaotic and regular components. Two natural questions raised by the principal investigator on the dynamics of open systems will be addressed. The first one asks how the escape through a hole depends on the position of a hole in phase space. The second question is about the relationship between escape through one hole and escape through multiple holes. These questions reveal some subtle connections between combinatorics and number theory. The dynamics of a finite-size billiard particle in nonconvex polygon will be shown to be hyperbolic. This will be applied to the classical Ehrenfest periodic wind-tree model in statistical mechanics and demonstrate that, from a  natural physical point of view, this model surpasses the periodic Lorentz model in the richness of its dynamics.<br/><br/>The project will provide new visual and relatively simple models of billiard dynamical systems with chaotic as well as with mixed (coexisting regions with chaotic and with regular dynamics) behavior. (N.B.""Billiards"" is a technical mathematical concept that does not refer to the parlor game of that name.) Moreover, some of the models introduced by the principal investigator will be (and some already have been) used in physics by both theoreticians and  experimentalists, who have actually built such devices, and therefore will foster interdisciplinary collaborations. A problem of finding an optimal (to ensure the fastest/slowest escape) placement of a hole will have a potentially large variety of applications for open systems. This question, as well as the one on escape through multiple holes, was inspired by experiments on atomic billiards. Moreover, this approach opens up the possibility of making finite-time (rather than asymptotic in time) predictions of dynamics (e.g., predicting a moment after which escape through a specific hole is more likely than escape through any other hole of the same size). The analysis of the wind-tree model with a finite-size particle will have applications in statistical mechanics.  The project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education through collaborations with researchers in the US, Mexico, Canada, and Europe. Graduate students are already involved in this research, and the involvement of undergraduates is anticipated. The results of the project will be broadly disseminated to enhance scientific and technological understanding via participation of the principal investigator (often with plenary talks), his collaborators, and his students in interdisciplinary conferences with a broad participation of physicists, biologists, and engineers."

The proposal consists of three parts. Part I focuses on sub-Riemannian geometric measure theory, specifically dimension comparison theorems for Carnot-Caratheodory and Euclidean Hausdorff measure and dimension. Applications include sharp dimension computations for nonlinear Euclidean iterated function systems of polynomial type. Related projects concern characteristic negligibility for hypersurfaces in Carnot groups. A long-term goal is to classify constant mean curvature surfaces in jet space groups with an eye to identifying candidate extremals for their isoperimetric inequalities. Part II considers sub-Riemannian geometric function theory, specifically Heisenberg analogs of the Tukia-Vaisala quasiconformal extension theorems and a problem of Heinonen-Semmes. In Part III, the PI studies highly regular surjections to metric spaces. This line of research originates in classical point-set topology results of Peano, Lebesgue and Hahn-Mazurkiewicz and is also influenced by recent work on Morse-Sard theory and rectifiability. The PI has constructed highly regular surjections from Euclidean spaces of sufficiently high dimension onto doubling geodesic spaces. Future problems to be considered include borderline regularity, infinite-dimensional analogs and other regularity classes (Holder and Sobolev maps). A problem of Gromov on density of Lipschitz maps in Sobolev spaces with sub-Riemannian target will be studied. The proposed research encompasses a range of topics within nonsmooth geometric analysis, yet remains unified by a common framework.<br/><br/>Geometry studies the static structure of spaces of arbitrary complexity and dimension, while analysis studies dynamic properties and functional interrelations of such spaces. The adjective nonsmooth suggests non-Euclidean settings: fractals, stratified (sub-Riemannian) manifolds, and other abstract spaces. Sub-Riemannian geometry is the `geometry of constrained motion?: it models physical situations where motion is subject to a priori geometric constraints. It features in a remarkably broad spectrum of applications including robotic motion, digital image reconstruction, computer vision, neurobiology, and the mathematics of finance. Sub-Riemannian analysis involves an intricate blend of smooth and nonsmooth techniques as these spaces admit both smooth structure (in restricted directions) and fractal structure (in generic directions). The proposal integrates research, teaching, service and outreach on multiple levels. Graduate student training occurs via summer research programs, teaching of graduate core and topics courses, and Ph.D. supervision. Educational opportunities and outreach related to the research are proposed at the undergraduate and secondary school levels. The PI?s collaborators are located across the U.S. and Europe. Visits to and from these institutions by faculty, postdocs and students will generate new opportunities for collaboration and increase the visibility of the area. To this end, the PI will also continue to organize conferences and workshops in sub-Riemannian geometry and analysis. <br/>"

On the other, it is focused on developing new theoretical tools that naturally address a wide range of problems in the area Hamiltonian partial differential equations. These two objectives feed into each other by way of multilinear harmonic analysis techniques. The main problems in the area are associated with solutions that tend to behave differently depending on whether their regularity is subcritical, critical, or supercritical with respect to a symmetry of the equation. In particular, the hope is that the project will supplement and broaden our understanding about the properties of mass critical, mass subcritical, and energy supercritical equations. This project looks closely at the qualitative behavior of such solutions.  This behavior is based on properties that include local/global existence of solutions, uniqueness, regularity, smoothing effect, finite-in-time blow up, and asymptotic behavior of solutions.<br/><br/>Dispersive equations model certain wave phenomena that occur in nature. Their solutions tend to be waves that spread out spatially on unbounded domains. They have received a great deal of attention from mathematicians, in particular because of their applications to nonlinear optics, water wave theory, and plasma physics. One famous example from this class is the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Building on the previous advances, the goal of the project is to extend the known results to cases where the analysis is harder, the terrain is unknown, and existing theoretical results lag behind conjecture for explaining the properties that we expect and have observed numerically. The intent is to provide analytical testing grounds for these physical observables."

The objective is to use the techniques of integrable systems, combinatorics, operator theory, and asymptotic analysis to understand, and to derive new results for, these probabilkistic models. One of the basic problems of ASEP is the study of height (or current) fluctuations, in particular to classify various limiting distributions that arise. It is conjectured (KPZ universality) that the fluctuations are universal for a large class of growth models. The PI and Craig A. Tracy established KPZ universality for ASEP with step initial condition, a result that required some new combinatorial identities. The project proposes the study of other initial conditions, in particular Bernoulli initial condition, which would require a better understanding of the combinatorial identities. For the Heisenberg-Ising model the focus will be on the dynamics of domain wall growth. The method will entail a novel use of the Bethe Ansatz that avoids the awkward spectral theory of the Heisenberg-Ising Hamiltonian.<br/><br/>The project would have broad impact in other areas of mathematics and science.The ideas and techniques coming from random matrix theory and integrable systems have had an impact on such diverse subjects as probability, statistics, biostatistics, number theory , condensed matter physics, and engineering.

In fact, the T(otally)ASEP was introduced in the late 1960s as a model of ribosome motion along mRNA. The understanding of the  limit laws that arise, in particular the underlying reason for their ubiquitous occurrence, will have great value in these areas. These universal distributions were first discovered and computed in the mathematical literature and have since found many applications. It is fully expected that elucidation of these laws in ASEP will further impact the applied areas -- not only to create new techniques to solve long-standing problems in the above-mentioned fields but also to proviude new and unexpected applications.<br/>"

The asymptotics of the determinants of these objects is of particular interest and is related to some 30-year conjectures, which have only been partially solved, and when solved have led to new open problems. The tools for studying the asymptotics of such determinants include asymptotic spectral theory, Banach algebra techniques (non-commutative Gelfand theory), certain aspects of Numerical Analysis (Stability Theory), and also Wiener-Hopf factorization theory. The asymptotics of determinants is interest if one wants to study the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of, for instance, Toeplitz matrices (which is one naive, but only partially solved problem). Another application are certain problems in Random Matrix Theory. There a first type of problem concerns the linear statistics for various random matrix ensembles in certain scaling limits. A second class of problem is related to the asymptotics of so-called gap probablities, again for various types of random matrices. It has turned out that both the distribution function for the linear statistics as well as the gap probabilities can be expressed in terms of the determinants of certain operators, where the underlying operator depends on the matrix ensemble under consideration. The focus of this research project is to use this link and apply the techniques from operator theory to solve those problems in Random Matrix Theory. <br/><br/>The proposal tries to connect two areas of Mathematics, Operator Theory and Random Matrix Theory. Operator Theory studies the analytical properties of certain mathematical objects and has a lot of hard and powerful tools available. Random Matrix Theory is a field which has already many connections to other branches of Mathematics. It has also an applied aspect in that its goal is to model and explain complex systems with an inherent random behavior. Such systems arise in models of Statistical Physics, but also in, for instance, Wireless Communication. There are very ``basic'' problems in Random Matrix Theory, which have not yet or only recently found their solution. It has turned out that some of these questions can be formulated in terms of the asymptotics of certain determinants. Operator Theory along with its sophisticated tools can be considered as being capable of tackling and solving these questions. It is the goal of the proposal to study in particular those problems in Operator Theory that arise from Random Matrix Theory. This will hopefully solve some of the basic questions there. On the other, the influence from Random Matrix Theory will likely lead to the development of new and the considerable extension of existing tools and methods in Operator Theory which are connected to asymptotic determinant problems as well as spectral theory. <br/>"

Intensive research during the past two decades proved that wide variety of such systems which display certain degree of chaotic behavior, are remarkably rigid. These results induced fast progress towards some long standing conjectures in number theory and quantum mechanics.  Rigidity of such systems stands in sharp contrast with flexibility of chaotic systems with one-dimensional time. There are two main themes within the proposed research. The first is to explore further stability and rigidity of algebraic multidimensional-time systems with less chaotic behavior: existence and local rigidity (i.e. differentiable stability) of partially hyperbolic abelian actions on nilmanifolds, and local rigidity of parabolic abelian actions on certain classes of locally symmetric spaces. In this direction the proposed research involves the KAM theory approach and thus requires a detailed study of the corresponding infinitesimal problem: the description of the first cohomology over these actions.  The second theme is to explore the existence and stability properties of non-algebraic systems which are strongly partially hyperbolic.  Such systems have specific structure of invariant foliations which on one hand  imposes restrictions for the manifold of the action, and on the other hand it tends to be robust under small perturbations thus leading to certain degree of stability for the action. The research in this direction leads towards global classification of strongly partially hyperbolic multidimensional-time systems.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems and chaos are the areas of mathematics which have flourished during past years while maintaining a strong connection with their roots which lie in the study of various phenomena in domains like cell biology, nano technology, meteorology and engineering. The studies of evolution of nature systems in time represent one of the core scientific interests today. The problem of stability of systems is one of the main issues which arises in the study of nature systems as mathematical models are merely approximations of the natural phenomena. In celestial mechanics, stability of the solar system is one important topic, and the KAM theory turned out to be a powerful tool towards better understanding of the system's long term behavior. Systems with multi-dimensional time appear in quantum mechanics, where rigidity of such systems is present in the form of uniform distribution of quantum states. Multidimensional-(lattice) time systems also appear in the mathematical formalism for quasicrystals, whose physical properties and generation have been intensively studied. In hardware architecture one of the recently explored venues is extending the classical methodology to multidimensional time (multidimensional scheduling). The principal investigator will continue to encourage undergraduate students, female in particular,  to take active part in the research process and will make an effort to expose them to various aspects and applications of this research. These activities will benefit from the grant."

Barbasch will continue and extend his previous work to find necessary and sufficient conditions for unitarity for classes of Langlands parameters such as principal series in  real and p-adic groups. The aim is to find proofs that are as uniform and conceptual as possible, and express the answers in a closed form.  Unipotent representations are (conjectured to be) the building blocks of the unitary dual. Their character theory plays an important role in the theory of automorphic forms. Barbasch will study the character theory  of unipotent representations in the real case, with an emphasis on relations to endoscopic groups, particularly twisted ones. Realizations of unipotent representations as local factors of automorphic forms, and in the context of the dual pairs correspondence are also envisioned.  This research will provide a deeper understanding of representation theory of reductive Lie groups, in particular unitary representations, which play an essential role in the applications of representation theory to automorphic forms, mathematical physics analysis and geometry. <br/><br/>This research will generate problems suitable for Ph.D. theses as well as combinatorial problems for undergraduate research. Together  with several faculty members at Cornell, Barbasch will run the ``Sophus Lie Days at Cornell'' an instructional conference designed to expose undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics and other sciences to the theory of Lie groups and their representations, one of the aims being to  get them interested and involved in research at an early stage. The results of this research will be disseminated through research papers, talks at seminars and conferences, and various web sites."

Examples of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds include quotients of hyperbolic space by certain groups of motion. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild model of the exterior of a black hole can  be viewed as an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold with two ends, while the Schwarzschild model of the exterior of a black hole can be viewed as a manifold with two ends that is asymptotically hyperbolic on one end and asymptotically Euclidean on the other. The principal investigator will study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the wave equation on nontrapping asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds and the Schwarzschild model of a black hole. In both cases the long-time behavior of waves is associated with the distribution of resonances, or scattering poles, and the project will address this question as well. The principal investigator will also study inverse scattering, including the question of determining an asymptotically Euclidean manifold from the scattering matrices at all energies. This requires the proof of a support theorem that generalizes to this setting the well-known support theorem for the Radon transform in Euclidean space.<br/><br/>One central problem in the study of partial differential equations is to understand how geometric properties of a medium influence the way waves propagate on it. The principal investigator will study the long time-behavior of solutions to the wave equation on spaces that are motivated by examples from physics. The ""inverse problem"" consists of using measurements obtained from waves that propagate on a certain medium to determine some of the medium's geometric properties. For example, by knocking on the surface of an object and listening to how it responds to this signal, one can obtain information about the object's interior; by measuring the time a wave travels between two points on the surface of the object one would like to obtain information about the variable speed of propagation of the waves in the interior of the object. The principal investigator will study problems of this nature in the spaces indicated above. The techniques that need to be developed might also have applications in other areas, such as tomography."

The principal focus of the project is the interplay between geometry and probability.   One of the goals of the research is to refine our understanding of the distributions of zeros and critical points of polynomials, holomorphic sections of ample line bundles, and entire functions.  A fundamental ingredient in the study of random sections is the Bergman-Szego kernel, and this project involves an examination of the asymptotics of this kernel for large powers of the line bundle.  Shiffman will investigate asymptotic statistics for polynomials of increasing degree, holomorphic sections of increasing powers of a line bundle, or in the case of entire functions, on domains of increasing size.  One problem is to estimate ""hole probabilities"" and ""overcrowding probabilities"" (i.e., the probabilities that random systems of equations have no solutions or too many solutions in fixed domains).  Shiffman will also study the distribution of zeros of real and complex ""fewnomial"" systems--polynomials of high degree with few terms. He will also investigate the asymptotic distribution of critical points for spherical harmonics as the dimension increases.<br/><br/>The distribution of critical points and zeros of random functions is relevant to many areas in physics, signal and image processing, and other areas of engineering.  In the physical sciences it is often necessary to handle disorder, where a certain amount of randomness is inserted into a system.  Random polynomials provide an elementary model for many systems, such as systems of atoms and molecules and their component particles--protons, neutrons, and electrons.  Quantum mechanics describes these particles by wave functions, which are solutions of Schrodinger's equation.  The zeros and local maxima of wave functions give important information on states of atoms and molecules; the zeros are known in quantum chemistry and physics as nodal lines.  Polynomials in several variables correspond to systems with several degrees of freedom, and those polynomials of high degree correspond to wave functions for highly excited states.  While Shiffman's recent research was concerned primarily with demonstrating that average states of such large systems are typical, as in the law of large numbers, this project will also include the study of ""rare events,"" which has applications to various areas of current interest, such as economics and the study of climatic extremes.<br/>"

One particular emphasis in their work will be a study of Hilbert modules based on the Drury-Arveson space of analytic functions in several complex variables.<br/><br/>The study of spaces of analytic functions has a long and rich history as a meeting ground and source of ideas from a wide range of areas in both Pure and Applied Mathematics such as Complex Analysis, Harmonic Analysis, Operator Theory, Functional Analysis, Control theory, and Partial Differential Equations. Operator theory has its roots in the work on Partial Differential Equations of Fredholm and Hilbert in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The study of spaces of analytic functions has its origins in the work on the classical Hardy spaces by Hardy, Fischer, and the Riesz brothers, among others, in the first half of the twentieth century. The two areas met in the 1940's in the work of A. Beurling on the unilateral shift, which yielded a complete structure theory of an important infinite dimensional operator using Hardy-space techniques. The generalization of Beurling's results to arbitrary multiplicity shifts together with the Sz.Nagy dilation theorem is the basis for a model theory for contraction operators on Hilbert spaces. Thus, up to scaling, every bounded linear operator on a separable Hilbert space can be modeled using a semi-invariant subspace of a vector-valued Hardy space. As many naturally occurring processes can be modeled by use of such linear operators, this has applications that can be felt throughout science. More research is needed and is being done to clarify the model theory. In particular, there has been a large effort devoted to extending the ideas developed in the study of the Hardy spaces to other spaces of analytic functions, and in particular to the multivariable setting. The current work of Richter and Sundberg is in this area."

In particular, the existence of a model manifold for a hyperbolic 3-manifold M that is uniformly bi-Lipschitz to M has foregrounded the extent to which many problems in the study of closed and finite volume hyperbolic 3- manifolds can be understood in terms of combinatorial structures associated to surfaces.  Likewise, large-scale questions in the geometry of Teichmller space have come into relief in terms of a new understanding of these combinatorics: the asymptotic geometry of geodesics in various metrics has been reconstituted and understood in a new language, yet the structure of the classical Weil-Petersson metric from this point of view remains largely unclear and tantalizingly open.  Our proposed research will demonstrate how model manifolds serve as building blocks for hyperbolic structures on closed manifolds via Heegaard splittings, to develop control on the synthetic geometry and dynamics of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmller space via the complex of curves, and to continue to reveal applications of the model manifolds to the topology of deformation spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>The idea of a ""coarse model"" in geometry proposes that one might sacrifice a certain degree of precision in the interest of capturing more large-scale structure.  Frequently a coarse model plays a similar role to DNA in biology: it can determine fine features of a space despite its apparently coarse nature.  In a recent result of the P.I.  <br/>with R. Canary and Y. Minsky, such models were used to classify all `constantly negatively curved,' or `hyperbolic' three-dimensional spaces of infinite volume that are `tame' in a certain sense.  The classification result solved a long-standing conjecture of William Thurston, and opened the door to developing a more detailed and complete picture of geometries on manifolds previously considered understood.  After Perelman's solution to Thurston's geometrization conjecture and the famous Poincar conjecture, the groundwork is in place for a fundamental investigation of algebraic, geometric and topological properties of all spaces of 3-dimensions and how these properties interrelate.<br/>"

The water-wave problem with surface tension concerns the time evolution of the interface between two different fluids, which is naturally posed as an initial value PDE.  By formulating the problem in the right fashion, the evolution of the interface is governed by a quasi-linear dispersive equation weakly coupled to a nonlinear transport equation.  The water-wave projects outlined in this proposal focus on properties of solutions to this system that follow from the dispersion relation.  Specifically, solutions to the nonlinear water-wave problem with surface tension are, on average in time, smoother than the initial data. In addition, it will be interesting to study mixed space-time dispersive properties (Strichartz estimates), higher-order smoothing properties, and the long-time well-posedness of the initial value problem.  In addition to the water-wave problem, this project is concerned with spectral properties of the Laplacian on smooth manifolds: eigenfunction scarring in the compact case, and local smoothing for solutions to the Schroedinger equation in the noncompact case.  The common thread running through all of these projects is the extensive use of microlocal analysis, the rough idea of which is to localize solutions of equations in space and in frequency (to the extent allowed by the uncertainty principle), after which these solutions are simpler to understand.<br/><br/>Dispersive equations and equations on curved spaces (manifolds) provide a rich area of interaction between various branches of mathematics as well as between different sciences.  The work on the water-wave problem, a problem coming from mathematical hydrodynamics, represents a cross-disciplinary collaboration between pure math, applied math, and physics.  The major goal of the project is to provide mathematical statements of physically intuitive ideas, such as ""surface tension is a regularizing effect.""  The study of equations on curved spaces is of interest to geometers, analysts, and number theorists in mathematics, as well as to theoretical physicists working in quantum chaos and general relativity."

The problems considered may be viewed as far-reaching extensions of classical results. At the same time, these problems lead to strong applications of ergodic theory to combinatorics, number theory, and algebra that are inaccessible, so far, by conventional methods. Some of the polynomial results obtained by the principal investigators in recent years have served as an impetus for further developments in the theory of multiple recurrence. These developments provide better understanding of the phenomenon of multiple recurrence along polynomials and bring new vistas of research to light. Some of these avenues of research lead to interesting new connections with and applications to the theory of prime numbers and finitary combinatorics. An interesting and important direction of research opened up by the results of the principal investigators is connected to the entrance of nilpotent groups into the picture. Not only are most of the familiar results dealing with commutative groups naturally extendible to the nilpotent setting, but it also turns out that nilpotent dynamics allow one to get new information about convergence and recurrence properties of abelian groups of measure-preserving transformations. The related conjectures that underlie the project shed new light on the linkages between nilpotent dynamics and important problems in ergodic theory, combinatorics, and uniform distribution.<br/><br/>The problems and conjectures that are under investigation in this project connect diverse areas of mathematics (ergodic theory, combinatorics, algebra, number theory) and contribute to each. For example, in recent years the methods, results, and ideas originating in the theory of ""multiple recurrence"" (some of which are due to principal investigators) have engendered spectacular advances in the study of prime numbers. Another interesting direction of research that has emerged recently links ergodic theory of multiple recurrence with combinatorics in the algebraic area of ""finite fields."" These developments have connections with theoretical computer science. The goal of this project is to obtain a better understanding of the regularity of the behavior of dynamical systems sampled at moments of time corresponding to values of polynomial (and more general) functions. While the project focuses on applications of this phenomenon in the mathematical areas of combinatorics and number theory, it may be of interest to physicists as well. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the area of so-called ergodic Ramsey theory, with its diversity of problems, techniques, and applications, is an excellent medium for attracting undergraduates to mathematics and graduate students to an area of active research."

The first specific class of projects involves continuing work with T. Riviere, on relations between the pth power  <br/>energy of a map between Riemannian manifolds and its homotopy class.   <br/>In various higher dimensional cases, energy concentration of limits of smooth mappings  to a manifold may produce new geometric topologically nontrivial objects and is related to the nonvanishing homotopy of the manifold. This concentration behavior corresponding to any nontorsion homotopy invariant can now be described, and bubbling related to torsion invariants is being investigated for  <br/>variational problems.   We also are attacking higher order Sobolev  <br/>spaces which seem more natural for certain homotopy classes, but for which basic approximation results and constructions have not been  <br/>previously studied.  Work with Thierry De Pauw involves the study of   <br/>chains, cochains, charges, and the higher dimensional calculus of  <br/>variations in general metric spaces with general coefficient groups.   <br/>We consider a variety of mass-type functionals and the notion of a flat chain which generalizes the finite mass metric-space currents of Ambrosio-Kirchheim and the rectifiable and flat Euclidean-space G- chains of B.White. Semi-algebraic maps, chains, forms, and various structures generalized from geometric measure theory continue proving useful in work with Pascal Lambrechts on the topology of algebraic varieties, including the real homotopy theory. Also metric properties of varieties are  to be approached using special classes of metric chains and cochains.  Other studies include microstructure computation, combined transport-shape problems with applications to imaging, and the existence and regularity of optimal trusses.<br/><br/>Solutions to many variational problems in both pure and applied mathematics often are forced to have singularities, that is, to involve regions where large oscillations occur.  For example a nematic liquid crystal material in a spherical container whose optical axis is forced to point outward on the container necessarily will have singularities inside (observable through cross-polarizers or x-ray diffraction).  In this example the optical axis has an energy density, which measures its local rate of change and whose integral tends to have a minimum value among all possible configurations. Our research proposes to understand the relationship between energies in such variational problems and the topological barriers imposed by the physics of these problems.  We have derived new notions which allow the treatment and precise geometric and analytic description of a wide variety of problems from soap films (which locally minimize area) and their higher dimensional  <br/>generalizations to optimal transport paths in various complex media.   <br/>The goal in these applications of geometric calculus of variations is to develop sufficient mathematical tools to model, compute, and predict physical behavior.  Geometric constraints which occur naturally in many physical problems have led to new mathematical and computational issues.  In particular, three that we are now studying involve flow problems in image processing,  microstructure formation in certain crystalline materials, and geometric analysis of large data sets.<br/><br/>"

Since the phenomena of refraction and reflection always occur simultaneously, when energy is refracted (or transmitted) there is always a fraction of this energy that is lost in internal reflection. It is important in the applications to optimize the energy refracted and so we are interested in the development and treatment of models that take into account this loss of energy. For the mathematical treatment of these problems, a fundamental difference appears: far field problems can be cast in the frame of optimal transportation (an area of mathematics dealing with the optimal allocation of resources). By contrast, since near field problems are not variational, they cannot be cast in those terms. This makes near field problems more difficult. The problems in the project range from questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions to various equations that model these problems to the study of their geometric and regularity properties. They offer various degrees of difficulty. Recent major breakthroughs for Monge-Ampere-type equations make these problems mathematically sound and challenging. A large portion of them have practical interest and, in addition, are aesthetically beautiful. The ideas proposed for their solution will improve the theoretica lunderstanding of fully nonlinear partial differential equations and will have an impact on applications in geometric optics.<br/><br/>The research in this project arises in the mathematical description of numerous optical, acoustic, and electromagnetic applications, as well as in global positioning systems (GPS). If successful, it could be of great benefit for engineering design and manufacturing. The project has connections, interactions, and applications within several areas in mathematics and outside. In addition to what was mentioned earlier, questions in mass transportation have applications to differential and convex geometry, optimization, economics, and quality control. The understanding of the properties of optimal maps also has possible implications for numerical computations. The work will involve collaborations with mathematicians in the US and abroad and will contribute to the training of graduate students."

This bears a striking resemblance to the ""canonical ring"" of algebraic geometry.<br/>Indeed it has been shown that the completion of this canonical ring gives a canonical subfactor whose standard invariant is the same as the original one! This structure will be explored in all its detail, especially the planar algbra structure on the standard invariant which is used to describe and analyse the canonical ring. Various combinatorial structures such as Hadamard matrices and Latin squares give rise to these canonical rings but there are serious problems of computational complexity.  The large n limit of random nxn matrices also gives such structures. Technically the tensor product over N referred to above is the Connes tensor product and we are looking at how this tensor product may be directly relevant to quantum physics.<br/><br/>  Fock space is the mathematical engine of second quantization, a process that, among other things, is necessary to make quantum mechanics compatible with special relativity. There are fermionic and bosonic versions. In our research we are pursuing a more general Fock space based on a subalgebra and an algebra.<br/>The small algebra corresponds to the scalars in second quantization and the large one corresponds to the first quantized Hilbert space.<br/>One can no longer freely exchange particles as in the fermionic and bosonic situations. But annihilation and creation operators still exist and form a ring analogous to the canonical ring of a projective variety. In our situation the canonical ring/Fock space  has much more structure, namely that of a planar algebra.  Roughly speaking this gives operations for every map. <br/>Imagine the map of a country like the United States. Upon putting an element of the Fock space into each State on the map one would get  an output for the whole country, which is another element of the Fock space. To say that our structure is a planar algebra means that such an operation on Fock space exists for every conceivable map that can be drawn on a piece of paper."

The primary focus of the next two years of work will be to construct such models by deforming a given model in a manner recently introduced by D. Buchholz and the proposer. Among other things, this will necessitate the further development of functional-analytic techniques to define multiple operator integrals yielding suitable deformations of quantum field operators or of associated bounded observables, to prove the essential self-adjointness of such integrals, and to prove suitable commutativity properties of the self-adjoint extensions. This would lead to associated von Neumann algebras of observables, whose modular structure would be studied. In addition, will develop further techniques to establish that certain intersections of such von Neumann algebras are sufficiently large (or not), which would allow us to determine the availability of sufficiently many local observables in the constructed models. Such progress is likely to be useful in other applications of functional analysis besides the one discussed here. <br/> <br/>Relativistic quantum field theory is the most successful theory of elementary particle physics, which itself seeks to describe the fundamental constituents of matter and their laws of interaction, but one of the most serious gaps in our understanding of QFT has been the absence of mathematically rigorously constructed models of nontrivial quantum fields on the standard model of the four-dimensional Minkowski space. The proposed work will provide such models, as well as further mathematical techniques for their analysis and control.  Moreover, these methods can also be transferred to quantum field theories on curved spacetimes with a sufficiently large isometry group, such as de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space.  Nontrivial quantum field models on such space--times can then also be constructed. In addition, due to the special nature of the deformation to be studied in this proposal, the proposed work will also result in further rigorous quantum field models on noncommutative Minkowski space, which is expected to be of relevance to the quantization of gravity."

A guiding principle of the proposer's research is that many problems in stochastic geometry are best understood in terms of random surfaces and height functions (in discrete settings) and random distributions such as the Gaussian free field (in continuum settings).<br/><br/>Two dimensional random geometries are important in part because many problems in statistical physics (such as the way crystal surfaces fluctuate) are essentially two dimensional.

Over the past two decades, physicists have developed sophisticated non-rigorous techniques for understanding the properties of random objects with conformal symmetries. During the past few years, several mathematicians have begun to rigorously prove some of the predictions from the physics literature, along with many additional results.

More precisely, the principal investigator considers global well-posedness and scattering questions for nonlinear Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon, and (modified) Korteweg-de Vries equations for initial data belonging to critical/low-regularity Sobolev spaces. Critical-regularity problems for the nonlinear wave (NLW) and Schrodinger (NLS) equations have attracted considerable attention over the past few years. These works have developed a powerful set of tools and techniques meant to address NLW and NLS at conserved critical regularity. The main purpose of this project is to strengthen and broaden this toolbox. Immediate goals include treating the focusing (low-dimensional) energy-critical NLS and the defocusing/focusing mass-critical NLS, problems that lie a little beyond the reach of existing techniques (except in the case of radial data). Second, the principal investigator wishes to test the robustness of the toolbox developed thus far against new difficulties, such as problems for which the critical regularity does not correspond to a (coercive) conserved quantity or problems with broken symmetries.  The last part of the project is concerned with the global well-posedness question for the (modified) Korteweg-de Vries equation for initial data in low regularity spaces. Thanks to complete integrability techniques, this problem is understood better in the periodic case than in the nonperiodic one.  The principal investigator proposes to revisit these new advances due to Kappeler and Topalov from a purely partial differential equations point of view in the hope of discovering an appropriate gauge that would allow the treatment of the nonperiodic case at low regularity.<br/><br/>The equations under investigation in this project have a rich history. They have been studied by mathematicians and physicists alike because they capture important facets of certain physical behaviors, while maintaining an attractive simplicity.  As such, they serve as breeding grounds for new analytical techniques for studying partial differential equations. Although the equations to be investigated are drastically oversimplified relative to the needs of science or industry, the principal investigator believes that the study of these equations will foster the development of tools with much broader applicability, while even the tiniest hastening toward an era when supercritical equations such as the celebrated Navier-Stokes equation can be treated would be very beneficial indeed.  Parallel to the development of a toolbox is its dissemination.  The principal investigator will continue her activities in this direction, including the maintenance of a set of lecture notes on this material."

More specifically, it is proposed to study the focusing and defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries equation.

The analysis of the corresponding frequency maps would eventually lead to new well-posedness results and to various applications to perturbation theory. The principal investigator proposes to establish spectral rigidity of a class of Riemannian manifolds with boundary (known as ""Liouville billiard tables"") by introducing new techniques involving quasimodes and a generalization of the Radon transform. The dynamical properties of the corresponding discrete billiard system will play a crucial role in the proof of the claimed spectral rigidity. <br/><br/>The scope of the project lies in the development of new methods coming from the theory of Hamiltonian systems to fundamental problems in analysis, geometry, and the theory of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations.

Beyond applications to well-posedness and perturbation theory, normal forms provide a very detailed description of the solutions via so-called Birkhoff coordinates. The proposed activity would lead to a better understanding of the dynamics and the stability properties of the solutions of a class of nonlinear evolution equations that arise in various physical systems such as water waves, plasma physics, solid-state physics, nonlinear optics, and fluid mechanics.

Because of the growing applications of quantum optics, physicists have become increasingly interested in experimental situations where the theoretical explanation must go beyond regular QED (quantum electrodynamics) perturbation theory. This calls for a more refined analysis of the mathematical  theory of non-relativistic QED that describes the interaction of charged quantum matter and the quantized radiation at low energy scales related to those phenomena. Our main goal within this project is to improve the mathematical control on the dynamics of metastable states where a non-perturbative analysis is necessary. To this end, we plan to push forward the analysis of spectral, scattering, and expansion methods developed in recent years also with the contribution of  the PI.<br/>2) Irreversible processes and transport equations in open quantum systems. Transport theory is intimately related to the study of many-body systems, for which a detailed control of the dynamics is beyond both analytic and numerical methods. Therefore we are forced to deal with effective equations for coarse-grained physical quantities, but one one would like to derive them from the underlying quantum dynamics. This is a mathematically challenging program that links some basic physical concepts to rigorous results expressed in mathematical proofs which hold, at least, in simple models with a non-trivial micro-dynamics. We will extend some first results that we have recently attained regarding quantum diffusion.<br/><br/>The concepts and techniques involved in this research project connect different branches of analysis and mathematical physics. Our general strategy is to address mathematical physics problems from different perspectives, because we are confident that solid physical intuition can make links across different mathematical contexts. Conversely we want to gain more insight in the mathematical structures and techniques starting from the solution of physics problems.  These problems will provide doctoral research projects for students in mathematics and in physics.  The projects represent a valuable training for both students who will pursue academic research in mathematical physics as well as students who will apply tools from analysis and probability to model complex systems in physical applications."

If we consider a billiard trajectory and keep track of the sides that it hits we can interpret the result as a symbolic system. We investigate symbolic systems that arise this way. The study of such systems gives us a common ground in which symbolic techniques and polygonal billiard techniques can both be applied. The collection of translation surfaces of a fixed topological type forms a topological space which we think of as a moduli space. This space has a natural unipotent flow on it which is usually called the horocycle flow. We consider to what extent does this flow behave like the unipotent flows described by Ratner's classification theorem. In particular we consider the extent to which techniques that work in the homogeneous case do and do not work in the moduli space case.<br/><br/><br/>In physics, biology, economics and many other fields one studies the long term behavior of mathematical models of systems that change with time. If these systems are deterministic and autonomous, that is to say isolated from their environment, then they fall in the domain of the field of dynamical systems. A fundamental discovery of this field is that there are common elements of behavior for systems that arise in different areas. There are for example common features to ""chaotic"" systems. In this proposal we study a class of systems which  we call low complexity by contrast with typical dynamical systems which are ""chaotic"" or ""high complexity"".

Among the ensembles to be studied are real asymmetric ensembles and ensembles of cosquare matrices. The latter ensembles consist of matrices whose eigenvalues are complex and satisfy an invariance property with respect to the unit circle. This invariance property is analogous to that of complex conjugation in real asymmetric ensembles, and the unit circle replaces the real line as an exceptional set in the study of eigenvalue statistics. Of particular interest is the study of the integrable structure of cosquare ensembles. Recent work by the PI on the integrable structure of real asymmetric ensembles suggests that cosquare ensembles have an analogous integrable structure. This discovery will further our understanding of ensembles with two (or more) different species of eigenvalues. Specific topics to be investigated include the joint eigenvalue density, a closed form for ensemble averages and correlation functions, as well as the limit law for the spectral radius (as the size of the matrices increases) and asymptotic results for the proportion of eigenvalues of unit modulus. The proposed research also aims to apply these results to Diophantine problems via the investigation of ensembles which arise naturally from heights of polynomials. The connection between polynomials and cosquare ensembles stems from the fact that the set characteristic polynomials of cosquare matrices is identical to the set of monic self-inversive polynomials. The latter arise naturally in the study of integer polynomials of small height. <br/><br/>An additional goal is the study of the integrable structure of Hermitian ensembles whose<br/>inverse temperature parameter (beta) is a square integer. Random matrix theory is a branch of mathematics which has application to fields as varied as physics, neuroscience, wireless communication and the study of prime numbers. This ubiquity arises via ?universal? mathematical models which are naturally applicable in many diverse contexts.<br/>The study of these universal models not only leads to new discoveries in their areas of application, but also leads to surprising connections between seemingly disparate areas of science and engineering. Random matrix theory is but one example of the pursuit of abstract mathematical knowledge leading to advances in applied sciences. The goal of the proposed research is the investigation of two particular universal models and their application to the study of the integers. One of these universal models also has applications in the study of random networks, dynamics and cortical electric activity; the proposed research will potentially further our understanding of these fields. The other proposed model is new and has application to the study of integers; past precedents suggest that this universal model will find eventual application in a wider variety of contexts."

The primary goal is to study hyperbolic systems with singularities. Most of those under study in the project fall under the chaotic billiards heading, which includes popular physical models such as the Lorentz and hard-ball gases that provide the mathematical foundations of statistical mechanics. These systems have properties similar to those of geodesic flows on negatively curved manifolds and Axiom-A diffeomorphisms and flows, but their singularities give rise to an unpleasant fragmentation of phase space, which makes them much harder to study. In particular, dynamical systems with weak statistical properties (such as slow decay of correlations) play extremely important roles in applications to physical sciences. The dynamics in such systems are intermittent between regular and chaotic. However, mathematical methods for the analysis of systems with slow mixing rates were developed only recently and are still difficult to apply to realistic models. Based upon recent results of Young, Dolgopyat, and Chernov, the principal investigator proposes to develop new approaches to estimating the decay of correlations that can be applied to more general systems with singularities, systems that could not be handled by existing techniques.<br/><br/>The first major component of this project deals with systems with singularities that represent the most general mathematical models of physical phenomena. Of special interest in the project is the subject of ""chaotic billiards,"" a term used by mathematicians and physicists to describe certain phenomena that are observed in the study of Boltzmann's ergodic hypothesis. The second key component of the project focuses on ergodic theory, which is an important mathematical research field in which the subjects of probability and dynamical systems come together. Through a collaboration with Feres, the principal investigator will explore the scattering properties of gas-surface collisions through random billiards (again the mathematical concept, not the parlor game). This demonstrates the contribution of the rigorous study of abstract singular systems to the concrete field of chemical engineering. Indeed, such a study may ultimately lead to new techniques for gas separation in industrial processes. It is expected that the progress in understanding statistical properties of dynamical systems that will be made in this project will have an impact on our knowledge of many important events in nature and find application in other scientific and engineering disciplines."

The workshop will be cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering. They will support the student component. <br/><br/>The workshop activities will center on two mini-courses delivered by two distinguished senior researchers, but there will be an additional lectures daily. The courses will prepare younger researchers to work on topics of current interest in several complex variables and partial differential equations. There will be an international mix of students and junior and senior researchers and this will foster new international collaborations."
