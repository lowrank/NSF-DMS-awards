Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies. <br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

The classical theory of these operators was designed to work on smooth functions. However, nature often provides us with very irregular media with which to engage. This creates the need for a very low-regularity form of the theory of singular integrals, which the principal investigators on this project have constructed. A consequence of the low-regularity theory is that through the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a Euclidean space of a very high dimension, one can sometimes conclude that the set itself is of a much lower dimension than the ambient space, an important piece of information from the perspective of data science. To refine this approach to data analysis is one of the main goals of this project. <br/><br/>This project considers several problems in nonhomogeneous harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and spectral theory. The common theme uniting the problems is the behavior of singular operators with very good (Calderon-Zygmund) kernels in very bad environments (e.g., on sets with no a priori structure, in spaces with matrix weights). Specifically, the project will pursue the following avenues of research: (1) the David-Semmes problem to characterize the rectifiability of sets and measures in high-dimensional Euclidean space in terms of the boundedness of the corresponding Riesz transforms; (2) the geometry of reflection-less measures; (3) the geometric characterization of higher-dimensional analogues of positive analytic capacity; (4) two-weight estimates for very simple singular operators in the non-Hilbert setting; and (5) sharp estimates for classical operators with matrix weights. Singular integral operators with respect to bad measures and very irregular sets appear naturally in many problems of analysis. One of the reasons for their increasing interest in recent years has been the study of analytic capacity. While the theory for the two-dimensional case (i.e., the Cauchy transform on the complex plane) and the theory of analytic capacity that emerged as its by-product are now very well understood, the analogous theory in higher dimensions has not been fully developed. The main roadblock here is the lack of geometric tools in higher dimensions. Additionally, in higher dimensions, nonhomogeneous situations arise more often than in the plane and more often one might expect. For example, boundary value problems in (otherwise smooth) domains with cusps lead to nonhomogeneous problems, because, unlike what happens in the two-dimensional setting, surface measure on the boundary of such a domain is non-doubling. This becomes an even more vexing problem if one wants to consider harmonic measure estimates for domains on whose boundaries ""surface measure"" is practically arbitrary. This is an important issue that the project seeks to confront."

In the geometric setting it is to show that such sets contain a translated and rotated copy of a given finite set, or of its sufficiently large dilates. In other words it is to study the occurrence of geometric patterns. Over the past fifteen years there has been a remarkable progress of the study of linear patterns, developing and introducing tools from mathematical analysis, often referred to as higher-order Fourier analysis. Among the major achievements is the celebrated result of Green and Tao, which states that there are arbitrary long sequences of equally spaced prime numbers. This project builds on this development, and one of its major objectives is to develop analytic tools to understand the occurrence of geometric and arithmetic (i.e., defined by equations) structures in large but otherwise arbitrary sets. The problems arise in the context of the prime and integer lattice and also in classical Euclidean spaces. The principal investigator's approaches involve the interplay of techniques from discrete harmonic analysis and number theory, in addition to a new ingredient, ideas from additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>The first motivational context for the project is that of prime numbers: to study nonlinear relations among the primes and to investigate the related problem of finding geometric constellations among points with prime coordinates. The underlying philosophy of considering the primes as a random subset of the integers leads naturally to the study of analogous questions in large sets of integer points and also in large measurable subsets of Euclidean spaces. Geometric structures in such sets are not well understood.  The project aims to develop a general approach based on the modern point of view of additive combinatorics; namely, to establish appropriate notions of randomness that control the frequency at which a certain pattern occurs and to prove structure theorems for sets that are not suitably random. The underlying constructs are analytic and are related to objects studied in discrete harmonic analysis such as maximal operators and Radon transforms acting on functions defined on the integer lattice. Finally, the project aims to study geometric patterns in large measurable subsets of Euclidean spaces from this novel point of view, strengthening the connections between additive combinatorics and classical harmonic analysis."

The plenary talks include a number of previous invited speakers to the International Congress of Mathematicians. Emphasis will be placed on promoting interaction between early-stage researchers and leading experts, contributing to future research opportunities.  Early-stage researchers from across the US will be able to showcase their work through talks and a poster session.<br/><br/>Geometric functional analysis is concerned with geometric and linear properties of finite dimensional spaces, studying their characteristic behavior when the dimension, or a number of other relevant free parameters, grows to infinity.  Since high dimensional systems appear naturally and play an essential role in mathematics and applied sciences, the techniques from the field are of broad interest.  In the last decade, geometric functional analysis has had a significant impact on a variety of fields including the geometry of convex sets, random matrix theory, quantitative metric geometry, probability and applied fields such as compressed sensing. The aim is to communicate new techniques that merge tools from the latter fields to the broadest of audiences.

The seemingly chaotic behavior of smoke trails from a cigarette or milk as it is poured into coffee is easily seen; indeed, turbulent flow was famously sketched by Leonardo da Vinci over half a millennium ago. Despite its conspicuousness, turbulence remains one of greatest enigmas of both theoretical and mathematical physics. Any small progress made in developing better mathematical underpinnings to the theory could lead to profound developments in the applied sciences. Characteristic to turbulence is a cascade to small scales: in hydrodynamic turbulence this corresponds to the formations of eddies that break up to form smaller eddies, whereupon the process repeats. The aim of this research project is to investigate the mathematical structures present in such a cascade. <br/><br/>The project is guided by two underlying goals: to better understand anomalous dissipation of kinetic energy in turbulence, and to develop stronger mathematical foundations for the theory of wave turbulence. Specifically, relating to the first goal, the investigator intends to work towards resolving a famous conjecture of Lars Onsager relating to the existence of weak solutions to the Euler equations whose kinetic energy is not conserved. The work will build on previously-developed convex integration schemes and will introduce new ideas unseen in any convex integration to date. With regard to the second goal, the investigator intends to develop new mathematical methods in order to better understand how heuristic derivations made in the physics literature can be made rigorous. A key aspect of this investigation will be the use of methods from analytic number theory in order to characterize resonant and quasi-resonant interactions, which are suspected to play a fundamental role in the non-linear dynamics of the regimes of wave turbulence under investigation."

It happens to be useful and natural to make ""time"" itself more abstract and replace it with any other discrete system of symmetries, say of some object (such symmetries form what is a called a discrete group). In the case of a very chaotic physical system, one cannot effectively predict its future state. This fact gives rise to an important quantity, the entropy of the system, that measures how unpredictable it is. Entropy was originally defined directly within an information theoretic context, but it turns out that, if one views it instead from the perspective of a statistical mechanics formalism, the scope of entropy theory is increased to encompass a very large class of groups known as ""sofic groups."" Seen through this new lens, entropy becomes a measurement of how many finitary approximations the physical system has. The general question of how well an infinitary process can be approximated by a finitary one is a fundamental question of scientific inquiry, and the class of sofic groups includes many natural examples coming from geometry and number theory. This project also sheds light on the connection to physics that is inherent in its statistical mechanical and information theoretic origins. Moreover, the subject has proven to have interesting links to diverse areas of mathematics, including the following: functional analysis, ergodic theory, combinatorics, and operator algebras. Many of the links are direct consequences of the principal investigator's research.  The project is part of ongoing activity to strengthen and understand such connections.<br/><br/>This project revolves around three main problems. The first is to understand the orbit equivalence consequences of positive or complete positive entropy for actions of nonamenable groups. For example, the principal investigator has shown that actions with complete positive entropy are strongly ergodic and that positive entropy actions are not weakly compact. He seeks to prove that actions with compete positive entropy are solidly ergodic, as defined by Chifan and Ioana, which will give further indication of the Bernoulli-like behavior that these actions exhibit. Part of the interest in this objective is that it places the theory of entropy for actions of nonamenable groups in stark contrast to the study of entropy for actions of amenable groups, where it is impossible to derive any orbit equivalence consequences of entropy. These consequences of complete positive entropy apply to algebraic actions (i.e., actions on compact groups by automorphisms), for the principal investigator can already demonstrate that algebraic actions related to invertible convolution operators have complete positive entropy. A second problem is concerned with investigating the entropy theory of algebraic actions of equivalence relations, which is joint work with Lewis Bowen and Dylan Airey. One aim of this part of the project is to generalize the principal investigator's results on entropy and Fuglede-Kadison determinants from the group case to the equivalence relation case. Lastly, the principal investigator will further the connections between dynamics and operator algebras by defining sofic entropy for actions on operator algebras."

As a result, the theory of homogenization of partial differential equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients has many important applications in physics, mechanics, and materials science. The long-term goal of this project is to establish optimal quantitative results in the homogenization theory for a large class of partial differential equations in various settings, most arising in materials science.

One of the broad objectives of this project is the  investigation of the theoretical feasibility threshold of the time-frequency techniques in terms of the relative size and smoothness of the input. An analogous procedure is adopted in tomographic imaging, where a solid body is reconstructed by means of sampling its density along penetrating waves, mathematically described as lines in three-dimensional space.  This project will study mathematical toy models of sampling along lines or curves, whose theoretical understanding may play a significant role in the derivation of improved analytical image reconstruction methods.  An integral component of the project is the training of graduate and undergraduate students within the active research group in harmonic analysis at Brown University, with the particular intent of attracting young and promising researchers to the field.<br/> <br/>The central objects of study of this project are modulation-invariant singular integrals and their behavior at or near the boundary of their known boundedness range. The model question, involving Carleson's maximal partial Fourier sum operator, is the characterization of the sharp integrability order sufficient for the almost-everywhere pointwise convergence of the Fourier series of a periodic function. The second, deeply related question concerns the extension of the Lacey-Thiele Holder-type estimates for the bilinear Hilbert transform to the boundary of the known range. Together with his collaborators, the principal investigator has recently obtained the current best results for both problems, relying in particular on a newly developed Calderon-Zygmund decomposition adapted to the modulation-invariant setting. It is expected that further developments of this technique will lead to additional improvements  towards the solution of these two central questions, as well as of other significant open problems. A standout question is the extension of the known uniform estimates for the bilinear Hilbert transform to the full expected range of exponents, completing the original program of Calderon for the boundedness of the first commutator. Another central direction of the proposed investigation is the study of singular integral operators with rotational symmetries, a prime example of which is the Hilbert transform along a smooth vector field in the plane, by means of multiparameter time-frequency analysis techniques. Further improvements of the aforementioned techniques are also expected to impact on several questions concerning summability of multiple Fourier series."

Furthermore, translation surfaces have started to appear in mathematical physics with connections to quantum mechanics.  From an educational standpoint, polygons arise in high school geometry and the PI has successfully explained to high school students how to find periodic trajectories of a ball on a rectangular table, using standard reflecting rules, using translation surfaces.  The elementary nature of polygons allows undergraduates to meaningfully experiment with them using software, such as Sage, which is open source software that is freely available on the internet.  The PI has already developed projects for undergraduates concerning translation surfaces.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are threefold.  First, the PI will study the geometry of orbit closures of translation surfaces through classification problems.  Secondly, the PI will apply his knowledge of the geometry of orbit closures to resolve questions concerning dynamics in moduli space and on translation surfaces.  He will approach problems concerning the anomalous behavior of Lyapunov exponents of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle through a conjecture he proposes.  Finally, he will study the structure of quadratic differentials with higher order poles on finite genus Riemann surfaces, which has applications to mathematical physics."

In other words, assuming that at a moment in time the curvature of a given spacetime is very close to the curvature of a Kerr spacetime, it is expected that after evolving for a long time it will eventually approach a (potentially different) Kerr spacetime. The main goal of this project is understanding the behavior of solutions to equations and systems of equations that model Einstein's Equations, but are simpler. The study of these toy problems is necessary in order to tackle the much harder nonlinear stability problem mentioned above. <br/><br/>There has recently been a flurry of activity with regard to understanding the decay for the linear wave equations on Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, which is the simplest possible model to study. Even this problem is quite difficult, since the complicated background geometry affects the dispersion properties in nontrivial ways. In compact regions one must deal with high frequency wave packets that linger along trapped geodesics for a long time, while at infinity the non-Euclidean character of the metric affects the pointwise rates of decay. The very delicate (and unstable) nature of the trapped set in particular requires tools coming from harmonic analysis, differential equations, and differential geometry. Nevertheless, robust ways of measuring decay (e.g. local energy estimates and Strichartz estimates) have now been established. These estimates can in turn be used to tackle nonlinear problems like global well-posedness (existence and uniqueness of solutions, and continuous dependence of initial data). One example of such nonlinear problems is the semilinear wave equation with power nonlinearities for both small and large initial data. Another example, which is a good model of Einstein's Equations in harmonic coordinates, is the wave equation for a metric that itself depends on the solution. These techniques can also be used to settle the problem of optimal decay of solutions to the Maxwell Equations, the linear system which describes the evolution of an electromagnetic field on Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds. Finally, there is interest in the study of higher dimensional black holes coming from string theory, which at low energies can be described by higher-dimensional theories of gravity. Understanding the relevant decay properties for the wave equation on these backgrounds would also be quite interesting."

Periodic media correspond to crystalline structures, such as metals or semiconductors, which can conduct electrons freely at certain energies. It is proposed to study mathematically rigorous models of electron transport near the edges of the ""forbidden zones"" and develop new approaches to the effective mass approximation. Quasiperiodic operators are examples of disordered systems which, depending on the regime, can look like pure crystals, or crystals with random impurities, while being completely deterministic. One of the models under study demonstrates random-like behavior at arbitrarily small disorder and can potentially be a suitable replacement for a random environment without having to employ a large parameter space. Special emphasis will be given to multi-dimensional and multi-particle models, with possible applications to quantum spin systems and quantum information theory. The project provides research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The activities of this research project fall into several groups distinguished by the classes of the operators under study and the types of their spectra. In the area of Anderson localization for quasiperiodic operators (""random-like behavior""), the project studies multi-particle models with analytic potentials at perturbatively large disorder and low regularity models, with the latter results expected to be non-perturbative. The methods here include operator theory, harmonic analysis, real algebraic geometry, and large deviation theorems for subharmonic or piecewise-monotonic functions. In the area of absolutely continuous spectrum (""crystalline behavior""), the project investigates the relation between low regularity reducibility of Schrodinger cocycles and strong ballistic transport for the corresponding Schrodinger operators, which, in turn, is related to transport properties of quantum spin systems. In the area of periodic operators, it is intended to study possible singularities of the Bloch varieties at the edges of spectral bands, both in 2D and 3D cases. Finally, on the more abstract side, the project aims to develop a quantitative classification of almost commuting matrices in topologically non-trivial cases, which demonstrates connections both with Cantor spectra for quasiperiodic operators and with some quantum spin systems."

Besides being an interesting subject in its own right, model theory has had major impacts on almost every other branch of mathematics.  In this project, we focus on applications of model theory to operator algebras, that is, various subalgebras of the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are closed under adjoint and are closed in various topologies.  The union of model theory and operator algebras has already proven to be fruitful and we plan on continuing the emerging evolution of model-theoretic methods in operator algebras.  We also plan to continue our work in using nonstandard analysis to solve questions in diverse areas of mathematics, including infinite-dimensional Lie theory, topological graph theory, and combinatorial number theory.  Nonstandard analysis takes advantage of idealized elements to replace limiting processes and offers new insights into difficult problems.<br/><br/>The study of operator algebras originally began as a rigorous mathematical formulation for studying various phenomena in quantum physics.  A Hilbert space is a space consisting of vectors that can be added and multiplied by scalars and for which a notion of angle makes sense.  An operator on a Hilbert space is a continuous transformation of the Hilbert space that respects the addition and scalar multiplication; operators can themselves be added and multiplied and there is also a notion of an adjoint of an operator, which in some sense is akin to taking a matrix and taking its transpose.  An operator algebra is a collection of operators on a Hilbert space that is closed under addition, scalar multiplication and adjoint and is closed under taking limits in a suitable sense.  Understanding the properties of various kinds of operator algebras and attempting to classify them has been an important venture in functional analysis for over half a century.  In this project, we propose to continue the use of techniques from logic to study operator algebras and their model-theoretic properties, that is, the properties they possess that can be expressed in logical terms."

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will  mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies.<br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

Similarly, geometry is the basis for many current industrial applications such as 3D printing. This project will enhance the tools available in these branches of mathematics. The development of geometry goes back to the ancient Greeks, who laid down axioms, or basic assumptions, from which other reasonable properties could be logically deduced. The main focus of this project is a detailed study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean axiom, attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer valid. The resulting mathematics turns out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of the usual, Archimedean, kind. <br/><br/>This research project will use techniques from non-Archimedean analysis and geometry in order to study a range of problems in analysis, dynamics, and geometry. The project makes use of Berkovich spaces, non-Archimedean analogues of real and complex manifolds. One part of the project involves Calabi-Yau manifolds, geometric objects that play an important role in mathematical physics. The principal investigator and collaborator will use non-Archimedean techniques to study a conjecture concerning one-parameter families of complex Calabi-Yau manifolds that degenerate to a real Calabi-Yau manifold. Another part of the project is in arithmetic dynamics. Given a discrete-time two-dimensional dynamical system defined by a pair of polynomials with rational coefficients, the research investigates how the arithmetic complexity grows along orbits of the dynamics. Here the problem is formulated in terms of elementary number theory but approached using a detailed study of an induced dynamical system on a Berkovich space."

A classical dynamical system is a space together with a map or flow of the space into itself.  Sometimes there is also a group of symmetries of the space.  If the group of symmetries is complicated enough, the system is often ""rigid"".   This means the important dynamical properties of the symmetries cannot be changed without destroying the entire system.  In contrast, the classical systems, with a single map or flow, are often quite flexible. This research program is aimed at understanding this flexibility.  <br/><br/>In hyperbolic dynamics there is a contrast between behavior of classical smooth systems (diffeomorphisms and flows) and actions of higher rank abelian groups. The latter, which have been at the center of the PI's research during the last decade, exhibit remarkable rigidity of behavior. Classical systems, on the other hand, are quite flexible. The principal challenge of the flexibility program is that numerical dynamical invariants can only be precisely calculated in very few cases, mostly of algebraic origin. Most known constructions are perturbative and hence at best  would allow to cover a small neighborhood of the values allowed by the model, or more often, not even that, since homogeneous systems are often ""extremal"".  So establishing flexibility calls for non-perturbative or large perturbation constructions in large families to cover possible values of invariants. This calls for a combination of methods from the theory of Lyapunov characteristic exponents, smooth ergodic theory, and geometry. While the principal problems are relatively easy to explain to a fairly broad audience of mathematicians and scientists familiar with the key notions of the modern theory of dynamical systems, the point of view is quite new and has been explicitly formulated by the PI within the last few years. A second direction of research is the further development of the rigidity program for actions of higher rank abelian groups. The combinations of techniques and insights that goes under the name ""non-uniform measure rigidity"" resulted in the almost definitive description of maximal rank actions. Those actions turn out to have an arithmetic nature from measure-theoretic and, with proper qualifications, also geometric point of view. There are non-trivial implications for the topology of manifolds that can carry such actions. The proposed research includes further study of the topology of maximal rank actions, as well as an extension of arithmeticity results to broader classes of actions whose rank is not related to the dimension of the ambient manifold. Additional directions of research deal with zero entropy systems and include several areas of study in both parabolic (polynomial complexity) and elliptic (low complexity) systems."

Wave propagation and other properties are the backbone of modern Science and Technology. Quantum waves control the nano world, electromagnetic waves manifest as light, lasers, heat, and are responsible for chemical reactions and electronic devices. Gravity theory is described by Einstein wave equation as well. The analysis of complex systems via such wave equations is extremely difficult, and even super fast computers cannot do the job. Therefore, deeper understanding of the equations provides new tools for the relevant features of the solutions. At the same time, the acquired knowledge opens new directions of research in mathematics. In this proposal the behavior of special solutions, called coherent states, of fundamental equations of mathematical physics are studied. In particular, focus is given to the effect of disturbances of such solutions over long periods of time, in an effort to control the stability, life time and evolution of such solutions. The cases mostly considered are solutions called solitons- which are clumps of self trapped waves in some small domain. The solitons formed by laser beams going through an optical fiber play a key role in fast communication and other future planned optical devices.<br/><br/>Soliton dynamics of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation will be studied. While the complete understanding of the solutions of such equations for all initial data seems remote, a novel direction is proposed: The interaction of solitons with radiation, with large potential terms, and with each other, will be analyzed by identifying processes which are adiabatic in time. Relevant adiabatic dispersive theory will be used, previously developed by the PI and new planned methods. It is expected to complete a gap in our understanding of a fundamental aspect of nonlinear scattering: interaction process of a soliton with large perturbation. The study of nonhomogeneous nonlinearities of the long range type, initiated by the PI, which are fundamental to many nonlinear scattering problems (e.g. Kink scattering), uncovered a new, subtle resonance phenomena: the unbound growth of some Invariant Sobolev norm of such systems. It is the aim of the research to understand the implications of these new processes. Dispersive estimates for linear equations play a central role in spectral and scattering theory. The PI's recent and future work is to develop an alternative, abstract theory. By avoiding the need to study the explicit (eigen) solutions or fundamental solutions of the linear equation, one can expand the dispersive theory to new classes of problems, including dynamics on manifolds."

Sorting, or ordering, data is one of the most fundamental problems in computational science, and in today's data-driven world, there is a need to develop new algorithms and tools for handling massive amounts of data in novel ways. Many sorting algorithms are computationally intensive, but have a highly predictable structure when applied to very large amounts of data. A deep mathematical understanding of this structure will lead to new insights that have the potential to significantly improve performance. Applications of sorting are ubiquitous in science and engineering, and include the analysis of DNA sequences, sorting of hits in web searches, and fingerprint identification. A significant improvement in any sorting algorithm would have a broad impact on many fields of science and engineering. <br/><br/>This project will study two algorithms for sorting multivariate data: non-dominated sorting, and convex hull ordering. Non-dominated sorting is fundamental in multi-objective optimization, which is commonly used in scientific and engineering contexts. It has recently been shown that non-dominated sorting of random points in Euclidean space has a continuum limit that corresponds to solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The first objective of this project is to study the regularity of viscosity solutions of this Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and to develop highly accurate numerical schemes for approximating its solution. The second, and main objective, is to study convex hull ordering, which is widely used in robust statistics. It is conjectured that convex hull ordering has a continuum limit that corresponds to affine invariant curvature motion. This project aims to study, and prove rigorously, this conjectured continuum limit. This result provides an asymptotic distributional theory for convex hull ordering, which is an open problem in robust statistics. Another goal of this project is to exploit this continuum limit to develop a fast algorithm for approximate convex hull ordering that can handle massive amounts of data."

Being strongly motivated by challenging purely mathematical questions, this research area also has a wide range of applications in disciplines such as information theory, statistics, computer science, and machine learning, among others. This research project is aimed in particular at a correct understanding of the role of the growing dimension, especially in the problems where high dimension serves as a unifying force. High-dimensional models are useful in practice for instance to understand the entire evolution of a phenomenon in time, not just the governing local rules, which may lead one's low-dimensional intuition astray. The project will have an important impact correcting such misconceptions in mathematics, and will have further impact when these ideas are applied to areas such as statistics and machine learning. The project will also have broader impact on educating undergraduate and graduate students in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/>The project's themes refer either to long-standing open problems or to challenging questions related to recent developments. More specifically, the investigator plans to develop new concentration tools starting from the spherical concentration phenomenon and its extensions to Grassman and Stiefel manifolds. With new tools, one of the targets of investigation will be the circle of problems related to the K-L-S conjecture of Kannan, Lovasz, and Simonovits. The project will explore refined concentration properties of high dimensional projections of log-concave and more general convex measures; in particular, the work will investigate new integral geometric characteristics of convex measures on Euclidean spaces that are responsible for spectral gap and Cheeger isoperimetric constants. Part of the project is devoted to asymptotic expansions in the central limit theorem for the relative entropy and Fisher information, including Berry-Esseen bounds, and their applications to optimal transport for sums of independent random vectors. The project also deals with information-theoretic inequalities and transport problems about empirical distributions."

Parabolic equations are evolution equations--the unknown function (i.e., the solution) depends on one or several spatial variables and one more distinguished variable playing the role of time. Such equations are widely used in models in applied sciences, in particular, in chemical engineering, combustion theory, and ecology. Given an initial state of the system, the problem is to describe its future states. Mathematically, this translates to an understanding of the spatial structure (e.g., homogeneity, symmetry, concentration) of the solution at large times, as well as of its temporal behavior, such as approach to a time-independent steady state or periodic behavior, or possibilities of an even more complicated behavior. Elliptic equations are equations whose solutions can be viewed as time-independent solutions, or equilibria, of parabolic equations (and many other types of evolution equations). Naturally, therefore, analysis of elliptic equations is one of the key basic steps toward understanding the dynamics of parabolic equations.  Of particular significance to the present project are symmetry properties of steady states and the global structure of the whole set of steady states for certain elliptic equations.  Qualitative analysis of solutions to be carried out in this project is important for the internal development of the mathematical theory of partial differential equations as well as for improvement of their modeling relevance.  Rigorous analysis maintains its indispensable role even in the presence of the high computing power currently available for numerical analysis. Not only does it provide guidelines for and simplifications of otherwise formidable computations, in many situations qualitative analysis is the only way to deal with difficult problems concerning general solutions of nonlinear equations. <br/><br/>The research in this project will develop along several main topics. For parabolic equations on the real line, the principal investigator will first analyze the behavior of front-like solutions and their approach to propagating terraces (stacked systems of traveling fronts). He will then take a closer look at quasiconvergence properties of general solutions with respect to a localized topology. For multidimensional parabolic problems on the entire space, one of the basic questions to be addressed is whether bounded solutions converge to equilibrium, at least along a sequence of times, as solutions of the one- and two-dimensional equations do. Two other problems deal with Liouville-type theorems for entire solutions of nonlinear parabolic equations. In one of them, the principal investigator suggests a way of using a Liouville theorem in a proof of the approach to propagating terraces for solutions of multidimensional parabolic problems. In the other one, scaling techniques in parabolic partial differential equations and a Liouville theorem are used for analyzing solutions with singularities. A major problem in this area is to determine the optimal range of exponents for the validity of the Liouville theorem.  In elliptic equations on the entire space, one of the problems concerns solutions that decay to zero in all but one variable. The principal investigator seeks to establish the existence of solutions that are quasiperiodic in the nondecay variable. He will also continue working on his projects on symmetry and the nodal structure of nonnegative solutions of elliptic and parabolic equations and on threshold solutions in various parabolic problems."

The other field studies the long-time behavior of systems under evolution (e.g., the state of the solar system one billion years in the future) and, more generally, symmetries of systems. Although these two fields might appear to be quite different, in the last several years some surprising connections between them have been discovered, especially about those ""infinite"" symmetries that can be approximated by finite symmetries. These connections have led to applications in both fields. The principal investigator plans to deepen and broaden such connections. <br/><br/>The principal investigator seeks to deepen the recently-found connection between the theory of invariants for manifolds via group von Neumann algebras and the theory of dynamical systems by introducing various relative invariants. This includes the connection between von Neumann-Lueck rank in the former theory and mean topological dimension in the latter and the connection between torsion-type invariant in the first theory and entropy in the second. The project will shed new light on the geometry and dynamics of various spaces and algebras. The newly-created theory of invariants for sofic group actions, including both entropy and mean dimension, is developing rapidly. The project will provides a better understanding of this theory. It will also deepen the interplay between different fields of mathematics. Operator algebras have become a powerful tool in the study of algebraic actions of nonabelian groups, replacing the commutative algebra tool that is used in the study of algebraic actions of abelian groups. The parts of the project on the connection between mean dimension and von Neumann-Lueck rank and on the connection between entropy and torsion-type invariants have already found applications to both the mean dimension and entropy theory of such group actions.

A classical example is the motion of the planets.  Dynamical systems arise in all areas of sciences, for instance in physics, biology, and economics.  In addition, the methods of dynamical systems can be applied to study problems in other fields of mathematics, including geometry and number theory.  There is a well-established theory of chaos that applies to dynamical systems whose nearby trajectories diverge exponentially rapidly with time (the weather is perhaps the most famous example). At the other end of the spectrum, there is regular motion, characterized by slowly-evolving families of trajectories. This research project aims to advance fundamental research on the intermediate case of weakly chaotic systems, often called parabolic. Parabolic systems are characterized by the property that nearby trajectories diverge at most polynomially rapidly with time.  Systems of this kind are especially important in geometry, number theory, and mathematical models arising in several branches of physics, including solid-state physics, celestial mechanics, and statistical mechanics.  For instance, in recent years, in number theory, and to a lesser extent, in geometry, many questions have been reformulated (sometimes solved) as questions on the dynamics of certain parabolic flows. In physics, the behavior of electrons at the Fermi surface (solid-state physics), the motion of planets near a singularity (celestial mechanics), and the motion of a confined atom (statistical mechanics) are related to parabolic systems. This project aims to develop new approaches to these important questions and will involve graduate students in the fundamental mathematical research.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems can be roughly distinguished according to the speed of divergence of nearby trajectories. Systems with sub-exponential, polynomial divergence of nearby orbits are often called parabolic. An extremely successful approach to some parabolic systems is based on renormalization, which is an effective tool whenever the system reveals itself to be at least approximately self-similar, meaning it is nearly the same when viewed at smaller and smaller scales, possibly after changing of coordinates. However, many fundamental parabolic systems, including most homogeneous flows, do not seem to possess self-similarity properties, and no renormalization method has been developed for such systems. As a consequence, the dynamical properties of these systems are very poorly understood and are rarely the subject of investigation. This project aims to build on recent results by the principal investigator and collaborators to investigate non-renormalizable systems. The guiding principle is to develop a scaling method to generalize renormalization in the absence of self-similarity. Non-renormalizable parabolic systems include higher-step nilflows and higher rank Abelian actions on higher step nilmanifolds. This includes most unipotent Abelian actions on quotients of semisimple Lie groups and billiards in non-rational polygons."

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies. <br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

For example, when we roll a pair of dice, they fly and bounce according to physical laws that are non-random, but the outcome of the roll is nevertheless random.  A more sophisticated example is weather; although we understand atmospheric dynamics and can make reliable short-term predictions, the exact behavior of the weather several weeks from now remains largely random and unpredictable.  The theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems studies the mechanism that drives this evolution from predictability to randomness.  When this mechanism operates consistently no matter what state the system is in, the system is said to be ""uniformly hyperbolic"".  Such systems are well-understood, but this uniformity condition is so restrictive that it rarely applies to physically realistic examples.  A more realistic condition is ""non-uniform hyperbolicity"", where the increase in randomness only happens some of the time, but nevertheless appears eventually for typical initial conditions.  Several different approaches have been used to study non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.  The goal of this project is to develop a unified theory of non-uniform hyperbolicity by clarifying and strengthening the connections between these existing approaches; by introducing new tools; and by studying new classes of examples.<br/><br/>Historically, the two most successful approaches to non-uniform hyperbolicity are Pesin theory (introduced in 1976) and Young towers (introduced in 1998).  Recent work by the PI and his co-authors has introduced ""effective hyperbolicity"" and ""non-uniform specification"".  All four approaches study non-uniform hyperbolicity via invariant measures, but the connections between them are not yet clear, and different approaches have different applications.  For example, Pesin theory gives powerful results once an appropriate invariant measure has been selected, but the other three approaches are more useful for finding distinguished invariant measures such as SRB measures and equilibrium states.  Similarly, Young towers yield stronger statistical properties than the other approaches, but construction of a tower may be quite difficult.  Recently Sarig gave a construction of countable Markov partitions using Pesin theory, which allows a tower to be built for any hyperbolic measure, but gives no information on the rate of decay of the tail of the tower, which is necessary for statistical properties such as the central limit theorem.  Preliminary results by the PI and his co-authors give an alternate construction that yields estimates on the decay rate; the PI will develop this approach to obtain strong statistical properties for a broad class of hyperbolic measures, including the SRB measures constructed using effective hyperbolicity and the equilibrium states constructed using non-uniform specification.  As a first concrete example, geodesic flow in non-positive curvature will be considered; these techniques are expected to give rapid decay of correlations for the unique measure of maximal entropy and other equilibrium states, and to give polynomial decay of correlations for the regular component of Liouville measure (subject to geometric conditions on the manifold).  More generally, the connection between the four approaches will significantly strengthen the tools of effective hyperbolicity and non-uniform specification; it will also make the the powerful theory of Young towers easier to apply, and give a precise sense in which all four approaches are equivalent.  A longer-term goal is to extend the class of rigorously understood non-uniformly hyperbolic examples; one important planned application is to Teichmuller flow, which has deep geometrical significance."

Physical systems are often also subject to random effects, either through measurement reading errors or noise in the system itself. This research project aims to develop a good statistical understanding of non-equilibrium and random complex systems using recent advances in probability and analysis.

Examples of the systems to be studied include billiard systems (polynomially and exponentially mixing), models of intermittency, Lorenz-like maps and flows, and systems arising from statistical mechanics. Statistical properties of random dynamics can be investigated by sampling over all noise realizations (annealed statistics) or along individual realizations of the noise (quenched statistics).

Being able to provide points that look random, statistically, is extremely important both from applied and pure points of view. An illustration of the importance of the task is given by secure communications, such as bank transfers and other electronic commerce, which start with a scheme that picks a random pair of prime numbers from the collection of all primes of an appropriate size. Being sufficiently random is one of the requirements that keeps many such schemes secure. However, providing a random point from a pool of points is a computational task that is much harder than it might seem.  This research project studies mathematical questions underpinning the random choice of elements of a set.  One of the main aims of this project is to establish that, if the group of symmetries of a collection of points is complicated enough, then one can provide a pseudo-random point rather quickly, compared to the number of points. The main focus of this project is to develop a very concrete way of measuring how complicated a group is by using polynomial equations. As part of the project, the investigator plans to explore some of its applications to pure mathematics, for example, generalizations of the work on sum and product sets that says: given a finite set of integers, the collection of all possible pairwise sums, and, the collection of all possible pairwise products, these collections cannot both be small. <br/><br/>The principal aim of this project is to prove the main conjecture of super-approximation and explore its applications to the other areas of mathematics.

In the past decade there has been substantial progress in this subject, and super-approximation has been shown to be extremely useful in various parts of mathematics, including number theory (affine sieve; variations of Galois representations) and group theory (sieve in groups; hyperbolic geometry; orbit equivalence rigidity). Another goal of this project is to find additional applications of super-approximation."

Its methods have already led to the discovery of new and unexpected algebraic regimes, through a combination of theoretical tools that narrow the domain of search, and experimental methods such as the simulation of billiard flows in idealized polygons. <br/><br/>Moduli spaces of lattices, Riemann surfaces, rational maps and other algebraic structures exhibit rich geometry, often accompanied by rigidity and a connection with arithmetic. These spaces also have a dynamical nature -- they support natural flows or group actions with complicated orbits, or they classify such actions. This research project investigates moduli spaces from a dynamical and geometric perspective. In the setting of Riemann surfaces, the project aims to reveal the mechanisms within dynamics, algebraic geometry, and number theory that underlie the existence of unexpected, recently-discovered primitive, totally geodesic complex surfaces in moduli space. The investigator also aims to develop the L^p geometry of Teichmueller space, to interpolate between and go beyond the Teichmueller and Weil-Petersson metrics (which represent the cases p=1 and p=2). The case p=infinity in particular should lead to the sharpest bounds on the hyperbolic 3-manifold that fiber over the circle. In the setting of homogeneous spaces, the investigator plans to establish Ratner-like rigidity theorems for suitable open hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Additionally, in the setting of proper holomorphic maps on the unit disk, the investigator aims to develop a dynamical analogue of the theory of simple closed curves and stretch maps, enhancing the dictionary between rational maps and Kleinian groups."

The advantage of the problems is that the solutions to many of them are ""intuitively clear"" not only to graduate students, but also to undergraduate students, and in some cases, even to high-school pupils! On the other hand, the answers are (very often) counterintuitive, requiring the use of the most advanced and sophisticated tools belonging to the different branches of modern mathematics. Moreover, many of the problems originated not in ""pure math,"" but in medical imaging and tomography. For this reason the solutions might find very interesting biomedical applications.<br/><br/>The current project is a continuation of the long-time collaboration between the two principal investigators. They will continue to use and develop the methods of harmonic analysis to solve problems arising in convex and discrete geometry. These problems include ones about Brunn-Minkowski-type inequalities for general measures, as well as questions related to different versions of slicing inequalities, including a slicing inequality for general measures and a discrete version of the slicing inequality. The principal investigators also plan to continue their work on the unique determination of convex bodies given information on the size (or some other properties) of projections and sections. This will involve a mixture of topological, probabilistic, and Fourier-analytic methods, and part of the work will be concentrated around a classical problem of Bonnensen that the principal investigators and their collaborators have previously solved in even dimensions. Many of the techniques developed in that work are new, and there are high hopes that the methods could help to solve a number of classical (but still open) questions in geometric tomography."

Nevertheless, the problem of their regularity has not yet been fully understood. Can a three-dimensional, incompressible, unforced viscous flow that starts smoothly develop a singularity in finite time? This question, one of the Clay Millennial Problems, is as mysterious as its solution would be important. In other parts of harmonic analysis, similar questions arise. One of the most famous problems along these lines is the Kakeya problem: Can a set in some Euclidean space contain a unit line segment in every direction but be of lower dimension than the ambient space? This question is connected to important questions in several areas of mathematics, and an example of such a set could provide insight into singularities of solutions to wave equations and Schrodinger equations. The Kakeya problem also shares many features with other problems in the field of additive combinatorics, the field whose central question is whether a set of numbers giving rise to many additive equations is always an indication of some additive structure in the set or can occur as a sort of malevolent coincidence. This project aims to classify and explain the kind of coincidences that can occur in all these problems.<br/><br/>This project takes aim at three specific problems. First, the principal investigator will study whether the quasi-geostrophic equation in the plane develops singularities. He hopes to do this by studying simplified model problems in which all of the action takes place in a finite-dimensional Lie group, one of the jet groups of the class of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. Second, he would like to show that a Kakeya set in three dimensions has a Hausdorff dimension that is strictly greater than two and a half. He hopes to do this by exploiting as few structural properties of the set as possible. Earlier work used structural properties heavily to obtain good Minkowski-dimension bounds; it is anticipated that a lighter approach will be effective for the problem of Hausdorff dimension. Finally, the principal investigator seeks to develop a good theory for finding structured parts of additively nonsmoothing sets. He will attempt to extend earlier work on the size of capsets with implications for the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture."

Recent developments in the area of sharp geometric inequalities include best constants for Moser-Trudinger inequalities on the entire Heisenberg group and more general Carnot groups and Adams inequalities on high order Sobolev spaces on unbounded domains in Euclidean spaces. These are circumstances where symmetrization properties do not hold. The PI, in collaboration with his PhD students, have very recently succeeded in developing a rearrangement-free argument. This new method suggests that such sharp geometric inequalities can be established in more general scenarios including Riemannian and sub-Riemannian manifolds.  Moreover, the PI will investigate the existence of extremal functions for these sharp geometric inequalities where many challenging problems still remain open.  Another main direction of research is to develop multiparameter harmonic analysis function space theory in several complicated but important multiparameter settings. The PI, in collaboration with others, has developed a satisfactory theory of discrete Littlewood-Paley square functions in a number of multiparameter scenarios. However,  there are still many other important multiparameter settings where such a discrete Littlewood-Paley theory is yet to be established. <br/><br/>Multi parameter Harmonic analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations are central areas of modern mathematics. Findings and new tools discovered in this project may lead to new development in the area of classical harmonic analysis, partial differential equations as well as other branches of mathematics. They have many applications in sciences and engineering. The solution to the proposed project will have impact on many other disciplines, including mechanics engineering (such as vibration and noise reduction for vehicles), imaging processing and pattern recognitions in medical sciences, stochastic control and optimization, game theory, chemical combustion, human vision and other topics in the life and medical sciences. Moreover, this project has a substantial training and educational component. It finely integrates research together with education. Many graduate students will actively participate in this project by receiving research training under the supervision of the principal investigator."

Mixing due to motion of a liquid or gaseous medium in which reactive processes occur is frequently an important component in their dynamics, and is also relevant to other processes, such as reliable manufacturing of glasses and alloys. This motion may be subject to fluid turbulence, the effects of which are of paramount importance in many areas of physics and engineering. The central aim of this project is a better understanding of the long term behavior of these physical processes through the analytical study of their mathematical models, which are expressed in the form of partial differential equations. The main questions addressed will be the question of dependence of the speed of spreading of reactive processes on the properties and structure of combustive media in which they occur; the question of how an underlying mixing process can enhance this speed and which types of mixing are most efficient at achieving this; and the question of spontaneous development of turbulence and unexpected singular behaviors in the motion of fluids. The goal is to obtain mathematically rigorous results which can also shed further light on the dynamical behavior of the actual physical processes being modeled. <br/><br/>This research project studies mathematical models of several important physical processes, which include reactive processes, fluid dynamics, and mixing. The models are given by linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular, by reaction-diffusion equations, transport equations, and equations of fluid dynamics. The main interest is in the long term dynamics of their solutions as well as in the formation of singularities. The goal of the reaction-diffusion portion of the project is the understanding and description of long term dynamics of reactive processes spreading through inhomogeneous media in one and several dimensions, including existence of traveling fronts, asymptotic convergence of general solutions to them, and homogenization of solutions in random media. The goal of the mixing portion of the project is the study of mixing efficiency of flows and the search for those which are best at mixing substances advected by them. The goal of the fluid dynamics portion of the project is the study of turbulence, particularly creation of small scales and finite time singularity formation in models of fluid and atmospheric motion in two dimensions. Another goal of the research is the study of active combustion, where all three of these processes come together due to a direct feedback of the reaction on fluid motion via the buoyancy force. Models incorporating such feedback involve reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid dynamics equations, and the focus will be on existence and stability of traveling fronts and on gravity-induced mixing. To address these questions, the research will make use of techniques recently developed by the investigator and collaborators, as well as the development of new methods capable of further advancing understanding of the dynamical behavior of reactive processes."

Both of them have close connections with the physical world. Every partial differential equation models some physical phenomenon, such as fluid and atmospheric dynamics, particle interactions, behavior of spins in a ferro-magnet, etc. The differential equations that the principal investigator will study in this project are no exception. Harmonic analysis is another area of mathematics with deep implications, such as compressed sensing with applications to signal processing, photography, computed tomography, etc. Although of a varying flavor, all the problems under study in this project have one common feature: trying to understand structure and determining means to measure it. <br/><br/>Parts of this project focus on analyzing the long-time dynamics of dispersive partial differential equations. The equations considered in the project have a physical background: the Dirac-type equations and systems model most of the elementary particles and their interactions, while the Schrodinger-maps equation is the Heisenberg model in ferro-magnetism. From a mathematical point of view, the principal investigator is pursuing open problems whose solutions are of broad interest to the scientific community. The long-time dynamics of partial differential equations is a very active field of research that has witnessed some major breakthroughs over the past few years, but in which many fundamental questions have yet to be addressed. Another part of the project focuses on multilinear restriction estimates and their applications. This theory brings together ideas and tools from a mix of fields (e.g., analysis, combinatorics, incidence geometry, differential geometry, algebraic topology). In turn, the multilinear theory has applications to fundamental problems in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, combinatorics, and number theory."

In recent years, there has been significant progress in the mathematical understanding of the effects of flow on combustion.  Nevertheless, the inherent complexity and richness of the phenomena continues to present a challenge to our study of this problem.  These models are given by nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular, by reaction-diffusion equations which may also be coupled to equations of fluid dynamics.  One of the goals of the proposed research  is a continuation of previous work on passive combustion in periodic, random, as well as general inhomogeneous media.  The main questions of interest include the effects of flows on mixing and on speed-up of propagation of reaction.  In addition, simplified models will be considered and experience gained from their study will be applied to the original problems.  Another goal of the project is the study of propagation of reaction in a model of active combustion, with direct feedback of reaction on the fluid motion via the buoyancy force and gravity-induced mixing.  In many situations this effect cannot be ignored, particularly in highly turbulent combustion regimes.  Although this is a very difficult problem, limited progress has been achieved recently and it is proposed here to build upon these results.  The developed techniques will also be applied to the study of other related models, including systems of reaction-diffusion equations and a model of liquid suspensions.<br/><br/>Reactive processes, such as burning in internal combustion engines, nuclear reactions in stars, and forest fires, are ubiquitous in nature.  Their study is relevant to several branches of science and engineering such as astrophysics, biology, environmental science, and chemical engineering.  The research proposed here focuses on the influence of the motion of the underlying medium, such as fluid flow, on the speed of spreading of reactive processes.  It aims at improving our understanding of fundamental mathematical models describing such processes, which may provide useful qualitative insights into real life phenomena.  An important part of this proposal is its educational component.  The principal investigator (PI) plans to develop an undergraduate partial differential equations (PDE) course at the University of Wisconsin, mentor undergraduate mathematics majors in the study of advanced topics, and organize a Research Experience for Undergraduates program in analysis and PDEs.  The PI will also teach specialized graduate courses and involve graduate students in working under his supervision."

Ebenfelt will consider questions regarding existence, uniqueness, and regularity of CR maps, as well as related questions that arise in connection with this study. He will consider the context of CR maps of a Levi nondegenerate hypersurface into a nondegenerate hyperquadric of higher dimension. This study will enhance our understanding of the CR submanifold structure of the hyperquadrics, which constitute the flat models in the theory of Levi nondegenerate hypersurfaces. The proposed work should also provide insight into how the local CR geometry of such hypersurfaces (in principle completely encoded in the CR curvature tensor) affects various properties, such as notions of nondegeneracy and rigidity, of their CR maps. Ebenfelt will also continue his study of CR maps between generic submanifolds of infinite type by investigating the prolongation of the system defining CR maps to a singular Pfaffian system on the jet bundle. He will, in particular, focus on understanding the recently discovered phenomenon that for infinite type hypersurfaces the biholomorphic, formal, and smooth CR equivalence classifications are different. He will also study a conjecture regarding finite jet determination of local automorphisms. These investigations are expected to shed new light on the nature of CR maps between infinite type manifolds, and lead to a better understanding of the Pfaffian systems arising in this context. Ebenfelt will also continue his work on normal forms for infinite type hypersurfaces in complex 2-space. Finally, Ebenfelt will study CR invariants on unit circle bundles over Khler manifolds, specifically Cartan's umbilical tensor in the 3-dimensional case and those arising in the expansions of the Bergman and Szeg kernels. He intends to develop new methods for detecting umbilical points on general 3-dimensional CR manifolds, and resolve an open problem regarding existence of umbilical points on compact CR manifolds embedded in complex 2-space."

This applies, for instance, to sound waves in the presence of sharp corners or cone points, and it is of practical importance in acoustics and in a variety of computational problems involving wave propagation.<br/><br/>The project will study the asymptotic behavior of waves propagating on certain Lorentzian space-times such as arise in the theory of general relativity.  A main goal is to understand the asymptotics of the Friedlander radiation field for a range of Lorentzian geometries, including asymptotically static space-times with asymptotically Euclidean ends (with long-range perturbations).  The principal investigator will also study the decay of waves near their source in different geometric settings, especially in singular geometries.  In particular, he will investigate the distribution of quantum resonances in a variety of geometries involving cone points and corners, as well as continue collaborations on more applied problems motivated by numerical analysis for high-frequency asymptotics of the Helmholtz equation. Finally, the principal investigator will study the closely related problem of the structure of the propagator for the Dirac-Coulomb equation, where the singularity of the potential diffracts the singularities of the solution, producing an outgoing spherical wave."

Such discrete dynamical systems occur as models throughout science and engineering.  Polynomials and rational functions of a single variable provide basic examples of non-invertible, algebraic, discrete dynamical systems by iteration. Even the simplest families of examples exhibit complicated and chaotic dynamical behavior; the most famous is the family of quadratic polynomials where a point x is mapped to x ""squared"" plus a constant. The constant can be a real or complex number. This family gives rise to the Mandelbrot set, which continues to baffle researchers. A fundamental problem in the mathematical study of these systems is to characterize their stability: under what circumstances -- and by how much -- can we perturb a system while maintaining its long-term dynamical features? The primary goal of this research project is to explore connections between the stability of algebraic dynamical systems and the algebraic or geometric structures that are preserved under iteration. The first connections between the algebra and dynamics of these models were discovered in the 19th century. This project will exploit modern tools from arithmetic geometry and dynamical systems to strengthen these connections and deepen our understanding of the systems themselves. <br/><br/>The project studies: (1) the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, with dynamical methods; (2) a series of substantial conjectures about ""unlikely intersections"" in moduli spaces of dynamical systems; and (3) the 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry of a rational function, with curvature form equal to its measure of maximal entropy. The main goal of this project is to build relations between the algebra and the geometry of dynamical systems on algebraic varieties, with an eye towards applications in Diophantine geometry. The second goal of the project is a study of rational maps in dimension one, particularly an exploration of the canonical shape of the dynamical system and its stability properties. In recent work, the investigator and collaborator developed new methods of proof incorporating tools from both complex and non-Archimedean analysis and formulated a conjecture about the dynamics of rational maps that encompasses known results about elliptic curves. This project aims to investigate particular cases of this conjecture while developing the theory to connect these results to the study of the symmetries and stability and invariants of complex dynamical systems in dimensions one and two."

Geometry and mathematical physics have traditionally focused on smooth geometric objects called manifolds, but a slightly more general class of geometric objects called stratified spaces is equally ubiquitous. Despite this, only recently have specific techniques been developed appropriate to study detailed analytic problems on these spaces. One goal of this project is a continuation of the PI's long-term goal of establishing certain strong analytic techniques to study a wide variety of problems in geometric analysis which are set on such stratified spaces. Other goals of this project include applications of these techniques to problems occurring in gauge theory and in mathematical relativity. This has significant cross-disciplinary appeal between partial differential equations, geometric analysis and mathematical physics, and modulates between the parallel goals of developing general techniques and solving specific problems of interest in various disciplines.<br/><br/>Geometric microlocal analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to study a range of problems concerning differential and pseudodifferential operators with degeneracies. Such operators arise in many applications in geometric analysis and mathematical physics. The PI's current research interest centers on the development of a calculus of iterated edge pseudodifferential operators which can be used as an investigative tool to study elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic operators on stratified pseudomanifolds. The ultimate goal in this is a theory paralleling and generalizing the Boutet de Monvel calculus, which provides the most general and natural setting to study elliptic boundary problems on manifolds with boundary. The PI intends to use this calculus to study specific problems, including Kaehler-Einstein metrics with edge singularities along normal crossing divisors and singular solutions of the Kapustin-Witten equations. Closely related research projects include a new approach to study the asymptotic geometry of certain gauge-theoretic moduli spaces, in particular the moduli space of solutions to the Hitchin equations on a Riemann surface, and the continuation of a program to understand the blowup profiles of families of solutions of the vacuum Einstein constraint equations in mathematical relativity."

The data are complex in size, dimension, and structure. The technology for rapidly processing such massive amounts of data is still in its infancy. One of the main goals of this project is to take advantage of some recent mathematical advances to develop and implement fast algorithms for fitting data by smooth functions. This could have many practical applications, for example in the design of automated systems that guide airplanes and unmanned aerial vehicles through complex terrains avoiding obstacles of arbitrary shapes. The proposed research carries the hope of advancing obstacle avoidance algorithms -- fast algorithms that can plan an optimal path under various constraints. The project will open new research directions for students and researchers; and it also will enhance our understanding of mathematical theories such as harmonic analysis, differential geometry, partial differential equations, and nonlinear programming.<br/><br/>This 5-year integrated research and education project focuses on solving variational problems with boundary and/or obstacle constraints on arbitrary subsets in Euclidean space. The approach that the PI proposes is unorthodox: Rather than seeking exact minimizers of energy functionals, the PI will look for functions that minimize the energy functionals up to universal constant multiples. In contrast to the conventional approach to solving variational problems, which involves the solution of a partial differential equation, the PI will construct the solutions directly. The ultimate goal is to develop a complete theory revolving around the belief that any variational problem that can be solved using PDE theory can also be dealt with using extension theory. The special problems the PI will focus on are the obstacle problem, which requires the minimizers to lie above a certain barrier; and the Plateau problem, which seeks a surface of least area with prescribed boundary. Solving variational problems using PDE methods often requires the boundary of the set to have some kind of smoothness. In practice, this is a severe limitation. The novelty of the proposed approach is that there is no need to make any assumption on the geometry or the regularity of the set on which the PI prescribes the boundary conditions or constraints."

Complex numbers include quantities such as the square root of negative one. The calculus studies how physical or geometric quantities vary in space or time. The combination of these ideas (called complex analysis) leads to far-reaching and beautiful results about smoothly varying complex quantities (called holomorphic functions). One may use these ideas to model various natural phenomena such as electrical attraction or the motion of liquids. These considerations also have surprising consequences in other parts of mathematics, such as the properties of prime numbers, the geometry of higher dimensional spaces, and the study of equations (called partial differential equations) used to describe many physical processes such as heat conduction and the propagation of waves.

The domains to be studied include piecewise smooth domains (in particular product domains), Levi-flat Stein domains in complex manifolds, and non-pseudoconvex domains, both with and without ""holes."" The research will involve both the investigation of general questions and the careful study of particular examples, which can exhibit unexpected phenomena associated to these domains.

Another focus of the project is the iteration theory of holomorphic functions. The PI will study the size, shape and behavior of the Julia and Fatou sets associated to entire functions (holomorphic functions defined on the whole plane). Traditionally, most work has focused on the special case of polynomials; the case of more general entire functions is known as ""transcendental dynamics"", but has  been much  less studied so far. The project will also consider several problems in analysis that can be attacked using ideas from discrete and computational geometry. Successful completion of this work could result in faster algorithms related to meshing, as used in graphics, medical imaging, and a wide variety of design and manufacturing applications.<br/><br/>The project divides into several broad areas: transcendental dynamics, Brownian motion, and the interactions of analysis with computational geometry. Continuing earlier work, the PI will study problems such as computing the dimension of Julia sets of entire functions, investigating the existence of wandering domains with bounded orbits, and studying the escaping set (points that iterate to infinity). The PI will also work on related geometric problems for random sets such as Brownian motion, considering both well known questions (does Brownian motion cover any rectifiable arcs?) as well as more novel ones (is Brownian motion removable for conformal maps? Does the set of cut-points lie on a rectifiable curve?) Finally, the PI will work on extending his earlier algorithms for optimal meshing, triangulation and conformal mapping using ideas from analysis, geometry and topology. The most interesting generalization would be to three dimensions, where no rigorous complexity bounds are known, but where the most important applications lie. The proposal also considers problems in ""pure"" analysis that might be solved using strengthened versions of known results in computational geometry; one such problem is the connectedness of the space of chord-arc curves in the BMO topology; another is the factoring of general bi-Lipschitz maps into bi-Lipschitz maps with small constants."

The areas of application range from the solar system, global weather on earth, to the future and past of the cosmos and everything between. Although there is an enormous variety of systems, one often observes common features. The role of mathematics in dynamics can be found not only in fundamental contributions to geometrical and probabilistic aspects of dynamics but also in concrete algorithms for predictions. We are still very far from a global understanding of dynamics. Generally speaking we only understand the dynamics of real world systems by numerical simulations. Refined theories are only available in specific and relatively simple systems. The degree of complexity one can expect increases with the number of observables involved and the dimension of the system. Among the most refined areas of dynamics are those where the underling space is an interval or the real line.  This is what is called ""one-dimensional dynamics"".  Although one-dimensional dynamics is the simplest of the simplest, the one-dimensional theory is extremely rich. The central tool in one-dimensional dynamics is renormalization. It connects the combinatorial structure of the system with its geometrical and probabilistic behavior. One step up, is the theory of two-dimensional dynamics where the underlying space is the Euclidean plane or a piece of it.  This area of research is still wide open. The main goal of this project is to introduce renormalization into two-dimensional dynamics and to explore its consequences for the development of a theory for two-dimensional dynamics.<br/><br/>Henon maps play a crucial role in understanding transitions observed in general smooth dynamics. The most famous example is the transition to chaos in dissipative dynamics. Renormalization plays the central role in understanding these transitions. This has been fully developed for general one-dimensional dynamics and for the transition to chaos in two dimensional dissipative dynamics. This success of renormalization inspired this project. The main goal of the research is to extend the period doubling renormalization theory. In particular, it will introduce Generalized Renormalization which is able to describe systems with general combinatorial structure and the corresponding transitions observed in Henon families. Secondly, it will continue the development of a theory for the dynamics of Henon maps at transition to chaos. Renormalization theory gives us invaluable insights into universality features of dynamical and parameter-regions. It should become an intrinsic part a comprehensive picture of two-dimensional dynamics."

The project focuses especially on spaces which are poorly described by classical Euclidean language, such as fractals and sub-Riemannian spaces.  The latter occur as mathematical models for problems in robotics, neurobiology, celestial mechanics and other physical systems.  In each of these models, the underlying geometry is inherently nonsmooth. The proposed research will consequently contribute to developing the mathematical framework which simultaneously underlies a variety of physical applications. On the geometric side, nonsmooth notions of curvature will be studied.  Curvature is a fundamental concept in modern geometry.  For instance, general relativity predicts that curvature is the primary geometric feature of space responsible for gravity.  Nonsmooth generalizations of curvature and their relationship to the structure of measures will also be studied.  Measure theory is a wide-ranging mathematical generalization of fundamental concepts of length, area, and volume.  Finally, analysis refers to the dynamic properties of transformations acting between spaces. Since the classical Newton--Leibniz theory of the derivative is not well-adapted to transformations of nonsmooth spaces, there is currently significant interest in developing a new analytic toolkit to extend the machinery of calculus beyond its usual context.  The principle investigator will continue to train graduate students, postdocs and early-career researchers.  Results of this research program will be disseminated via talks at conferences and workshops, publication of journal articles, and exposition for a general mathematical audience.  The PI is currently coauthoring a graduate textbook on analysis in nonsmooth spaces.  The ongoing preparation of this book will be coordinated with advances in the field, including those obtained as part of this research program.<br/><br/>The project concerns the geometry of measures and submanifolds in, and mappings between, sub-Riemannian manifolds.  Three coordinating themes will be considered.  The first set of problems concerns density of measures and the geometry of submanifolds.  The main goal is a sub-Riemannian analog of a celebrated theorem of David Preiss characterizing rectifiability (a measure-theoretic notion of smoothness) via densities.  This line of investigation will extend to the sub-Riemannian setting some fundamental aspects of Euclidean geometric measure theory tied to notions of curvature for submanifolds.  The primary methodology for this investigation involves the approximation of sub-Riemannian spaces by Riemannian spaces, and an analysis of the limiting behavior of geometric quantities in the Riemannian approximations.  The second theme concerns iteration of conformal and quasiregular mappings.  Such iterative schemes provide a basic combinatorial model for fractal objects. They arise naturally in both hyperbolic geometry and number theory.  Building on his previous work for similarity mappings, the principle investigator will extend the analysis to conformal mappings.  The goal is a detailed description of the geometry of self-conformal limit sets in sub-Riemannian spaces and natural measures on such sets. Finally, the principle investigator will study the type problem for sub-Riemannian quasiregular mappings. The goal here is to understand both the flexibility of quasiregular mappings as well as inherent geometric obstructions to their construction.  The principle investigator will also investigate new constructions of Sobolev mappings inducing optimal measure and dimension distortion, as well as criteria for the density of Lipschitz mappings in spaces of Sobolev mappings with sub-Riemannian targets.  The principle investigator will take advantage of his prior expertise in all of the aforementioned areas, as well as the latest advances in related fields, to pursue answers to the proposed problems.  The proposed research will have a broad impact; it addresses a wide range of questions at the intersection of different mathematical areas. The principle investigator will use this broad framework to identify specific problems suitable for beginning graduate students and postdocs."

These equations arise as critical points of an action in the space of probability measures; the project will investigate sufficient and necessary conditions for minimizers of this action to exist. Moreover, the investigator aims is to lay a foundation for a theory of Lagrangian mechanics, calculus of variations, and control theory in the space of probability measures. To this end, he will employ methods from fluid mechanics, optimal transport, functional inequalities, and evolution equations. In collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Teaching and Learning, the investigator will organize an interactive seminar based on these topics as a way recruit and train undergraduates to do research.

This conference is integrated in the sense that it draws participants at every stage of their mathematical careers, with particular focus on both early-career graduate students and undergraduates. A meeting of this type brings together researchers from the academically young to the well-established, yet offers a more narrow research focus than is typically found at undergraduate-inclusive conferences. This narrow focus serves to promote more meaningful contact in the context of mathematical research. The conference is intended to fuel young mathematicians' interest in research mathematics, promote inter- and intra-generational research ties, and demonstrate how undergraduates can be incorporated into research programs in these fields.<br/><br/>Three established speakers and three early-career speakers are invited by the organizing committee; these speakers are chosen both for their eminence in their respective fields and their ability to provide meaningful introductions to complex topics for audiences with a wide range of mathematical backgrounds. Invitations for submissions by graduate students and undergraduate students will be issued in mid-February. Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by subject-specific committees composed of faculty at Eastern Illinois University. Up to 6 graduate students and between 12 and 15 undergraduates will be invited to make presentations, either as talks or in poster sessions. In addition to the talks and poster sessions, the conference provides opportunities for less formal interaction, including social events on Friday and Saturday nights. Our increased focus on incorporating undergraduates into professional life includes panel discussions from funded graduate students and early-career mathematicians covering important but seldom-discussed aspects of attending graduate school and pursuing an academic career in mathematics.<br/><br/>More information will be available at the conference website: https://ux1.eiu.edu/~gdt/2016.html"

The successfully constructed solutions will not only provide new theoretical results but also stimulate efficient numerical algorithms to compute solutions in multi-scale and stochastic dynamical systems. <br/><br/>More specifically, the PI intends to study the following problems rigorously. The first category of problems is to construct special dynamical structures for three kinds of hyperbolic PDEs, which include a system of nonlinear wave equations, the cubic focusing Schrodinger equation and quasilinear Schrodinger equation in high dimensions. All these problems have multiple spatio-temporal scales, which requires new mathematical ideas and analytical tools to handle. The next problem is to study the persistence of Sine-Gordon breather under multiplicative noise perturbation. The main aim is to understand the effect of stochastic forcing. A new method stemming from invariant manifold, random dynamical system and ergodic theory needs to be developed. The last problem in this project is to study the asymptotic behavior of solutions near some steady states for isentropic and non-isentropic compressible flows by using ideas of invariant manifold.

Particular attention will be paid to links with other areas of mathematics and other mathematical and physical sciences, which motivate most of the problems being considered. Since the number of free parameters in the underlying problem can often be related to the dimension of sets in the corresponding mathematical model, and since real-life problems usually involve very many parameters, the high-dimensional setting is of particular interest. This is especially true for quantum theory, where systems consisting of just several particles naturally lead to models whose dimension is from thousands to billions. While classical analysis of high-dimensional phenomena often suffers from the curse of dimensionality (the complexity of the problem explodes with the increase in dimension so that the question quickly ceases to be tractable), we may say that asymptotic geometric analysis exploits the blessing of dimensionality by identifying and exploiting ""approximate symmetries"", which become apparent only when the dimension is large. This project is an attempt to implement this philosophy in selected directions of research, most notably in those related to quantum information theory, the interdisciplinary area that provides theoretical underpinnings for the project of building a quantum computer,  which is one of the major scientific and technological challenges of the 21st century. Additionally, the project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in intensive research, thus contributing to development of human resources in science. In the same vein, one of the products of the project will be a book surveying the interface of asymptotic geometric analysis and quantum information theory, likewise contributing to the development of scientific base and infrastructure and to the promotion of interdisciplinarity. <br/><br/>Analysis is a study of functions, or relationships between quantities, and particularly of their regularity properties. Since very many naturally appearing relationships are linear or at least convex, a good understanding of convex functions and sets is a prerequisite for understanding those relationships.  The emphasis of the proposed research will be on the high-dimensional setting.  Sample research topics to be studied include: structural properties of high-dimensional convex sets and of high dimensional normed spaces, derandomization of various probabilistic constructions appearing in functional analysis, and problems motivated by links to operations research. Most notably, the project will address geometric questions related to quantum information theory and quantum computing, for example those related to the positive partial transpose property. The questions typically are (or can be) expressed in the language of the geometry of Banach spaces or of high-dimensional probability and are to be analyzed primarily by using the diverse methods that originated or were developed in those contexts."

The PI intends to investigate fundamental mathematical problems concerning the dynamics of black holes in the context of the initial value problem for the celebrated Einstein equations. One of the most outstanding problems in this direction is the black hole stability conjecture, namely that black holes are indeed stable under perturbations from the outside. The resolution of this conjecture would underpin the relevance of black holes in the physical theory. Previous works of the PI uncovered a novel instability property of the so-called extremal black holes under a special class of perturbations. This instability has been further studied by several research groups worldwide both from the point of view of rigorous mathematics and numerics. The PI will strive to provide a complete description for the stability and instability properties of extremal black holes, obtaining in particular mathematically rigorous results for associated physical phenomena predicted by numerical simulations. The project will also investigate important global aspects of the Einstein equations including radiative properties of gravitational waves. Work on this proposal will improve our society's understanding of black holes, and consequently the structure of our universe. <br/><br/>The focus of the project is the study of three central problems relating to local and global properties of hyperbolic partial differential equations arising in general relativity. First, the project will investigate the stability problem for extremal and sub-extremal black holes. In this direction, the PI and his collaborators have developed a new method in the context of spherical symmetry which addresses various difficulties at the event horizon and null infinity and is expected to have a wide range of applications in hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The PI intends to extend this method and also obtain finer boundedness and decay properties of linear waves in order to obtain global results for the black hole stability problem. This project will probe various instabilities in the extremal case which originate from the convergence of non-axisymmetric quasinormal modes to finite values on the real axis and the coupling of the so-called trapping effect and superradiance. These phenomena are of fundamental importance in black hole dynamics and have been the object of extensive numerical simulations in the physics literature, but no rigorous results are presently available. Second, the project will investigate the gluing problem for characteristic initial data of hyperbolic equations, which is an extension of the Riemannian gluing problem, the latter being intensively studied in geometric analysis. Finally the project will develop a scattering theory for the Einstein equations which is expected to provide new insights into the global behavior of the Einstein equations and in particular the study of gravitational waves. The PI strongly believes that the proposal will lead to the discovery of genuinely new analytical techniques applicable in a wider spectrum of problems in geometry, analysis, PDEs and mathematical physics."

We are now capable of gathering immense amounts of data, and so it is a central concern to develop quick and efficient ways of analyzing this data.  In many instances, one can endow the points of a data set with a notion of distance and weight, thereby giving us a geometric representation of the data.  One can then try to take advantage of this geometry and leverage this information to speed up computations on the data set.  This project seeks to develop new techniques and theorems for understanding the geometric and analytic structure of spaces with some notion of distance and (possibly) weight.  Some basic questions the project will address are the following: Can I represent my space in some other space (e.g. Euclidean space) so that the geometry is preserved with high fidelity?  Does my space exhibit low dimensional behavior despite living in a possibly high (or infinite) dimensional space?  Is there a calculus available on my space that I can use to analyze functions on the space?<br/><br/>This project will study analytic and geometric properties of certain classes of metric measure spaces.  In the first part of the project, the PI will study problems about metric embeddings including whether doubling subsets of Hilbert space embed into Euclidean spaces and developing biLipschitz metric invariants to measure uniform smoothness. The second part of the project will focus on detecting rectifiable behavior in metric measure spaces.  Rectifiable spaces admit parameterizations by simple model spaces (usually Euclidean space) and so can exhibit low dimensional behavior. The PI will study Carnot notions of rectifiability and also link these geometric properties to boundedness of singular integrals.  Finally, the PI will continue his study into the nature of Lipschitz differentiability on metric measure spaces as introduced by Cheeger.  The project will determine whether such differentiation differs between real valued and RNP Banach space valued functions. If these notions turn out to be different, the PI will then seek to discover the geometric mechanisms for the former (the PI has already been geometrically characterized the latter). The PI will also seek to broaden the differentiability theory to non-Banach space target."

Two examples under study are: (1) Eigenvalue statistics in the normal matrix model. The quest for universal behavior when the eigenvalues are accumulating in a two-dimensional region is in its infancy; this project aims to create connections between rigorous mathematical analysis and physical intuition developed over the last 20 years. (2) The asymptotic behavior of the partition function in the two-cut regime, for which ideas and conjectural formulae have existed for some time."

The PI employs Optimal Transport to study the Semi-Geostrophic System (and another, related model) arising from Atmospheric Science, and which is now recognized as a powerful prediction tool in Meteorology. Mathematical rigor is important for understanding predictability of weather systems and informs decisions made in operational modeling. Also at the center of this project is the analysis of the non-conventional (infinite-dimensional) Hamilton-Jacobi equations arising from Mean Field Games; this has applications to Economics and models interactions between large numbers of players/agents whose individual effect on the system is negligible.<br/><br/>The PI will focus on some systems of PDE from Fluid Dynamics and Plasma Physics, and on Hamilton- Jacobi equations in metric spaces of probability measures. The PI has done significant work on problems arising from a need to further validate and analyze these mathematical models, and the present proposal will outline plans to further investigate such issues. Herein is a brief description of the proposed research.  The Semi-Geostrophic (SG) and SG-Shallow-Water equations are difficult to analyze, with the basic question of existence of solutions in physical space still open. A physical change of variables has transferred the problem to the so-called dual space, yet pulling the solutions back to physical space has only very recently been achieved and only in special cases (first Lagrangian, then Eulerian in an even more restrictive setting, with little hope to extend the approach to the general case). Instead, a weaker solution (relaxed Lagrangian solution) has recently been obtained in full generality by the PI and a collaborator. Building on this previous work, the PI lays out a plan to prove existence and weak stability of weak Lagrangian solutions in full generality.  Dimensional blow-up limits of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in finite-dimensional spaces, or the limits of large systems of such equations (as appearing in Mean Field Games) lead to Hamilton-Jacobi equations in metric spaces of probability measures. Various notions of differentiability in the Wasserstein space have been circulated, and it is unclear how the corresponding notions of viscosity solutions are related. This issue may come from a loose interpretation of what viscosity solution means in this infinite-dimensional context. The PI will introduce the notion of consistent Hamiltonian and argue, backed by examples from applications, its ability to provide both uniqueness and a solid meaning for viscosity as related to vanishing viscosity. The embedding of finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces into the space of Borel probability measures used successfully by the PI in earlier collaborative work has provided important insight into the asymptotics of various PDE systems of nonstandard Hamiltonian type."

Despite its intuitive manifestations, the scientific understanding of turbulence is far from satisfactory. A related phenomenon is ""wave turbulence,"" which pertains to similar problems but for different physical systems involving wave interactions (e.g.,ocean or plasma waves). The aim of this project is to gain a better understanding of certain phenomena pertaining to wave turbulence from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint and thereby to take the first steps towards putting the theory on solid mathematical foundations.<br/><br/>The project addresses two different regimes of long-time behavior for nonlinear dispersive and wave partial differential equations. The first regime can be characterized by ""out-of-equilibrium dynamics,"" in which solutions do not exhibit long-time stability around equilibrium configurations. This is the typical behavior of nonlinear dispersive equations posed on compact domains, where dispersive effects do not translate to decay, and is the natural setting of wave turbulence theory. The other regime of long-time behavior concerns dispersive partial differential equations posed on Euclidean space, for which one can hope to have stable equilibrium points for the dynamics (stationary solutions). The ""asymptotic stability"" of trivial equilibria (zero solutions) is mostly well understood by now, but that of nontrivial stationary solutions is far from settled. The project suggests several avenues of research to improve our understanding in the two aforementioned directions."

Techniques and ideas from analysis area, such as elliptic estimates and Fourier analysis, will be combined and applied into this project. The proposed research should enhance the understanding of classical and Steklov eigenvalue problems, semilinear and higher order elliptic equations, wave equations, fractional Laplacians, fully nonlinear equations, etc.  Further research will be devoted to the study of quantitative uniqueness of parabolic differential equations and other important equations from mathematical physics.  Another related direction is the study of phase separations phenomenon in Bose-Einstein condensate. Emphasis will be placed on the two components Gross-Pitaevskki system.  An important part of proposed research is on eigenfunction and eigenvalue estimates. Techniques and insights in the various areas cross-fertilize  each other in a fruitful way in this area.

The investigator and collaborators previously studied special cases of this conjecture. This project will develop this direction further and will study applications of the universality conjecture to statistics, combinatorics, mathematical physics, and computer science, bringing together researchers from probability theory and these other fields.

Murray and John von Neumann as a vast generalization of matrix algebra necessary to capture the mathematical complexities of quantum mechanics by encoding the symmetries of the quantum mechanical system in roughly the same way that matrix algebra encodes the symmetries of classical mechanics and general relativity. Over the intervening decades it has been realized that von Neumann algebras represent the symmetries of many objects studied in the physical and biological sciences, leading to applications in diverse fields such as the theory of statistical mechanics, the structure of DNA molecules, the theory of error correcting codes, and the theory of quantum information theory and quantum computing. The building blocks of these symmetries are called ""factors."" The main goal of the theory of von Neumann algebras is to provide an effective classification of factors to understand how symmetries arise in these various settings. One approach is through so-called rigidity, where it is shown that a small, known group of symmetries actually describes the entire, vast set of symmetries of a factor. Another direction addresses the computability of the symmetries of a factor via the ability to simulate the factor in a computer by matrix algebras, what is known as the Connes embedding problem.<br/><br/>The last decade has seen a rapid growth in the understanding of the structure of factors, due to the development of deformation-rigidity theory that was initiated by Sorin Popa in the early 2000s. These results and approaches have additionally had a remarkable impact on the fields of measurable dynamics of groups, descriptive set theory of Polish group actions, probability theory, as well as on geometric group theory and coarse geometry. Working to develop and expand this theory, the principal investigator's research focuses on the connections between operator algebras, geometric and measurable group theory, Lie groups, and ergodic theory, specifically through the use of geometric deformations that were first investigated in work by the principal investigator and Ionut Chifan. The principal investigator is also interested in the application of logic and model-theoretic techniques to operator algebras. The project aims to achieve the following broad objectives: (1) to continue developing a perspective from which tools from Lie groups and geometric group theory can be used to classify the structure of and to demonstrate new examples of rigidity phenomena in the context of group and measure-measure space von Neumann algebras; (2) to find applications of these techniques to measurable group theory, probability theory, and the classification of C*-algebras; (3) to further explore and develop connections between continuous model theory and von Neumann algebras, C*-algebras, and the theory of operator systems with applications to the Connes embedding problem. The principal investigator will continue to teach advanced courses and organize seminars in operator algebras, working closely with graduate students to develop and foster talent and discovery. He will also continue to broadly and actively disseminate his research through publications, seminar and colloquium talks, and conferences and workshops, at both the national and international level."

In practice, the questions about solutions to these equations that we are interested in can be simple, such as what is the drag force of a boat with a given shape, or when nonlinear interference between different electro-magnetic waves becomes too serious. The answers to these simple questions can however be quite complicated, and usually depend on deep understanding of the underlying mathematical equations. These equations are nonlinear, for which our current understanding is still fundamentally incomplete. As is often the case, relatively few ``global quantities"" are already sufficient to provide satisfactory control on the most interesting aspects of the complicated solutions. It is an ultimate goal in many theoretic studies of nonlinear partial differential equations to find these quantities and the mechanism through which they control the solutions. These quantities can play an essential role in guiding practical applications of these fundamental equations, such as in the design of numerical schemes to calculate the solutions, by allowing us to focus on relatively few important parameters, while ignoring large amount of other non-essential parameters.<br/><br/>The projects on Navier Stokes focus on the following problems. 1. The regularity of axi-symmetric solutions with small initial swirl component. Since the other components can still be large, compactness arguments are not sufficient to obtain regularity and suitable dynamical control on the solution is needed.  2. The spectral assumption related to large scale invariant solutions. Such spectral assumption appears naturally in the study of large scale invariant solutions in the non-perturbative regime, and has profound applications in the uniqueness problem of Leray-Hopf weak solutions.  3. Large distance asymptotics of steady state solutions. For such problems, it is well documented that nonlinearity is important even for small solutions. The projects on energy critical nonlinear wave equations are centered around the soliton resolution conjecture for various models. For the focusing energy critical wave equation and energy critical wave map equations, the PI aims to prove the soliton resolution conjecture along a sequence of times in the non-radial case, based on recent partial results. The PI also aims to establish full soliton resolution under certain additional conditions, such as in the case of one bubble concentration, or in the radial case. Another model the PI plans to study is the defocusing energy critical wave equation with a trapping potential, in the non-radial case. In this case, basic questions such as the ``ground state conjecture"" are still open. More interestingly, it appears that one can now describe rigorously the generic and non-generic behavior of solutions in a non-perturbative regime. The PI plans to address some of these questions."

These typically depend upon many parameters and vary randomly on a small scale. In addition, often the available information (e.g., data used in weather prediction) is not exact (deterministic) but statistical (random), with large fluctuations. On macroscopic scales that are much larger than the ones of the heterogeneities, the models often exhibit an effective deterministic behavior, which is much simpler than the original one. The process of averaging such data is known as homogenization. Mathematically, this means that the original random problem is replaced by a deterministic one. When this averaging is not possible, which is typically the case when the fluctuations are too strong (wild), it is necessary to deal with so-called stochastic media (stochastic partial differential equations), which have rather singular behavior in space and time.  The mathematical study of both the stochastic averaging and the stochastic partial differential equations requires original ideas and the development of new methodologies, since both topics fall outside the traditional theories of averaging and partial differential equations.  Another burgeoning area of research in which similar issues surface is mathematical biology, where experiments at the molecular scale, as well as theoretical advances, have led to new, sophisticated mathematical models. Novel tools and ideas are needed to study these problems further and to validate all the relevant regimes/scales of the parameters affecting the experimentally observed and theoretically conjectured behaviors. <br/><br/>This project is directed at the development of general methodologies to study random homogenization, nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations, and applications to front propagation, phase transitions, and mathematical biology. Random environments are much more general than periodic ones. The latter basically involve fixed translations of a certain equation, whereas the former can be thought of as involving all possible (relevant) equations. This leads to considerable issues concerning the lack of compactness. It is therefore necessary to develop novel arguments that combine both the differential and random structures of the media under scrutiny. In this setting, the equation is the random variable and the special dependence signifies the location in space where the equation is observed. The principal investigator and his collaborators were the first to consider stochastic homogenization in stationary ergodic environments. A large part of the project is dedicated to further development of the theory.  Stochastic partial differential equations have coefficients with very singular (Brownian) behavior. In the linear context, this can usually be handled by known methods, such as the classical martingale approach. This method is based on the linear character of the higher order part of the equation and thus cannot be used for nonlinear problems, where it is necessary to find appropriate alternative notions of solutions. These, in the context of first- and second-order nonlinear equations, are the stochastic viscosity and pathwise entropy solutions that have been introduced by the principal investigator and his collaborators.  A part of the project is the study of the qualitative behavior/properties of these solutions. In the context of mathematical biology, the principal investigator plans to work on models of adaptation/selection as well as on models of the biology of development. The former concerns questions related to the adaptation of species to global change, the resistance of insects to pesticides, etc. The latter aims at developing models to study how positional information is provided to proliferating cells, the main questions being the formation and location of sharp and precise boundaries."

The classical theory of these operators was designed to work on smooth functions. However, nature often provides us with very irregular media with which to engage. This creates the need for a very low-regularity form of the theory of singular integrals, which the principal investigators on this project have constructed. A consequence of the low-regularity theory is that through the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a Euclidean space of a very high dimension, one can sometimes conclude that the set itself is of a much lower dimension than the ambient space, an important piece of information from the perspective of data science. To refine this approach to data analysis is one of the main goals of this project. <br/><br/>This project considers several problems in nonhomogeneous harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and spectral theory. The common theme uniting the problems is the behavior of singular operators with very good (Calderon-Zygmund) kernels in very bad environments (e.g., on sets with no a priori structure, in spaces with matrix weights). Specifically, the project will pursue the following avenues of research: (1) the David-Semmes problem to characterize the rectifiability of sets and measures in high-dimensional Euclidean space in terms of the boundedness of the corresponding Riesz transforms; (2) the geometry of reflection-less measures; (3) the geometric characterization of higher-dimensional analogues of positive analytic capacity; (4) two-weight estimates for very simple singular operators in the non-Hilbert setting; and (5) sharp estimates for classical operators with matrix weights. Singular integral operators with respect to bad measures and very irregular sets appear naturally in many problems of analysis. One of the reasons for their increasing interest in recent years has been the study of analytic capacity. While the theory for the two-dimensional case (i.e., the Cauchy transform on the complex plane) and the theory of analytic capacity that emerged as its by-product are now very well understood, the analogous theory in higher dimensions has not been fully developed. The main roadblock here is the lack of geometric tools in higher dimensions. Additionally, in higher dimensions, nonhomogeneous situations arise more often than in the plane and more often one might expect. For example, boundary value problems in (otherwise smooth) domains with cusps lead to nonhomogeneous problems, because, unlike what happens in the two-dimensional setting, surface measure on the boundary of such a domain is non-doubling. This becomes an even more vexing problem if one wants to consider harmonic measure estimates for domains on whose boundaries ""surface measure"" is practically arbitrary. This is an important issue that the project seeks to confront."

In signal processing, so-called one-bit sensing replaces the usual linear measurements of a signal by incorporating the sign of the measurement. There are two motivations for this.  First, the sign function is a basic type of nonlinearity, so results about it can represent a first step towards relaxing linearity in a number of significant settings. Second, in an important technological development, one-bit measurements can be done very frequently. Surprising experiments are using new methods that need theoretical justification, and in this context one-bit measurements have proven to be just as effective as linear ones.  <br/><br/>Topics in compressive sensing have an intimate relationship to questions in discrepancy theory, with one-bit sensing being the easiest place to uncover this relationship.  This raises a new set of questions in discrepancy theory, and brings to compressive sensing new techniques.  In particular, there are new tools to study lower bounds in the subject, which can reveal how effective the current random techniques are. Also, it can provide new approaches to sampling, such as the semi-random jittered sampling.  In analysis and number theory, the project will study discrete variants of maximal oscillatory singular integrals. The latter, in the continuous case, are already fascinating objects.  Passing to the discrete variants entails many additional complications that arise from subtle arithmetic structures.  The results established in the project will be the first of this type, hence will require novel techniques.  The new approach is a synthesis of breakthrough results of Bourgain and elemental methods in phase-plane analysis."

Mechanical systems achieve a state of lowest energy by giving off energy to the environment. Likewise, local disturbances in a thermodynamic system, such as temperature fluctuations in a room, tend to even out; i.e., the system relaxes towards a thermal equilibrium. However, there are instances where due to external influences, systems do not tend towards an equilibrium. A famous example is a piece of metal that is heated on one end and cooled at the other. In this case, the system does not relax into equilibrium but remains in a steady state as heat flows from the hot to the cold end. The objective of this proposal is to describe these states in terms of various mathematical models ranging from basic optimization problems to large systems of interacting agents.  We will consider optimization problems that are important in mathematics or ubiquitous in descriptions of physical phenomena, such as superconductivity. Our goal is to answer questions such as: How fast does a large system equilibrate or tend towards a steady state? What are the properties of these equilibria? If a system has some underlying symmetry, do equilibria have the same symmetry? The fascinating aspect of this research area is that problems run the gamut from ones that can be solved using standard methods to those that need considerable ingenuity for their solution. These characteristics also make it an ideal training ground for graduate students.<br/><br/>The analysis of systems out of equilibrium is still a wide open field; e.g., the interaction of a physical system with heat baths is not well understood. Such systems do not tend towards equilibrium but instead towards a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). The PI proposes to examine such phenomena within the frame work of master equations.  One of the research goals is to find Lyapunov functions that allow to control the approach towards an NESS. The investigation of such systems often leads to variational problems for the gap as well as for the entropy production, and their solution requires functional inequalities. It is important to prove these inequalities in their sharp form and to know all functions for which there is equality. One direction of research is to investigate such inequalities using flows which is the idea of  Lyapunov functions in reverse. This method has been successful in some highly non-trivial cases and it is expected that it will deliver not only sharp inequalities but also additional correction terms. The Polaron model which describes an electron interacting with the vibrations of a crystal, fits into this framework as well. This is one of the simplest examples of a quantum field theory. The strong coupling limit of the energy is well understood and it is proposed to study the more subtle problem, namely the strong coupling limit of the electron density."

The principal investigator plans to study cases where such a decomposition is not possible, or is not efficient enough, for example because the functions in question are no longer defined over intervals. The question is whether similar decompositions are possible in such cases, with the sines and cosines replaced by other functions of a simple structure. The goal is to use functions that mimic the structure of the sines and cosines, in one way or another, as good replacements for the trigonometric functions, which provide an excellent tool for studying properties of functions and the interrelationships between them. In particular, this project includes the development of efficient ways to sample, interpolate, and approximate signals.<br/><br/>The principal investigator and collaborators have recently shown that any finite union of intervals admits a Riesz basis of exponentials.  While a big advance in the area, there remain many aspects of the question that the principal investigator will study, such as clarifying whether this is a generic property of all sets of finite measure and understanding whether the result holds for Riesz bases with ""good bounds."" Further, she plans to study the benefits of using even weaker notions (e.g., frames, Riesz sequences) for the same purposes. Of particular interest is the relation between the study of such systems and the development of techniques to analyze sampling and interpolating sequences. Finally, the project will explore applications to Gabor systems in time-frequency analysis, for instance, possible extensions of the Balian-Low theorem and linear independence of Gabor elements."

Real world and engineering networks often have tens of thousands of components. Theory, developed by the principal investigator, allows one to compress networks of any type into much smaller networks while preserving important information about the initial large network.  In the proposed project, this theory will be further developed.  And, in collaboration with Center for Disease Control (CDC) researchers, applied to an analysis of transmission and cross-immunoreactivity networks for Hepatitis C.  Cross-immunoreactivity means that antibodies produced by the immune system to fight some specific type of viruses sometimes fights other types of viruses as well.  Cross-immunoreactivity is found for Hepatitis C, influenza, dengue, and is a basis for a mathematical model developed by the author with CDC colleagues.  Traditional views on evolution of systems with complex dynamics suggest that only long term predictions for such systems are possible, since one should wait until the system stabilizes.  A new approach, proposed by the principal investigator, allows one to make short term predictions on the evolution of chaotic systems.  It will be possible to answer questions such as, ""which state of the system is most likely?"".  This research will extend this approach to a larger class of systems with complex dynamics and also address problem of recurrence.  Understanding of a fundamental mechanism of chaos, called defocusing, will be essentially extended. Discovery of this mechanism by the principal investigator has already found numerous applications in theoretical and experimental physics. New visual models of systems with various types of chaotic behavior can be included into basic and advanced courses on complex systems and chaos.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses some long standing and technically challenging, as well as new natural problems, in the theory of dynamical systems and statistical mechanics. A new area of finite time qualitative properties of dynamical and stochastic systems, pioneered by the principal investigator, will be further developed.  This will make use of combinations of methods and ideas of symbolic dynamics, discrete mathematics and probability.  The theory of isospectral transformation of networks will be further developed with a special emphasis on analysis of attractors of sequences of such transformations in the space of networks.  Understanding the mechanism of defocusing, a fundamental mechanism of hyperbolicity (chaos), will be advanced.  This uses new classes of chaotic billiards where focusing components are not forced to be far from each other.   Classical Ehrenfests' gas will be shown to have unexpected properties thanks to a new observation that billiards with a point and with a finite size particle can have quite different dynamics."

For example, a theorem of Emmy Noether states that symmetries of physical systems, like time and space translation, correspond to conserved quantities, like energy and momentum, respectively. Von Neumann, in his study of quantum mechanics, discovered that certain operator algebras on Hilbert space describe symmetries of quantum systems. These von Neumann algebras are built from basic building blocks called factors. A subfactor is an inclusion of factors, and its representation theory encodes quantum symmetries. In the classical setting, the symmetries of a particular object form a group, like the collection of symmetries of a square or of a molecule. When one passes from the classical setting to the quantum setting, these groups are replaced by so-called quantum groups and tensor categories. Unitary tensor categories arise naturally in the study of subfactors, and in return, subfactor theory provides a wealth of techniques for classification and construction of examples. Moreover, the quantum doubles of unitary fusion categories are unitary modular categories, which are vital to research in topological phases of matter and topological quantum computation.<br/><br/>The first aim of this project is the classification of subfactors and fusion categories. The small index subfactor classification program has seen recent success classifying up to index five, and the principal investigator will raise this index bound slightly above five. To raise the bound even further, up towards six, new techniques and obstructions are necessary. The project will also develop more techniques for studying infinite index subfactors, where there are relatively few results. The second aim is developing deeper connections between subfactors and free probability, C*-algebras, noncommutative geometry, and conformal field theory (CFT).  Recent work of Guionnet, Jones, and Shlyakhtenko developed a connection between subfactors, random matrices, and free probability. With Hartglass, the principal investigator developed this connection, discovering new connections to C*-algebras and noncommutative geometry via work of Pimsner and Voiculescu. The project will continue to investigate these new developments. Finally, conformal nets on the circle intimately relate subfactors and CFT.  In joint work with Henriques and Tener, the principal investigator will study conformal planar algebras, which are a common generalization of Jones's subfactor planar algebras and genus-zero Segal CFT. Tener and the principal investigator anticipate a classification in terms of module categories for the representation category of this CFT. They also conjecture the subfactor/planar algebra duality extends to a duality between conformal planar algebras and certain morphisms in the 3-category of conformal nets."

The equation has also found applications in many other area of science and engineering such as astrophysics and image processing.  In addition to its significance in advancing knowledge in mathematics and other sciences, the Allen-Cahn equation provides an excellent tool for training students and junior researchers in interdisciplinary research.

Singularities can range anywhere from black holes in astrophysics to turbulence in fluid mechanics to the accumulation of cancer cells in biomedical research. Such physical phenomena are often described by differential equations that involve time and space. Studying the qualitative behavior of the solutions of these equations frequently deepens one's understanding of the related physical problems. To study a singularity of a solution one uses a so-called blow-up procedure that allows one to focus attention near the singularity and to exploit the scaling properties that the differential equation enjoys. Because of the change in the scaling of space and time, this process leads to a new solution that is defined for all space and time, in other words to a ""global solution."" The classification of global solutions, when possible, sheds new insight into the singularity and thus into the underlying physical phenomenon. <br/> <br/>This project addresses the questions of existence, uniqueness, and  qualitative behavior of global solutions to nonlinear geometric elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations.

The first of these is the mathematical problem of recovering the structure of the Earth from seismic measurements. The project takes into account that the Earth is best modeled as an elastic medium; that it consist of several cores, and that it is anisotropic (i.e., that the speed of seismic signals can depend on the direction).  A second problem is motivated by applications to cosmology: to determine the stage of the early Universe, to the extent possible, from the cosmic microwave background radiation measurements. Finally, the principal investigator will study the mathematics of new medical imaging methods that use two different waves to form an image: one wave (electromagnetic, for example) is sent to the human body to excite the cells, which creates another type of wave (acoustic, for example) that one measures away from the body. In all the aforementioned examples, one is especially interested in solving local problems using local information: when measurements are done locally (say, on some part of the boundary of the relevant domain), one's desire is to recover the object locally, as well. Indeed, in many practical applications such measurements can only be done locally, and very often one is interested in the object under scrutiny only in a region near the point where the measurement is taken. The goal is to understand how much information is included in the measured data, to determine how sensitive such information is to noise and measurement errors, and to devise a means of using this data to reconstruct the object.  <br/><br/>More specifically, the project will pursue the following avenues of research: (1) recovery of a Riemannian metric, up to isometry, on a compact manifold with boundary near a strictly convex boundary point from localized lens/distance boundary data; (2) recovery of a Lorentzian metric up to a gauge transformation from boundary measurements; (3) recovery of both types of metrics from wave equation data on the boundary; (4) solving the inverse problem for the elastic geophysics model with piecewise smooth Lame parameters; (5) inversion of the geodesic and the light ray transforms; and (6) solving inverse source problems that arise in medical imaging. Theses include both linear and nonlinear problems, from well-posed to mildly ill-posed to ill-posed. The aim is to recover the leading term in the underlying hyperbolic equation, which determines the geometry. Unlike much previous work in the area, this project allows for the existence of conjugate points, albeit modulo some additional geometric assumptions. The problem of local recovery a Riemannian metric in boundary/lens rigidity, up to isometry, is very challenging because simple linearization does not work, and there is inherent nonuniqueness. The principal investigator expects to combine ideas from tensor tomography, Melrose's scattering calculus, and other new ideas to deal with the nonlinearity. His methods would prove global uniqueness and stability as well, under the condition that the manifold admits a strictly convex foliation. Existence of conjugate points is not excluded. The inverse problems in time-space, including the integral geometry ones, lack ellipticity because only space-like singularities are recoverable. This makes the problem ill-posed. The light ray transform is a restricted ray transform, requiring specialized microlocal tools, not even fully developed yet for nonflat metrics. Those problems are of interest in geometry (where they are called rigidity problems), in the part of the theory of partial differential equations known as inverse kinematic and inverse boundary-value problems, and in applications like geophysics."

One of the fundamental issues when converting an analog (continuous) signal to a digital (discrete) one is the following question: Can the original signals be recovered from the samples, and if so, how accurately? The answer, of course, depends heavily on the nature of the signals that are being processed. For example, signals that are more complex (oscillatory) in nature require more samples for accurate reconstruction. The precise mathematical relationship between the rate of oscillation and the required rate of sampling is surprisingly delicate, especially when the samples are non-uniform. This project is centered on the problem of understanding precisely this relationship, including several other mathematical questions that arise naturally from it. <br/><br/>Analytic function spaces have always played an important role in the mathematical theory of signal processing. One natural class of such spaces that is particularly useful when studying non-uniform sampling is the class of de Branges spaces. Introduced in the sixties, the theory of de Branges spaces encompassed a great deal of mathematical analysis knowledge at that time, and it continues to play an important role in modern mathematics, providing a setting for the interplay of various areas of mathematics, including Fourier analysis, spectral theory, operator theory, random matrix theory, analytic number theory, and mathematical physics. The main research objective of this project is to conduct a deeper analysis of de Branges function spaces, and use the resulting findings to attack and resolve several long-standing open problems. Many of these problems are much more general in nature and go far beyond the setting of de Branges spaces. The reason that de Branges spaces serve as a model rests on the fact that this class of spaces already exhibits most of the key difficulties confronting signal processors. Another important goal of this project is to develop a theory that will unify the theory of classical function spaces, and use this unification as a guideline for developing new methods for resolving the remaining open questions about these spaces."

IWOTA brings together mathematicians from around the world in both pure and applied areas (related to the field of operator theory) for the purposes of collaborating, sharing new research, and educating graduate students and early career researchers.  IWOTA 2016 makes a special effort to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics through its selection of speakers and its designation as a conference conducted ""in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics.""  The funds for this grant will be used to support the travel of main speakers as well as graduate students and early career researchers.<br/><br/>IWOTA has two main scientific goals.  First, it serves as a meeting place for mathematicians in the field of operator theory.  Many of the main speakers of the conference are experts in operator theory with recent innovations to share with the broader community.  The conference has numerous special sessions to allow subgroups within operator theory (such as free analysis/probability, applied harmonic analysis, and systems and function theory) to collaborate.  Second, IWOTA has always had the goal of increasing the interaction of pure operator theorists, applied mathematicians, and engineers.

In this project, the principal investigator will endeavor to understand, in a quantitative way, the effects of curvature on such decompositions.  For example, in medical imaging, X-rays are passed through a body, and one reconstructs the density function of the body by measuring how much of the X-radiation is absorbed or scattered.  Mathematically, this process is represented by an operator, known as the X-ray transform, which averages functions along straight-line paths.  The principal investigator is working on a project that seeks to understand what happens when averages are taken along curved paths.  It is known that sufficient curvature of the paths leads to greater stability of the output, and the project aims to quantify the stabilizing effect in an intermediate case where the paths are curved, but may have flat regions.  As another example, the Fourier transform expresses a natural signal as a superposition of constant velocity waves.  If the velocities lie on a plane, then they are all aligned, and, like ocean waves formed by a steady breeze, the signal does not decay.  But if the wave velocities lie on a curved surface, such as the surface of a ball, then there is some decay.  Precisely measuring this decay is an important question in harmonic analysis, the answer to which is unknown.  The principal investigator's research lies at the interface between these situations, when the velocities lie on a surface that is nearly planar in some regions and curved in others, and she seeks to precisely quantify the rate of decay.  Such questions have potential implications to partial differential equations that arise in the study of quantum mechanics. <br/><br/>The principal investigator will study curvature-related problems arising in Euclidean harmonic analysis, as well as some applications to dispersive partial differential equations.  This work will encompass three directions.  One is to prove new, curvature-independent bounds for the restriction of the Fourier transform to manifolds whose curvature vanishes along some nonempty set; another is to prove analogous results for averaging operators; finally, she will study extremizer problems and concentration compactness techniques, some having applications to partial differential equations.  As part of this project, the principal investigator will organize conferences to facilitate the dissemination of mathematical knowledge and will make a dedicated effort to improve graduate training in harmonic analysis and to increase the participation of underrepresented groups, especially women."

One example is the problem of modeling melting ice, where the interface of ice and water is determined dynamically by the distribution of temperature (i.e., the solution of the heat equation) in the water region. This project addresses some fundamental questions concerning free-boundary problems, such as the existence and long-time behavior of solutions. This is an important topic, since without a proper mathematical theory it is difficult to develop accurate and trustworthy numerical methods for dealing with concrete physical problems. A good example is the problem of liquid drops sliding on a tilted surface. In this case the shape of the drop can change drastically when the velocity is increased, and a singularity (corner) develops at the rear of the drop when the velocity exceeds a certain critical value. At higher speeds the tail of the drop may break into another component (pearling). Accurate modeling of the motion of drops is therefore a highly complex question in fluid mechanics, with many important applications in engineering. Another example is in the crowd motion of individuals or cars in congested areas exiting through part of the boundary of the confining domain (e.g., a room or a highway); in these examples, the exit pattern is heavily influenced by the shape of the domain as well as the location of the exit. The project aims towards a better understanding of the properties of these problems and seeks to provide a framework for developing accurate computer-based numerical simulations of the processes. <br/><br/>The problems studied in this project arise in a variety of physical phenomena, including the phase change between liquid and solid, the motion of capillary drops, congested crowd motion, and tumor growth. Particular focus will be on the asymptotic behavior of solutions starting with general initial data, either in the context of homogenization and long-time behavior or in the ""stiff-pressure"" limit of nonlinear diffusion. In addition to standard methods in partial differential equations, such as integral estimates, it will often be necessary to introduce geometric methods to understand the pointwise behavior of the moving interface. The first part of the project concerns volume-preserving geometric motions and their large-time behavior. The challenge lies in possible topological changes of the interface caused by the merging and splitting of fronts. For this reason most results in this area hold only for convex surfaces. The principal investigator will introduce a modified version of the moving-planes method to investigate a more general class of interfaces and to study their convergence to equilibrium. The second subproject concerns the evolution of capillary drops on a flat or tilted surface in the quasi-static approximation regime. While many models have been proposed in the study of dynamic capillary drops, the analysis of such models is still in its early stages, due the wide range of behavior with respect to parameters such as the roughness of the surface or the volume of the drop. The aim here is to address the well-posedness and long-time behavior of solutions in various regimes, to classify possible singularities, and to investigate the process's transitional behavior upon the change of parameters. The principal investigator also proposes to study the emergence of congested zones in collective motions, for example the evolution of jammed regions in crowd motions with a density constraint, or tumor growth in the motion of cancer cells with anti-crowding pressure. The plan is to characterize the motion law of the congested zones as well as to investigate the stability and long-time behavior of the solutions. Finally, the principal investigator proposes to study interface homogenization problems in random media, where the inhomogeneity is present either in the advection vector field or in the latent heat. The goal is to understand how the inhomogeneities in the system interact with the geometry of the interfaces to affect the macroscopic behavior of the solutions. New approaches will be introduced to the investigation, using tools such as energy estimates and concentration inequalities."

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies. <br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

Banach spaces, in particular function spaces and sequence spaces, are an important tool used either directly or indirectly in scientific fields such as engineering and physics. Hilbert spaces, which are a special type of Banach spaces, and operators acting on such spaces, provide a theoretical framework that can be used to study problems in quantum mechanics and computer science. Therefore, there exists potential practical value in studying the fairly abstract notion of a Banach space and its space of operators. The project is centered around the study of old problems, as well as ones that have emerged from recent developments in the theory. Although it is formulated in terms of Banach space theory, many of the problems studied are related to other areas of mathematics, such as descriptive set theory and operator theory. The solution of those problems will require the combination of techniques from such areas as combinatorics, set theory and topology.<br/><br/>The project revolves around the investigation of a variety of problems. Emphasis is given on the local and asymptotic behavior of basic sequences, which can in fact have far reaching implications in the properties of operators on certain spaces. Some notions that are studied are those of spreading models, finite block representability, and script-L-infinity spaces. As already mentioned, one of the main intentions is to deduce properties of operators. There are two main approaches that can be used in this setting. The first one is the construction of spaces with hereditary heterogeneous asymptotic structure. This method was previously used by the principal investigator and S. Argyros to construct the first example of a separable reflexive Banach space with the invariant subspace property. The question as to whether the separable Hilbert space has this property as well, is one of the central problems of operator theory, in fact of mathematics. Further study of this method can possibly yield further examples of spaces which resemble Hilbert spaces, for example uniformly convex spaces, with the invariant subspace property. The second approach is related to the study of script-L-infinity spaces. This approach is based on the method developed by S. Argyros and R. Haydon to construct the first known Banach space with the scalar-plus-compact property. This means that every bounded linear operator on this space is a compact perturbation of a scalar multiple of the identity. This method has its roots in a construction of J. Bourgain and F. Delbaen. Further study of this method may lead to the characterization of spaces with the aforementioned property."

Traditionally, most optical designs have been rotationally symmetric because of manufacturing limitations and production costs. With the development of computer-controlled precision machines, optical devices that are not necessarily symmetric, called free-form or aspherical, can be manufactured. In particular, with the recent advances in additive or three-dimensional manufacturing, free-form lenses can also be made. The design of lenses and mirrors is currently made computationally with ray tracing (i.e., by software calculating the trajectory of the light rays), in which choices are based upon educated guesses. This project is concerned with the development of mathematical methods for the design of lenses, mirrors, and antennas. It provides a better understanding than past approaches of the design problems and enables one to adapt the solutions to the needs required for any specific application. It develops models that are physically more accurate than earlier ones and takes into account, for example, internal reflection.  The project addresses theoretical aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations with concrete problems in optics and photonics.   In addition, the principal investigator is concerned with the mathematical descriptions of the loss of energy due to bending in waveguides, chromatic aberration for lenses, and variations of refractive indices in materials, in particular, negative refraction. A part of the research concerns the development of an algorithm for the numerical calculation of lenses.<br/><br/>The problems are described by partial differential equations involving the output and input intensities and other parameters depending on the models. The goals are concerned with existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of the solutions. The methods used derive from the mathematical fields of optimal mass transportation, optimization, and nonlinear partial differential equations of a specific type, called Monge-Ampere-type equations. The techniques include lower and upper estimates of various gradient maps and strict convexity analysis. Partial differential equations appear naturally because the interface surface one looks for has the property that the ratio between the energy sent and received over a small area can be expressed in terms of the input and output energy densities. This yields an equation involving second derivatives of the unknown surface. The development of an algorithm for the numerical calculation of lenses requires establishing Lipschitz estimates for the associated functionals. Furthermore, as waveguides of size comparable to the wavelength of radiation are electromagnetic in nature, the proposal blends with the study of Maxwell's equations in discontinuous and anisotropic media."

Nonlinear effects are precisely those that generate interactions between such waves.  The principal objective of this project is to study models that combine both phenomena.  However, it has become evident that further progress on these problems requires a deeper understanding of the purely dispersive effects; correspondingly, a significant fraction of the project is directed toward this goal.  In particular, the principal investigator will focus on situations where the dispersive behavior is complicated either by taking place in a region of finite extent or in a heterogeneous medium.  Although the project focuses on simple models, these embody fundamental hurdles appearing much more broadly in the theory of wave motion.  All the models under consideration can arise as mechanical systems.  It has recently been discovered that, at least for finite systems of particles, this places considerable restrictions on the possible behavior, far beyond those discovered in the nineteenth century; however, the full nature of these restrictions is poorly understood.  Part of the project is to exhibit (for the first time) such restrictions for equations modeling infinite systems of particles, spread over an infinite volume.<br/><br/>The project concerns several topics in dispersive partial differential equations, both linear and nonlinear.  Strichartz estimates encapsulate much about the linear flow in a manner well-adapted to the nonlinear theory.  Further study of such estimates in the setting of Schrodinger equations on compact manifolds will be undertaken, building on recent dramatic advances, including those of Bourgain and Demeter.  The treatment of scaling-critical nonlinear equations requires one to understand not just estimates for the linear flow, but also the defects of compactness therein.  Toward this direction, the principal investigator seeks to obtain mass-critical profile decompositions for models with nonconstant coefficients, building on some initial successes in this direction.  Turning now to truly nonlinear questions, nonsqueezing results will be sought in two distinct infinite-volume settings.  Recall that nonsqueezing is a peculiar property of general finite-dimensional Hamiltonian flows uncovered by Gromov saying that no ball can flow wholly into a cylinder whose (symplectic) cross-section has lesser radius.  Past work has been restricted to tori, which aids significantly in the development of finite dimensional approximations.  Due to substantial differences in the nature of complete integrability, the low-regularity theory of the Korteweg-de Vries equation is further advanced on the torus than on the whole line.  The project seeks to make some inroads on the low-regularity problem for the line, building on a recently developed method for global control of Sobolev/Besov norms that works simultaneously in both geometries."

A central topic in the research of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations is the smoothness of solutions under various regularity assumptions on coefficients and domains. Many equations and systems from physics and engineering involve discontinuous coefficients or domains with sharp corners or cusps, or even fractal structures. For instance, fiber-reinforced materials may have fiber inclusions that are very closely spaced and may even touch. In such cases, much of the classical theory of partial differential equations is no longer applicable. Another research topic of major importance is hydrodynamic turbulence in fluid and gas dynamics. The study of turbulence leads to new ideas in scientific computing, differential equations, and statistics, and it has been characterized as one of the most fascinating problems in fluid mechanics.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will carry out research closely related to the aforementioned topics and will attempt to address some of the open problems in these areas. He will focus his attention on several projects that can be gathered into three main topical areas. First, the project will develop new methods to study certain elliptic equations associated with composite materials (e.g., elasticity problems, conductivity problems). The principal investigator is particularly interested in the fine regularity of solutions to these equations, including higher-order regularity and more quantitative derivative estimates. Second, the project will explore nonstandard Sobolev estimates for local (or nonlocal) nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations with irregular coefficients or kernels, in possibly irregular domains. Finally, the project will investigate well-posedness and regularity issues for certain deterministic and stochastic fluid equations such as the magnetohydrodynamics equations."

Mixing due to motion of a liquid or gaseous medium in which reactive processes occur is frequently an important component in their dynamics, and is also relevant to other processes, such as reliable manufacturing of glasses and alloys. This motion may be subject to fluid turbulence, the effects of which are of paramount importance in many areas of physics and engineering. The central aim of this project is a better understanding of the long term behavior of these physical processes through the analytical study of their mathematical models, which are expressed in the form of partial differential equations. The main questions addressed will be the question of dependence of the speed of spreading of reactive processes on the properties and structure of combustive media in which they occur; the question of how an underlying mixing process can enhance this speed and which types of mixing are most efficient at achieving this; and the question of spontaneous development of turbulence and unexpected singular behaviors in the motion of fluids. The goal is to obtain mathematically rigorous results which can also shed further light on the dynamical behavior of the actual physical processes being modeled. <br/><br/>This research project studies mathematical models of several important physical processes, which include reactive processes, fluid dynamics, and mixing. The models are given by linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular, by reaction-diffusion equations, transport equations, and equations of fluid dynamics. The main interest is in the long term dynamics of their solutions as well as in the formation of singularities. The goal of the reaction-diffusion portion of the project is the understanding and description of long term dynamics of reactive processes spreading through inhomogeneous media in one and several dimensions, including existence of traveling fronts, asymptotic convergence of general solutions to them, and homogenization of solutions in random media. The goal of the mixing portion of the project is the study of mixing efficiency of flows and the search for those which are best at mixing substances advected by them. The goal of the fluid dynamics portion of the project is the study of turbulence, particularly creation of small scales and finite time singularity formation in models of fluid and atmospheric motion in two dimensions. Another goal of the research is the study of active combustion, where all three of these processes come together due to a direct feedback of the reaction on fluid motion via the buoyancy force. Models incorporating such feedback involve reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid dynamics equations, and the focus will be on existence and stability of traveling fronts and on gravity-induced mixing. To address these questions, the research will make use of techniques recently developed by the investigator and collaborators, as well as the development of new methods capable of further advancing understanding of the dynamical behavior of reactive processes."

The classical theory of these operators was designed to work on smooth functions. However, nature often provides us with very irregular media with which to engage. This creates the need for a very low-regularity form of the theory of singular integrals, which the principal investigators on this project have constructed. A consequence of the low-regularity theory is that through the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a Euclidean space of a very high dimension, one can sometimes conclude that the set itself is of a much lower dimension than the ambient space, an important piece of information from the perspective of data science. To refine this approach to data analysis is one of the main goals of this project. <br/><br/>This project considers several problems in nonhomogeneous harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and spectral theory. The common theme uniting the problems is the behavior of singular operators with very good (Calderon-Zygmund) kernels in very bad environments (e.g., on sets with no a priori structure, in spaces with matrix weights). Specifically, the project will pursue the following avenues of research: (1) the David-Semmes problem to characterize the rectifiability of sets and measures in high-dimensional Euclidean space in terms of the boundedness of the corresponding Riesz transforms; (2) the geometry of reflection-less measures; (3) the geometric characterization of higher-dimensional analogues of positive analytic capacity; (4) two-weight estimates for very simple singular operators in the non-Hilbert setting; and (5) sharp estimates for classical operators with matrix weights. Singular integral operators with respect to bad measures and very irregular sets appear naturally in many problems of analysis. One of the reasons for their increasing interest in recent years has been the study of analytic capacity. While the theory for the two-dimensional case (i.e., the Cauchy transform on the complex plane) and the theory of analytic capacity that emerged as its by-product are now very well understood, the analogous theory in higher dimensions has not been fully developed. The main roadblock here is the lack of geometric tools in higher dimensions. Additionally, in higher dimensions, nonhomogeneous situations arise more often than in the plane and more often one might expect. For example, boundary value problems in (otherwise smooth) domains with cusps lead to nonhomogeneous problems, because, unlike what happens in the two-dimensional setting, surface measure on the boundary of such a domain is non-doubling. This becomes an even more vexing problem if one wants to consider harmonic measure estimates for domains on whose boundaries ""surface measure"" is practically arbitrary. This is an important issue that the project seeks to confront."

The search for a mathematical apparatus capable of handling these dual aspects in a unified manner motivated the foundation of noncommutative geometry. In this young field of mathematics, the classical concept of a space formed of points labeled by numerical coordinates is replaced by a qualitatively more general paradigm, in which the algebra of coordinates consists of bounded operators (observables) that do not necessarily commute under the natural multiplication. The geometry of a noncommutative space is encoded in an unbounded operator, whose inverse plays the role of the line element in classical geometry, which interacts with the observables in a bounded fashion. With innate spatial intuition rendered inoperative by the forfeit of commutativity, even the most basic geometric notions, such as locality, symmetry, and curvature, have to undergo a drastic conceptual metamorphosis. Helpful hints come from physics, where the first two appear in quantum field theory as the high-energy limit and gauge symmetry, respectively, while the last is the very manifestation of gravity in Einstein's general relativity. This project aims to deepen the conceptual understanding of the above triad of notions in the noncommutative framework, as well as to develop effective mathematical tools for their quantitative measurement. Besides relevance for physics, the envisaged developments hold a proven potential of having applications in geometry and topology.<br/><br/>The first part of the project, building on recent work of the principal investigator and collaborators, will apply the enhanced pseudodifferential calculus for C*-dynamical systems to a host of problems involving curvature calculations for concrete noncommutative spaces, such as the noncommutative tori of arbitrary dimension. The second subproject will refine the higher index pairing between elliptic operators and Alexander-Spanier cocycles on a closed manifold and extend it to a pairing defined over the algebra of bounded pseudo-differential operators. In particular, this will yield an upgraded version of the Helton-Howe integral formula for the trace of the totally antisymmetric commutator of an n-tuple of Toeplitz operators, promoting it to a full-fledged index theorem. It will also extend Perrot's formula for the periodic cyclic cohomology class of the Radul cocycle, as well as the vanishing of the periodic cyclic cohomology class of the Wodzicki residue. The third project concerns a new Hopf algebra K(n) that presents the advantage of acting directly on the noncommutative space of leaves of any foliation rather than on its frame bundle. Its Hopf cyclic cohomology captures all transverse Chern classes, but misses the secondary classes. The goal is to construct an enhanced, topological version of the Hopf algebra K(n), whose Hopf cyclic cohomology will serve as a universal receptacle for all the geometric characteristic classes of foliations. In addition, this part of the project seeks to express these classes in terms of explicit Hopf cyclic cocycles and employ the concrete representations to derive geometric and topological consequences."

Discrete metric geometry, including dimension reduction that has been established by the PI and a collaborator, is important in the design of algorithms and in compressed sensing. Work on the classification of operators that are commuters was originally motivated by the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics (which, from a mathematical point of view, arises because multiplication of operators, unlike multiplication of numbers, is not commutative). Nonlinear phenomenon often occurs in nature but is difficult to deal with.  This makes it important to understand when non linearity actually conceals underlying linear structure, and this is central to the nonlinear study of Banach spaces. Parts of this research project are coordinated with the Workshop in Analysis and Probability Theory at Texas A&M University, of which the PI is Associate Director. The Workshop encourages interactions among researchers and apprentices in different mathematical fields by bringing together graduate students and junior and senior postdoctoral participants in several areas of analysis. Activities of the Workshop include seminars, Concentration Weeks, introductory lectures, and an annual conference.  The efforts of the principal investigators and other participants in the Workshop are helping to break down barriers between different areas of mathematics and also promote the outreach of pure mathematics to other sciences, especially to computer science.<br/><br/>The problems in Banach space and metric geometry to be considered fall into several subcategories: commutators of operators on Banach spaces, approximation properties of Banach spaces, the structure of finite and infinite dimensional spaces of p-integrable functions, the nonlinear classification of Banach spaces, discrete metric geometry,  quantitative linear algebra, and cluster value problems in an infinite dimensional setting.  These topics are at the heart of the geometries of Banach spaces and of metric spaces and make contact with many other areas within mathematics, including operator theory, group theory, geometric analysis, and linear algebra, as well as with other areas of science, including the design of algorithms and compressed sensing."

One aspect of the research pursued in this project provides the mathematical foundation for the study of light and sound waves. Fourier analysis continues to play a significant role in deepening one's understanding of the equations that model this behavior. In particular, these investigations yield further insight as to how the presence of a hard boundary surface influences the development of waves. For example, if one listens to the symphony in an auditorium, the sounds heard are affected by the manner in which the acoustic waves reflect off the walls. In this sense, it can be important to understand how the shape of the hall influences its acoustics. While this is, of course, a classical problem, there is more to be understood in terms of how these interactions influence dispersive properties. Moreover, this line of work is important in the analysis of closely related nonlinear equations arising from fiber optics, relativity, and water waves, where there is much to be done in understanding and limiting the various types of instabilities that can occur.  A second aspect of this research project seeks to understand the link between geometry and the behavior of vibrational modes.  This is closely related to so-called Chladni plates, where one vibrates a metal plate with sand on it and studies the patterns formed by the accumulation of sand, corresponding to the lines on which the plate does not move.  Here it is interesting to consider how the shape of the plate influences the patterns that evolve and to estimate their length.  These investigations are closely related to themes in quantum chaos and semiclassical analysis.<br/><br/>This mathematical research project in harmonic analysis seeks to understand dispersive properties of light, sound, and quantum waves in various settings such as in curved backgrounds, in nonhomogeneous media, and in the presence of boundary conditions.  These dispersive properties are, in turn, influenced by the behavior of paths of least action, so the approaches here rely partially on methods in microlocal analysis, where one seeks to understand such wave propagation in phase space.  This wave behavior can be modeled by solutions to partial differential equations, possibly satisfying certain boundary conditions.  Of particular interest is to understand how dispersive properties affect basic regularity estimates for solutions to these equations.  These regularity estimates actually stem from Fourier restriction theory, and in particular from the classical theorems of Stein, Tomas, and Strichartz.  While the non-Euclidean character of these problems means that the classical Fourier transform is not directly applicable, harmonic analysis is nonetheless fundamental to the proposed research.  Indeed, the common methods employed by the principal investigator for understanding wave propagation such as Fourier integral operators, the Hadamard parametrix, and wave-packet methods, rely on Fourier analysis to a strong degree. Moreover, the oscillatory integrals that arise in applying these methods are very close to those encountered in harmonic analysis, hence the research here deepens our understanding of the classical theory."
