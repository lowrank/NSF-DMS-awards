The dominant themes in this research will               be a noncommutative Riemann-Roch theorem, higher index                          invariants, connections with arithmetic algebraic geometry via                  noncommutative differential geometry in positive characteristic,                and quantization of homological algebras in a direction parallel                to quantum groups.                                                                   Differential geometry can be thought of as calculus on                     manifolds.  These are surfaces and their higher dimensional                     analogues.  The algebra of differentiation operators on the                     manifold can be further abstracted until there is no manifold                   left but just the algebra.  This is the far reaching                            generalization of differential geometry called noncommutative                   differential geometry.  The area draws on and nourishes all the                 major fields of mathematics:  algebra, geometry and analysis."
