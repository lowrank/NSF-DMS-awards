While the basic scientific question ""What are the effects of disorder?"" is always relevant, it is particularly urgent today in the context of quantum systems due to the recent advent of noisy, intermediate scale quantum devices.  The aim of this project is to deepen our theoretical and mathematical understanding of disorder effects in key models of the quantum evolution of ""open"" quantum systems, with non-negligible environment interactions.  The equations studied in this project arise in the theory of disordered materials and quantum information science but are of general interest because of the fundamental nature of both wave motion and disorder. Progress in understanding the solutions to these equations will improve basic understanding of models of theoretical physics and applied mathematics. The project will entail extensive opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The project is a program of research on the effects of disorder in models of quantum system models, and will focus on three main investigations: 1) Evolution of ergodic quantum processes. Building on the recent discovery, by the PI and his collaborator, of a general ergodic theorem in the context of open quantum systems, this investigation will aim to bring the tools of probability and ergodic theory to bear on questions relevant to quantum information science. 2) Quantitative analysis of diffusion in open and noisy, extensive systems. The main goal of this investigation is to develop quantitative methods to estimate the diffusivity for a quantum particle subject to thermal noise. 3) Study of Anderson localization in many body systems and systems with correlated randomness. It is known that interference effects due to strong static disorder can trap the wave function, a phenomenon called Anderson localization.  However, the exact nature of localization in many body and open quantum systems is poorly understood. The goal of this investigation is to prove the existence of, and clarify the nature of, Anderson localization in many-body systems and systems with strongly correlated randomness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will integrate advances in the study of metric spaces and complex analysis with tools from convex analysis, probability, and graph theory to address emerging questions in network science. In particular, the project will bridge the gap between certain powerful tools originating within the subject of mathematical analysis, and their counterparts in discrete and applied mathematics. The project will also develop numerical and algorithmic approaches that will connect abstract methods in analysis with practical questions of network science, data science, and other areas in applied mathematics. For example, tools developed in this project for the study of network science may be useful for the modeling, prediction, and mitigation of the spread of epidemics. The project will build upon and amplify the work of the Network Optimization Design and Exploration (NODE) research group at Kansas State University, an interdisciplinary team of researchers from mathematics, electrical and computer engineering, computer science, and statistics. The project will support the involvement of faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students, working on a diverse range of topics in analysis, applied mathematics, and network science within the framework of this interdisciplinary research group.<br/><br/>A key aspect in the study of spreading phenomena on a network is an understanding of interconnectedness, i.e., the many ways in which individuals, represented by nodes within the network, interact with and come into contact with other nodes. Classically, in the quantitative study of spreading processes among subpopulations, researchers have used mathematical concepts such as the length of a shortest path (to measure how far one must travel) or the size of minimum cuts (to capture the number of different pathways available). The notion of effective resistance, which originated in the theory of electrical networks, provides a needed compromise between these two extremes, balancing shortness of paths with variety of pathways. In a sense, electricity is able to find many optimal routes and thus yields insights into the intrinsic structure of networks. From a mathematical point of view, electrical current has deep connections to random walks and to classical diffusion processes. In previous work, the PIs and their collaborators have developed the theory of p-modulus on networks, which unifies in a single framework three classical measures: shortest paths, mincuts, and effective resistance. The concept of p-modulus originated in complex analysis, but when applied in the study of networks becomes an extremely flexible tool that can measure the richness of many different families of objects in multiple ways. The goal of the current project is to use the discrete theory of modulus to obtain new results in analysis, and also to show that certain quantities in the discrete context converge to their continuous counterparts under specific approximation schemes or scaling limits.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems model the time evolution of physical, biological or mathematical systems, such as planetary motion, fluid flows, or the progression of diseases.  Several fundamental concepts and ideas, such as entropy, chaos and attractors, have been developed to describe such systems.  Tools from symbolic dynamics have proved important in developing fast and safe codes in computer science.  Hyperbolic dynamical systems naturally arise in electrical systems and their network problems.  They also have applications within mathematics, especially to number theory, mathematical physics and geometry.  This workshop will bring together experts in the dynamical systems areas of rigidity and flexibility, as well as a large group of graduate students and young researchers, to open new research avenues.  The primary goal is to foster collaboration and build a community of researchers engaged in studying the interplay between flexibility and rigidity in dynamics. The workshop includes three mini-courses in addition to research talks and a problem session. The proximity of Stony Brook to many education and research institutions lends itself particularly well to dissemination of new research directions. <br/><br/>The workshop will focus on fine properties of hyperbolic dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose orbits diverge exponentially fast - as it is typical in many situations.  Mathematicians introduced invariants, in particular entropy and Lyapunov exponents, to describe their behavior.  One can naturally ask for the range these invariants can take in a given class of dynamical systems (?flexibility?).  Such ranges can be very restrictive, for example, when the systems exhibit extra symmetries.  Sometimes this leads to a complete description of the systems (?rigidity?).  While investigations on rigidity started half a century ago, work on flexibility started only recently. Highlights of recent research will form the core of the mini-courses of the workshop, especially new advances on rigidity of hyperbolic dynamical systems, entropy properties of negatively curved manifolds, and flexibility of group actions on the circle.

The field of conformal geometry has had rich interactions with both geometric analysis and physics, especially high-energy and condensed-matter physics, over the past three decades. The benefits have been bidirectional in both cases: conformal geometry has led to the development of new analytic tools infused by geometric intuitions, which in turn lead to the solution of important geometric problems. Similarly, physics is a source both of new problems and of important insights, while conformal geometry provides crucial tools in the solution of physical problems. This conference will bring together experts from all of these fields to share and discuss their research and benefit from each other's perspectives and tools. It is expected that the conference will stimulate further development in all three fields and cooperation across many kinds of boundaries. Facilitating entry of early-career researchers into dialog with all three areas is a particular goal for this event. A poster session will be held for students.<br/><br/>Conformal geometry is the geometry of spaces where angles are defined, but not lengths. It has had a long and, recently, fast-growing relevance in physics, where it is a tool that provides new perspectives on many old phenomena. Conversely, physics has been a rich source of insights and problems in conformal geometry. For many years now, conformal geometry itself has provided some of the most compelling problems in geometric analysis, while techniques from analysis, scattering theory, and partial differential equations have enabled tremendous progress in the field. The primary goal of the conference is to bring together researchers from the three title areas whose work overlaps, in order to disseminate progress, share interesting problems, build relationships, and broaden perspectives. The conference will allow exposure to relevant state-of-the-art techniques in conformal geometry, analysis, and physics to be shared with other interested practitioners in each field. It will foster international collaboration between the US and other countries, and also collaboration between mathematicians and physicists. Junior participants will gain valuable insights, and relationships with more senior practitioners that may shape both their career and their mathematical (or physical) perspectives. Opportunity will be given for them to present their own work, and collaboration opportunities will exist between researchers at all levels. Most of the funding will be used to support junior mathematicians. Substantial effort will be made in recruiting women and members of other underrepresented groups in mathematics.

The topics to be studied as part of the project are universal in the field of mathematics in the sense that the same paradigm appears, for instance, in geometry, mathematical physics, or dynamical systems. The fundamental issue the project aims to understand is the interplay, for a given system of partial differential equations, between the existence and regularity of solutions versus the appearance of singularities. This type of question is of major importance for both time-dependent and time-independent equations. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The project lies at the interface of several areas of mathematics, such as Partial Differential Equations, Geometric Measure Theory, Geometric Analysis, and Harmonic Analysis, with many problems under consideration being motivated by relevant applications to liquid crystals, fluid dynamics, statistical physics, and various areas of differential geometry. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to pursue research in the regularity theory and geometric properties for partial differential equations arising in the theory of minimal surfaces and harmonic maps with free boundaries, by investigating thoroughly a new model where the boundary effects are prevalent. The theory of nonlocal equations makes it possible to study problems which seem to be local at first sight but are intrinsically nonlocal, such as connected sums on the boundary of manifolds or the construction of blow-up solutions of the harmonic map flow with free boundary. The PI plans to continue this fruitful line of research. Related to the latter, the theory of a particularly important class of degenerate/singular partial differential equations connected to the fractional Laplacian has seen some recent developments. Building on recent results, the PI plans to study degenerate/singular equations in fluid dynamics involving variable coefficients. Several models in compressible fluids are a major output of this line of investigation. A possible way to understand the singularities and degeneracies in a system is via geometric microlocal analysis. A useful tool developed over the years by the PI and collaborators, called parabolic gluing, offers a very versatile method to construct new objects, possibly singular, in parabolic equations and geometric flows. As part of this project, the PI plans to continue to develop this method to investigate bubbling phenomena in several parabolic equations coming from physics (fluid dynamics, in particular) and geometry (curvature flows and complex flows, for example).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research focuses on hyperbolic dynamical systems, where a small perturbation causes exponential uncertainty in both negative and positive time. Such systems appear in many real-world dynamics, for example in interacting particle systems. Much is known for hyperbolic systems of particles with low degrees of freedom and with hard ball interactions by models of mathematical billiards. An important goal of this research is to investigate the case of high degrees of freedom, which is more relevant for physical systems - ergodic theory provides an abstract point of view on dynamical systems by studying time and space averages instead of the local geometry. Another research goal is to extend the understanding of infinite ergodic theory and partial chaos by hyperbolic dynamics examples. Moreover, a summer school will be offered to advanced high school or first year undergraduate students and several research projects will involve both undergraduate and Ph.D. students.<br/><br/>The research is comprised of three main parts. The first part concerns the study high dimensional billiards and deterministic walks. Topics that are well understood in two-dimensional billiards (complexity bounds, long flight times) will be investigated in higher dimensions. The second part is devoted to hyperbolic dynamics in physical systems. Based on earlier results by the investigator on smaller building blocks, larger systems of mass and energy transport will be studied. Both these parts make significant advances towards better mathematical models of high dimensional real-life dynamical systems. The third part is to study the role of hyperbolic dynamics in infinite ergodic theory: a field which is more suitable for some large physical systems than traditional finite ergodic theory.

The mathematical theory of singular integrals has traditionally been formulated in smooth geometric settings. However, demand for an understanding of singular integrals in rougher settings has grown recently with a more refined understanding of mathematical models for physical phenomena in irregular or non-smooth environments. Emerging applications of singular integrals in quantum computing further buttress the need for such extensions of the classical theory. Notably, the relationship between singular integrals and the geometry of sets and measures facilitates a new understanding of dimension reduction for high-dimensional point sets, that is, mechanisms to detect whether large collections of points in a high-dimensional space in fact lie on a smooth lower-dimensional manifold. Results of this nature are important for data science applications, and the project has the potential to bring the toolkit of singular integral theory to bear on this important application domain. By coupling pure harmonic analysis methods with tools from combinatorics and probability, and through its noticeable interface with questions of relevance in data science, the project will also provide opportunities for the training of junior mathematicians, including graduate students.<br/><br/>This project considers a variety of questions in the study of singular integrals in non-smooth or rough settings, using both existing and newly developed tools. The principal investigators have been at the forefront of the past development of such a theory, and the current project will crystallize new applications to other areas of geometry and analysis. Questions under consideration in this project include: (a) a sharp characterization of bounded singular integrals with matrix weight, which is important in the regularity theory of vector stationary stochastic processes, (b) a characterization of weighted boundedness for para-product singular operators on graphs with cycles (multi-trees, Hamming cubes, etc.), and (c) the David-Semmes regularity problem in codimensions larger than one.

Fourier analysis has had far-reaching applications in other areas of mathematics, physics, engineering, medicine, industry, and the applied sciences. This project will investigate central questions in the field of bilinear Fourier analysis, where a pair of signals are analyzed simultaneously.

The full equations are too difficult to solve explicitly or even by computer, hence mathematical attention focuses on properties of the equations. Such properties include whether solutions for given initial conditions exist for a long time or break down in finite time; whether solutions are stable and can be predicted with small errors, or fundamentally unstable and unpredictable; and the validity of simplifying approximations used to make the equations more manageable. These questions are difficult and longstanding. For instance, the question of long-time existence for the idealized three-dimensional fluid equations has remained open for well over a century.

It quantifies the state of randomness or uncertainty of a physical system and has numerous applications in machine learning, data compression, and quantum mechanics. In this project entropy is studied in two settings. In the first the entropy of a dynamical system is considered. Dynamical systems describe the state of a certain physical system (e.g., amount of a certain gas inside a room, spread of viruses) as it changes in time. It is useful and natural to make ?time? abstract and replace it with a discrete system of symmetries called ?groups.? Dynamical entropy was originally defined through an information theory viewpoint, and recent developments show that this perspective allows one to expand entropy theory to evolution under a certain class of groups called ?sofic groups.? In this new framework, entropy describes how many finitary approximations an infinitary system has; a fundamental question of scientific inquiry. The second setting for entropy is in the context of von Neumann algebras (specifically in free probability), which arise naturally as the setting for quantum mechanics and provide a precise framework for quantum computing. Potential applications in cryptography are vast. Investigating entropy in this setting amounts to understanding the disorder of a quantum mechanical system. These problems have links to functional analysis, ergodic theory, operator algebras, random matrices, and geometry, some of which will be explicitly addressed. The educational component is directly aimed at broadening participation in mathematics and the sciences. This includes starting a teaching and diversity seminar at the University of Virginia to create a more diverse inclusive environment in the department and running a summer school to bring researchers in different fields together. An expansion is planned for the role of the bridge program at the University of Virginia, as well as the department's involvement with the math alliance. These two endeavors are explicitly aimed at increasing the representation of underrepresented groups in mathematics.<br/> <br/> <br/>This proposal revolves around two main projects. The first is the study of entropy in algebraic actions, which are actions of a discrete group on a compact group by automorphisms. One goal is to completely settle the connections between f-invariant entropy for algebraic actions of free groups and a generalized torsion theory (in the sense of topology) for noncompact Riemannian manifolds defined via Hilbert spaces. Planned is an extension of our current understanding of which algebraic actions are isomorphic to Bernoulli shifts. In von Neumann algebras, the principal investigator will expand on his recent joint work showing that Property (T) von Neumann algebras have few finite-dimensional approximations. These concepts will be generalized to groups with vanishing first cohomology with values in the left regular representation, as well as to inner amenable groups. Expansion of these results is planned to twisted group von Neumann algebras, and compact quantum groups, provided such objects have vanishing first cohomology in natural analogues of the left regular representation. Lastly, the term mean dimension will be adapted from the ergodic theory setting to the von Neumann algebraic setting with the ultimate goal of settling the famous generator problem for von Neumann algebras in the negative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach has wide applications in physics and engineering, but also within mathematics itself. A special focus of harmonic analysis is to obtain good quantitative information on the objects in question, which can often be applied to yield strong quantitative results in the fields of ergodic theory and combinatorics. Ergodic theory investigates behavior of dynamical systems that evolve for a long time, while one focus of combinatorics is to study existence of structures in large but otherwise arbitrary sets. These structures can be geometric patterns such as arithmetic progressions, vertices of a square, their translates, rotates, or dilates. The project will focus on the study of integral transformations that naturally occur within harmonic analysis and build a set of tools that further expands the reach of harmonic analysis into the nearby fields of ergodic theory and combinatorics. As these are very foundational subjects, the results and techniques from these areas are applicable in a wider scientific context. Examples include applications in stochastic analysis, partial differential equations, signal processing, and medical imaging. The project?s fundamental mathematical research will address the community?s currently relevant scientific questions in its continued pursuit in understanding open mathematical questions. The project will further entail working with a postdoc and mentoring undergraduate students, organization of seminars and workshops that promote cross-collaboration and exchange of ideas. <br/><br/>The first part of this project will deal with a fundamental family of multilinear singular integral forms with a hypergraph structure. The main goal will be to address boundedness of these forms on Lebesgue spaces. These questions will be approached by extending the techniques previously developed by the PI and collaborators. The work is partially inspired by a major open question in harmonic analysis, boundedness of the simplex Hilbert transforms. Further, this project will address multilinear oscillatory integral forms and their connections with variants of multilinear singular integrals and maximal functions with curvature. Estimates on multilinear singular and oscillatory integrals will then be applied to ergodic theory. In this context, the main goal will be to investigate convergence of various types of ergodic averages along the orbits of commuting measure-preserving transformations by establishing qualitative convergence statements via stronger quantitative variational estimates. The latter will be translated to questions in Euclidean spaces and addressed with harmonic analysis techniques developed throughout this project. These methods will also be applied to questions in Euclidean Ramsey theory, where existence of linear and non-linear point configurations in large subsets of the Euclidean space will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of considerable interest is the study of various integral transforms such as the Hilbert transform, which can be understood as a frequency filter acting on a given signal and is a prototypical example of a singular integral operator. Other mathematical operators important to this project are the Fourier transform, which decomposes a signal into its frequency components, maximal functions and various Radon-type transforms.

This award supports an integrated research program on partial differential equations and an educational program promoting scientific computing and applied mathematics at the undergraduate and graduate level. The research component of the project is concerned with mathematical models from physics and engineering, specifically models used to describe long-range forces and mass transport/kinetic effects, and seeks to answer a number of fundamental questions. Answers to these questions will aid in the creation of practical and reliable algorithms for computer simulations of complex physical systems (such as those found in plasma physics, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, material science) and in the creation of practical and reliable autonomous systems (including but not limited to robotics and control theory). In mathematics, long-range forces and heavy-tailed distribution are often modeled via a class of equations known as integro-differential equations. The mathematical theory for such equations is not as advanced as that of ordinary or partial differential equations, but integro-differential equations are becoming increasingly common in theory and applications. The mathematical analysis of mass-transport, understood in the broadest sense, deals with dynamics of masses of ""particles"" moving in reaction to both background forces and collisions between said particles. Depending on the context, these ""particles"" may represent actual physical particles or intelligent agents interacting with their environment and with one another. As such, transport models cover many situations: from dynamical formulations of models in statistical mechanics to the study of optimal or stable matchings in economics, and the mathematical results of this project may be of use to such disciplines. The project explores interconnected questions in these two fields (many of which are relevant to the modeling of plasmas) and in particular will explore the use of transport methods to analyze problems involving long-range forces. The activities in this project also provide substantial support for the recruitment, training, and mentorship of mathematically talented undergraduate and graduate students at Texas State University. These activities include campus-wide events with guest speakers from academia and industry, specialized advanced courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and research mentorship of graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. A prime objective of this project's educational efforts is increasing the numbers of graduates entering careers in industry and/or academia that require state of the art mathematical and computational training.<br/><br/>The research activities in this project fall, thematically speaking, in one or more of the following areas: high dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations, kinetic equations with nonlocal terms, integro-differential methods for interface problems, and Jacobian equations/transport problems. A common thread connecting these diverse topics is the search for pointwise estimates and regularity estimates for solutions of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, and as such questions about estimates makes for a considerable portion of this project's research efforts. While a few of the problems considered in this project lie squarely within one of the categories above, they are motivated by a potential application in a different category - such as the Nonlocal Jacobian equation, which is motivated by the question of obtaining Aleksandrov-type estimates adapted to integro-differential equations. Positive outcomes in the various lines of inquiry could potentially lead to a mesh-free algorithm for viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations, an optimal transport formulation of solutions for nonlinear kinetic equations, new regularity results for two-phase free boundary problems, and new Harnack inequalities for nonlocal equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such geometries arise naturally in areas of mathematics such as several complex variables, partial differential equations (PDE), and algebraic, complex, and differential geometry. This project investigates a particular geometry ? CR geometry -- that arises in the study of several complex variables and complex geometry. It has deep connections with current topics in mathematical physics, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory, as well as applications in, e.g., systems engineering and control theory. For example, the study of obstruction flatness has a direct link to the equations of motion in conformal gravity. The notion of Kähler-Einstein metric is highly relevant for these investigations; such metrics are measurements of distance and angle in higher-dimensional spaces (manifolds), which curve according to Einstein?s equations of relativity in vacuum. One way in which CR manifolds arise is as the boundaries of regions in high-dimensional complex spaces which curve in a well-behaved fashion in complex directions; such regions are known as pseudoconvex domains. Techniques to be used in this project come from a variety of mathematical areas: complex analysis/geometry, PDE, and differential geometry. At the same time, techniques and tools developed in this project will influence these areas as well. The project will also provide interesting research topics for graduate students and postdocs. The seminar activity resulting from the project will inspire and stimulate both students and other researchers.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study geometric, analytic, and algebraic aspects of real submanifolds in complex varieties, together with their symmetries. Such aspects include, for instance, the geometric consequences of global vanishing on a compact CR manifold of a higher order local invariant that arises as an obstruction in the study of a complex Monge--Ampere equation. In three dimensions, this invariant coincides with the trace on the boundary of the log-term in an asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. Solutions to this Monge-Ampere equation give rise to complete Kähler-Einstein metrics with negative curvature, and a major goal of the project is to characterize domains and complex manifolds in terms of properties of various metrics and kernels, and their relations. As an example, one aim is to understand what assumptions ensure that the Bergman metric on a domain is Kähler-Einstein if and only if the domain is biholomorphically equivalent to the ball. Another topic to be considered is the existence of CR umbilical points on compact CR 3-manifolds. Umbilical points on a manifold are locations where the manifold exhibits an unexpectedly high degree of symmetry and smoothness. It is not known whether such points always exist on bounded strictly pseudoconvex domains in complex 2-dimensional space; this question remains open if the domain is diffeomorphic to the ball. Finally, the project considers existence, uniqueness, and regularity questions for CR maps. These include the study of CR maps between generic submanifolds of infinite type and the recently discovered phenomenon that for infinite type hypersurfaces the biholomorphic, formal, and smooth CR equivalence classifications are distinct. These investigations are expected to shed new light on the nature of CR maps between infinite type manifolds, and to lead to a better understanding of the Pfaffian systems arising in this context. In conclusion, this project will significantly enhance the understanding of the role of invariant objects and symmetries in several complex variables and complex geometry, which in turn will increase the utility of the theory in physical models and applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This theory is also a natural mathematical framework in which physical systems as they evolve in time (called dynamical systems) can be represented and studied; groups are the algebraic structures that represent the time in this picture. Groups also model symmetries of physical systems and mathematical structures, and since their formal introduction in the 19th century, their applications have expanded deep into almost every major area of mathematics. Representation theory of groups provides canonical ways to assign operator algebras to a given group, hence establishes a bridge between the two theories which allows one to import ideas and concepts from one theory to the other. The study of the connections between groups and their associated operator algebras has been a central part of operator algebra theory since the time of von Neumann, and it has had tremendous impact on both theories, as well as in several other related areas such as ergodic theory, dynamical systems, and representation theory. This project aims to make further progress in this direction by discovering new connections between structural properties of groups and their operator algebras. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The first part of the project is aimed at several conjectures and problems related to new operator-algebraic rigidity phenomena for discrete groups in terms of their C*-algebras. This is based on a new approach to extending important classical results from ergodic theory of higher rank groups to the operator-algebraic setting. The main concept of interest is that of invariant subalgebras of C*-algebras generated by unitary representations, which are viewed as non-commutative generalizations of normal subgroups. The boundary theory of groups (in the sense of Furstenberg) plays a central role in the Principal Investigator?s strategies to approach the proposed problems. Furstenberg's boundary theory has been, in the past few decades, a major tool in ergodic theory of higher rank lattices and in proving their rigidity properties. More recently, it has also been used in operator-algebraic rigidity problems, resulting in significant progress in this area. The project aims to develop new techniques in utilizing boundary actions in order to prove the proposed rigidity results for invariant subalgebras of C*-algebras generated by unitary representations of discrete groups.

Dynamical systems (""dynamics,"" for short) is the study of motion, and in particular motion that is dictated by an unchanging set of rules, such as the forces controlling planetary motion.  Well-known experimental phenomena in dynamics such as chaotic trajectories combined with stable motion have been observed experimentally but are far from being fully understood from a theoretical perspective. The project will address several themes. The first is the stability of dynamical systems - that is, how small perturbations in initial conditions and even in the rules themselves affect the outcome of the evolution. Understanding robust mechanisms for stability is a fundamental pursuit, and the investigator has already discovered several novel such mechanisms.  The second theme is genericity, or loosely to understand what dynamical features are present in a typical system.  The third theme is rigidity, the study of symmetries of dynamical systems and those systems with optimal symmetries, the so-called ideal crystals of dynamics. An important aspect of the project is to further interaction between mathematical and adjacent scientific communities, such as physics.  The PI has already collaborated on questions surrounding the design of particle accelerators and is currently collaborating with a physicist on studying the quantum dynamics behind the emergence of black holes.  Furthermore, the PI has given several public lectures on dynamics and has written in the popular press about the work of mathematicians.  The PI will expand these activities in the coming years. The project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project considers questions in smooth dynamical systems all the way from a general perspective, in particular those about genericity of certain foliation dynamics, to a local one, focused on the rigidity of specific families of group actions. These questions are motivated by well-known conjectures, but also by the desire to discover and explore new dynamical phenomena. The first circle of questions centers around Boltzmann?s original ergodic hypothesis as well as the modern and related conjectures of Pugh and Shub about stable ergodicity. The basic question they address is when one might expect a dynamical system to be ergodic. An important question that remains open is the symplectic version of the C1 Pugh-Shub conjecture, which the investigator will attack.  The strategy to prove this conjecture involves interesting and timely aspects of the study of hyperbolic and partially hyperbolic dynamics and expanding foliations. A second project investigates the topological and statistical properties of the unstable foliations of partially hyperbolic systems, and in particular Anosov diffeomorphisms with a partially hyperbolic splitting. A third project concerns the rigidity properties of partially hyperbolic abelian actions. Here the action of the su-holonomy group plays an important role: in the actions considered, the joint action of the ambient, partially hyperbolic dynamics and the su-holonomy group are constrained by certain solvable groups for which known rigidity results described above hold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, we cannot make a detailed weather forecast for six months in the future and expect it to be accurate. And yet we believe these events to be governed by laws of physics that are deterministic: the same input always leads to the same output. These two opposing ideas ? unpredictability in practice versus predictability in theory ? can be reconciled using the mathematical theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems, which leads to ideas that are popularly known as chaos theory. When we study some system and use a model to make predictions, it is vital to understand the way that predictability evolves into unpredictability so that we know when a forecast predicting one specific outcome (""it will rain tomorrow"") must be replaced by a more probabilistic statement (""in the long run, the coin will come up tails half the time""). The basic mechanism for this process is ""sensitive dependence on initial conditions"" ? a small error in our initial measurement of the system can grow quickly as time passes. The resulting theory is well-understood when this phenomenon occurs for all initial conditions and when the system does not have any ""singularities,"" where the rules governing the system change suddenly. However, these assumptions are quite restrictive, and it is more realistic to drop one or both, allowing study of a much broader class of systems. For this broader class, the theory is not as complete, and this leads to the goal of the present project: to develop a better understanding of systems displaying hyperbolic behavior in the presence of singularities, or for which there is coexistence of hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic behavior. This will involve both a study of the properties of systems with such behavior, as well as the development of tools to verify rigorously that this behavior does in fact occur. The project will also provide research training and mentoring of students.<br/><br/>More concretely, one part of the project involves thermodynamic formalism for systems with singularities, especially billiards, including both dispersing (Sinai billiard) and non-uniformly hyperbolic (Bunimovich stadium). For uniformly hyperbolic systems without singularities, the theory of thermodynamic formalism provides insights into the statistical behavior of the system, including existence and uniqueness of equilibrium measures, stochastic properties, and Margulis asymptotics for periodic orbits. The presence of singularities for billiard systems makes the corresponding theory more difficult to develop beyond the smooth Liouville measure (which is well understood). The investigator and collaborators previously studied thermodynamic formalism for non-uniformly hyperbolic systems without singularities using specification and leaf measure techniques; part of this project aims to extend these to systems with singularities. Another part of the project will focus on the problem of verifying non-uniform hyperbolicity and coexistence of regular and stochastic behavior. There are many systems where this is suggested by numerical evidence but not proved. The project will investigate a new technique for proving non-uniform hyperbolicity and coexistence in smooth systems that approximate singular ones, by using the invariant cone family for the singular system and borrowing ideas from one-dimensional dynamics to deal with the failure of cone-invariance for the smooth system. One expected application of this theory will be the construction of a positively curved surface whose geodesic flow has positive Liouville entropy (and thus non-uniform hyperbolicity) coexisting with vanishing Lyapunov exponents on a set of positive Liouville measure; existence of such a surface remains an important open problem at the interface of dynamical systems and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The integrable systems at the center of this project are significantly more complicated, but likewise serve as oracles for the full-complexity systems at the forefront of science and engineering. Indeed, all the concrete models studied as part of this project arose initially as effective models of real physical systems (such as water waves, optics, and magnetohydrodynamics), stripped down to reveal the central mechanisms behind the observed phenomena. To fulfill the role just articulated, we must study these integrable systems in large-data non-perturbative regimes - regimes where still simpler models cannot reproduce the observed phenomenology. This is a hallmark of this research project and indeed, of the methods developed in the PI's recent work, more broadly. The project provides significant research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, who are integrated into every major activity of the project.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the project is to advance the low-regularity theory of certain completely integrable dispersive partial differential equations, both as an end onto itself and as a tool for understanding the statistical mechanics of these systems. As a means to this end, the project further develops the commuting flows paradigm and seeks out new and diverse applications for several technical tools developed in support of this approach. Well-posedness problems will be studied, including that of the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Microscopic conservation laws will be deployed to further elaborate the spacetime structural properties of solutions constructed via commuting flows. The synthesis of renormalization and commuting flows technologies will be investigated, with a view to well-posedness, to the construction of Gibbs states, and to the dynamical properties thereof. Likewise, the continuum limit of discrete integrable models will be investigated both for deterministic initial data and as a means of gaining insight into Gibbs-state dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, they are ubiquitous in the mathematical modelling of a host of systems in physics, engineering, and other scientific fields. This project will explore two salient issues related to the theory of partial differential equations, in the setting of higher-dimensional spaces defined via complex numbers. The first topic is the question of unique continuation, which ? in rough terms ? asks when infinitesimal data about the solution to a differential equation suffices to determine the behavior of the solution on macroscopic scale. The second topic is the regularity of solutions. In many physically relevant situations, partial differential equations exhibit a self-improving regularity property: solutions that are a priori assumed to exist within a broad class of functions with a weakly defined notion of smoothness, in fact can be shown a posteriori to satisfy a much more stringent smoothness condition. Such results are important both for the theory of partial differential equations and for scientific applications. The types of second order partial differential equations under consideration in this project are relevant for other equations of physical significance, such as the wave and heat equations, the Klein-Gordon equation, Maxell?s equation, and Schrödinger?s equation. The project will also contribute to the development of a scientifically literate workforce through graduate recruitment and training.<br/><br/>The primary focus of the project is on the theory of CR mappings between CR manifolds. CR mappings are a foundational concept in the theory of several complex variables. In this context, a general unique continuation problem asks when a CR mapping between two embedded CR manifolds, that vanishes to infinite order at a single point, must vanish identically in a neighborhood of that point. Very few sufficient conditions are known, even in simple special cases. This question will be investigated in concert with related unique continuation problems for solutions of second order subelliptic partial differential equations with real analytic coefficients. The second part of the project involves the regularity theory of CR mappings on embeddable and abstract CR manifolds, along with the regularity of CR functions on abstract CR manifolds. Such results have applications to the theory of solutions of systems of first order complex nonlinear partial differential equations. The current project will focus on understanding conditions on the underlying manifolds that guarantee smoothness of CR mappings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory of homogenization, whose goal is to describe macroscopic properties of microscopically inhomogeneous or heterogeneous materials, shows that such strongly inhomogeneous material, whose characteristics change sharply with respect to space variables, may be approximately described via a homogenized or effective homogeneous material. As a result, the theory of homogenization of partial differential equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients has many important applications in physics, mechanics, and materials science. The long-term goal of this project is to establish optimal quantitative results in the homogenization theory for a large class of partial differential equations in various settings, arising in applications. The proposed research focuses on several challenging problems in the modelling of fluid flows and acoustic propagation in porous media and inclusions in composite materials.

While topology, geometry, and analysis are united in the two-dimensional plane, higher dimensional Euclidean spaces or abstract metric spaces lack such powerful tools. Such considerations prompted the development of the field of ""analysis on metric spaces,"" in which first-order differential calculus and geometric measure theory are extended from the classical Euclidean or Riemannian setting to the realm of spaces without a priori smooth structure (such as fractals). Results and techniques in this field have found important applications in geometric group theory, in the structure of manifolds, and in analysis on fractals. Furthermore, besides their mathematical importance, physical applications of these theories range from the reconstruction of missing data in large data sets, to methodologies for data storage and access, and to the study of thin films.<br/><br/>This project seeks to develop techniques to address several long-standing questions in the field of analysis on metric spaces and geometric measure theory. The first goal is to relate integral bounds for discrete forms of curvature on non-smooth manifolds with locally Euclidean bi-Lipschitz parameterizations. Such parameterizations are well understood in two dimensions but have so far been elusive in dimensions greater or equal to three. Another goal is to identify sufficient conditions for 2-rectifiability, that is, to understand which sets are contained within the Lipschitz image of a square. Results in this direction will in turn lead to an improved understanding of 2-rectifiable measures. Finally, the project addresses the Euclidean embedding question, namely, to characterize those metric spaces that admit an embedding into a finite-dimensional Euclidean space that does not distort the geometry of the space too much. Apart from providing a better understanding of the geometry and analysis of metric spaces, the existence of such embeddings has been instrumental in recent advances in theoretical computer science and graphic imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast with hyperbolic dynamical systems, which display exponential divergence of orbits, parabolic systems are much less understood.  Hyperbolic systems will also be studied insofar they appear as auxiliary tools in the study of parabolic ones, which are the main focus. The research will emphasize quantitative aspects that are relevant for applications. The project aims to advance our fundamental knowledge of dynamical systems and to develop new ideas and new methods of mathematical investigation with potential applications to geometry and number theory and thus indirectly to other scientific subjects. Also, since parabolic behavior appears in Hamiltonian mechanics, the project can directly advance our understanding of simple mathematical models of classical physical systems (billiards in polygons, statistical mechanics, planetary motions).  Research training and mentoring of students and postdocs is an important goal of the project, with particular attention to members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The investigator will carry out research in several directions (effective weak mixing of translation flows, Ruelle asymptotics, dynamics on character varieties) and  will continue work on longstanding open questions such as on effective ergodicity for non-horospherical unipotent flows (effective Ratner theory), optimal bounds on Weyl sums for higher degree polynomials, the ergodic theory of geodesic flows on flat surfaces and of billiards in non-rational polygons, as well as the ergodic and spectral theory of smooth parabolic flows. An important approach to parabolic systems, often called renormalization approach, replaces the direct studies of the parabolic dynamics with that of an auxiliary hyperbolic system, which is easier to understand by methods of hyperbolic theory (invariant manifolds, Lyapunov exponents).  Motivated by recent interest in the relation between parabolic and hyperbolic dynamics via renormalization, the investigator has broadened his research with work on exponential decay of correlations and Ruelle asymptotics for hyperbolic systems from the point of view of the effective (polynomial) equidistribution of unstable foliations, and will further pursue research on the interplay between effective equidistribution in parabolic dynamics and effective mixing in hyperbolic dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the major advances of modern physics has been the revelation that groups are not sufficient to capture the symmetries of a quantum system. It is now understood that the symmetries of a quantum system can be captured on its algebra of observables (a von Neumann algebra). The mathematical tool which describes these generalized symmetries is known as a tensor category.

However, if the solutions do not have sufficient regularity, the performance of numerical algorithms and their computational accuracy is a challenging issue. In this project, the PI will study some fundamental questions regarding the regularity of solutions for various classes of PDE modeling nonlinear waves, also in the presence of nonlocal source terms. A major focus of the research will be on the emergence of singularities, such as shock waves, for generic solutions. The expected results will provide an accurate asymptotic description of how new singularities are formed, and how they interact with each other, valid for almost all initial data. This will lead to a new class of numerical schemes, with high-order accuracy and a wide range of applications. In addition, the project will provide a training ground for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This research project contains two main parts. The first part is concerned with the fine regularity structure of solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Here, the goals are to (i) deepen the analysis of the metric entropy of sets of solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations, study SBV regularity, and develop new techniques that cover a wider class of equations; and (ii) investigate the fine properties of generalized monotone functions, study the propagation of singularities, and establish new regularity estimates and controllability results for Hamilton Jacobi equations. The second part of the project will focus on generic singularities for nonlinear balance laws, also in the presence of nonlocal terms. For a wide class of such equations, it is well known that solutions with smooth initial data can lose regularity in finite time. However, they can be extended in a weak sense beyond the time when the first derivatives blowup. A major difficulty in understanding entropy weak solutions is that nonlocal source terms have a huge influence on singularity formation. For this reason, many interesting properties of entropy weak solutions, such as uniqueness, shock formation, shock interactions, and the structure of singularities, are still far from being well understood. In this part of the project the PI aims to (i) develop a quantitative analysis of the number of shocks for entropy weak solutions and study their generic regularity for various models of nonlinear waves and for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws; and (ii) provide a detailed description of shock formation and wave breaking of entropy weak solutions for nonlocal balance laws as well as trace their impact on BV regularity and stability results. The approach that will be pursued, taking advantage of the piecewise regularity of solutions, seeks to reduce an equation defined on a space with low regularity to an equation on a more regular space coupled with an ODE on a finite dimensional manifold. In cases where the solutions of interest are known to be generically piecewise smooth, this can have an impact in the broader field of numerical analysis, suggesting new high-order computational algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It aims to utilize quantum phenomena such as entanglement and coherence to gain substantial advantages in cryptography, communication, and computational power.

Due to the nature of quantum mechanics, the mathematical theory of quantum information processing is often noncommutative. Commutative mathematical objects are numbers and functions, where the multiplication order does not matter. Quantum physics is largely modeled by matrices and operators whose multiplication is noncommutative. Such inherent non-commutativity decides the essential connection between the theory of operator algebras and quantum information theory. Based on this connection, the Principal Investigator will use mathematical tools from operator algebras to study entropic quantities in quantum information and quantum stochastic processes, which has theoretical relevance as well as applications in quantum information and quantum physics.

Such relations are called orbit equivalence relations. Due to their statistical nature, ergodic theoretical conclusions always leave the possibility of an exceptional behavior on some outlying orbits.

A translational tiling is a covering of a space using translated copies of certain building blocks, called the ?tiles?, without overlaps. The focus of this project is on the major question in the area: which are the possible ways that a space can be tiled.  The structure of tilings has been extensively studied over the years by many mathematicians; among the most famous and significant contributors are the mathematical physicist Roger Penrose and the amateur mathematicians Robert Ammann and Maurits Cornelis Escher. This mathematical study has found many important applications to other sciences. In particular, it led to one of the most significant breakthroughs in physical science: the discovery of natural quasicrystals, physical solids whose atoms? arrangement is not periodic. Since aperiodic tilings (i.e., pavings of space which cannot be ?determined? by how they look in an arbitrarily large but bounded part of the space) serve as the mathematical models of quasicrystals, the discovery of those aperiodic forms in nature by Dan Shechtman (for which he won the Nobel prize), was based on the mathematical discovery of aperiodic tilings. Orthogonal systems are of importance to several branches of mathematics, including number theory, algebraic geometry and analysis. One of their advantageous properties is that they can facilitate an amenable decomposition of a function (e.g., describing light or sound waves) into more manageable pieces with a high level of mutual independence. Studying these pieces separately can yield insight into the physical properties of a system such as dominant frequencies. The research carried out (in conjunction with collaborators) consists of revealing connections to a range of different areas of mathematics and building on past results in those areas, as well as developing novel methods and techniques.<br/><br/>The first part of this project will be devoted to the study of the structure of translational tilings. The main goal is solving the well-known periodic tiling conjecture, which asserts that any bounded measurable tile of the Euclidean space must admit at least one periodic tiling. This conjecture is known to hold for tilings of the real line, and there are some partial results towards it in higher dimensions. However, the periodic tiling conjecture has not been settled yet in dimensions two and higher. Over time it has become apparent that in many respects translational tiles ?behave like? domains whose Hilbert space (i.e., the space of quadratically integrable functions that are supported on the domain) admits an orthogonal basis of exponential functions. Thus, a second area of focus is on the structure of frequency sets of orthogonal systems of exponentials in two different settings: in time-frequency spaces (Gabor bases) and in Hilbert spaces of certain domains. This part of the project aims to find new approaches to the latter mentioned studies of orthogonal systems, building new bridges between number theory, algebraic geometry and Fourier analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Noncommutativity played a fundamental role in the foundation of quantum mechanics, leading to the development of the branch of mathematics known as functional analysis. From its origins in physics, functional analysis has gained a life of its own and has found exciting applications in areas such as quantum information theory and quantum computing as well as control and systems theory. More recently, questions (about semi-definite programming and linear matrix inequalities) arising in the engineering literature have led to the development of a new subfield of functional analysis known as noncommutative function theory. This exciting new subfield sits at the intersection of noncommutative algebra, functional analysis, and operator theory, and it enjoys a wide variety of applications. Rather than deal with completely abstract mathematical objects, noncommutative function theory employs the use of concrete structures known as matrices, which are one of the fundamental noncommutative objects used in science, engineering and industry. This project aims to deepen the understanding of noncommutative function theory and consequently augment its connections to related mathematical fields. It will assist in the professional development of early researches and provide an up-to-date list of both solved and unsolved problems in the field of noncommutative function theory.<br/>             <br/>One of the main goals of this project is to increase the interplay between noncommutative function theory, noncommutative algebra, and operator theory.

On the other hand, results from noncommutative algebra (such as the realization of a noncommutative rational function) will be used to deepen the understanding of topics in mathematical analysis.

However, there are many situations where physical limitations result in the loss of important aspects of those measurements.  This imposes constraints on which frames can be used for the analysis of a signal, and different algorithms are required for reconstruction based only on partial information. For example, phase retrieval is applied in X-ray crystallography and coherent diffraction imaging where scientists are only able to identify the magnitude (or intensity) of each linear measurement of a signal. A different scenario occurs when using sensors with a fixed range, such as a pixel in a digital camera.  In this case, any measurement with an intensity above the range saturates the sensor which then outputs the maximum value.  In both situations, we can formalize the physical limitations imposed by the measurement process as applying a non-linear operator to a sequence of linear measurements.  Although these non-linear operators are very simple, the loss of linearity can cause significant difficulty for signal reconstruction in high dimensions which becomes further confounded in the presence of error.  These kinds of reconstruction scenarios arise naturally in many circumstances, and researchers in a variety of disciplines have developed solutions for specific applications.  This makes the mathematical foundation for solving these types of inverse questions particularly important, and has led to significant research being devoted to the mathematics of phase retrieval in particular.   The investigators and their students are working on a unique approach to expanding the mathematical theory of phase retrieval and saturation recovery by using a combination of techniques from frame theory, probability, and the geometry of Banach spaces.  <br/><br/>Both phase retrieval and saturation recovery require the redundancy of a frame, and are not possible with a basis.  One component of the project concerns identifying the exact amount of redundancy which is necessary to do phase retrieval or saturation recovery using a frame or fusion frame.  The second component considers a generalization of the phase retrieval scenario to the setting of subspaces of Banach lattices where the goal is to identify a vector in a subspace from its absolute value.  This connection allows for established techniques in Banach lattices to prove new theorems about phase retrieval, and also opens a new line of inquiry in the theory of Banach lattices itself.  It is not only important for phase retrieval to be possible, but for phase retrieval to be stable under error.  The best known methods for constructing frames for high dimensional spaces which do stable phase retrieval are random constructions which achieve a certain stability bound with high probability.  It is much easier to construct continuous frames which do stable phase retrieval with a certain stability bound, but discrete frames are better suited for computations.  Because of this, important parts of the project involve both (1) determining when a continuous frame may be sampled to construct a frame with given frame bounds which does phase retrieval with a given stability bound and (2) using probabilistic methods to determine when a continuous frame may be randomly sampled to achieve such a frame with high probability. The final component of the project introduces phase retrieval for vector bundles over manifolds.  That is, instead of recovering a single vector up to a phase factor from the magnitude of its frame coefficients, the goal is to use a continuously moving frame to recover a section of a vector bundle up to an equivalence relation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Important questions are: As time evolves, will electrons escape, showing metal-like behavior of the material, or will electrons stay confined near their original positions, showing insulator-like behavior? Furthermore, are there mathematical ways to quantify these behaviors? Understanding these features in different materials, including multi-layer graphene, has important applications, including electricity transmission, design of room-temperature superconductor, and quantum computing.

Harmonic analysis has played major roles in pure and applied sciences since Fourier's work on the theory of heat diffusion, continuing with the success of Schrödinger?s equation in quantum mechanics. It underlies a diverse array of tools widely used in sciences and engineering and offers the promise of further applications in the future. The research is to deal with foundational issues, which may help to underpin future applications. In PDE, the focus will be to study long-time dynamical properties, such as decay and smoothing of dispersive PDE including several fundamental equations describing diverse physical phenomena. In particular, the Dirac equation is a model for graphene, which has important applications in science and engineering. The fourth order Schrödinger equation was introduced to model the propagation of intense laser beams in a bulk medium with Kerr nonlinearity; in addition it is useful in the study of interaction of water waves. In harmonic analysis, the focus lies on questions in Euclidean spaces centered around Lebesgue norm inequalities. One subject of on-going research is the Fourier restriction phenomenon and its applications on questions in PDE and geometric measure theory. The project will involve undergraduate students in research activities through numerical projects in Illinois Geometry Lab and the mentoring of graduate students.<br/> <br/>More specifically, the research is to encompass dispersive decay and smoothing estimates and the boundedness of wave operators for dispersive PDE such as higher order Schrödinger?s equations and Dirac equations, and to study applications to the regularity properties and long-time dynamics of the nonlinear counterparts. The methods involved will include the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators and oscillatory integral estimates in Fourier analysis. Another area of research is on the fractal dimension of solution graphs of dispersive PDE, or the Talbot effect. Previously, these questions were studied in the case of periodic boundary conditions using exponential sum estimates and smoothing estimates for nonlinear equations; as part of this project, more general geometries such as the sphere and tori in higher dimensions will be investigated.

The mathematical theory that addresses these questions is the calculus of variations. Variational questions are deeply rooted in nature in the sense that systems tend to settle in a state that has energy as low as possible. An example is an excited atom that falls to its lowest energy state while emitting light.  Likewise, a hot liquid tends to an equilibrium with the environment by cooling down. The aim of research in this area is always twofold: describe the state to which a system tends and explain how the system reaches that state. In the case of the atom this means finding the lowest energy state and describing how it decays to that state; in the case for the liquid this means describing how heat flows from hot to cold. The research will pursue such questions in relation to new and relevant examples. There has been considerable progress in understanding how systems such as gases of colliding particles tend to their equilibrium.  In research the investigator will extend these ideas to quantum mechanical systems and to analyze how they tend to their equilibrium. In quantum mechanics these questions are to a large extent open and their answers will shed some light on various issues in quantum information theory. Another question to be pursued concerns magnetic fields that keep electrons confined to a region. The challenge will be to find fields that are optimal in some precise sense and to describe how the electrons are distributed. It is expected that the fields? lines have interesting patterns that resemble the ones created in fusion research where one uses magnetic fields to confine hot plasma. Graduate students will be exposed to and contribute to several questions in research level mathematics. The principal investigator is expected to significantly impact the community, as evidenced by their role as secretary of the International Association for Mathematical Physics.<br/><br/>The project addresses various questions in the calculus of variations. One question is to study zero modes of the three-dimensional Dirac equation. Zero modes are important in quantum field theory and in the question of proving the stability of matter.  It is well known that if the ?3/2 norm? of the magnetic field is small then the magnetic field cannot support a zero mode. A similar result holds for the ?3 norm? of the vector potential. The aim is to find sharp necessary conditions on these quantities zero modes exists. It is conjectured that the optimal fields have field lines that look like the Hopf fibration.  In this connection investigations will be pursued concerning possible blow up of solutions of the coupled Maxwell-Pauli equations where the magnetic moment is larger than 2.  A different research direction will be to understand the approach to equilibrium in certain quantum mechanical systems. Such systems can be described by Lindblad equations. In general, not much can be said about the rate of approach to equilibrium but there are interesting Quantum Markov Operators that are analogs of the classical Kac master equation. In these cases, quantitative determination is expected of the rate of approach to equilibrium. One possibility is to do this by computing the gap of the generator. Another attempt is to prove approach to equilibrium in entropy. This will be achieved by establishing analogs of classical entropy inequalities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project includes an educational component that involves researchers at many career stages through (a) the supervision of postdoctoral researchers and Ph.D. students; (b) the organization of a quarterly weekend conference to train students in scientific communication; (c) the organization of a winter workshop aimed at graduate and advanced undergraduate students, with week-long short courses by experts on research topics related to this project; and (d) the writing of a book based on advanced topics courses given by the PI, with significant input from the students who attended these courses.<br/><br/>At a technical level, the main goals of the project are to (1) construct new examples of nonlinear entire solutions to variants of the minimal surface equation, and prove related Bernstein-type theorems; (2) investigate singular structures that appear in solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic equations such as the Monge-Ampere and quadratic Hessian equations, motivated by applications to complex geometry, optimal transport, and meteorology; and (3) construct new examples of singular minimizers of classical variational integrals in low dimensions, and discover structure conditions that prevent the formation of singularities. The equations under investigation share features (degenerate ellipticity and the existence of singular solutions) that limit the usefulness of standard techniques.

Dispersive partial differential equations include the wave, Schrodinger, and Korteweg de-Vries equation. These equations are ubiquitous in physics, modeling phenomena ranging from the behavior of subatomic particles to interstellar gravity waves. Of particular interest are questions of long time behavior of  solutions. In other words, given certain initial data, does a solution to the equation exist? If a solution does exist, does it exist for all time? What is the behavior of the solution as time approaches either infinity or the maximum time for which the solution exists? Can we catalogue the various long time behaviors and obtain a complete description of the possible phenomena? The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>In this project, the Principal Investigator and his collaborators study the long time behavior of dispersive partial differential equations with initial data in a critical norm. Many diverse dispersive partial differential equations have a scaling symmetry, and a solution to the equation gives an entire family of solutions. Often, the scaling symmetry completely describes the local behavior of the equation completely: the equation is well-posed for initial data in the critical space, but it is ill-posed for data in a less regular (subcritical) space. We wish to understand the long time behavior for such equations at the critical regularity, where it is known that local well-posedness occurs. Additionally, in many such equations, the set where ill-posedness occurs in a subcritical space is often a set of measure zero. Thus, we hope to describe the nature of the set of initial data for which ill-posedness occurs. The specific problems that are addressed in this project are the Schrodinger maps problem, the focusing, mass-critical nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the energy subcritical nonlinear wave and Schrodinger equations, and the one dimensional cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation. For the defocusing, energy subcritical problems, we expect scattering to occur for initial data in the critical Sobolev space. Solitons are known to occur for the Schrodinger map problem and the mass-critical nonlinear Schrodinger equation. In both cases, scattering is known to occur for initial data below the soliton (for Schrodinger maps this is only in the equivariant case). We wish to understand the solution for initial data slightly above the soliton for these problems. Finally, for the one dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the aim is to understand the long time behavior for initial data that does not decay at infinity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The latter field, which studies the deformation of physical materials and bodies in response to stress and strain, is informed by developments in materials science and physics. A common challenge faced in the development of mathematical models of nonlinear elasticity is how to account for the physical impossibility of compressing a portion of an elastic body of positive volume into a space of zero volume. From a mathematical point of view, serious difficulties arise when trying to overcome the lack of injectivity as postulated by the physical principle of non-interpenetration of matter. While homeomorphic solutions would be ideal models, mathematical constraints linked to the necessity of complying with the aforementioned physical principle lead naturally to the conclusion that limits of homeomorphic solutions must be allowed as legitimate competitors. New analytic and geometric tools have been developed to accommodate these difficulties, and those tools will be developed further and in greater detail in this project. The project will also afford research opportunities for early career mathematicians, including graduate students.<br/><br/>Weak limits of energy-minimizing sequences of Sobolev homeomorphisms are natural candidates of energy-minimizers. In two dimensions, weak and strong limits coincide and characterize the class of monotone Sobolev mappings. Non-injective energy-minimal solutions, being monotone, may squeeze two-dimensional plates or thin films, but may not fold them. Serious challenges arise in the investigation of energy-minimal solutions solely based on inner-variational equations. This project is largely concerned with questions similar in spirit to the Riemann conformal mapping problem. Such variational questions also lead to associated Sobolev mapping problems and, in the case of prescribed boundary values, require a preliminary investigation of Sobolev variants of the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem. A further goal of the project is to deepen the connections between geometric function theory and relevant areas within physics and engineering, by fostering the exchange of ideas among practitioners of these various subjects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the quantity under study, these PDEs reveal the relation between the rates of change in different directions, and dictate the properties and evolution of the quantity. At the heart of the study of PDEs is a particular characteristic of solutions known as regularity. Theoretically, regularity is necessary to justify the models, and is the stepping stone for other properties of the solution (existence, uniqueness, and long term behavior). In practice, applications of the models involve numerical solutions of the PDEs and to obtain reasonable results requires stability of the solutions, which is often a consequence of regularity. Broadly speaking, objects that might seem rough often turn out to be regular if they satisfy an elliptic equation or constraint. The investigator will investigate three specific phenomena under this general philosophy: free interface problems, optimal transport maps, and free boundary problems. The results of this project will have numerous applications in other fields such as computer vision, data mining, machine learning, material sciences and biology.<br/><br/>The first project will investigate interfaces arising in the study of liquid drops exposed to electric fields. The goal is to show that these interfaces are smooth in low spatial dimensions. This is related to an important conjecture in the physics literature. The second project concerns the optimal transport map between convex domains in Euclidean spaces. The plan is to show that without any extra assumptions on the domains, these maps can be very regular ""up to the boundary"".

Similarly, geometry is the basis for numerous current industrial applications such as 3D printing. This research project will enhance the tools available in the aforementioned mathematical areas. The axiomatic development of geometry, which postulates a set of basic assumptions from which all other reasonable conclusions are logically deduced, dates back to ancient Greece.

The project will also generate research opportunities at a variety of levels, suitable for work by graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will employ non-Archimedean tools to study a range of problems in analysis, dynamics, and geometry. Essential to this endeavor is an understanding of Berkovich spaces, which are non-Archimedean analogues of real and complex manifolds. One component of the project involves a detailed study of the space of metrics on an ample line bundle on a compact complex manifold. Geodesic rays within this space can be studied via non-Archimedean methods. Another topic for consideration is the Kontsevich-Soibelman conjecture, which originally arose in the study of mirror symmetry.

More recently, singular flat geometries have gained prominence because of their relationship to the classical moduli space as well as their connections to important examples in the theory of dynamical systems (systems that evolve over time). This project will advance the study of moduli spaces in five interrelated research programs tied together by shared techniques and analogies. Progress on these research programs will advance the understanding of the geometry of surfaces and higher dimensional spaces and will unlock applications to dynamical systems. The nature of the topics makes their simultaneous investigation synergistic and allows for their integration into educational activities, including the training and mentoring of graduate students, vertically integrated research with undergraduate students, and the development of a new course for the bridge to PhD program.

Models with this type of motions can be widely found in physics, biology, chemistry, as well as in engineering and economics. Hyperbolicity theory, which is an important part of general theory of dynamical systems, provides a mathematical foundation for the deterministic chaos phenomenon by supplying researchers with tools that allow them to describe global properties of a nonlinear dynamical system using information about infinitesimal hyperbolic behavior of its trajectories. The study of hyperbolic phenomena originated in the seminal works of Artin, Morse, Hedlund and Hopf, but the systematic study of hyperbolic dynamical systems was initiated by Smale, Anosov and Sinai, who studied dynamical systems with strong hyperbolic behavior which possess high level of unpredictability and exhibit strong chaotic behavior. In this project, the PI considers the weakest (hence, most general) form of hyperbolicity, known as non-uniform hyperbolicity. The latter originated in the work of the PI. The study of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems is based upon the theory of Lyapunov exponents, which provides some ?practical? tools to detect and describe hyperbolic properties of the systems. The modern non-uniform hyperbolicity theory has numerous applications to ergodic theory, mathematical and statistical physics, Riemannian geometry, and other areas of mathematics and beyond. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Building upon past results the PI will carry out a broad research program which includes the following topics: (1) Thermodynamic formalism for non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. Some ideas from geometric measure theory are used to construct equilibrium measures in hyperbolic dynamics. The new method is based on pushing forward by the dynamics the Caratheodory measure associated with the Caratheodory dimension structure generated by the potential; (2) Essential coexistence of hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic behavior. This is to understand how two different types of dynamical behavior - fully hyperbolic (positive entropy) and non-hyperbolic (zero entropy) - can coexist in an essential way. The project is aimed at constructing Hamiltonian systems and geodesic flows which exhibit the essential coexistence phenomenon thus providing new insights in the classical Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory; (3) The study of two important conjectures in dynamics: (i) Katok's entropy conjecture, claiming that a volume preserving uniquely ergodic diffeomorphism has zero Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy; (ii) Baire Category conjecture, claiming that irregular sets for smooth dynamical systems and for continuous cocycles over them have the 2nd Baire Category; (4) Maps with exponential and polynomial decay of correlations on compact manifolds.

They were introduced in the 1930s in order to provide a mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics. Since then, the theory of von Neumann algebras has flourished into an independent area with fruitful connections to several areas of mathematics and science, including quantum physics. Von Neumann algebras arise naturally from a variety of mathematical structures, such as groups of symmetries and actions, which are present in many areas of mathematics. Their study is closely connected to topics in group theory and ergodic theory. This project will deepen the connections between these areas and operator algebras, by investigating a number of open problems at their interface. The project will also provide opportunities for the training and professional development of graduate students.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to expand the scope of rigidity in von Neumann algebras and uncover new applications to group theory, ergodic theory and C*-algebras. The first objective of the project is to investigate rigidity for group von Neumann algebras. Building on recent work on Connes' famous 1980 rigidity conjecture, the PI proposes to find new families of property (T) groups which are rigid in the context of von Neumann algebras and measure equivalence. The second objective of the project is to investigate two related rigidity properties for groups: Hilbert-Schmidt stability and the local lifting property for full group C*-algebras. The PI proposes to investigate two longstanding problems concerning almost commuting matrices and the local lifting property. The third objective of the project is to study asymptotic problems of von Neumann algebras. The proposed research is expected to lead to new interactions between operator algebras, (both geometric and measured) group theory and ergodic theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PDE are used to model various phenomena in the physical world. In music, eigenfunctions are, for example, oscillations of a guitar's string or vibrations of a drum's membrane. In mathematics, eigenfunctions are the higher dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions. In quantum mechanics, eigenfunctions are known as the energy states. The study of nodal sets (that is, zero-level sets) dates back to the eighteenth century with the discovery of the Chladni patterns. These nodal sets are places where a metal plate vibrate the least. In quantum mechanics, nodal sets are where quantum particles are least likely to be found. Understanding the profile of eigenfunctions of a given energy (i.e., eigenvalue) hinges on our ability to answer the following questions: (i) How large are the sizes of level sets of eigenfunctions with respect to the frequency?; and (ii) How does the information about eigenfunctions on some given set propagate to nearby sets? This project provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as outreach activities aimed at K-12 students and the general public.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project focus on quantitative studies of level sets of eigenfunctions for the Laplace operator and related topics for solutions of PDE. The principal investigator (PI) aims to study the upper bounds on the measure of nodal and singular sets for various Laplace operators on smooth surfaces. The PI will also study bounds on nodal sets of eigenfunctions in periodic elliptic homogenization. This line of investigation will contribute to the understanding of quantitative properties of heterogeneous media. Another research direction that will be pursued as part of the project is the study quantitative unique continuation for elliptic PDE with regular and singular potentials.

The complex numbers are a system of generalized numbers providing greater flexibility with algebraic operations, such as allowing for the extraction of square roots of negative quantities. In this project, the investigator will apply the tools of calculus to smoothly varying complex outputs which depend on one or more complex inputs. Such objects are known in the mathematical literature as holomorphic functions. The study of holomorphic functions has applications to phenomena as diverse as the flow of liquids, heat conduction, the distribution of prime numbers, and the speed of computer programs. The project will employ two methods to construct holomorphic functions. The first is via a system of equations called the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations. The second, the method of projections, interprets the collection of holomorphic functions geometrically as a sub-collection inside a larger collection of functions, and uses this geometric insight to construct holomorphic functions with specified properties. The deeper understanding of holomorphic functions to be gained in this project will be useful for applications both within and outside mathematics. The project will also involve undergraduate participants, who will work on both the computational and theoretical aspects of the problems. Such participation will expose students to challenging mathematical problems and will contribute to the training of future mathematicians and scientists.<br/><br/>Holomorphic functions of one or several complex variables constitute a natural and important class of functions in analysis and have important applications throughout science and engineering. This project investigates two classical techniques for constructing such functions: the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations and projection operators. For the Cauchy-Riemann equations, the main thrust is to study the solution of these equations in annuli, where an annulus in complex Euclidean space is a domain obtained from a larger domain (the envelope) by removing a compact subset (the hole).  Since annuli are not domains of holomorphy, new phenomena appear in this situation which are not found in the well-understood and classical setting of pseudoconvex domains. The analogy between complex analysis on annuli and Alexander duality (a circle of ideas in topology) is expected to forge novel methods of attack on these questions. Coupled with classical approaches based on a priori estimates for partial differential operators, these new methods will be employed to yield important new information on function theory of new classes of non-pseudoconvex domains. With regards to the geometric construction via projection operators, a primary focus of investigation will be a class of questions concerning the regularity of the Bergman projection, and other associated projection operators, in Lebesgue spaces on non-smooth domains. Such regularity depends on the geometry of the domain in ways that are not completely understood. Among the domains to be studied are quotients of balls by finite groups, and Reinhardt domains whose boundary contains the origin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These inequalities arise from studying partial differential equations such as the Schrödinger equation or wave equation and also from number theory through exponential sums, which can be thought of as Fourier series that encode certain arithmetic data. Over the years, tools in these two areas have developed somewhat independently from each other. One aim of this project is to bring more tools from number theory into Fourier analysis. The connections between these two areas will be studied with hopes of proving decoupling inequalities for a wider and more general class of surfaces and improving upon quantitative versions of these inequalities. Activities will further include organizing an online seminar, several undergraduate activities, and even presentations motivated by the research that are accessible to the public.<br/><br/>In 2015, Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth were able to prove a decoupling theorem for the moment curve from which the Main Conjecture in Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem (VMVT), a longstanding open question from 1935, followed as a corollary.

Such systems are abundant in all areas of science including biology, chemistry, and physics.   They are also readily visible in our everyday lives, ranging from describing the ways in which a disease epidemic is likely to progress to predicting the weather.  Given the initial state of the system, one would like to know what the future state of the system will be, as well as the long-term behavior of the system.  The equations describing such real-world phenomena are very complicated and are usually custom tailored to the system at hand.  They are typically far too difficult for rigorous study and scientists must often use numerical simulations to analyze them.  However, the underlying dynamical phenomena can often be understood by studying simpler systems whose states can be described in terms of one or two variables.   This project will support the study of dynamical systems consisting of iterating rational mappings in two complex variables, a setting where the powerful tools of complex analysis and algebraic geometry are available.   The research is designed around three principles: (1) exploring connections between two or more different areas of mathematics can lead to surprising new results, (2) dynamical systems having an additional context from another field can be studied significantly more deeply, and (3) a study of concrete examples often leads to more general theories.  Among other things, this project will support Ph.D. students from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis to engage in these research topics, thus training them in dynamical systems.   The broader impacts of this grant will be further achieved through the principal investigator's mentoring of highly talented high-school students from the Indianapolis area, and running the IUPUI High School Math Contest which engages approximately 60 to 100 high-school students from Indiana each year.<br/><br/>This research project is concerned with complex dynamics in higher dimensions.

Harmonic analysis involves breaking up a mathematical object such as a function into pieces that are easier to understand.  The beauty of this area is that the pieces are oftentimes simple, yet represent the whole with accuracy.  Number theory involves deceptively simple statements about the integers, easy to test, yet often difficult to prove.  Though seemingly disparate, analysis and number theory share many interactions. For instance, one can use intricate analysis of complex functions to answer fundamental questions about prime numbers.  This project explores a variety of problems at the interface of these two areas.  In particular, the PI will consider discrete variants of operators in analysis, which enjoy applications in fields such as medical imaging and cosmology.  To analyze these operators, continuous techniques often fail, and one has to develop number theoretic techniques adapted to the underlying geometry of the analytic problem. The PI seeks to provide new bounds, new techniques, sharper analysis and broader connections.  The PI also plans to bring Fourier analysis, a fundamental decomposition of the time-frequency domain, such as that used to understand waves, into the emerging field of arithmetic statistics.  Here she seeks to provide sharp counts of a wide variety of objects of arithmetic interest, such as elliptic curves used in cryptography.  As a broader impact, the PI will spark new mathematical conversations between analysts and number theorists and also improve the educational and scientific climate for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project addresses several fundamental questions at the interface of analysis and number theory.  Firstly, the PI pursues bounds for discrete variants of continuous operators in harmonic analysis that involve integration over a curved subvariety.  These bounds provide quantitative distributional facts about the underlying Diophantine equations that define these varieties, which makes them different from their continuous counterparts.  In particular, since continuous techniques usually do not carry over in this setting, the PI will develop refined number theoretic techniques to bound several operators, including multilinear spherical variants, variants defined over the primes, and higher codimensional analogues.  In particular, the higher codimensional study should open new avenues of problems as very little is known in this setting. Solving these problems has connections to discrete geometry, lattice point counts of surfaces, and Falconer's distance conjecture.  In another series of problems, the PI will pursue ""sparse bounds"" for both continuous and discrete operators.  Sparse bounds are a refinement of Lebesgue space bounds that allow one to deduce weighted estimates.  Finally, the PI plans to pursue a far reaching program in arithmetic statistics.  This is an area greatly developed on the algebraic side recently. The PI plans to inject Fourier analytic techniques to obtain precise lattice point counts that are adaptable to take advantage of the power of the algebraic techniques and push those bounds even further.  In particular, the PI hopes to obtain counts on certain objects such as elliptic curves, with an eye to not only developing techniques, but also fostering interactions between number theorists and analysts in new ways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some situations, minimizers to these natural energies exhibit singularities ? places where the solution is not smooth. This project investigates the formation and structure of such singularities. The integrated educational component of the project supports a mathematical summer program for high school students, a learning seminar designed to increase access to local research seminars, and a new and interdisciplinary graduate course.<br/><br/>The project studies singularity formation in three areas of the calculus of variations: (stationary) free boundary problems, nodal sets of solutions to parabolic partial differential equations, and energy critical evolution on manifolds.

When can one precisely describe the behavior of a solution in a space-time neighborhood of the singularity formation?

The Principal Investigator (PI) has a strong track record in targeting specific problems with broad appeal in various areas of Partial Differential Equations (PDE). In that sense, the problems considered as part of this project, though specific to the subject at hand, can also be reformulated in other important problems of mathematical physics. The project also fits well with respect to the long term goal of the PI to help create a vibrant scientific community working on mathematical problems connected to these areas.

This is a precise, explicit, family of solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations, depending on two parameters (the mass and the angular momentum), on which our theoretical understanding of black holes is based. Thus, the problems mentioned above are not only deep from a mathematical point of view, they also have serious implications in Astrophysics. This is particularly true about the problem of stability, since if the Kerr family were to be found unstable, black holes would be nothing more than mathematical artifacts. The PI interprets these three related problems as mathematical ""tests of reality"" for black holes. All three problems require a deep understanding of the dynamics of the Einstein field equations in a strong gravitational field regime. This is a tall task which can only be achieved by a systematic mathematical analysis of the underlining structure of the problems, using new geometric PDE techniques. The resolution of these problems promotes the progress of Mathematics and Science beyond the subject matter of this particular project.

The pioneering works of F. Murray and J. von Neumann from 1930-1940 already revealed that von Neumann algebras are complex objects that display extraordinary rich mathematical structures. Gradually, their study morphed into a stand-alone discipline which, over time, triggered the development of powerful mathematical theories and brought valuable insight to other sciences, including physics (statistical mechanics), biology (DNA molecule structure), engineering (cell phone network design) and computer science (error-correcting codes, theory of quantum information and quantum computing). Von Neumann algebras are highly interdisciplinary, arising naturally from simpler mathematical structures, such as symmetries and actions, often present in many areas of mathematics. Over time, their study maintained close connections with various topics in dynamical systems, measured group theory, and more recently to continuous model theory and geometric group theory. This project investigates new research avenues at the rich interaction between von Neumann algebras and the aforementioned areas. The main goal is to identify new ways of classifying von Neumann algebras through the lens of rigidity - a condition where it is shown that an entire structure of a mathematical object can be unraveled only from very limited a priori known information on that object. The project provides ample opportunities for the training and professional development of graduate students. <br/><br/>Continuing prior efforts of the Principal Investigator (PI), this project is aimed at expanding the boundary of knowledge in the classification of group/measure space von Neumann algebras and their applications to related fields. Specifically, the PI pursues new ideas at the interaction between deformation/rigidity theory and geometric group theory to advance several fundamental problems: (i) identify new groups and algebraic group features that are completely recognizable from the von Neumann algebraic and C*-algebraic structure; in particular, find additional examples of property (T) groups satisfying Connes' rigidity conjecture; (ii) compute invariants like the endomorphisms and the fundamental group of property (T) group factors and reduced group C*-algebras; (iii) find new natural examples of W*-superrigid actions, a problem of continued interest as it unifies two extreme forms of rigidity both in orbit equivalence and von Neumann algebras; and (iv) unveil new invariants distinguishing ultrapowers of factors and explore in depth their applications to continuous model theory. Many of these projects are highly interdisciplinary in nature and results arising from these projects are expected to reveal new bridges between geometric group theory, ergodic theory, C*-algebras, model theory, and von Neumann algebras.

This project addresses several aspects of such equations, including the qualitative and quantitative study of their asymptotic behavior and the stability of various equilibriums (stable equilibriums correspond to objects that can be encountered/observed). An underlying theme of the project is to develop robust methods to leverage the stabilizing mechanisms of dispersion (the fact that, since all objects move constantly in an infinite space, a high concentration at any given point at any given time becomes increasingly unlikely as time passes). Another central theme of the project is to study the effect of rotation on fluids. While it has been already recognized that this induces a stabilizing dispersive effect, the extent of this effect, its precise mathematical expression, and its consequences, remain largely unknown.  This project will also contribute to preparing the next generation of scientists by training graduate students, developing courses, as well as collaborative opportunities. <br/><br/>This project addresses various stability and asymptotic questions on kinetic and fluid equations, using the dispersive mechanism to obtain long-time control of the solutions. For kinetic equations, a goal is to understand the long-time behavior of solutions with a point charge part, using (and developing) the method of asymptotic action-angle. A first example is the stability of a Dirac mass, in the repulsive or (tentatively) the attractive case. A second question is to investigate the case of large data and the extension to the relativistic case. Another problem addressed concerns homogeneous equilibrium with an aim to better understand Landau damping (in the whole space). The PI will consider a model of fat-tail equilibria (the Poisson equilibrium) and will prove stability, by decomposing the electric field into an electrostatic contribution with faster decay and an oscillatory component that dissipates slowly. Using normal form techniques, the PI will prove that the long-time contribution of the slow but oscillatory component remains under control, and will close with a bootstrap argument based on Lebesgue norm of the density alone. Other generalizations will also be pursued. Finally, this project also considers situations where the rotation induces a stabilizing decaying mechanism, starting with global stability of the vector field of rigid motion for the incompressible 3d Euler. This in turn reduces to a problem of small data global existence for a quasilinear dispersive problem, which will be tackled using methods originating from the space-time resonance method and extensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematical theory of singular integrals has traditionally been formulated in smooth geometric settings. However, demand for an understanding of singular integrals in rougher settings has grown recently with a more refined understanding of mathematical models for physical phenomena in irregular or non-smooth environments. Emerging applications of singular integrals in quantum computing further buttress the need for such extensions of the classical theory. Notably, the relationship between singular integrals and the geometry of sets and measures facilitates a new understanding of dimension reduction for high-dimensional point sets, that is, mechanisms to detect whether large collections of points in a high-dimensional space in fact lie on a smooth lower-dimensional manifold. Results of this nature are important for data science applications, and the project has the potential to bring the toolkit of singular integral theory to bear on this important application domain. By coupling pure harmonic analysis methods with tools from combinatorics and probability, and through its noticeable interface with questions of relevance in data science, the project will also provide opportunities for the training of junior mathematicians, including graduate students.<br/><br/>This project considers a variety of questions in the study of singular integrals in non-smooth or rough settings, using both existing and newly developed tools. The principal investigators have been at the forefront of the past development of such a theory, and the current project will crystallize new applications to other areas of geometry and analysis. Questions under consideration in this project include: (a) a sharp characterization of bounded singular integrals with matrix weight, which is important in the regularity theory of vector stationary stochastic processes, (b) a characterization of weighted boundedness for para-product singular operators on graphs with cycles (multi-trees, Hamming cubes, etc.), and (c) the David-Semmes regularity problem in codimensions larger than one.

The area of mathematical dynamical systems consists of the study of the evolution over time of a system under a transformation rule that governs the behavior of the system. Methods from the study of dynamical systems, when applied to systems of algebraic origin and admitting a lot of symmetries, shed light, perhaps strikingly, on some of the oldest and most well-studied questions in mathematics, namely solutions in whole numbers, or integers, of polynomial equations, and approximations of arbitrary real numbers by fractions. In turn, developments in number theory, driven by dynamical methods, have had interesting and surprising applications, reaching recently as far as impacting wireless communication technologies. This project aims to deepen these fruitful connections between dynamics and number theory by, in particular, developing new methods for counting the number of integer solutions to certain types of highly symmetric polynomial equations. An important component of this project is geared towards training graduate students in this area, at the intersection of dynamical systems and number theory, through research and professional mentoring.<br/><br/>       The goal of this project is fourfold: 1) develop methods in homogeneous dynamics to resolve outstanding questions regarding the distribution of rational points near manifolds and self-similar sets; 2) develop techniques in the theory of random walks and linear representations of algebraic groups aimed at studying counting problems of integral points on affine homogeneous varieties; 3) develop spectral tools for the study of the dynamics of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle over the Teichmueller geodesic flow, along with applications to rigidity problems for horocycle flows on moduli spaces of Abelian differentials; 4) develop new methods for the study of the mixing properties of the geodesic flow on infinite volume locally symmetric spaces of negative curvature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pervasiveness of measures within contemporary mathematics notwithstanding, there are presently only a few tools available to analyze measures in regimes with low regularity. The proposed investigation seeks to develop novel and robust quantitative methods to study the geometry of general sets and measures in the absence of traditional simplifying hypotheses. The project will explore applications of these tools and methods to the analysis of harmonic functions and temperatures (solutions to the heat equation) in domains with rough boundary, both in ideal settings and inside non-homogenous media. The project will also provide training to graduate research assistants at the University of Connecticut and to visiting Ph.D. students working in geometric measure theory, harmonic analysis, and partial differential equations.<br/><br/>The project will develop four interrelated threads of research on the fine geometry of sets, the structure and regularity of measures, and the solutions of partial differential equations. The first line of inquiry pursues questions about subsets of rectifiable curves in infinite dimensional Banach spaces, with a concrete goal of solving the Analyst's Traveling Salesman Problem in a non-Hilbert setting. A second line of inquiry concerns the parameterization problem for Lipschitz images of the plane and the classification of 2-rectifiable Radon measures. Additional work will focus on the structure of measures supported on the graphs of Hölder continuous functions. A third direction of study will involve improved upper bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of harmonic and caloric measures on general domains, along with the relationship between the static and time-dependent cases.

The task of organizing large amounts of data in useful and ordered ways can be formulated in mathematical terms. This project investigates mathematical analogs of questions such as the following: How much data can we expect to organize in a useful way? What type of geometric structures arise in the process of such organization? Do these answers change if we allow ourselves to disregard a certain amount of information, and can the impact of such a choice be quantified? Finally, are there practical algorithms to implement such data organization? In geometric language, data naturally resides in a high dimensional space or a space where the notion of distance is quite different from the Euclidean one. This project aims at transferring well studied and efficient tools for analysis from low-dimensional Euclidean spaces to higher-dimensional and more general settings, allowing high-dimensional data to be ""visualized"" in a lower-dimensional, structured environment. The project will involve the training and mentoring of graduate students and postdocs and aims to develop tools which can lead to engagement between pure mathematicians and the data science community.<br/><br/>In many applications one is given a large data set, represented as a subset of a high-dimensional space, and one seeks to faithfully represent a large portion of this data set in a space of substantially lower dimension. ""Faithfully"" here means that essential geometric features are either preserved or mildly distorted. The Lipschitz condition for a geometric transformation quantifies the distortion of distances between data points. To date, the preceding task has received attention from computer scientists and applied mathematicians using a range of approaches. This project investigates mathematical approaches rooted in analysis and geometry. A key point is that often the given data has additional geometric structure, for example, it may have small Hausdorff dimension or be close to a union of low dimensional manifolds. Such added structure allows for the use of tools from harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory, especially, the theory of rectifiability. A quantitative version of this theory, known as uniform rectifiability, will be explored in novel metric settings. Other topics to be considered include quantitative improvements of low rank factorization theorems, Lipschitz decompositions of metric measure spaces, low-distortion factorization of bi-Lipschitz mappings, and Lipschitz parameterizations of high-dimensional spaces with parameterizing dimension greater than one.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex analysis studies functions depending on variables that are complex numbers. Complex analysis and potential theory provide powerful tools for solving important problems from other fields of pure and applied mathematics (e.g., image and signal processing) and physics (e.g., quantum mechanics and statistical physics). The project will focus on a diverse collection of questions advancing knowledge and understanding in these fields. New techniques from complex analysis and potential theory will be applied to questions originating in fields as diverse as complex and algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, and number theory. For example, the project will investigate sections of holomorphic line bundles and the asymptotics of the related Bergman kernel functions. These topics are related, for instance, to the quantum mechanics of particles in magnetic fields. The project will impact the development of human resources by effectively integrating research and education, and will include the supervision of doctoral theses.

These events will bring together established mathematicians, early-career researchers, and graduate students to discuss mathematics research and student mentoring.<br/> <br/>This project will address questions originating in the fields of pluripotential theory and random complex geometry, in the setting of compact complex manifolds. Some of these questions have important applications to complex and algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, or number theory. A unifying theme is a focus on plurisubharmonic functions and positive closed currents as objects of investigation or as tools to be employed. The first direction of research involves quantization problems on compact complex spaces. Such questions have applications to both statistical physics (via quantum chaos) and number theory (via quantum unique ergodicity for modular forms). Associated to a sequence of singular Hermitian holomorphic line bundles over a compact complex space, there are natural Bergman spaces of square-integrable holomorphic sections. Suitable positivity assumptions on curvature will be considered in connection with the growth of the dimension of these spaces, the convergence of the Fubini-Study currents, and the asymptotics of the associated Bergman kernel functions. Another topic to be considered is the asymptotic distribution of common zeros of random sequences of m-tuples of sections in the Bergman spaces, where special attention will be paid to estimates for the speed of convergence. In connection with holomorphic sections that vanish to high order along an analytic subset, the asymptotics of the corresponding partial Bergman kernels will be studied. Another direction of research deals with pluripotential theory on compact Kaehler manifolds. Here interesting new phenomena arise, distinct from the local setting. The investigator will study the largest domain of quasiplurisubharmonic functions on which the complex Monge-Ampere operator is well defined, and singularities of the corresponding quasiplurisubharmonic Green functions. Extension and regularization of quasiplurisubharmonic functions defined on analytic subvarieties will play a role.

A canonical example of an elliptic PDE is Laplace?s equation, which governs steady-state temperature distributions. One reason that elliptic equations are so useful is that precise results are known for very general elliptic PDE, even in the notoriously difficult setting of fully nonlinear equations. Outside of the elliptic setting, current techniques usually require the use of special properties of the equation under consideration, and abstract general results are rare. The theory of maximally subelliptic equations, a far-reaching generalization of elliptic equations, originated in the 1960s and 1970s. In the intervening years, many mathematicians have adapted results from the elliptic theory to various special cases of linear maximally subelliptic equations. This project will develop the regularity theory of linear maximally subelliptic PDE in full generality, and moreover will address the general situation of fully nonlinear maximally subelliptic PDE. This will provide a toolbox, more general than the usual one from the elliptic theory, for mathematicians and scientists who encounter such partial differential equations in their work. The project will provide research opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>This project will develop the theory of maximally subelliptic partial differential equations in three main steps. The first is a study of general linear maximally subelliptic partial differential operators with smooth coefficients. Special cases have previously been considered, but this will be the first such theory of these operators in full generality. A key tool which will be used is the underlying Carnot-Caratheodory geometry along with associated scaling maps. The next stage of the project will be a development of the theory of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin function spaces adapted to maximally subelliptic operators.  An important property of elliptic operators is that, modulo smooth functions, they are left invertible on many classical function spaces. The aforementioned Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces will generalize this fact to the maximally subelliptic setting. Special cases of these function spaces include both Sobolev and Zygmund-Holder spaces adapted to a maximally subelliptic operator. The third stage of the project will involve a study of fully nonlinear partial differential equations. The theory of function spaces and linear operators as described above will be used to understand the interior regularity of fully nonlinear maximally subelliptic equations. Outside of the elliptic setting, fully nonlinear equations are often difficult to study. The results of this project will provide a framework for future study of fully nonlinear equations in the maximally subelliptic setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, when water freezes into ice, the resulting ice crystal is expected to form a fractal-like structure on its boundary. Another example is tumor growth, where the boundary of the tumor develops irregularity due to the search for regions of high nutrients.

Dynamic free boundary problems face an additional difficulty coming from the lack of a priori regularity of the free boundaries.

Ergodic theory focusses on the statistical behavior of dynamical systems. Applications of ergodic theory are widespread: from traffic modeling to aerospace engineering and population dynamics. It is natural and of practical importance to generalize the role of time in a dynamical system to more complicated groups of symmetries. This generalized notion of dynamics leads to applications in statistical physics, number theory and geometry. However, new tools are needed especially in the particular case when the group of symmetries is non-amenable, which means that boundary phenomena are too significant to be safely ignored. Non-amenable groups naturally arise in many parts of mathematics such as geometry and number theory. This project is concerned with developing the tools needed to analyze the statistical behavior of non-amenable group actions by generalizing ergodic theory to this context. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The research goals of this projects are: (1) Measured equivalence relations (MERs) arise from actions of groups. MERs are both a tool and a source of interesting examples for extending classical ergodic theory to non-amenable group actions. This project aims to develop the structure of MERs by classifying the normal subequivalence relations of low-dimensional MERs and finding MER-analogs of objects from geometric group theory. (2) Sofic entropy theory is a generalization of classical entropy to actions of sofic groups, a class of groups including amenable and residually finite groups. It is relatively new. Specific goals include: determine conditions under which entropy is invariant under orbit-equivalence, develop a locally compact version of sofic entropy theory, classify mixing Markov chains over free groups and determine how sofic entropy depends on the choice of sofic approximation. (3) A major tool for extending ergodic theory to non-amenable groups is sofic approximation, in which the action of the group on itself is approximated locally on average by a sequence of partial actions on finite sets. There are no known cases when this tool cannot be used. A major goal of this project is to find non-sofic groups and actions of low-dimensional groups by modifying recent techniques used to solve Connes? Embedding Conjecture. (4) Sofic approximation fits into the broader framework of Benjamini-Schramm (BS) convergence, in which one considers sequence of finite graphs or compact measured metric spaces and the limit object is a random pointed graph or space. Naturally occurring sequences include random translation surfaces, quadratic differentials and measured laminations. This project will determine the BS-limit of these sequences and relate them to known objects such as the Curien-Werner Markovian triangulation and Gaussian Analytic Functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of them is on the theory of optimal transport, which dates back to Gaspard Monge in 1781. The theory studies, for instance, the optimal way to move a pile of sand to an excavation, where optimality is measured against a cost function which may be proportional to the distance traveled. Many works led to connections with partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, geometry, probability theory and functional analysis. Currently, optimal transport enjoys applications in signal and image representation, inverse problems, cancer detection, shape and image registration, and machine learning, to name a few. The project relies on the theory of optimal transport to make advances in games which consist of a large number of players, and keeps a focus on equations such as the so-called master equation pioneered by Lasry and Lions. It also features variational problems and dynamics of systems of finitely many and infinitely many particles and also deals with non-commutative optimal transport theory. The project offers training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, as well as learning seminars. The students are involved in a research program that aims to encourage interactions between mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers. <br/><br/>The project studies Hamilton-Jacobi equations with non-local terms, known to be challenging, especially when the non-locality appears in the gradient of the unknown function. In this context, the so-called Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition allowed to obtain the first well-posedness result on the master equation. In a previous research project, an alternative condition was proposed, which made it possible for the first time to handle non-separable Hamiltonians. This prior work relied heavily on the presence of the so-called individual noise. This project explores new ideas for handling non-separable Hamiltonians with only common noise in the master equations. It also initiates studies on inverse optimal transport and inverse Mean Field Games problems, with the goal of achieving desired outcomes by designing appropriate Lagrangians. Working on bounded domains makes it more difficult to predict the Lagrangians needed to produce desirable Nash equilibria in Mean Field Games. The project identifies minimal information on the boundary needed to deal with non-smooth augmented Lagrangians which appear in the resolution of these inverse problems. The project also considers inverse optimal transport problems in unbounded sets. Another part of this project is on partial differential equations on graphs and relies on a metric manifold of discrete densities. The project develops a well-posedness theory as well as a stability property for differential equations on graphs. While the role of optimal transport is well established in classical mechanics, establishing these ideas in the quantum setting, opens doors to several new avenues of research. For instance, one faces the challenge of identifying the non-commutative common noise operator, and studying its properties. To achieve these goals, there is a need to continue unearthing new properties of the Biane-Voiculescu's transport distance, and study non-commutative dynamical systems. Non-commutative optimal transport theory offers the appropriate setting for studying dynamics of random matrices, whose sizes will later tend to infinity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A translational tiling is a covering of a space using translated copies of certain building blocks, called the ?tiles?, without overlaps. The focus of this project is on the major question in the area: which are the possible ways that a space can be tiled.  The structure of tilings has been extensively studied over the years by many mathematicians; among the most famous and significant contributors are the mathematical physicist Roger Penrose and the amateur mathematicians Robert Ammann and Maurits Cornelis Escher. This mathematical study has found many important applications to other sciences. In particular, it led to one of the most significant breakthroughs in physical science: the discovery of natural quasicrystals, physical solids whose atoms? arrangement is not periodic. Since aperiodic tilings (i.e., pavings of space which cannot be ?determined? by how they look in an arbitrarily large but bounded part of the space) serve as the mathematical models of quasicrystals, the discovery of those aperiodic forms in nature by Dan Shechtman (for which he won the Nobel prize), was based on the mathematical discovery of aperiodic tilings. Orthogonal systems are of importance to several branches of mathematics, including number theory, algebraic geometry and analysis. One of their advantageous properties is that they can facilitate an amenable decomposition of a function (e.g., describing light or sound waves) into more manageable pieces with a high level of mutual independence. Studying these pieces separately can yield insight into the physical properties of a system such as dominant frequencies. The research carried out (in conjunction with collaborators) consists of revealing connections to a range of different areas of mathematics and building on past results in those areas, as well as developing novel methods and techniques.<br/><br/>The first part of this project will be devoted to the study of the structure of translational tilings. The main goal is solving the well-known periodic tiling conjecture, which asserts that any bounded measurable tile of the Euclidean space must admit at least one periodic tiling. This conjecture is known to hold for tilings of the real line, and there are some partial results towards it in higher dimensions. However, the periodic tiling conjecture has not been settled yet in dimensions two and higher. Over time it has become apparent that in many respects translational tiles ?behave like? domains whose Hilbert space (i.e., the space of quadratically integrable functions that are supported on the domain) admits an orthogonal basis of exponential functions. Thus, a second area of focus is on the structure of frequency sets of orthogonal systems of exponentials in two different settings: in time-frequency spaces (Gabor bases) and in Hilbert spaces of certain domains. This part of the project aims to find new approaches to the latter mentioned studies of orthogonal systems, building new bridges between number theory, algebraic geometry and Fourier analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mean field equation and the Allen-Cahn equation are two important types of nonlinear PDE that have arisen in the study of physical phenomena such as electroweak interaction and Chern-Simons-Higgs quantum field theories, statistical mechanics of two-dimensional turbulence, phase separation, and phase transitions. The mean field equation is also related to the study of general relativity as well as to cosmology. An important aspect of the Allen-Cahn equation is the formation of interfaces separating different physical regions of interest, which often have area minimizing properties, seen in minimal surfaces such as soap bubbles. This research project aims to advance understanding of these important equations through use of a mathematical tool recently developed by the investigator and collaborators. The project involves students at both undergraduate and graduate levels in interdisciplinary research. Postdoctoral fellows and junior researchers will also participate in and be trained as part of the project.<br/><br/>The principal investigator plans to investigate the newly discovered sphere covering inequality (SCI) in high dimensions and various other generalizations. Applications to the mean field equation and its high-dimensional counterpart will be explored. The SCI connects geometry to analysis and has become a powerful tool in the study of two-dimensional nonlinear PDE. High-dimensional SCIs have potential for study of conformal geometry, such as improved Beckner's inequalities and uniqueness of solutions to higher order equations involving Paneitz operators. For the Allen-Cahn equation, the PI will focus on the level set structure of solutions of finite Morse index, such as, for example, the relation between the level sets of solutions and minimal surfaces. In particular, a classification of stable solutions in three dimensions will be pursued. The PI intends to use various identities and energy estimates as well as Morse index information to develop a new approach for these non-monotone, non-minimizing solutions. The final goal of the project is to understand completely entire solutions for both scalar and vector-valued Allen-Cahn equations and the stability and dynamics of triple or quadruple junctions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematical theory of singular integrals has traditionally been formulated in smooth geometric settings. However, demand for an understanding of singular integrals in rougher settings has grown recently with a more refined understanding of mathematical models for physical phenomena in irregular or non-smooth environments. Emerging applications of singular integrals in quantum computing further buttress the need for such extensions of the classical theory. Notably, the relationship between singular integrals and the geometry of sets and measures facilitates a new understanding of dimension reduction for high-dimensional point sets, that is, mechanisms to detect whether large collections of points in a high-dimensional space in fact lie on a smooth lower-dimensional manifold. Results of this nature are important for data science applications, and the project has the potential to bring the toolkit of singular integral theory to bear on this important application domain. By coupling pure harmonic analysis methods with tools from combinatorics and probability, and through its noticeable interface with questions of relevance in data science, the project will also provide opportunities for the training of junior mathematicians, including graduate students.<br/><br/>This project considers a variety of questions in the study of singular integrals in non-smooth or rough settings, using both existing and newly developed tools. The principal investigators have been at the forefront of the past development of such a theory, and the current project will crystallize new applications to other areas of geometry and analysis. Questions under consideration in this project include: (a) a sharp characterization of bounded singular integrals with matrix weight, which is important in the regularity theory of vector stationary stochastic processes, (b) a characterization of weighted boundedness for para-product singular operators on graphs with cycles (multi-trees, Hamming cubes, etc.), and (c) the David-Semmes regularity problem in codimensions larger than one.

At the same time, such complex systems are subject to an abundance of influences, and depend on a large variety of parameters and interactions. In addition, for many complex phenomena most of the available information is very often ""statistical"" (random) and not ""exact"" (deterministic). A systematic understanding of the interplay of stochasticity and complex dynamical behavior aims at unveiling universal properties, irrespectively of the many details of the concrete systems at hand. Its development relies on the derivation and analysis of universal concepts for their scaling limits, capturing not only their average behavior, but also their fluctuations. Stochastic partial differential equations are the natural mathematical object to study and understand the role of fluctuations. Another very current and important issue arising in science and technology is the analysis, both theoretically and computationally, of problems that involve several disparate length-scales at once. For example, understanding, modeling and accurately predicting the behavior of materials at the macroscopic scale necessitates to consider their microscopic structure. Instead of considering materials in one scale and neglecting the finer scales, modern materials science increasingly explicitly and concurrently deals with models of a given material at many different scales. Homogenization and multiscale approaches are the two, respectively theoretical and computational, facets of the mathematical theory to study such problems. As a matter of fact, it is necessary to consider homogenization in random environments since periodicity is rather restrictive for the modeling of real materials. Growth models are natural mathematical models used in probability and mathematical physics to study stochastic partial differential equations exhibiting a universal scaling limit. Mean-field games are the ideal mathematical structures to study the quintessential problems in the social-economic sciences, which differ from physical settings because of the forward looking behavior on the part of individual agents. In this context, an agent aims to optimize certain criteria which, together with her/his dynamics, depend on the other agents and their actions. Agents react, anticipate and strategize instead of simply reacting instantaneously. Examples of applications include the modeling of the macro-economy and conflicts in the modern era. In both cases, a large number of agents interact strategically in a stochastically evolving environment, all responding to partly common and partly idiosyncratic incentives, and all trying to simultaneously forecast the dynamic decisions of others. Some mean-field games models in, for example, telecommunications are naturally set on networks (graphs). This raises the need of the development of the mathematical tools to study equations on graphs and to understand their behavior across nodes. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project is a continuation of the PI's program to develop novel methodologies and techniques for the qualitative and quantitative study of nonlinear first- and second-order deterministic and stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs and SPDEs, respectively) arising in natural and social sciences and engineering. The emphasis is on (i) PDEs with multiplicative ``rough'' path dependence; (ii) homogenization in random media; (iii) well-posedness in domains with singularities; (iv) mean-field games; and (v) convergence of growth models. Nonlinear, first- and second-order partial differential equations with rough and, in particular, stochastic time dependence arise naturally in the study of fluctuations. The further development of the theory of pathwise solutions is important, for it allows to study of new classes of nonlinear SPDEs, and is expected to play a crucial role in applied areas by providing the tools to analyze previously intractable models. Studying qualitatively and quantitatively stochastic homogenization problems requires the development of novel arguments and methodologies to address the loss of compactness when going from periodic to stationary ergodic media. The analysis of the behavior of scaled growth models gives rise to new equations. Their well-posedness requires the refinement of some of the by now classical tools from the theory of viscosity solutions. It is by now well understood that a very important element of the mean-field game theory is the so-called master equation, an infinite-dimensional partial differential equation which subsumes in a single equation both the individual and collective behaviors of agents. In spite of considerable progress in the study of the properties of the smooth solution of the master equation in the presence of both idiosyncratic and common noises, less is known in the absence of the former in which case smooth solutions do not exist in general. Another important question in this context is the development of a notion of weak solution in the relevant for application nonmonotone setting. Two of the most important questions in the study of equations of graphs is the well-posedness across vertices and the identification of the correct coupling condition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
