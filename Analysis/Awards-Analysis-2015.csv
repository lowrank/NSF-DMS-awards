Dynamical systems are all around us: the motion of the planets, the weather, the stock market, and the ecosystems in which we live. These systems depend on a variety of parameters, and as these parameters change, the corresponding system is affected. Often, ""complexifying"" a dynamical system and its corresponding parameter space, that is, regarding the salient quantities as complex numbers rather than (the more highly restricted) real numbers,  leads to new insights and tools for investigating the underlying mathematics. Complex dynamics is a very active field that has experienced tremendous progress over the past few decades. This conference will bring together a diverse group of participants, ranging from various experts in these fields to younger researchers who are beginning their studies, for an intense and focused meeting to discuss exciting new developments, ideas, and directions for the subject.<br/><br/>Complex dynamics has thrived over the past 25 years. This period of development has led to deep results on certain one-parameter model families (quadratic polynomials, for example). The time is ripe for the subject to advance to a more general theory, which will inevitably involve related fields such as Teichmüller theory, moduli spaces, dynamics in several complex variables, self-similar groups, arithmetic dynamics, symbolic dynamics, hyperbolic and algebraic geometry, and statistical physics. The conference will feature presentations by leading experts in complex dynamics and Teichmüller theory and will provide ample time for discussions.  In addition to the formal scientific program, this conference will have two aspects less common to current mathematics conferences: there will be a young researchers seminar in which more junior participants can share their work with the community of mathematicians attending the conference, and there will be a computer program tutorial, showcasing some of the latest software used in the field. <br/><br/>Conference web site :  http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kochsc/H70.html"

From its origins in the late 19th century to today, the mathematical theory of dynamical systems has been inspired by problems in adjacent areas of mathematics (e.g. number theory, geometry, probability), and other natural sciences (e.g. celestial mechanics, statistical mechanics, population biology). This project belongs to that rich tradition, and focuses on deriving fundamental results for a variety of dynamical systems arising from geometry, number theory and applied settings. The common thread that unifies these topics is an 'entropic' approach to all the problems under consideration. The entropy of a dynamical system is a fundamental invariant which measures the complexity of its orbit structure. The three main research directions of the project are: (1) to establish uniqueness of measures of maximal entropy and equilibrium states in a variety of higher dimensional settings of interest to the dynamics and wider mathematical communities; (2) to give a number-theoretic description of all the possible entropies that can be achieved within certain natural classes of dynamical systems; (3) to use information-theoretic interpretations of entropy and related quantities to give insight to problems in mathematical bioscience. The project contains a substantial program of synergistic educational activities, including the development of an after-school math enrichment program for the Ohio State University Young Scholars Program. The program will develop fundamental mathematical skills for a talented population of students from under-represented groups taken from all the major urban areas of Ohio.<br/><br/>Part (1) of the project develops a novel approach to the theory of equilibrium states, focusing on implementation to non-uniformly and partially hyperbolic systems. The project develops novel techniques to overcome some of the traditional obstructions to developing an effective theory in these higher dimensional settings. The end goal is to use these results to derive numerous global statistical properties (central limit theorems, large deviations, etc.) for the systems within our framework. Motivating examples include geodesic flows in non-positive curvature, and the Teichmueller flow on the moduli space of quadratic differentials. Part (2) concerns the algebraic description of numbers arising as entropies of post-critically finite interval maps. A surprising relationship between the degree of the map and the algebraic properties of these numbers was identified experimentally in Thurston's final paper. A rigorous explanation of this phenomenon remains an open problem, which the PI has recast in terms of identifying zeros of certain complex functions. Part (3) investigates finitary versions of entropy, and related quantities, in the mathematical biosciences. The PI will use these quantities, interpreted as measures of complexity, as tools for detecting structure in large data sets, particularly those arising in genomic analysis and in the dynamics of biologically motivated networks."

Probably the most important example is the time evolution of a physical system. Given complete information about its state at a particular time, one should be able to predict the state at any later time. If the dynamics is ""reversible"" (such as in Newtonian mechanics), one can also determine the state at any previous time. If there are no outside influences on the system, the new state depends only on the beginning state and how long the system was allowed to run, not on the particular time at which it started. (If you plant a seed in the fall, the result six months later will be different from the result if you plant it in the spring. However,  if the climate were the same year round, the result six months later would be the same regardless of when you plant.) This setup is an example of an action of the group of real numbers: the set of possible lengths of time the system is allowed to run. Actions of other groups are also important. The group of integers corresponds to taking time in discrete steps, which is sometimes appropriate and is mathematically simpler. Other groups arise from symmetry in a system or from entirely different considerations. One main goal of this project is to better understand certain kinds of dynamical systems, at this stage primarily discrete ones but for which the groups can be otherwise complicated. One direction is to understand the relation between the system and a particular algebraic object, the so-called crossed product, constructed from the system. Another direction is the complete description in a special case (in which the collection of objects of the system is very complicated but the group is actually finite) of all possible systems.<br/><br/>The largest component of this project involves relating the properties of a minimal and essentially free action of a countable amenable group on a compact metric space to the structure of its crossed product. The plan is to push forward the boundaries of our knowledge in two two particular directions: (1) relating the mean dimension of a minimal homeomorphism to the radius of comparison of the crossed product (simplest group, namely, the integers, and most complicated space) and (2) proving regularity properties when the group is arbitrary but the space is the Cantor set (simplest space, most complicated group). It is also hoped that related methods will help with actions on simple C*-algebras when the action has the tracial Rokhlin property. The next component is the classification of pointwise outer actions of finite groups on purely infinite simple separable nuclear C*-algebras, a much larger class of actions than the ones already classified (those with the Rokhlin property). The third component is the study of operator algebras on Lebesgue spaces with exponent different from two. This is a new field which turns out to be unexpectedly rich."

This research project on Banach spaces will have two main directions. The first one is the study of coordinate systems of Banach spaces. If we model a given problem in physics or signal analysis using a certain Banach space we will also need an ""appropriate coordinate system"" for that space, i.e. we want to represent the elements of this space by a sequence of numbers. What constitutes an ""appropriate coordinate system"" will of course depend on the specific problem, but generally the goal is to approximate a given element of a Banach space as well as possible with the least amount of coordinates, and to reconstruct the element from the given sequence of coordinates with the smallest possible error and the least amount of effort. Not every Banach space admits coordinate systems which have the minimality properties; one would like a coordinate system to satisfy. Therefore one also needs to find for a given Banach space criteria to embed it into a space with coordinate systems, without losing the topological and geometrical properties of the original space. Metric spaces are often used in Computer Science to model large data sets, and our second objective is to investigate embeddings of metric spaces into Banach spaces, and to obtain on the one hand information about the structure of the metric space, from the property that it embeds in certain Banach spaces, and on the other hand deduce geometric properties of a Banach space, from the property that certain metrics embed or do not embed in it.  <br/><br/>Many of the problems under study in this project either originate from, or are related to, other areas of mathematics such as descriptive set theory, harmonic analysis, metric geometry, and approximation theory. The techniques to be employed will involve a combination of analysis, geometry, infinite combinatorics, and logic.  One of the problems considered is an old one from harmonic analysis, which asks whether the space of p-integrable functions and other function spaces have a Schauder basis formed by translates of only one element.  Another prominent problem is the embedding of uniformly convex Banach spaces into such spaces with a basis or a finite dimensional decomposition. Together with his colleague Sivakumar and their joint student, Keaton Hamm, the investigator intends to study the representation and approximation of elements of certain function classes using redundant coordinate systems. The research also pursues a new direction and investigates problems in metric geometry. This work aims to characterize geometric and topological properties of Banach space like reflexivity by the embeddability of certain metric spaces."

However, the scope of applications of the Heisenberg groups goes far beyond quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg groups play an important role in many areas of mathematics and also in the mathematical biology in the development of a mathematical model of the visual cortex. Although the Heisenberg groups have been studied for several decades now, recent developments, leading to applications in new areas of pure and applied mathematics, provide new perspectives. This research project will advance this very active area of contemporary mathematics. The project will provide ample opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral associates to be trained in this important area that bridges different fields of mathematics. Four graduate students and two postdoctoral associates will actively work on topics related to the project. <br/><br/>The research will lead to a development of the program introduced in a seminal work of M. Gromov and it will consist of several independent, but related tasks. Most of the tasks will be carried out as a joint projects of the PI with his graduate students, postdoctoral associates and other researchers from the US and Europe. The project will investigate the following problems. (1) Develop the theory of Lipschitz homotopy groups of the Heisenberg groups. Unlike the classical homotopy groups, the Lipschitz homotopy groups provide a deeper insight into the geometry of Holder, Lipschitz, and Sobolev mappings into the Heisenberg group. (2) Characterize the pairs of the Heisenberg groups that have the Lipschitz extension property. The Lipschitz extension property is very difficult to study, because the methods of the classical topology fail and a more quantitative and analytic methods are necessary. (3) Solve the problem of the Whitney extension for mappings into the Heisenberg group. While the Whitney extension theorem has proven to be one of the most influential results in analysis, the Heisenberg group provides a non-linear constraint that has not been investigated so far. (4) Develop the differential calculus of Holder continuous maps. This subject has recently and independently been discovered by many researchers working in different areas of mathematics and the goal of the PI is to find a unified approach which will lead to a simplification of some results of Gromov and will link the methods developed for the Heisenberg group with the geometric rigidity problems in convex integration. (5) Construct a counterexample to a conjecture of M. Gromov about Holder mappings into the Heisenberg group. Numerical examples show unexpected results, but they have to be verified rigorously. (6) Find a new characterization of mappings of bounded length distortion, a study motivated by unrectifiability of the Heisenberg group. Other topics under study in the project are: approximation of convex functions, boundedness of maximal functions in Sobolev spaces, homeomorphisms whose Jacobian changes sign, and continuity of Sobolev mappings with positive Jacobian."

The PI studies holomorphic dynamics, which refers to iterations of certain complex-valued maps that admit a rich geometry. The subject has numerous interactions with other areas of mathematics, in particular with the important subjects of Teichmuller Theory and Multidimensional Complex Analysis.  The PI will continue her work concerning geometric aspects of holomorphic dynamics and in particular she will work to extend certain parts of the the theory from dynamics of one complex variable to several complex variables.  The PI will continue to provide special topical lectures to undergraduate and graduate students in the hope of exciting the interest of students in the field of dynamical systems and, more broadly, in mathematics.<br/><br/>The link between holomorphic dynamics and Teichmuller Theory can be to a large extent explained by holomorphic motions. The PI, together with collaborators, suggest a geometric approach to the proof of Slodkowski's lambda lemma. We relate holomorphic motions to the technique of filling totally real manifolds by holomorphic discs. We plan to use this approach to investigate the h-principle for holomorphic motions over Riemann surfaces. Thurston's theorem on postcritically finite rational maps is one of the central results in one-dimensional holomorphic dynamics.  Building on Thurston's work, A. Epstein introduced deformation spaces, which give a unified approach to transversality results in holomorphic dynamics.  The PI, together with collaborators, will investigate certain topological properties of these deformation spaces. In one-dimensional holomorphic dynamics to a large extent the orbits of critical points determine the dynamics of the map. For an automorphism of complex plane there are no critical points however there are various analogs of the critical points in different dynamically defined regions. The research will investigate these critical loci and their application to the construction of topological models. We also study the non-linearizable germs of analytic diffeomorphisms of complex plane."

For example, the spread of an epidemic in a specific population can be described using a contact network representing the nature and strength of interpersonal interactions among individuals. Historically, these models were intractable due to the complexity of individual behavior and, therefore, many early disease models utilized simplified representations involving population averages and statistics. By differentiating individuals, network models carry a large amount of additional information that has become more accessible thanks to increasingly powerful computer processors and the advent of fast computational algorithms. This project develops new mathematical theories and computational algorithms to capture the essential features of networks and applies them to models in epidemiology. Results from this project will allow researchers to identify a number of valuable patterns in the data, including the subpopulations at highest risk, vulnerable transmission pathways, and effective mitigation strategies. <br/><br/>The investigator and his colleagues study the mathematical concept of p-modulus on networks, focusing on the analysis of theoretical properties, the development of numerical algorithms, and the study of applications to the spread of diseases in contact networks. This is an interdisciplinary project intended to enhance both the theoretical understanding of the ways in which diseases spread in an interconnected network of individuals or sub-populations, and the computational tools available to researchers interested in modeling, simulating, and predicting the behavior of epidemics. The theory of p-modulus was originally developed in the field of complex analysis and has a connection to the concept of effective resistance in the context of electrical networks. The p-modulus provides a method for quantifying the richness of a family of walks: families of many short walks have a larger modulus than families of few long ones. Therefore, the flexibility of p-modulus provides a means for extracting fine structure characteristics of linked data."

These systems depend on a variety of parameters, and as these parameters change, the corresponding system is affected. Understanding how dynamical systems change with different parameters is a very complicated and delicate question which is not even completely understood in the simplest of mathematical models. The research outlined in this proposal explores connections between different perspectives on parameter spaces associated to particular dynamical systems. For example, one of the most intriguing ways to view these parameter spaces is algebraically; that is, these parameters spaces are intimately related of roots of polynomials, an area of mathematics that, a priori, has no obvious connection to dynamics. Investigating these mysterious and somewhat surprising connections is one of the main research goals outlined in this proposal. This proposal also contains a substantial outreach component to share mathematics with high school students through mathematical fieldtrips to the Mathematics Department at the University of Michigan, and to give graduate students and postdocs opportunities to learn from each other through a series of workshops, which will be followed by companion conferences at the University of Michigan. <br/><br/><br/>A major goal in the field of complex dynamics is to understand dynamical moduli spaces. The most successful endeavor in this regard has been the study of the moduli space of quadratic polynomials where the Mandelbrot set lives; the Mandelbrot set is a universal object in complex dynamics. Much of the structure of the Mandelbrot set can actually be revealed through algebraic data; that is, there are distinguished algebraic integers in the Mandelbrot set (ie, roots of a certain collection of polynomials with integer coefficients), and these points are dense in the boundary. In the first part of this proposal, we consider collections of algebraic integers (or roots of collections of polynomials) arising naturally in the parameter space of an iterated function system. We take the topological closure of these roots and (following some work of others) develop a dynamical theory of the iterated function system to better understand the structure of this set. Much of the discussion unfolds in a way parallel to that for quadratic polynomials except there are some surprising differences and still many interesting questions to explore which link geometry, dynamics, algebra, and Galois theory. The second part of this proposal is centered around algebraic data and Thurston's Topological Characterization of Rational Maps, one of the most important theorems in complex dynamics. Associated to a postcritically finite rational map on the Riemann sphere, are three different kinds of linear operators. These operators naturally arise in the setting of Thurston's theorem, each acting on a finite-dimensional vector space. The characteristic polynomials of these operators have rational coefficients, so the corresponding eigenvalues are algebraic. This proposal explores possible connections that these operators (and their eigenvalues) have with each other, and connections that these operators (and their eigenvalues) have with the geometry and dynamics of the original rational map."

In a broader context, the research is aimed at answering a basic scientific question: ""What are the effects of disorder?""  This is a fundamental question relevant to any mathematical model, even one in which disorder is not explicitly included. After all, any real world system is subject to a small amount of noise, and experience shows that even weak disorder may have a profound effect on the behavior of the system. The equations studied in this project arise in the theory of electrical conduction in disordered materials, but are of general interest because of the fundamental nature of both wave motion and disorder. Progress in understanding the solutions to these equations will improve basic understanding of models of theoretical physics and applied mathematics.  In addition, a central goal of the research is pedagogical: to introduce undergraduate and graduate students to a fundamental subject and convey to them that mathematics is a vibrant, growing field. <br/><br/>The project will proceed through a program of research on the effects of disorder in physical models. A key goal is to analyze the diffusion of waves in a weakly disordered medium over arbitrarily long times.  There is a rich non-rigorous theory of the weakly disordered regime in the physics literature based on heuristic analyses and uncontrolled, renormalized perturbation theory which suggests that waves propagate diffusively, characterized by spreading of wave packets over a distance proportional to the square root of t in time t. However, we are far from having a rigorous analysis of the mathematics involved. A major challenge is that diffusive propagation does not occur for waves in a non-random medium. Thus, a naive approach in which the disorder is incorporated perturbatively has not worked, indeed in the physics literature the problem is attacked with renormalized perturbation theory. In recent years the PI and various post-doc and student collaborators have considered the problem of wave diffusion in time-dependent random media, with the time dependence generated by a Markov process. For such models the diffusive propagation, e.g., for the tight binding Schrödinger equation, can be established by spectral analysis. One aim of the present project is to approach the time independent equation as a perturbation of these time dependent equations, which have the virtue of sharing the expected qualitative behavior."

After the pioneering work of Joseph Fourier in the first decades of the nineteenth century, one is now familiar with the process of decomposing a signal or function into its elementary frequency components (analysis) as well as with the reverse process of superposing individual frequency components to form a single signal (synthesis). Fourier analysis thus acts in a way similar to a prism, which allows one to see the individual color components of a beam of light. Along these lines, when two functions or signals coexist, their frequency components interact and this  phenomenon plays a key role in the study of certain partial differential equations that arise, for instance, in optics, quantum mechanics, and fluid dynamics. In the field of bilinear Fourier analysis, tools are developed to model the behavior and interaction of two signals by decomposing each one into their constituent frequencies, separating each decomposition into low and high frequencies, and studying the interplay between the low-low, high-low, and high-high frequencies from each decomposition. This project will also contribute to the integration of research and education at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels, to advancing discovery, to forming human resources, and to developing academic curricula.<br/><br/>Motivated by the study of commutators, bilinear Leibniz-type rules, paraproducts, and related topics in analysis and partial differential equations, the research activities of this project aim at developing methods in bilinear Fourier analysis to advance the theory of bilinear pseudo-differential operators and their applications. In particular, problems to be addressed include the description of the mapping properties, in the scales of Lebesgue, Besov, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, of bilinear pseudodifferential operators with symbols in certain critical classes."

Of particular interest is the scenario when the intrinsic driving forces within the physical system are highly irregular.  Such irregularities are prevalent in many mathematical models used in physics, fluid mechanics, epidemiology and financial mathematics.  The goal is to reach a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of such models.  In particular, the plan is to establish the existence of a large class of mathematical models in physics and biology which is sufficiently rich to allow for a broad range of applications and at the same time flexible enough to accommodate unavoidable statistical errors in estimating the parameters of the underlying models. <br/><br/>The proposed research consists of three major undertakings concerning stochastic dynamical systems:<br/>1.  Existence and spatial regularity of random invariant manifolds for singular stochastic differential equations (sdes) driven by Brownian motion and Borel measurable linearly bounded drift coefficients.   A Stable Manifold Theorem should hold for such singular sdes.  Given the extreme roughness of the driving vector fields, the existence and differentiability of the invariant manifolds would be striking and counter-intuitive.  The results will be attained via Malliavin calculus and multiplicative ergodic theory.  <br/>2.  A strategy for a proof of the Kupka-Smale Conjecture for stochastic differential equations driven by smooth vector fields on compact Riemannian manifolds.  The basic intuition behind such a fundamental result is that in order for a family of hyperbolic vector fields to represent the dynamics of viable physical/biological models, it is imperative that the family be ""rich"" within the set of all ""reasonable"" vector fields, and at the same time be insensitive to perturbations in the coefficients.  <br/>3.  Existence and smoothness of densities (with respect to Lebesgue measure) for the finite-dimensional random invariant subspaces of linear stochastic partial differential equations."

The new insights gained from this work should also reflect back on noncommutative geometry, operator space theory, and classical harmonic analysis.<br/> <br/>The study of noncommutative objects offers a new point of view on many topics in mathematics that reflect daily life, and it also arguably represents the ""right"" language for quantum mechanics.  In real life, the order in which certain operations are executed can make a big difference. For example, first boiling water and afterwards adding oil is very different from first boiling oil and then adding water. Noncommutative analysis is about functions and their properties in the realm of noncommuting variables. The most important example is matrix-valued functions. The theory of Fourier analysis or harmonic analysis has a lot to say about functions, and as this project intends to show, also about matrix-valued functions. The project will also make valuable contributions to control theory and signal and image processing, where matrix-valued functions are natural occurences."

This began in the seventeenth century with Rene Descartes's remarkable insight that associated to any equation a geometric object; namely, the graph of the equation. Geometric properties of the graph encode algebraic properties of the equation, and vice versa. Throughout the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, many mathematicians worked to deepen and extend Descartes's ideas. Thus the subject of algebraic geometry was developed. This subject has flourished and has achieved many outstanding results. In the mid-twentieth century--largely inspired by quantum theory and other physics--a new kind of algebra (operator algebras) emerged.  More recently, this new algebra has been combined with geometry to form the new subject of noncommutative geometry. The mathematics of this project takes methods and results from noncommutative geometry and applies them to problems in the older, more traditional branches of mathematics.<br/><br/>The noncommutative geometry point of view has led to some startling conjectures and results. In the representation theory of reductive p-adic groups a totally unexpected geometric structure has been revealed. This greatly simplifies the representation theory and links the Baum-Connes conjecture (which is a conjecture within noncommutative geometry) to the Langlands program. For the index of geometrically-arising Fredholm operators, the noncommutative geometry point of view leads to the surprising conclusion that formulas like the Atiyah-Singer index formula apply well beyond elliptic operators. Hence ellipticity is not the essential point needed to obtain a topological formula for the index of such operators. This project will explore the many interactions of this wide-ranging set of ideas."

It is often the case that full knowledge of the particles' position and velocity are not exact.  As a particle moves after a unit of time (say a day), the new position is not known exactly.  In this project such systems are studied.  The goal is to show that the long run behavior of the collection of particles is governed by some probability distribution in the phase space.  The distribution should have nice geometric properties.   While the ""chaotic"" behavior of these system is by definition impossible to be exactly predicted there are systems which are described by algebraic equations where researchers can probabilistically study the long run behavior.<br/><br/>The random iteration of diffeomorphisms is an important model for different types of dynamical systems. The PI plans to study these random iterations and gives a precise (as precise as possible) description of the stationary measure associated with it, particularly its geometric properties.   Once geometric properties are established, some statistical properties can be deduced as corollaries, for example, the equidistribution of almost every orbit with respect to volume. This project will develop in two additional directions.  One concerns dynamical systems with multidimensional time (i.e. actions of higher rank groups) and the other concerns classical dynamical systems (i.e. one dimensional time) displaying some uniform (though possibly partial) hyperbolicity. The unifying theme in the study is the techniques used which involve the interactions between measure theoretical and topological properties of a system. In all cases a description of relevant invariant measures is desired, how this impacts the topological dynamics and ultimately how this affects the topology of the ambient manifold. The PI also seeks intermediate interactions, for instance how the topology of the manifold imposes restrictions on the dynamics."

The analysis of the equations governing physical and biological processes often requires a precise quantitative understanding of the relative sizes of various quantities involved in these processes, and this is provided by mathematical inequalities, often of a geometric nature. The quest for a better understanding of these processes is in part quest for new and more precise mathematical inequalities.  One way of discovering and proving such mathematical inequalities, which is central to the project, is through the consideration of auxiliary dynamical processes that evolve the state of a system into a form that is amenable to analysis. This area of research has been fruitful not only in producing results that are of interest to a wider scientific community, but also in engaging the interest of Ph.D. students. The intellectual merit of the research is that it will produce not only significant new mathematics, but results that are relevant to physical and biological sciences as well. These applications in other fields guarantee a broad impact of the work, which is further enhanced by the involvement of students, contributing to training of the next generation of researchers. <br/><br/>Among the many nonlinear evolution equations that arise in the description of physical and biological systems are the Boltzmann equation and the Keller-Segel equations for chemotaxis.  For both of these, an essential source of information on the behavior of solutions is a priori functional inequalities.  For example, solutions of the Boltzmann equation tend towards equilibrium solutions, and the rate at which this happens is governed by an inequality relating relative entropy and the entropy production forced by the evolution. Such functional inequalities are established by completely solving a variational problem: finding the minimum value of some functional, determining the full set of minimizing functions, and finally, proving results that assert that if the value of a functional is close to the optimal value, then its argument must be close to an optimizer. Such complete solutions of variational problems are not only of interest for studying the evolution of physical systems, but also, variational problems can sometimes be best solved by studying an appropriate dynamics associated with them. This interplay between nonlinear dynamics and variational problems has been the source of much recent progress. This project focuses on variational problems and on nonlinear evolution equations, with emphasis on those problems in which the investigator expects a particularly fruitful interplay.  A second focus is on operator and trace inequalities for quantum systems.  Investigation of these is motivated by problems in quantum statistical mechanics and quantum information theory, and again there is close interplay between quantum dynamics and the inequalities to be investigated, except that here functions are replaced by operators and non-commutativity issues arise."

The principal investigator is introducing new mathematical tools that extend the understanding of energy flow phenomena to regimes that cannot be handled by standard analytical tools. Emphasis is placed on using methods that lend themselves to computational analysis. There is a long history of harmonic analysis tools finding application in signal and image processing, and the investigator's work involves developing similar tools for the study of wave propagation. One focus of the project is the reflection of waves from convex objects. The goal is to obtain a more precise understanding of how the wave disperses as it interacts with the boundary. Applications include control on the degree to which vibrational modes can concentrate near the boundary of a convex object. The project has another focus in the study of seismic waves, and more generally waves in elastic media. Seismic waves can involve both transverse and longitudinal displacements, and these components of the wave generally propagate at different speeds. A goal of the project is to estimate the order to which these distinct modes interact with each other as they propagate through highly heterogeneous media, such as the mixture of materials occurring within the earth. Practical implications include estimates on the error for computational models that treat the modes separately, and whether it is necessary to include their interaction in order to attain an assigned degree of accuracy. New methods will also be used in the study of decaying vibrational modes, known as resonant states. Example of systems with resonant states include microwave cavities, and quantum mechanical systems with potential barriers. Tools from harmonic analysis are used to study the existence of resonances, and to relate the number of resonances to properties of the system. All results of this project will be disseminated online, through open access websites.<br/><br/>This project involves the use of harmonic analysis techniques to advance our understanding of waves and eigenfunctions in nonhomogeneous media. A main goal of the project is to show that, in various settings where the traditional mathematical methods of geometric optics do not apply, the rate of dispersion of waves is nevertheless the same as would be predicted by geometric optics. An example of a setting studied is rough media, modeled by manifolds with twice-differentiable metrics. The energy of waves passing through such media can scatter, and only imprecise knowledge on energy flow is available. Nevertheless, the principal investigator's work shows that one can obtain sufficient control on energy flow in such media to establish important results, such as dispersive estimates that are of interest in the fields of nonlinear wave and Schrodinger equations. A related application is bounding the degree to which eigenfunctions in such media can concentrate. Another example of significant importance is seismic waves, which can propagate at distinct speeds, depending on the nature of the initial displacement. The principal investigator's  research investigates the transfer of energy between various seismic modes that is induced by the singularities in the media through which they propagate. Scattering of waves from convex obstacles is another focus of the project. In this part of the proposed research the goal is to obtain precise rates of energy decay in small regions of the boundary. The results would show that energy cannot concentrate near the boundary to a degree higher than predicted by geometric optics, and would lead to new dispersive estimates, with consequent results for the study of nonlinear equations on domains with obstacles. The investigator is also applying harmonic analysis to the study of resonances for Schrodinger operators with bounded potentials. A sharp relation between higher Sobolev regularity of the potential, and series expansions for the regularized heat trace, is established, which is then used to prove the existence of resonances for such potentials."

Broadly speaking, in an inverse problem, one wishes to determine internal properties of a medium by performing measurements along the boundary of the medium. For instance, in electrical impedance tomography, one attempts to recover the conductivity of a body by making voltage and current measurements at the boundary.  Since inverse problems are at the core of a variety of engineering and scientific investigations, including medical imaging, seismography, oil prospection, radar imaging, and non-destructive testing, any further progress in the mathematical theory of such problems will undoubtedly have real world applications.  Spectral theory deals with the investigation of vibrations and their frequencies for a variety of different objects, ranging from atoms and molecules in chemistry to obstacles in acoustic waveguides. The fundamental issues, which are of great significance in many problems of science and engineering, from celestial to quantum mechanics, include deciding when such vibrations occur, how to go about computing their frequencies, as well as understanding the size and localization of the vibrations. The aim of the project is to advance our understanding  of these issues by concentrating on model problems of quantum mechanics, specifically in the physically relevant regime of high frequencies.<br/><br/><br/>The project addresses the following significant topics: the mathematical theory of inverse boundary problems for elliptic partial differential equations (PDE), harmonic analysis for elliptic PDE, and spectral theory of elliptic PDE with periodic coefficients. Although these topics have originated in distinct mathematical communities, recent work has shown that techniques and insights in the various topics are closely related and interact in a fruitful way. A novel idea of the project is to expand this interaction to solve significant problems in all of these areas.  Despite an impressive body of results in the field of inverse problems obtained within the last 30 years, many fundamental questions still remain unsolved, including inverse problems for PDE with irregular coefficients, partial data problems when measurements are performed only on a portion of the boundary, and inverse problems on manifolds. The goal of the first part of the project is to attack these problems for several fundamental elliptic PDE, in particular the conductivity, magnetic Schroedinger, and polyharmonic equations, as well as the Maxwell system. The second topic is concerned with estimates for resolvents of elliptic operators on compact and non-compact manifolds, in Lebesgue spaces. Apart from their intrinsic significance in spectral and scattering theory, such estimates are crucial in control theory and inverse problems. The aim here is to understand how the dynamics of the underlying Hamilton flow of the operator and regularity of the coefficients each impacts on the spectral estimates. The third topic deals with the spectral theory of Schroedinger type operators with periodic coefficients, coming from solid state physics. A central question concerns the nature of the spectra of such operators, which one conjectures to be purely absolutely continuous.  Long known in the Euclidean case, it is still wide open for general Laplace-Beltrami type operators. The objective is to resolve this conjecture in several significant special cases of Riemannian metrics."

The approach to the study of the compactness of solutions is to give a fine analysis of blow up solutions to the type of nonlinear elliptic equations on manifolds.

Consider a ball on a frictionless table. If the ball is set in motion, it will travel forever, making perfectly elastic collisions with the walls. If the table is a square or an equilateral triangle, there are only two possible behaviors: either the ball repeats the same periodic path forever, or it travels completely randomly in the entire polygon, eventually visiting every part of the table.  This project is directed toward the basic mathematical problem of understanding the behavior of a ball when the table is a more general polygon.  This is a basic problem arising in physics and statistical mechanics.<br/><br/>The project concerns the interrelated analytic study of trajectories on rational polygonal tables, moduli spaces of abelian and quadratic differentials, and the dynamics of the action of the group of two-by-two matrices on these moduli spaces.  In recent work with M. Mirzakhani and in part with A. Mohammadi the PI was able to prove some dynamical rigidity results for this action, which allow one to understand every (and not just almost every) orbit. This is important for several reasons. In particular, the surfaces which arise from table trajectories are a set of measure zero in the moduli space, and ergodic theorems which hold at every point are needed to prove results about the trajectories.  Many of the results and techniques are based on a loose analogy with the theory of unipotent flows on locally symmetric spaces (e.g. Ratner's theorem). However, the moduli spaces of differentials are substantially different and new ideas were needed. We propose developing these ideas further, both in the context of dynamics on moduli space and also in the context of other group actions."

A deep mathematical understanding of this structure will lead to new insights that have the potential to significantly improve performance. Applications of sorting are ubiquitous in science and engineering, and include the analysis of DNA sequences, sorting of hits in web searches, and fingerprint identification. A significant improvement in any sorting algorithm would have a broad impact on many fields of science and engineering. <br/><br/>This project will study two algorithms for sorting multivariate data: non-dominated sorting, and convex hull ordering. Non-dominated sorting is fundamental in multi-objective optimization, which is commonly used in scientific and engineering contexts. It has recently been shown that non-dominated sorting of random points in Euclidean space has a continuum limit that corresponds to solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The first objective of this project is to study the regularity of viscosity solutions of this Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and to develop highly accurate numerical schemes for approximating its solution. The second, and main objective, is to study convex hull ordering, which is widely used in robust statistics. It is conjectured that convex hull ordering has a continuum limit that corresponds to affine invariant curvature motion. This project aims to study, and prove rigorously, this conjectured continuum limit. This result provides an asymptotic distributional theory for convex hull ordering, which is an open problem in robust statistics. Another goal of this project is to exploit this continuum limit to develop a fast algorithm for approximate convex hull ordering that can handle massive amounts of data."

The goal of the project is to investigate how the one-to-one interactions between the agents determine the global behavior of the group. A second aspect of this project concerns the mathematical study of the motion of small droplets of liquid on a solid support. Various models have been developed to describe this phenomenon; this project investigates the detailed mathematical properties of several of these models, as a step toward better understanding which models can be used to accurately describe specific behaviors of the droplets. Of particular interest are the geometric properties of the contact line (the interface where air, liquid and solid meet). Finally, this project also investigates mathematical problems related to the modeling of heat propagation through certain materials (mostly insulating crystals). One of the challenges is to better understand how the microscopic laws, which describe the motion of the atoms of the crystals, yield the classical macroscopic models for heat diffusion (such as the classical Fourier law). <br/><br/>Most of the mathematical problems under study in this project are free boundary problems (partial differential equations to be solved on domains that are not known a priori, but must be found as part of the solution). This is the case in particular of the moving drop problem, where the free boundary is the contact line mentioned above. The project investigates how various models (corresponding to different choices of free boundary conditions) affect the regularity of the contact line. The project also studies the relationship of self-organizing phenomena under simple attraction/repulsion mechanisms to fine regularity properties for some obstacle problems of order higher than two (such as the biharmonic obstacle problem). While the harmonic obstacle problem is a classical free boundary problem, there are still many unanswered questions concerning its higher order counterpart. Many classical tools (such as the maximum principle) seem no longer relevant, while other tools, in particular tools from geometric measure theory, should play an important role. The project also investigates related evolution problems that model the phenomenon of phase separation (leading to patches with positive concentration separated by empty regions). The equations under study are reminiscent of Cahn-Hilliard equations, but involve degenerate and non-local diffusion phenomena. Finally, the project explores the rigorous derivation of non-local integro-differential equations from kinetic models for heat propagation (and other transport phenomena). One such kinetic model is the Boltzmann phonon equation. The study of this equation is still in its early stage compared to the considerable amount of work devoted to the Boltzmann equation for dilute gases, and the project will contribute to the development of this theory."

While basic aspects of wave propagation were understood about three hundred years ago, technology and science demand methods to analyze more and more sophisticated phenomena relating to waves. For example, information for the internet is passed along glass fiber cables in the form of light as well as  via satellites in space through electromagnetic waves.  Cell phone technology operates essentially the same way. The dramatic increase in speed in internet communication today as compared to the mid 1990s, for example, is due to a complete and radical change in the design of glass fiber cables. Instead of using the same material for hundreds or thousands of miles, the current design alternates between different materials thus allowing for subtle nonlinear effects to come into play. This revolutionary design is the result of interactions between engineers, applied mathematicians, and material scientists. Advanced mathematics very closely related to the subject matter of this project played a decisive role in the process. Mathematicians working in partial differential equations are cognizant of the importance of training students in the sciences in order to meet the high demands of industry and government. <br/><br/>This project aims at understanding the long-term dynamics of solutions to various systems of nonlinear partial differential equation of wave type. This typically means hyperbolic equations, but it can also refer to the Schroedinger equation. While much progress has been made on the defocusing case, where waves exist for all times and scatter to the vacuum state, focusing equations are much less studied. This type of equation can exhibit finite time blowup as well as small data scattering. The main goal is to determine whether or not global solutions scatter to a stationary solution also known as a soliton. The latter seems likely if basic invariances of the equations, such those given by dilation and translation symmetries, are excluded. This is precisely the case for Klein-Gordon equations in the radial setting."

At the macroscopic level the randomness is typically not seen. But under certain conditions this randomness manifests itself at the macroscopic scale. This is known as a critical phenomena. For example, the spins in a magnetic material have randomness in their orientation. At a certain temperature these spins can align with each other to produce macroscopic magnetic domains that play a crucial role in technological applications such as hard drives. The randomness seen at the macroscopic scale often does not depend on the details of the microscopic randomness. In physics this is called universality and has developed into a key idea in the understanding of critical phenomena. The renormalization group is set of methods from physics that has become the basis for the modern understanding of both critical phenomena and of quantum field theory - the theory of elementary particles. Despite the tremendous success of the renormalization group in physics, we do not have a deep mathematical understanding of this set of ideas. This research will further the mathematical development and understanding of this set of ideas and methods and use them to understand the mathematics of critical phenomena in models such as self-avoiding random walks and Ising models of magnetic spins.<br/><br/>Most of the research will be devoted to random walk models and Ising-type models. The smart kinetic walk (also known as a limiting case of the Laplacian-b random walk) is a dynamic model for self-avoiding walks. On the hexagonal lattice it is closely related to percolation. Percolation methods have been used to prove its scaling limit is the Schramm-Loewner evolution with parameter value 6. The research will study this scaling limit on other lattices and for generalizations of the transition probabilities. The goal is to understand the universality of this scaling limit. For the ordinary random walk the scaling limit of the exit distribution for a domain is harmonic measure. Another goal of the research is to understand the first order correction for this convergence for both the ordinary random walk and the smart kinetic walk. The research will also study real space renormalization groups for Ising type models, in particular exact renormalization group transformations in one and two dimensions. These transformation have the potential advantage that the map would act on a finite dimensional space. The goal is to prove that the map can be rigorously defined and then take advantage of the finite dimensional nature to prove existence of a fixed point and all the exciting consequences that follow from this existence. Finally the research will study Schramm-Loewner evolution as a renormalization group fixed point. This stochastic process is known to be the scaling limit of many critical models. The goal here is to define a renormalization group map that has this process as a fixed point and then use this map to understand models that are near criticality."

The concept of a convex function is illustrated by a cup; it has  unique  lowest point (minimum), while for nonconvex problems one would think of a mountain range with many valleys, hence  many lowest points (local minima). Computer algorithms are good at finding one (or even a few) of local minima, but a  major open problem is this: out of all the local minima, find the lowest (global) one. For convex problems all local minima are global, which means that computer runs do not report a false minimum. Of course, in technology the number of variables is huge, so all that is available to the designer are algebraic formulas (not pictures); thus the cup and mountain metaphors are  misleadingly simple. There are two major classes of convex optimization problems solvable on a computer: classical linear programing and (within the last twenty years) the more widely applicable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). This project concerns many aspects of LMIs, including the scope of LMI techniques: problems treatable with LMIs are convex, but conversely, which convex problems are treatable with LMIs? With collaborators the PI has sketched out a roadmap for this problem and pursues its confirmation. What one sees in linear systems engineering and control are problems with matrix unknowns. Simplifying physical problems and converting them to convex ones is currently done by ad hoc algebraic tricks. A major goal in this project is to develop a theory that will help systematize this. A particular concern is changes of variables to convert nonconvex problems to LMIs. Another is approximating a set with a convex set. In addition, the PI's group is the main provider to the public of software (called NCAlgebra) for performing general noncommuting algebra calculations in Mathematica. NCAlgebra is developed in the course of doing experiments for the proposed research.<br/><br/>Classical real algebraic geometry develops a theory of (commutative) polynomials and much of it concerns inequalities based on evaluating them on tuples of real numbers. A good part of this project concerns  noncommutative polynomials and their properties when evaluated on tuples of matrices (of all sizes). This new (freely) noncommutative real algebraic geometry often behaves much more rigidly than classical real algebraic geometry. While seeing how classical structure transports to free real algebraic geometry is part of the pursuit, engineering motivation and the highly rigid structure opens up new classes of problems. For example, free convexity, change of variables to achieve free convexity, free convex hulls, and free dilation theory are mathematically rich areas involving mixtures of functional analysis, optimization theory, algebra, and several complex variables. Also studied in this project are interactions with other subjects such as free probability as well as commutative topics related mostly to so-called linear matrix inequalities."

The two generalized ideas from linear algebra, about symmetries of three-, four-, or higher-dimensional space, to an infinite-dimensional setting that arises naturally in quantum physics.  When trying to understand von Neumann algebras and their underlying structure, one is led naturally to consider ""subfactors."" These are pairs of minimal von Neumann algebras, one of which contains the other.  The study of subfactors has resulted in some surprising connections with other areas of mathematics.  One of the earliest is the famous Jones polynomial, which arrises in the mathematical study of knots.  This polynomial has led to a deeper understand of the connections between subfactors and topology (the qualitative study of shape--as opposed to geometry, which is the quantitative study of shape). More recently, subfactors have been connected, through the seemingly abstract algebraic field of ""category theory,"" to the topic of topological quantum computing.  Quantum computers would be capable of efficiently computing a large class of problems that are widely believed to be intractable on traditional computers, and topology may be the answer to the difficult question of how to stabilize quantum systems enough to make computers from them.  <br/><br/>The principal research goals of this project deal with questions in subfactor theory: the study of inclusions of von Neumann algebras with trivial center. In this approach, questions about subfactors are translated into questions about finite invariants of subfactors, namely, planar algebras and principal graphs. Planar algebras have many advantages: they allow one to calculate in finite-dimensional spaces, exploit the connection between subfactors and topology, and illuminate the underlying symmetry of the subfactors. The principal investigator plans to extend her previous research on classification and construction of small index subfactors and also to apply ideas from this classification in new places.  This project is guided by the following big questions that the principal investigator does not expect to answer completely but that lead one to ask smaller and more approachable questions: (1) Which graphs can occur as principal graphs?  (2) What is the highest supertransitivity a subfactor can have?  (3) Can subfactors with integer index have objects whose dimensions are not square roots of integers?  (4) Are exotic subfactors common, or rare, at higher indices? (5) Are there symmetry principals relating graphs and subfactor planar algebras embedded in their graph planar algebras?"

The mathematical idea of diffusion is an attempt to quantify and model how a species, a fluid, heat, particles, or information spreads out in time due to the effect of pressure (as in particles or populations) or by other neighbor-to-neighbor interaction, as in the case of information dynamics. One of the ways in which diffusion has been described mathematically is through partial differential equations, which model infinitesimal adjacent interactions.  With mathematical modeling in fields like biology, finance, and the social sciences, the need has emerged of understanding phenomena where the diffusion process takes into consideration long-range information or interactions; that is the case when particles are transported, information is communicated simultaneously at many scales, organisms communicate by the creation of a chemical potential, or stocks change value in discontinuous ways. The PI will study diverse phenomena related to these processes with long interactions in space and time (memory), such as flows in reservoirs that clog with time, segregation processes that occur at a distance, or models in price formation where there is a gap between buyers and sellers.<br/><br/>A first area of research encompasses nonlinear problems involving nonlocality in both space and time. From the stochastic side, the model is the continuous in time random walk equation, which involves Levy walks instead of jumps. From the variational side, there are diverse models for porous medium flows with potential pressures, where the medium is deformed by the flow. These involve study of fully nonlinear equations of nonlocal type that by the nature of their invariant properties parallel equations involving symmetric functions of the Hessian, such as the Monge-Ampere equation.  Another area of investigation involves phase transitions and free boundary problems. One group concerns models for segregation of species, optimal partition of a domain by disjoint subdomains optimizing some ""shape"" value function. Another group deals with the homogenization of fronts in random or periodic media, and a third concerns the regularity of free boundaries for some stationary or evolution problems. The issues described above are universal in the sense that the same paradigm reappears in geometry and analysis, fluid dynamics and material sciences, financial mathematics, and more recently biology and stochastic geometry."

As a concrete example one can consider the trajectory of a ball on an ideal table. The table is frictionless and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.   A classical mathematical problem is to study the trajectories of a ball when the sides of the table form a polygon - not necessarily a rectangle.  There can be different types of trajectories.  Some trajectories can be periodic and some can be dense on the table.  This simple problem is notoriously difficult.  It is very difficult to solve the problem for a particular table, unless it is of a special shape; for example, a rectangle or an equilateral triangle.   This leads to the study of families of tables that have similarities.  You could for instance, study the family of tables with five sides.  Taking the family of tables as a new space it is possible to define a new flow on this space.  This point of view turns out to have important consequences.  For example, we may now be able to say what happens on ""most"" tables.  This proposal studies dynamical systems by taking a similar point of view.<br/><br/>We mainly seek rigidity results where rather weak initial data about an object yields an almost complete classification of the object.  The following will be the main objectives:       <br/>(i) Employing a dynamical approach to study problems in number theory and geometry has proven rather fruitful.  However, this approach is often noneffective.  <br/>We will seek effectivization of the rigidity phenomena for the action of groups generated by unipotent subgroups on homogeneous spaces; these rigidity results have served as one of the main tools in the aforementioned applications.  <br/>(ii) There is an action of the group of nonsingular, real, two by two matrices on the moduli space of a compact Riemann surface; this is closely related to the asymptotic of the number of periodic trajectories on rational polygonal tables.  <br/>This proposal seeks generalizations of the recent exciting developments which proved certain rigidity results for this action.  <br/>(iii) We attempt to investigate dynamics on homogeneous spaces with infinite volume, and on homogeneous spaces arising from local fields of positive characteristic. There are various geometric and number theoretical applications which motivate the study of these spaces."

A geometry on a space is a means of measuring distance  in the space and can be thought of as giving the space a shape. One approach to studying the geometry on a space is to consider the geodesic flow; this is an object that generalizes the notion of a straight line to spaces that are curved. By studying the properties of this object much can be discovered about the geometry itself. For example, the question of how many flow paths close up is related to the distribution of prime numbers. Often different geometries can be placed on a space and thus one obtains a space of shapes. A natural question to ask is if this space of shapes can be given a nice shape itself. The PI proposes to study these geometries  on the space of geometries and investigate their properties. The PI will continue his commitment to both undergraduate and graduate education.

The PI will also give research talks, expository talks, minicourses and lecture series on material related to the proposal as well as organize conferences. <br/><br/>The research plan of the PI centers around the use of certain  geometric measures to define structures on moduli spaces and representation varieties. Such measures include the Hausdorff measure on the limit set of a Kleinian group, geodesic currents, the Patterson-Sullivan measure of a Kleinian group, equilibrium measures defined using Themodynamics associated with representations of hyperbolic groups, and push-forwards of volume measures by certain geometrically defined functions. One area of study is Higher Teichmuller Theory which is the study of representation spaces of hyperbolic groups into semi-simple Lie groups. These are generalizations of the classical Teichmuller space. Using Thermodynamics, the PI and collaborators define a Pressure geometry on this Higher Teichmuller space. space. The PI proposes to study the geometric property of this metric including its curvature, metric completion, and isometry group. Another area of proposed study is geometric identities; these are equations that hold on a moduli space of geometries.

While topological transformation groups are quite trivially connected to geometry by the objects of which they are symmetries, this is not so for more general groups, that is, sets equipped with a notion of multiplication or addition. For example, solutions to differential equations can often be seen as points or vectors in infinite-dimensional spaces, namely so called Banach spaces, and such points can be added together to form new points in the space. So the solution spaces to differential equations are themselves groups. As it turns out, groups have an intrinsically defined large scale geometric structure. That is, as groups are seen from farther and farther away, the microscopical structure becomes blurred and one is left with a macroscopical perspective, which may be accessible to computation and provide structural information about the groups themselves. The PI will investigate groups from this large scale perspective, in particular expanding the existing theory to various infinite-dimensional groups originating in logic, topology and analysis.<br/><br/>The PI intends to conduct research on the large scale geometry of Polish groups. While large scale geometry of discrete or locally compact groups has been a very active area for quite some time, the realisation that Polish groups may have a well-defined large scale geometry is very recent. Several aspects to be investigated concern the large scale geometry of various concrete classes of groups such as homeomorphism and diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds and automorphism groups of countable first-order structures. In the latter case, one particular issue is to calibrate geometric properties of the automorphism group with the model theoretical properties of the structure. The nature of the proposal is very much interdisciplinary. On the one hand, it will involve descriptive set theory, via the study of Polish groups, model theory, via the study of automorphism groups, while at the same time incorporating the multifaceted instruments of geometric group theory. On the other hand, the theory allows for a geometric study of a number of topological transformation groups that were not hitherto amenable to such an approach, which again should open up for connections with areas such as geometric and differential topology."

The Midwest PDE Seminar series bridges these scientific areas and brings together several generations of researchers. The 74th seminar (fall 2014 seminar) will be held at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, during October 18-19, 2014. The spring 2015 (75th) seminar will be held at the University of Minnesota.<br/><br/>The Seminars provide rapid communication of problems, methods, and results in partial differential equations, and also enhance interactions among the researchers in the Midwest working in PDE and related fields. Junior researchers and graduate students are given special priority when both speakers and funded participants are selected. Announcements of the upcoming Midwest PDE seminars are routinely widely distributed via a mailing list, and the programs and history of the Seminar are available at the web site http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jlewis/midwpde/index.html"

Among these are (1) the structure of a collection of ultra-cold atoms (2) light waves moving through a medium whose index of refraction depends upon the strength of the wave allowing for the self-focusing of the wave (3) water waves in a shallow channel, and (4) waves that move through the electrons and ions in a plasma.  Among the important mathematical issues are the rigorous derivation of such models from fundamental physical laws, and the precise study of special types of coherent wave solutions (variously referred to as solitary waves, kinks, vortices, and monopoles, and blow-up profiles).   In the last decade, new techniques from several branches of mathematics, specifically harmonic analysis, spectral theory, and Hamiltonian mechanics,  have led to striking developments and the resolution of many problems once deemed intractable.   The PI has outlined several conjectures that he and his students and collaborators will address by adapting and extending these new methods.  At the same time, the resolution of these conjectures is expected to extend the applicability of these methods and interface  other branches of mathematics.<br/><br/>First, several conjectures on the derivation of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) as a limit of the fundamental quantum mechanical model for a many-body system of bosons are outlined.  The PI will continue to investigate problems pertaining to dimensional reduction by the imposition of strong anisotropic confining, and allowing attractive interactions leading to the focusing NLS, which supports bright solitary wave solutions, as observed in recent experiments.   Second, problems pertaining to the geometrical structure of singularity formation for NLS are proposed.  In particular, the PI will consider the stability of new contracting sphere blow-up solutions, the possibility for blow-up on an ellipse, and a precise description of blow-up in the Zakharov system, a model for collapse of Langmuir waves in a plasma.   Third, the PI proposes to consider the dynamics of dark solitons, vortices, and monopoles, which are solutions for which the wave function has nontrivial topological structure on the spatial boundary, in equations such as the sine Gordon equation, subjected to semiclassical perturbations.   Fourth, the dynamics of non-perturbative interacting multi-solitons in completely integrable models, specifically the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) and NLS equations, subjected to semiclassical perturbation, will also be pursued."

Many-body systems arise naturally as fundamental models for physical systems. Since these many-body systems could contain 10^23 particles or more, the simulation of such systems is only possible via some approximation, such as the so-called mean-field limits. The mathematical justification of these mean-field limits, from the many-body systems they are supposed to describe, is therefore an issue of fundamental scientific importance. Two projects arise from the study of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). BEC is a state of matter of a dilute gas of bosons cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero. A large fraction of the bosons occupy the same quantum state, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale. Since the Nobel-Prize-winning first observation of BEC in 1995, the investigation of this new state of matter has become one of the most active areas of contemporary research. Another project involves the determination of the motion of an object that is influenced by a sea of particles around it.<br/><br/>The particular scope of this research project is to investigate several problems concerning the fine properties of solutions to the time-dependent many-body Schrödinger equation when the particle number tends to infinity and free boundary problems in kinetic theory. This research project encompasses three broad directions. The first direction concerns the space-time regularity of the solution to the BBGKY hierarchy under Gross-Pitaevskii scaling in three dimensions in the important case in which the scattering length of the microscopic interaction potential emerges. The second direction focuses on the derivation of focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equations from quantum many-body systems with focusing interactions. The third direction turns to the study of kinetic theory with boundaries and focuses on the effects on the asymptotic behaviors near equilibrium in caused by free boundaries. The PI and collaborators will use techniques from harmonic analysis, probability, and spectral theory to analyze these problems."

For example, LG arises naturally in the study of certain  problems involving a moving boundary. As a growth process, LG is widely recognized as a model for the formation of various universal patterns observed in physics and natural sciences such as the growth of bacterial colonies.  A new exiting development in this classical area of mathematical physics was the recent discovery of the fact that on the microscopic level, the mechanism of LG is very closely related to the behavior of particles in plasma ensembles. Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter. A common form of plasma is seen in neon signs and in fact plasma is the most common state of matter in the universe. These plasma ensembles are described  in terms of mathematical objects call random matrices that have complex eigenvalues. The relation of LG and random matrices has been intensively studied on the physical level but many fundamental problems remain open on the mathematical side. The PI, Nikolai Makarov, will focus on several such problems. <br/><br/>The main topics and goals of the study will be the following: the proof of the convergence of rescaled point processes and the description of the universality laws for various types of boundary points in the random normal matrix model (RNM); the proof of the laminarity of Hele-Shaw flows and the rigorous derivation of their integrability properties;the analysis of the dynamics of the Schwarz reflections associated with algebraic droplets in the RNM model. To achieve these goals, the PI will bring together tools and ideas from various areas of mathematics (complex analysis, conformal dynamics, probability theory) and theoretical physics (conformal field theory, non-equilibrium growth phenomenon, disordered systems). The educational component of the project will be the development of new graduate courses and organization of scientific workshops and conferences. The project will provide research and training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs."

The term ""measure"" refers to an abstract generalization of length, area, or volume, which assigns a size value to every mathematical set.  Traditional outlets for geometric measure theory, such as the calculus of variations and geometric analysis, have expanded in recent decades to include partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. The widespread utility and current use of geometric measure theory in different areas of analysis justifies its continued development.  The proposed investigation on the geometry of sets and measures seeks to develop new techniques that will expand the toolbox that geometric measure theory provides for researchers in adjacent areas in analysis and geometry.<br/><br/>This project focuses on two groups of questions about the geometry of sets and measures in Euclidean space.  The first group of questions concerns rectifiable measures, one of the core objects of study in geometric measure theory.  Specifically, these questions are aimed at increased understanding of rectifiable measures in the absence of a standing regularity assumption that has been assumed in the past.  The main approach entails adapting quantitative techniques developed in the 1990s by Jones and David-Semmes to study the qualitative rectifiability of measures.  The second group of questions are designed to examine the geometry of Reifenberg-type sets, which are sets that can be approximated at all locations and scales by one or more kinds of model sets.  Instances where Reifenberg-type sets occur include geometric minimization problems and free boundary problems for elliptic partial differential equations.  A general goal of this inquiry is to determine in what situations and to what extent good properties of solutions to problems in ideal models (smooth settings) persist under controlled perturbation (weak regularity)."

Ergodic theory focuses on the statistical behavior of dynamical systems. Applications of ergodic theory are widespread: from traffic modelling to aerospace engineering and population dynamics. It is natural and of practical importance to generalize the role of time in a dynamical system to more complicated groups of symmetries. This generalized notion of dynamics leads to applications in statistical mechanics, number theory, and geometry. However, new tools are needed, especially in the particular case when the group of symmetries is non nonamenable, which means that boundary phenomena are too significant to be safely ignored (unlike intervals in the integers or real numbers). Nonamenable groups naturally arise in many parts of mathematics, such as geometry and number theory. This project is concerned with developing the tools needed to analyze the ergodic theory of nonamenable group actions. <br/><br/>There are five specific goals. The first is to continue developing sofic entropy theory. This is a vast generalization of Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy to actions of sofic groups, a class of groups that contains all amenable groups and residually finite groups. One major aim of this research is to determine to what extent Ornstein theory can be extended beyond actions of amenable groups. The second goal is to establish pointwise ergodic theorems for geometrically defined groups (e.g. Lie groups, CAT(0) cubulated groups, relatively hyperbolic groups) using techniques recently discovered by the PI and Amos Nevo. The third goal is to import tools from geometric group theory into the study of measured equivalence relations. The fourth goal is to continue to analyzing the structure of the space of  weak equivalence classes of actions of a given group. This space serves as a classifying object for the ways in which the Rokhlin Lemma fails for nonamenable groups. Because the Rokhlin Lemma is of crucial importance in Ornstein theory, this topic is intimately connected with the first goal. The fifth goal is to continue clarifying what the space of stationary actions of a given group ""looks like.'' One major focus is on new constructions of stationary actions (via invariant random subgroups or measured equivalence relations). Another is on generic behavior of stationary actions. Yet another is to apply the new techniques to the study of harmonic functions and random walks; topics deeply connected with stationary actions."

Von Neumann algebras have since become a field of independent interest with further applications to areas of mathematics such as ergodic theory, Voiculescu's free probability theory, Jones's theory of subfactors and planar algebras, knot theory, and many others. The development of von Neumann algebras has also historically been closely connected to the study of measurable dynamics, and these connections have recently begun to reemerge in the presence of a newly developed rigidity phenomenon. The investigation of this rigidity phenomenon has since led to new connections between von Neumann algebras and other areas of mathematics. Furthering the development of rigidity theory will in turn lead to new insights and connections among these various fields, and it will provide opportunities to exploit this phenomenon in other areas. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the newly emerging deformation/rigidity theory in von Neumann algebras, as well as continue to explore the deep connection between this theory and ergodic theory.  Deformation/rigidity theory, initiated by Popa in the early 2000s, has been extremely successful over the last decade in answering a number of longstanding problems in von Neumann algebras and ergodic theory.  The juxtaposition between deformability properties such as Haagerup's property, free products, or unbounded cocycles, with rigidity properties such as so-called property T or the spectral gap allows one to discover hidden structure in a von Neumann algebra where both types of phenomena occur.  This has led to new insight in the structural properties of these von Neumann algebras, and in turn has found applications to other areas such as measured group theory, or the theory of invariants. Developing alongside deformation/rigidity theory is the corresponding techniques applied to ergodic theory of group actions.  This has already led to a number of striking results, and yet here the surface has only been scratched.  This project will also investigate more fully these interactions."

Integral formulas are important tools for recovering information on large data sets that are located in hard-to-reach places by collecting very small samples that are within easy reach. For instance, integral formulas can be used to recover the temperature in the interior of a solid body (say a tree, or even a planet) without having to probe holes in the body (that is, in the tree example, without having to drill holes in the trunk). Instead, one measures the temperature at surface level (say on the tree's bark) and plots these values in the integral formula: the output will be the value of the temperature inside. One of the novelties of this project is that it allows to deal with objects whose outer surface is very rough (as opposed to very smooth).<br/><br/>The PI and her collaborators will bring together techniques and problems from different parts of the general field of analysis, specifically real harmonic analysis and complex function theory in one and several complex variables. One of the main goals is to develop a theory of Cauchy-like singular integrals with holomorphic kernel and for non-smooth domains in Euclidean complex space that successfully blends the complex structure of the ambient domain with the Calderon-Zygmund theory for singular integrals on non-smooth domains in real space. Doing so requires coming to terms with the additional rigidity imposed by the underlying complex structure, in particular the geometric properties that are collectively known as (or linked to) pseudo-convexity.

These again appear both in science (e.g. phases of matter) and mathematics (e.g. knot theory).

Though anybody can observe this phenomenon, and though it is of paramount importance in physics, aerospace engineering, etc.,  it is very poorly understood at a conceptual level. Weak turbulence is a related phenomenon, which is also poorly understood, but which might be theoretically more approachable. Rather than fluid flows, it describes situations where waves interact. The aim of this proposal is to develop theoretical tools, and apply them to concrete physical examples, leading to a deeper understanding of weak turbulence.<br/><br/>To be more specific, the main object of focus will be the nonlinear Schroedinger equation set on a compact domain, which is one of the simplest and most used models to describe nonlinear wave, or dispersive phenomena. It is believed by physicists that the right regime to observe weak turbulence involves three limits: weakly nonlinear (small data), big box (large domain), random phases (decorrelation of the Fourier modes in a statistical sense). The aim of this project is to investigate how these three limiting procedures can be made rigorous. It involves spectral questions (understanding the eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the Laplacian on domains), nonlinear aspects (how these eigenmodes interact) and statistical questions (finding the right probabilistic description of the stationary state)."

Such functions are used to encode information about physical systems, so  studying  various  aspects of them  could reveal important information  about how to design systems  that perform desired tasks or how to maximize their performance. The motivation for this project is the relatively recent worldwide interest in the noncommutative aspects of multivariable operator theory and function theory, and their interplay with the classical theory of functions, algebras, and harmonic analysis. The present project aims at extending fundamental ideas from analysis, algebra, and geometry to the noncommutative context and finding applications in science and engineering.  The study of noncommutative  functions and the algebras that they generate,  which is the goal of the project, has potential applications  to  free probability, interpolation , optimization and control, and systems theory. The principal investigator expects the results of the project to make new connections   between several areas of mathematics and  to have applications in mathematical physics.  Another important objective of the project is to attract graduate students to the PI's research program and help build a Ph.D. program in mathematics  at the University of Texas-San Antonio.  <br/><br/>The proposed project  is a continuation of the ongoing program of the principal investigator to develop a  free analogue of the Sz.-Nagy-Foias  theory of contractions for noncommutative domains and varieties  in several noncommuting  variables and to develop the theory of free holomorphic functions on these  domains.  The  project is devoted to enhancing the understanding of  the structure of the noncommutative polydomains and varieties  that admit  universal models  and have  rich  analytic function theory,  and  to make advances towards their  classification  up to free biholomorphic equivalence.  This is accompanied  by the study of free holomorphic  functions on these polydomains with the emphasis on geometric aspects and the connection with  the hyperbolic geometry. The most prominent  feature of this project is the interaction between the structure of the noncommutative polydomains and varieties,  the  operator  algebras generated by  the corresponding  universal model operators,  and the noncommutative  analytic function theory  on  these  polydomains. Moreover, this study is anchored in classical  complex function theory in  several variables and in  complex algebraic geometry. The project focuses  on the following problems:  classification of noncommutative  polydomains and varieties up to free biholomorphic equivalence and  the classification of the associated  universal algebras up to completely  isometric isomorphisms;  universal models, invariant subspaces, and commutant lifting; unitary invariants on noncommutative polydomains (e.g., the curvature, the Euler characteristic,  and  the entropy); hyperbolic geometry  on noncommutative polyballs;  free holomorphic   functions on polydomains; free holomorphic self-maps of noncommutative balls and composition operators."

The Monge-Ampere type equations arise naturally in optimal transportation problems in economics and in traffic network planning in cities, in the design of reflector antennae in geometric optics, and in the semi-geostrophic equations of meteorology. The project covers a broad class of PDEs where key structural quantities could be possibly extremely small (degenerate) or extremely large (singular). The main goal of the project aims at discovering new underlying principles and correct perspectives on these equations in order to develop innovative tools and methodologies to tackle them. Understanding deeper properties of affine maximal surface equations studied in this project will help design faster algorithms in architectural free-form structures, in computer graphics, and in visualization where convex objects are involved. In addition to applications, the successful analysis of PDEs investigated in this project will reveal deep and interesting connections between different areas of mathematics such as analysis, PDEs, the calculus of variations, geometry, and fluid mechanics, thereby augmenting the fruitful interaction among them.<br/><br/>This project, in the field of analysis and partial differential equations (PDEs), focuses on regularity properties of solutions to the linearized Monge-Ampere (LMA) equation and their applications to nonlinear, geometric PDEs. The linearized Monge-Ampere equation arises in several fundamental problems of current interest in computer graphics, affine geometry, complex geometry, fluid mechanics, and economics. The purpose of this project is to obtain fine and higher order boundary regularity properties of the LMA equation and apply them to tackle several outstanding problems in analysis, geometry, and PDEs. More specifically, the objectives of the project are to: investigate sharp boundary regularity for the LMA equation; apply these regularity results to understand qualitative properties of several interesting but highly challenging nonlinear, fourth-order geometric equations such as the second boundary value problems for the affine maximal surface and Abreu's equations, and finally resolve the outstanding open problem on global smoothness of eigenfunctions to the Monge-Ampere operator. The techniques used in attacking the problems under study in this project  include perturbation arguments, localization techniques, covering arguments, partial Legendre transform, geometry of the Monge-Ampere equation, and also harmonic analysis on homogeneous spaces."

The spaces under investigation, called manifolds with boundaries, serve often as background spaces with special structures (e.g., conformal geometry, Cauchy-Riemann geometry). The aforementioned linear operators prescribe the change in the shape of space, change quantified in terms of certain curvature measurement by means of a differential equation that is typically nonlinear. A long-term goal of this study is to find conditions under which these curvature equations are solvable and to study the quality of the solution. Successful results in the proposed project will enrich the subject of conformal geometry by providing a large new family of examples of special Einstein spaces that are of interest to a wide audience of mathematicians, as well as to mathematical physicists. In addition to contributing directly to the field of conformal geometry, this project will help train a number of graduate students and postdocs, who will have the dual role of researchers and educators of the next generation of mathematicians. The extensive lecture course conducted by the principal investigators contributes to the mathematical education of scientists in several geographic areas.<br/><br/>A basic tool for this project is a version of a well-known inequality, the Sobolev inequality, that controls the size of a function in terms of a measurement of its variation. Indeed, it is often the case that a sharp version of such an inequality is what is needed. The principal investigators intend to find such sharp inequalities for certain spaces by making use of traditional methods from the calculus of variations. A secondary objective of the project is to improve upon previous work of the principal investigators in order to obtain bounds for a family of conformally compact Einstein spaces, bounds that might eventually allow one to construct of a large family of such spaces, as predicted by physicists.  A third objective is to broaden the conditions under which one can assert the validity of a strong maximum principle for fourth-order partial differential equations, a technical device that only became available because of prior work by the prinicipal investigators. Such a maximum principle will allow for a number of applications not only to geometric questions but also to general analytic questions about elasticity and the bending of plates."

The four aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations are all manifestations of the general goal of understanding the long time dynamics of solutions to important nonlinear dispersive and hyperbolic equations. <br/><br/>This project is a collective effort of a group of five senior researchers from four institutions with research experience in various areas of partial differential equations. The investigators have been interested in both dispersive and hyperbolic partial differential equations and will collaborate to approach the problems under study from several different directions.

These four aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations are all manifestations of the general goal of understanding the long time dynamics of solutions. While specific major problems are identified for the project, this is a very active field, and it is anticipated that this project will identify and study other important problems during the course of the investigation. The project will also enhance links and collaborations among researchers at leading mathematical centers in the U.S., promoting training through active research involvement of students and postdoctoral researchers. Research resulting from this project will be disseminated widely in advanced graduate courses, survey articles, and monographs."

Until recently, many of these problems seemed unrelated. In light of his work with Bourgain, these problems are now understood as part of a more general theory that the two call ""decoupling."" The methods pertain to the field of modern harmonic analysis, a natural framework that allows for the formulation of a general enough theory. This project seeks to enlarge  the range of applicability of decouplings, with some high-value targets in sight. A surprising feature of the research is that it removes certain restrictions on frequencies that were thought to be necessary in earlier work. In particular, the old requirement that frequencies have integer coordinates is replaced with the weaker assumption that sufficient spatial separation exists between frequencies. It is expected that the tools that will be developed will be accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community.<br/><br/>Decouplings are certain generalizations of the Littlewood--Paley theory in the presence of curvature. The principal investigator's progress in pursuing the line of research related to this subject has relied hitherto on the interplay between multilinear and linear multiscale analysis. He  has successfully addressed the case when the relevant manifold is a hypersurface with nonzero Gaussian curvature. He now proposes to develop the optimal decoupling theory for nondegenerate curves. Such a theory has the potential to achieve almost unprecedented applications of harmonic analysis to number theory. One notable example is the resolution of Vinogradov's mean value theorem. There is an interesting related circle of problems for the cone. The fact that it has zero Gaussian curvature poses a new level of difficulty that will most certainly require new ideas. Understanding the cone is part of a more ambitious project that will aim at understanding the decoupling theory for real analytic surfaces. There are further important related questions that remain to be explored, in connection with various restriction theorems and the Kakeya conjectures."

As we are discovering and dealing with more and more complicated phenomena, both natural and societal, it is critical that the description nevertheless stay simple. Mathematics achieves this by introducing new notions. Here is an example, pertinent for this project. Quantities in the real world are measured by real numbers, and since the invention of analytic geometry we know that real world figures---curves, surfaces, etc.---can be described by functions of real variables. Yet real world quantities in oscillatory phenomena, for example voltage in an alternating current, can be described much more simply in terms of complex numbers. It takes some investment to introduce complex numbers, but once done, the description becomes fully transparent. By now we understand well that complex numbers are indispensable in a vast number of problems that arise in science and engineering. Similarly, it is often advantageous to pass from functions of real variables and the figures they describe to functions of complex variables and the associated geometric figures. This research will deal with fundamental properties of functions of complex variables and of complex geometric figures, known as complex manifolds. One component is motivated by problems that arise in the quantum description of the micro-world, and seeks to understand to what extent this description is independent of the somewhat arbitrary choices one is forced to make as the mathematical description is constructed. It turns out that this problem and various others that arise in the study of manifolds have a common generalization, and the answer promises to depend on the notion of curvature. The PI will study curvature in various situations; it is the concept that unifies the three components of this research.---As said, some of the concrete problems in the project are directly motivated by quantum theory, and have a potential to impact theoretical physics. By involving graduate students, the project will also serve to introduce young people to mathematical research.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, one component of this project studies fields of Hilbert spaces, generalizations of hermitian vector bundles. They arise as direct images of holomorphic vector bundles, and the PI will seek to connect the curvature of the direct image with the curvature of the vector bundle. A second component is motivated by the problem of Kahler metrics of constant scalar curvature. The existence and uniqueness of these metrics is related to the geometry of the space of all Kahler metrics, an infinite dimensional Riemannian manifold, in particular to the geodesics in this space. The PI will study these geodesics and the partial differential equation that governs them. The third component is about general hermitian metrics in holomorphic vector bundles and their curvature. The metric can be singular and the bundle of infinite rank. The questions here concern how to generalize to this setting the phenomena well understood in the case of line bundles."

The most commonly encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum circuit model, requires challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the hardware to be of practical value, due to local interactions of the system with the surrounding environment. The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. This research project studies mathematically the application of topological phases of matter to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit in quantum computation.<br/><br/>In this project the investigators study mathematical models for topological phases, focusing on their applications to topological quantum computation.  Topological phases of matter in two spatial dimensions are well-described in the framework of modular categories, but relatively little is known in three spatial dimensions.  A large part of this project is devoted to developing appropriate mathematical models in three spatial dimensions and analyzing the corresponding computational paradigms.  Specifically, the project will study (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories and representations of the loop braid group, and symmetry enriched topological order and gauging symmetry.  In addition, because locality and universality are two desirable properties for quantum computation that are manifested in the representations of the braid group, this project also aims to formulate conjectures characterizing when these properties hold and to verify and adapt these conjectures where appropriate to better characterize physical and computational aspects.  To compare the computational power of topological quantum computers to that of classical computers, the project investigates the complexity of the most natural computation in this setting: topological invariants."

In general, boundary effects may not stay only near the boundary but also impact on the whole interior dynamics. Therefore the boundary effects are important and have rich application in many cases.  However, boundary problems in kinetic models are mathematically challenging due to their singular nature. This project aims to develop new mathematical tools to handle these problems.<br/><br/>This research project studies several important boundary problems arising in kinetic models and fluid equations. The first topic regards optimal regularity of Boltzmann solutions in bounded domains with several physical boundary conditions for both dynamical and stationary problems. The second topic concerns the boundary-field interaction in kinetic models such as Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann systems. The third topic is to understand the relation between steady Boltzmann solutions and the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems in the presence of a boundary when the mean free path is sufficiently small.

The first part is to study partial differential equations that describe the hydrodynamics of liquid crystals and related complex fluid models. The main focus of this part of the research will be to study global existence of suitable weak solutions of liquid crystal flows in the Ericksen-Leslie theory; the global existence of solutions of Oldroyd B-model of incompressible visco-elastic fluids; the inviscid incompressible magneto-hydrodynamic system and, in general, coupled nonlinear dynamics of fluids with other geometric objects. The second part is to study a large class of extremum problems of elliptic eigenvalues. Such problems also arise in optimal designs, pattern formations and other applications in material sciences and condense matter physics. The partial differential equations (PDE) that the PI plans to study involve nonlinear couplings between equations that describe transport, phase-field, mapping or geometric object's evolutions and that of Navier Stokes equations. They may be of both parabolic and hyperbolic nature and possess singularities or multiple scales. The variational problems for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that linked with underlying domains are classical and fundamental.

Developing calculus in metric spaces is useful in part because it allows one to formulate and solve optimization problems in these settings. This research term will, in particular, integrate metric space theory with a wide variety of applications including image processing, reconstruction theory, control theory, and robotics.<br/><br/>More specifically, program brings together three areas of metric space research: first-order analysis (including theories of Sobolev spaces, solutions to the p-Laplace equation, and functions of bounded variation on metric measure spaces), geometric measure theory and variational problems (particularly in the sub-Riemannian setting), and versions of weak curvature (for example, the the setting of Alexandrov spaces).  It is expected to facilitate crossflow of ideas and techniques between these areas and establish international collaborations between researchers. The schedule includes four, week-long minicourses for non-specialists and young researchers during the month of May taught by leading experts in metric space analysis and geometry, followed by a workshop in June that brings together topics from the minicourses.

The second area involves evolution equations, for functions that vary with time.  Core classes of interest in this project include equations for wave motion, both for classical waves and variants, such as Schrodinger equations and Dirac equations, whose origins lie in the motions of atoms.<br/><br/>This project will develop tools to advance the study of elliptic systems on domains with uniformly rectifiable boundary, which is essentially the maximal class of domains on which one can use singular integral operator techniques. One class of problems that will be tackled consists of Riemann-Hilbert type problems.  These were first studied on planar domains, with piecewise smooth interfaces.  This project will develop higher dimensional versions of Riemann-Hilbert problems, on domains with uniformly rectifiable interfaces. A related study will involve a development of the index theory of Toeplitz operators on such rough domains.  The other major part of this project concerns evolution equations.  Specific problems to be tackled include studies of wave decay, via various mechanisms, some related to the formation of harmonics on stringed instruments, but in a higher dimensional context. In addition, wave decay problems will be considered on domains with rough geometry, including cases where the main geometrical hypothesis is a lower bound on the Ricci tensor, and the challenge is to develop a theory of geometrical optics in this setting."

In the first part of the project the PI will explore interactions between collections of sets of finite perimeter and quasiconformal mappings, and between collections of sets of finite perimeter and nonlinear potential theory. The second part of the project will explore ""tangent space"" regularity of sets of  quasiminimal boundary surfaces. The third part of the project is to develop a potential theory for functions of bounded variation. The last part of the project is to obtain a characterization of certain Poincare inequalities in terms of modulus of families of sets of finite perimeter. Applications of the research include further understanding of connections between metric geometry related to sets of finite perimeter and solutions to certain nonlinear partial differential equations. Such sets arise in the study of image processing and edge detection, while abstract metric spaces arise in Riemannian manifolds theory when considering Gromov-Hausdorff limit spaces as found in the works of Cheeger, Gromov, and Perelman.

Systems having structures at several spatial and temporal scales, micro-, meso- or macroscopic scales, are ubiquitous in industry (composite materials, microfluidics), in biology (tissues, cell membranes, brain), in geophysics (seabed), in meteorology (clouds), in fluid mechanics (turbulence) and in physics (granular materials, structure of matter). The general spirit of the mathematical study is to figure out how one can integrate these small scales into asymptotic simplified models. Moreover, this work focuses on the understanding of the interactions between the different scales from a dynamical point of view: memory effects, energy transfers, instabilities and out of equilibrium dynamics. This fundamental research has far reaching consequences. This work underlies the design of new numerical methods, aims at proving the accuracy of numerical schemes and enables to improve their efficiency. <br/><br/>This proposal focuses on the study of the boundary behavior of solutions and on the analysis of equations and systems with low regularity, either in the coefficients, or in the boundary. A lot of the existing theory of PDEs, even for elliptic problems, has been developed for equations, in smooth domains, with constant or smooth coefficients, with symmetry. Similarly, the derivation of asymptotic models often relies on strong structure assumptions such as periodicity. New applications have made the need for relaxing these assumptions even more important. These questions lead to many challenging open problems. The primary goals are to (i) develop the tools for non symmetric elliptic equations and systems with non constant coefficients, (ii) investigate highly oscillating boundary conditions, (iii) relax structure assumptions in problems concerned with oscillating boundaries, (iv) make progress in the analysis of stationary linear or nonlinear systems in infinite energy spaces motivated by the study of boundary layers, (v) provide tractable results for numerical homogenization and (vi) justify rigorously some asymptotic models in oceanography and in the theory of viscoelastic fluids. This area of research is currently very active, and the proposed problems are important. The PI and his collaborators have elaborated new methods in recent works to deal with such questions. Developing these tools further will not only help solve the problems (i)-(vi) but also bring new ideas to many fields of PDEs: homogenization, harmonic analysis, elliptic equations and systems, and fluid mechanics."

In other contexts, these eigenfunctions can describe, for example, how fluids mix on extremely small length scales, with potential applications to improved efficiency in medical drug delivery and dialysis.  These eigenfunctions are fundamental building blocks to understand problems in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and even biomedical engineering.  It is precisely these important fundamental connections between the proposed research and STEM subjects that makes this research have broader significance within the larger context of the STEM areas. The PI has been developing simple, instructional model problems related to most of his research for students and younger researchers. <br/><br/>This project concerns research in the deep relationships between solutions to partial differential equations, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and mathematical physics. These different areas of mathematics are often tied together by problems in spectral theory and microlocal analysis; that is, problems concerned with eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, phase space localization, and the generalizations thereof. The research in this proposal is divided between selfadjoint and non-selfadjoint eigenfunction problems.  The study of the behaviour of solutions to partial differential equations has a rich connection to the underlying geometry and classical phase space dynamics. For example, it is well known that eigenfunctions tend to concentrate along geodesics. If there are isolated periodic geodesics, one might expect a subsequence of eigenfunctions to concentrate along such geodesics. Understanding the rate of concentration is an extremely important question in quantum chaos. On the other hand, if the geodesic flow is sufficiently chaotic, one might expect the eigenfunctions to be equidistributed in phase space. It is important to investigate how robust these phenomena are, through phase space estimates, restriction estimates, and perturbations.  For example, in the chaotic case, the PI and his collaborators are working to understand restrictions of eigenfunctions to hypersurfaces.  With mild geometric assumptions on a hypersurface, they conjecture the mass of such restrictions is bounded above and below, independent of the eigenvalue.  The methods of investigation will introduce new microlocal energy techniques, demonstrating how to generalize a problem, previously only understood on arithmetic surfaces using number theory, to very general geometric situations.  Some properties of eigenfunctions tend to be stable under small complex perturbations, which means one can also understand some non-selfadjoint problems.  For non-selfadjoint problems with larger imaginary component, perturbation techniques are no longer strictly valid. The PI is working to develop a general theory of geometric control adapted to degenerate advection-diffusion type equations of any order. This has straightforward applications to the Fokker-Planck equation and similar equations from statistical mechanics. This theory also has applications to certain models in theoretic micro-fluidics, with potential applications to efficient geometrically localized drug delivery and dialysis."

The four aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations are all manifestations of the general goal of understanding the long time dynamics of solutions to important nonlinear dispersive and hyperbolic equations. <br/><br/>This project is a collective effort of a group of five senior researchers from four institutions with research experience in various areas of partial differential equations. The investigators have been interested in both dispersive and hyperbolic partial differential equations and will collaborate to approach the problems under study from several different directions. The project centers on four main research directions in the study of solutions of dispersive and hyperbolic equations: (1) the analysis of critical semilinear evolutions, with special emphasis on the ""soliton resolution conjecture"" for extended type II solutions, (2) construction of global solutions of certain quasilinear dispersive models, such as water wave models, plasma models, and crystal optics, (3) stability problems in General Relativity, motivated by the outstanding Kerr nonlinear stability conjecture, and (4) long-term dynamics of solutions corresponding to randomized data. These four aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations are all manifestations of the general goal of understanding the long time dynamics of solutions. While specific major problems are identified for the project, this is a very active field, and it is anticipated that this project will identify and study other important problems during the course of the investigation. The project will also enhance links and collaborations among researchers at leading mathematical centers in the U.S., promoting training through active research involvement of students and postdoctoral researchers. Research resulting from this project will be disseminated widely in advanced graduate courses, survey articles, and monographs."

In dynamical systems the way in which a system obeying some fixed rules evolves over time is studied. The long term behavior of a deterministic dynamical system may be chaotic and unpredictable.  Such behavior is termed ""instability"". An example is the well-known butterfly effect, where there is a sensitive dependence on the initial conditions in which a small change of the initial state of a system may lead to huge differences in later states.   The proposed research will study instabilities of systems arising in classical mechanics and general relativity. The goal is to understand how the instability occurs and to quantify its properties. Another goal is to discover unknown phenomena based on a new understanding of instability mechanisms.<br/><br/>The proposed projects fall into the following three different fields.  The first project is to study Hamiltonian systems using symplectic methods. This will be a continuation of previous work.  It includes finding periodic orbits and homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits satisfying certain topological constraints in non-convex Hamiltonian systems.   The next project is to try to use the methods of proving Arnold diffusion to study systems in general relativity.   The interest is in showing Arnold diffusion in a perturbed Kerr-de Sitter metric and the physical meaning of Arnold diffusion in this setting is the Penrose process for energy and angular momentum extraction from black hole. In the last project the PI and his collaborators will use a general dynamical system without Hamiltonian structure to produce positive Lyapunov exponents in concrete systems with the help of small random perturbations.   In particular, for two dimensions the methods show positive Lyapunov exponents for a randomly perturbed standard map."

Just as a bell sounds a fading note, a wave or an unstable molecule oscillates and decays at certain rates. These two rates (of oscillation and of decay) are properties of the system and not of the way in which it is measured. Understanding their behaviour can be useful both in construction and in detection. For instance, in engineering, the ratio of the two rates is called the quality factor and tells us the amount of energy loss per cycle. Knowing this ratio for modes of specific systems is important in design of, for instance, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  On a different scale, similar modes appear in gravitational waves generated by colliding black holes and their (hypothetical) detection could provide information about black holes. The PI searches for unifying themes connecting the distribution of these modes and geometries of various systems.<br/><br/>Many physical systems can be described using evolution of states. The following correlations are observed: one measures the time evolution of one state against another state. The time representation can be replaced by the frequency representation (by taking a Fourier transform) which produces the power spectrum. The poles of power spectrum appear in different settings and are called scattering poles (obstacle scattering), quantum resonances (quantum scattering theory), quasinormal modes (general relativity), Pollicott--Ruelle resonances (chaos theory). These poles provide information about long time behaviour: the real part corresponds to the rate of oscillations, and the imaginary part to the rate of decay. The PI studies these poles in the different settings mentioned above. One recurrent theme is the use of the classical/quantum (wave) correspondence which suggests subtle interplay between ""classical"" properties of the system and properties of waves.  The PI investigates this phenomenon in many settings, in particular when chaotic behaviour is present on the classical level. Most recently methods that were developed for the study of classical quantum correspondence (microlocal analysis) became useful in the study of purely dynamical problems such as meromorphic continuations of zeta functions and problems in X-ray tomography."

The order in which certain operations are performed  can dramatically change the outcome in real life and in the sciences. However, in the usual  multiplication of numbers the order is irrelevant. Since the product AB is the same as BA one says that the factors A and B commute. Inspired by the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, mathematicians have investigated a new type of multiplication that respects the order of operations. During the last century this has led to spectacular new discoveries in mathematical theories embracing noncommutativity (i.e., allowing AB to be different from BA) such as noncommutative geometry or quantum (i.e., noncommutative) probability. In this line of research a similar program is applied to fundamental concepts in classical harmonic analysis such as Fourier series and estimates for solving differential equations in noncommutative spaces. Quite surprisingly, the abstract tools developed in this investigation are also useful in other disciplines. The research of the principal investigator will include a thorough analysis of quantum channels in quantum information theory. Research in quantum information theory usually takes place in computer science and physic departments. However, as long as quantum computers are not available in large numbers, the limitations and advantages of quantum computers can be understood only using theoretical, mathematical tools. The same applies for the capacities of devices transmitting information through the use of quantum mechanics. Interdisciplinary research in this work  will also include mathematical aspects of big data and compressed sensing. All aspects of this research will also serve to enhance the teaching mission of the university, and in particular the formation of students who are familiar with pure mathematics and certain applications alike.<br/><br/>The theory of operator algebras provides many important tools that are essential in understanding noncommutative aspects of classical objects, such as Brownian motion, derivatives and derivations, tangent and cotangent spaces, Laplace-Beltrami operators, singular integral kernels, quantum channels, and capacity of quantum channels. The project will aim to connect theoretical aspects of the theory of completely positive maps with more applied aspects in quantum information theory  and harmonic analysis, in particular those analytic properties of operators that have a geometric or metric flavor. The proposed work on the Grothendieck program for triple-tensor norms belongs to the core subject in operator space theory but is also motivated by quantum information and compressed sensing. Previous research of the principal investigator related to quantum information theory has already demonstrated the potential to connect to topics in computer science and physics. The proposed new research on private capacity of channels may even have an impact beyond science."

In particular, the problems to be studied are aimed at obtaining a better understanding of the composition of paraproducts and determining necessary and sufficient conditions for their boundedness.  Connections to the two-weight inequality for the Hilbert transform suggest related problems to investigate.  Resolving the proposed problems will provide more insight into the recent characterization of the two-weight inequality for the Hilbert transform and related properties for Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space.  An additional research direction, based upon the principal investigator's recent results and their connection to the description of the Carleson measure for model spaces, will be pursued.  The open question of obtaining a characterization of the Riesz bases for model spaces leads to problems related to reverse Carleson measures for the model spaces, and their relation to two-weight inequalities for the Cauchy and Hilbert transforms.

Harmonic analysis has played major roles in the pure and applied sciences since Fourier's seminal work on the theory of heat diffusion, continuing on with Schrodinger's equation in quantum mechanics. It underlies a diverse array of tools widely used in science and engineering, and it offers the promise of further applications in the future. The proposed research deals with foundational issues that may help to underpin future applications. In PDE, the project will study the long-time dynamical properties of several fundamental equations describing diverse physical phenomenon.  In particular, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) models the transmission of data in fiber optic communication systems, and the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV)  models surface water waves as well as ion-acoustic waves in a cold plasma. The so-called fractional NLS is used as a model describing charge transport in bio polymers like DNA. Proposed problems on near-linear behavior and smoothing are directly motivated by real world engineering problems in fiber optic communication systems, and the methods used are likely to be useful in a range of applications.<br/><br/>In harmonic analysis this project focuses on problems in Euclidean spaces centered around Lebesgue norm inequalities. One subject of on-going research is the Fourier restriction phenomenon and its applications to problems in PDE and geometric measure theory. In the PDE component of the project, the focus is on the dynamical properties of linear and nonlinear dispersive equations. Subjects of interest here are dispersive decay and smoothing estimates for Schrodinger and wave equations, and their applications to the stability problem for their nonlinear counterparts. Another topic is the regularity properties of the solutions of nonlinear dispersive PDE such as the KdV equation, the Zakharov system, and the fractional NLS. The principal investigator will continue to explore the smoothing effect of the dispersive linear group on bounded domains, and he will study applications to the regularity properties and long-time dynamics of the nonlinear solutions. Proposed applications are on the existence and regularity of global attractors, dispersive quantization/Talbot effect, bounds for higher order Sobolev norms, and controllability."

Providing quantitative and qualitative information for the solutions is fundamental and essential in the study of partial differential equations, which lies in the core of mathematical analysis. It is often the case that the most effective and economical way in scientific research is to explore properties of solutions and then to develop algorithm in accordance.

Techniques and ideas from analysis area, such as elliptic estimates and Fourier analysis, will be combined and applied into this project.

Another related direction is the study of phase separations phenomenon in Bose-Einstein condensate. Emphasis will be placed on the two components Gross-Pitaevskki system.  An important part of proposed research is on eigenfunction and eigenvalue estimates. Techniques and insights in the various areas cross-fertilize  each other in a fruitful way in this area. The topics consist of measure of nodal sets (zero level sets),  asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues, Lebesgue norm estimates, as well as  doubling estimates of Steklov eigenfunctions and classical eigenfunctions.

This research project investigates analytic and geometric properties of the complex Laplace operator, in particular, its spectrum.  Spectral analysis is a major tool in scientific research, and spectral properties of the complex Laplace operator are known to be closely related to certain quantum phenomena in physics.  The goal of this project is to understand how algebraic, analytic, and geometric structures of the underlying complex space interact with each other. The project combines ideas and methods from several branches of mathematics, and the techniques under development could potentially have applications in other areas of mathematics and physical sciences.

Since the work of Kohn and Hörmander in the 1960's, there have been extensive studies on regularity theory of the complex Neumann Laplace operator that led to important discoveries in both partial differential equations and several complex variables.  The main thrust of this proposal is to study spectral theory of the complex Neumann Laplace operator, with emphasis on the interplay between the spectral behavior of the operator and the underlying geometric structures. Among the problems studied in this project are stability of the spectrum as the underlying structures deform and characterization of complex manifolds whose complex Laplace operator has discrete spectrum.   Also investigated are regularity theory of the Cauchy-Riemann operator on complex manifolds, reproducing kernels, invariant metrics, and their applications to problems in complex algebraic geometry.

It has become increasingly apparent that many of these rules lead to complicated behavior when applied repeatedly.   This complicated behavior is often called ""chaos"".  To understand the behavior of a system and make useful predictions is a deep mathematical problem.  One possible approach is to find ""landmarks"".  A landmark is a small subsystem that behaves in a simple manner and which anchors the behavior of the system.  If enough of these landmarks can be found, they can provide a skeleton for the dynamics which gives a global understanding of the system itself. <br/><br/>The plan is to develop systematic and accurate methods for the calculation of landmarks.  Another goal is to prove theorems which show that the calculations satisfying some conditions are correct.  It is planned to obtain results which show that if certain landmarks are found in some configurations (which can be verified with finite accuracy calculations) then conclusions can be obtained for all times.  The hope is to make contact with concrete problems motivated by questions in solid state physics and chemistry.  The work in the project will also be used as a training ground for graduate students, postdocs and visitors.  For over 50 years, the most commonly used landmarks in dynamical systems have been normally hyperbolic manifolds and quasi-periodic orbits as well as their stable and unstable manifolds.  Here, it is proposed to develop a systematic way of computing these objects theoretically as well as numerically.  Another goal is to prove constructive existence theorems that validate approximate solutions and also to develop and implement fast and accurate algorithms.  The unifying principle is to look for functional equations that describe the invariance and then use a variety of methods to try to solve them. The methods will vary from geometry to functional analysis.   A further part of the proposed work is to begin studying special solutions in some infinite dimensional problems including partial differential equations and delay differential equations with state dependent delays."

The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. This research project studies mathematically the application of topological phases of matter to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit in quantum computation.<br/><br/>In this project the investigators study mathematical models for topological phases, focusing on their applications to topological quantum computation.  Topological phases of matter in two spatial dimensions are well-described in the framework of modular categories, but relatively little is known in three spatial dimensions.  A large part of this project is devoted to developing appropriate mathematical models in three spatial dimensions and analyzing the corresponding computational paradigms.  Specifically, the project will study (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories and representations of the loop braid group, and symmetry enriched topological order and gauging symmetry.  In addition, because locality and universality are two desirable properties for quantum computation that are manifested in the representations of the braid group, this project also aims to formulate conjectures characterizing when these properties hold and to verify and adapt these conjectures where appropriate to better characterize physical and computational aspects.  To compare the computational power of topological quantum computers to that of classical computers, the project investigates the complexity of the most natural computation in this setting: topological invariants."

The non-intrusive nature of these sensing methods is applied in many areas of science and technology including medical imaging, geophysics, non-destructive testing, remote sensing and so on. The fundamental mathematical theory behind such enhancement of ""visibility"" is the main aspect of inverse problems, while another aspect of the subject seeks to hide an object from detection by waves, that is, to make it ""invisible"". These projects concern both aspects, visibility and invisibility, for various waves. For visibility, the investigator plans to develop mathematical techniques to address some of the challenging questions in inverse problems that may have real world applications in the future. For instance, the Thermo-acoustic Tomography (TAT) medical imaging modality has the potential to detect breast cancer cells at a much earlier stage than is currently feasible. The simultaneous improvement in contrast and resolution resulting from such coupled-physics modalities is the subject of intensive mathematical study. Another example is the CT scan, whose mathematical theory is the fundamental tool in integral geometry. Analysis of the mathematics of wave propagation in complicated materials is essential for interpreting seismic information about the earth. As for invisibility, the development of ""meta-materials"" permits the customization of electromagnetic or acoustic media and has inspired the theory of transformation-optics based invisible cloak design. At the mathematical level, this leads to further applications based on electromagnetic waves (e.g., light) manipulation. These projects will focus on a couple of issues, known as the artificial blackhole and Eaton lens. <br/><br/>The first major topic of the project is inverse boundary value problems for Maxwell's equations. Challenging questions to be investigated include: inverse electromagnetic problems with incomplete data of measurements and inverse electromagnetic problems on a medium with anisotropic parameters. We will also consider some special solutions to Maxwell's equations that describe a type of bending accelerating wave packets. This part of the project also concerns electromagnetic invisibility and other applications based on transformation-optics, such as artificial black holes. The PI is also proposing to investigate another construction idea of cloaking device based on singular geometry, known as the Eaton lens. The second major topic of the project focuses on inverse problems arising in nonlinear wave propagation, where the nonlinearity provides new information. This also leads naturally to the third topic of the project due to the connection between hyperbolic wave propagations and geometric boundary rigidity problems. These inverse problems form the basis of several tomography methods. The PI plans to work on this topic for more generalized cases, and with limited measurements. In the last part of the project the PI plans to consider coupled-physics (i.e., hybrid) medical imaging modalities. In particular, the PI is interested in the uniqueness of the reconstruction of electrical properties from the internal absorbed radiation map."

Their study is central to at least two areas of mathematics: scattering theory and general relativity.  This project focuses on the study of partial differential equations on singular spaces with an emphasis on the scattering theory of waves.  The long-time behavior of wave equations on smooth spaces is well-understood in many regards, but the presence of singularities raises many unresolved problems.  The singularities studied include boundaries, cone points, and large-scale structures ""at infinity."" These projects are of interest to mathematicians and physicists working in partial differential equations, geometry, general relativity, and numerical analysis.  The investigator intends to foster communication among researchers in these communities through collaboration and by organizing conferences in these fields.<br/><br/>This research will provide new insights into the long-time behavior of waves in novel contexts.  Other than on perturbations of Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, very little fine information is known about the long-time behavior of waves.  Many facts that are known to hold for the linear wave equation in flat space are largely unknown when the underlying spacetime on which the evolution takes place is instead time-dependent or singular. The investigator will employ microlocal, or phase space, techniques to explore problems in these areas.  In particular, the investigator will address problems concerning (1) wave decay on curved spacetimes such as those arising in general relativity, (2) wave maps, or nonlinear sigma models in the language of quantum field theory, on conic surfaces, and (3) boundary value problems for the Helmholtz equation arising in numerical analysis."

Variants of this time-frequency decomposition process are performed in countless real-world applications, such as audio or image compression and filtering, image pattern recognition, data assimilation and denoising.  One of the broad objectives of this project is the  investigation of the theoretical feasibility threshold of the time-frequency techniques in terms of the relative size and smoothness of the input. An analogous procedure is adopted in tomographic imaging, where a solid body is reconstructed by means of sampling its density along penetrating waves, mathematically described as lines in three-dimensional space.  This project will study mathematical toy models of sampling along lines or curves, whose theoretical understanding may play a significant role in the derivation of improved analytical image reconstruction methods.  An integral component of the project is the training of graduate and undergraduate students within the active research group in harmonic analysis at Brown University, with the particular intent of attracting young and promising researchers to the field.<br/> <br/>The central objects of study of this project are modulation-invariant singular integrals and their behavior at or near the boundary of their known boundedness range. The model question, involving Carleson's maximal partial Fourier sum operator, is the characterization of the sharp integrability order sufficient for the almost-everywhere pointwise convergence of the Fourier series of a periodic function. The second, deeply related question concerns the extension of the Lacey-Thiele Holder-type estimates for the bilinear Hilbert transform to the boundary of the known range. Together with his collaborators, the principal investigator has recently obtained the current best results for both problems, relying in particular on a newly developed Calderon-Zygmund decomposition adapted to the modulation-invariant setting. It is expected that further developments of this technique will lead to additional improvements  towards the solution of these two central questions, as well as of other significant open problems. A standout question is the extension of the known uniform estimates for the bilinear Hilbert transform to the full expected range of exponents, completing the original program of Calderon for the boundedness of the first commutator. Another central direction of the proposed investigation is the study of singular integral operators with rotational symmetries, a prime example of which is the Hilbert transform along a smooth vector field in the plane, by means of multiparameter time-frequency analysis techniques. Further improvements of the aforementioned techniques are also expected to impact on several questions concerning summability of multiple Fourier series."

For example, a theorem of Emmy Noether states that symmetries of physical systems, like time and space translation, correspond to conserved quantities, like energy and momentum, respectively. Von Neumann, in his study of quantum mechanics, discovered that certain operator algebras on Hilbert space describe symmetries of quantum systems. These von Neumann algebras are built from basic building blocks called factors. A subfactor is an inclusion of factors, and its representation theory encodes quantum symmetries. In the classical setting, the symmetries of a particular object form a group, like the collection of symmetries of a square or of a molecule. When one passes from the classical setting to the quantum setting, these groups are replaced by so-called quantum groups and tensor categories. Unitary tensor categories arise naturally in the study of subfactors, and in return, subfactor theory provides a wealth of techniques for classification and construction of examples. Moreover, the quantum doubles of unitary fusion categories are unitary modular categories, which are vital to research in topological phases of matter and topological quantum computation.<br/><br/>The first aim of this project is the classification of subfactors and fusion categories. The small index subfactor classification program has seen recent success classifying up to index five, and the principal investigator will raise this index bound slightly above five. To raise the bound even further, up towards six, new techniques and obstructions are necessary. The project will also develop more techniques for studying infinite index subfactors, where there are relatively few results. The second aim is developing deeper connections between subfactors and free probability, C*-algebras, noncommutative geometry, and conformal field theory (CFT).  Recent work of Guionnet, Jones, and Shlyakhtenko developed a connection between subfactors, random matrices, and free probability. With Hartglass, the principal investigator developed this connection, discovering new connections to C*-algebras and noncommutative geometry via work of Pimsner and Voiculescu. The project will continue to investigate these new developments. Finally, conformal nets on the circle intimately relate subfactors and CFT.  In joint work with Henriques and Tener, the principal investigator will study conformal planar algebras, which are a common generalization of Jones's subfactor planar algebras and genus-zero Segal CFT. Tener and the principal investigator anticipate a classification in terms of module categories for the representation category of this CFT. They also conjecture the subfactor/planar algebra duality extends to a duality between conformal planar algebras and certain morphisms in the 3-category of conformal nets."

Operator algebras were introduced by John von Neumann and his collaborator Murray during the 1930's, when mathematicians and physicists began the development of a rigorous description of matter on the atomic scale. The physical theory developed for that description was quantum theory. Mathematically, the possible configurations or states of matter (an electron moving around an atom, for example) are described by certain vector spaces. Performing an experiment on the physical system corresponds mathematically to applying an operator to the vector space of possible states. The collection of such operators is described mathematically as an algebra of operators. Nowadays, the study of operator algebras has become an important mathematical pursuit with applications to many other branches of mathematics and theoretical physics. The study of operator algebra itself also has been developed into several closely related subareas, of which one is structural investigation of the important class called C*-algebras. The classification of C*-algebras has developed rapidly in the past few years, with several exciting results. One goal of this summer school is to pull together these recent results to get a clear picture of the current status of the classification of C*-algebras.<br/><br/>The Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium (RMMC) has run a summer school, in which topics vary widely from year to year, for over thirty years. The theme of the 2015 installment in the series is the structure of C*-algebras. The set of topics includes the following: von Neumann algebra techniques in the classification of C*-algebras; an introduction to the K-theory of operator algebras; and higher-rank graph C*-algebras. The event's lecturers include four of the world's leading authorities on C*-algebras: George Elliott, Guihua Gong, Yasuhiko Sato, and Alex Kumjian. The choice of topic was motivated by the secondary purpose of the activity; namely, to prepare the summer school's participants, especially the junior ones, for the regional conference sponsored by the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) that will follow it during the second week of June and that has as its focus the so-called basic homotopy lemmas and the asymptotic uniqueness theorem, one of the key ingredients in the recent breakthroughs in the classification of C*-algebras. <br/><br/>Summer school web site: http://www.uwyo.edu/math/additional-learning-opportunities/rmmc-summer-school/"

The abstract nature of this language allows for a wide spectrum of applications, whose various settings include quantum mechanics, the theory of probability, and the study of systems, physical or otherwise, as they evolve in time. The project will concentrate on several aspects and generalized forms of the last of these three settings, and it will largely revolve around phenomena related to entropy.<br/><br/>Finite or finite-dimensional approximation has long played a fundamental role in both dynamics and operator algebras and is manifest in its most basic and influential forms through the notions of amenability and soficity and their algebraic analogues. In the domain of C*-algebras, amenability has been subject to various refinements like finite decomposition rank and finite nuclear dimension that express the kind of topological regularity necessary for K-theoretic classification theorems within the Elliott program. This project aims to broaden our understanding of the relationships between these regularity properties and phenomena in topological dynamics, in particular mean dimension and Rokhlin-type dimensional invariants, and to test this understanding on a variety of examples that have so far remained beyond the scope of classification, such as actions of branch groups. Combinatorial independence will be brought into this picture as a tool for analyzing mixing and paradoxicality in dynamics and their relation to quasidiagonality and dimensional behavior, and it will be also applied to actions of sofic groups in the study of entropy and orbit equivalence."

Another example is the curve outlining the wake of a boat. Yet another is the interface between plasma and ordinary matter in a fusion reactor.  Remarkably, the same mathematics of free boundaries that describes these physical phenomena can be used to design optimal shapes.  For example, when one wants to enclose an oven or pipe with insulating material, there is a shape that is optimal in the sense that the sum of the cost of insulation and the cost due to heat loss is minimized. Moreover, even farther from physics, one can seek optimal ways to divide data sets into yes/no regions according to rules that minimize the errors, that is, false positive or false negative identifications or diagnoses.  The overarching goal of this project is to reduce the complexity of the problem of searching for these optimal shapes.  The expectation is that there are broad classes of situations in which the optimal divider (free boundary) resembles a straight line or plane at an appropriate scale.  In those cases, one can be confident of finding a near optimal shape quickly.  In addition to conducting his own research, the PI has served and will serve as faculty advisor for research projects by dozens of undergraduates and high school students in programs at MIT.  Moreover, he has posted videos and lecture notes of a widely viewed single variable calculus course on MIT's Open Courseware site. He is currently working on an on-line course to be disseminated by MITx.<br/><br/>Free boundaries arise as the interface between materials in which the materials retain some energy.  Typically, space is divided into level sets of some quantity like temperature or pressure.  In contrast, the interface represented by a minimal surface lives in an ambient space that is empty.  Despite this difference between these two types of interfaces, there are profound connections between them.  The main goal of this project is to show that interfaces and level sets of least energy for a wide variety of problems are as simple as possible. The PI proposes that the level sets of optimizers resemble parallel planes in that these surfaces are connected and cleanly separated. Usually, methods from the more developed theory of minimal surfaces have guided the study of free boundaries, but here ideas from the theory of free boundaries will guide the study of minimal surfaces. The proposal also gives a pathway to proving analogous simple behavior of level sets of the least energy Neumann eigenfunction for a convex symmetric domain.  This would yield an important case of the longstanding ``hot spots'' conjecture of J. Rauch.  A second project is to identify the cases of equality in the celebrated Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities in convex geometry.  The PI will use a geometric approach based on establishing new properties, of independent interest, of the Brenier (optimal transportation) mapping. A third project is aimed at developing a highly accurate description of localization of eigenfunctions and quantum tunneling, relevant to the design of LEDs."

Important examples include the Einstein equations of general relativity (which form the basis of modern cosmology), the Euler equations of fluid mechanics, the equations of elasticity, and the equations of crystal optics. Despite hundreds of years of mathematical progress, major gaps remain in our understanding of solutions. For example, although it is expected that solutions often ""become infinite"" there are few cases in which mathematicians have found a proof. Moreover, in other contexts, it is not even known if the equations have solutions. Thus, we still do not have a definitive understanding of the physical predictions of many equations of classical physics. The main obstacle is that the aforementioned equations are extremely difficult to study except under unrealistic simplifying assumptions. However, there have been some recent advancements in resolving some of these difficulties. For example, recent results provide a detailed description of Big Bang formation in solutions to the Einstein equations and shocks in solutions to the Euler and related equations. A major goal of this project is to extend these results to apply to other physically relevant equations and regimes. This work will provide new insight on the long-time behavior of waves and on the ways in which various physical theories can break down. <br/><br/>This research project involves the rigorous study of quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs and has three main research goals. The first is to provide a detailed description of singularity formation in various quasilinear wave-like equations of physical significance, with an emphasis on avoiding symmetry assumptions whenever possible. Examples include various Einstein-matter equations, the Euler equations, and the equations of elasticity. This research will expand our understanding of singularity formation by enlarging the class of equations and the class of initial conditions that are known to lead to blow-up. The second research goal is to prove local well-posedness for a class of physically relevant quasilinear hyperbolic problems with a free boundary along which the hyperbolicity of the equations degenerates. The third is to develop new tools for understanding the behavior of solutions to quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs with multiple characteristics in contexts where knowledge of the precise characteristics is essential. An ultimate goal is to use these tools to prove that for such equations, under suitable assumptions on the nonlinearities and data, shock formation occurs and is stable.  This proposal has several educational components that are intimately connected to the research problems. Many of the problems have components that can be investigated by advanced undergraduates, and the PI plans to supervise undergraduate research projects. There are also components suitable for PhD students. Moreover, the PI is organizing, with three co-organizers, a pair of summer schools targeted at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students from across the US and beyond. The PI will also develop curriculum materials that will be made freely available to the public online."

Examples are pervasive in the sciences, including the motion of celestial bodies, weather patterns, the behavior of fluids moving through a pipe, and chemical processes. A basic question in the subject is to determine the behavior of such a system. So called hyperbolic dynamical systems are a prime example of success in the field. These systems admit a special kind of expansion and contraction, which make available certain mathematical methods of analyzing the behavior of these systems. This project centers on understanding systems at the opposite extreme, piecewise isometric systems, which admit no contraction or expansion and thus force different approaches to be used to understand these systems. These systems are typically understood through renormalization.  Renormalization is a method of looking more and more closely at, or zooming in on, repeated behavior.  Renormalization is a  major part of this project and the PI will develop new renormalization methods and improve existing methods to understand these systems. A better understanding of these systems will have broad consequences for our understanding of dynamical systems as a subject. In addition to the research aims of the project, the PI will work with students, providing mentoring and training in mathematical research.<br/><br/>The PI will make contributions toward the use of renormalization to understand dynamical phenomena in piecewise isometric dynamical systems and related systems. Systems of interest include horocyclic flows on hyperbolic surfaces, geodesic flows on flat manifolds, and piecewise isometric systems. Many of these systems arise naturally through connections with low-dimensional topology and geometry. A piecewise isometry is formed by cutting a metric space into pieces and applying an isometry to each piece so as to reassemble the whole space. Examples include interval exchange transformations (IETs), where the space is an interval, which is cut into finitely many subintervals. The theory of IETs is quite well developed and stands as a testament to the power of renormalization methods, but in contrast, many related systems are only poorly understood. A primary goal is to extend the applicability of renormalization methods to wider classes of systems including polygon exchange transformations, and infinite interval exchange transformations. New dynamical phenomena will be discovered and rigorously studied using the renormalization methods developed by the PI. Results produced by research in this proposal will widely disseminated through publication in research journals and through conference presentations."

These characteristics allow one to distinguish one object from another.  Some characteristics may change drastically under the influence of very small external forces,  and some remain resistant to change under such forces. The former are unstable and usually difficult to measure, while the latter are more stable and easier to detect, hence much more useful. In mathematics, those stable characteristics are called invariants. They provide some of the most fundamental tools in almost all branches of mathematics. In this project, the principal investigator will study a certain class of invariants of differential equations and apply them to study problems in classical geometry and topology. <br/><br/>Index theoretical invariants of elliptic operators are important for understanding the geometry of their underlying spaces. The famous Atiyah-Singer index theorem and its noncommutative geometric generalizations have many applications to geometry and topology. All these index theoretical invariants live naturally in the K-theory of certain operator algebras. The principal investigator will use methods developed in the studies of K-theory of operator algebras to investigate various invariants of elliptic operators on manifolds and spaces with singularities. In particular, he is interested in secondary invariants such as the higher rho invariant. The principal investigator proposes to use these secondary invariants to study the structure group of a closed topological manifold and the homotopy groups of the space of positive scalar curvature metrics on a given manifold. The principal investigator also plans to explore the connections of these problems to the Novikov conjecture and the Baum-Connes conjecture."

The research plan has the following characteristics: (1) it is structured into several classes of problems (some to be detailed in the next paragraph), on some of which the principal investigator has already made relevant contribution/advancements by developing new analysis methods; (2) it covers a wide range of techniques, with levels of difficulty varying depending on the nature of the subject that also allow partial progress; (3) it has two main components, namely, a purely theoretical one dealing with problems that focus on understanding the behavior of various so-called maximal operators with highly oscillatory kernels and a more applied side, part of the area of fluid dynamics, studying the problem of singularity formation for two-fluid interfaces. An advancement in this latter direction will contribute to a better understanding of the physical reality around us. Further aspects of the project are the dissemination of the principal investigator's work through conference participation, lectures, and graduate courses, interaction with other researchers/experts in the areas of harmonic analysis and PDE, the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. <br/><br/>This project investigates several problems that position themselves at the interface either between harmonic analysis and additive combinatorics, or between harmonic analysis and fluid dynamics. It is structured along several major themes, among which we mention the following (items (2), (3), and (4) represent joint projects with collaborators): (1) pointwise convergence of Fourier series near L^1; (2) the maximal Schrodinger operator, Kakeya extremizers, and sum-product estimates; (3) formation of singularities for the two-dimensional, two-fluid interface in the absence of vorticity in order to increase understanding of the ""limiting"" water-wave case; (4) the rotational two-dimensional water-wave problem and quasilinear systems of Klein--Gordon equations in three dimensions with nontrivial vorticity, with a focus on the time of existence for small initial data. On the first topic the author has already made contributions, developing new methods that either improved on known results (e.g., the pointwise convergence along lacunary subsequences of partial Fourier sums) or recovered the best known results stemming from the celebrated work of Lennart Carleson. The approaches for both the first and second topics combine techniques from time-frequency analysis and additive combinatorics. The third theme investigates, for the two-dimensional, two-fluid problem, how the geometry of the interface changes as the boundary approaches a ""splash"" scenario from the water-wave case; the fourth one explores how the time of existence for solutions (relative to small initial data) of the two-dimensional water-wave case and three dimensional Klein-Gordon systems are affected by the presence of vorticity, a new and hitherto mostly unexplored theme in the fluid dynamics literature."

Ramsey theory finds order in completely random structures, such as the relationships among an arbitrary set of people. Ergodic theory is the mathematical theory behind statistical mechanics. The strong connection between the two theories is unexpected, and since its discovery in the late 1970's, Ergodic Ramsey Theory has become an increasingly vibrant area of research. <br/><br/>The activity in the area of Ergodic Ramsey Theory area has greatly accelerated after the ground breaking work of Green, Tao, Host, and Kra less than a decade ago. The main theme of the conference is at the cross section of ergodic theory, combinatorics, number theory, and Fourier analysis. Ergodic Ramsey Theory has contributed to all four areas and serves as a perfect example of how the interplay of many areas of mathematics can facilitate progress.

The research will focus on three topics: approximation theory, nonlinear nonlocal evolution equations, and the spectral theory of Schrodinger operators. In approximation theory, the research concerns problems related to estimating the size of orthonormal polynomials. Understanding the asymptotics of the orthonormal polynomials has proved to be crucial for the progress in several fields, including mathematical physics and probability. The second main theme of the research is analysis of two-dimensional active scalar equations. These nonlinear and nonlocal evolution equations appear in the fluid dynamics and atmospheric and ocean sciences. The physical processes described by these equations are known to be highly unstable, and this project aims to develop a mathematical explanation for that phenomenon. The third topic of this project is spectral theory of Schrodinger operators. The Schrodinger equation is one of the basic equations in mathematical physics. The project will focus on understanding how the properties of the potential function affect the scattering of waves. <br/><br/>In the area of approximation theory, the research investigates the following classical question: what is the size of the polynomial orthonormal on the unit circle (or the real line) with respect to a measure from a given class. Various ways to define the size and various classes of measures will be considered. For example, the project will study a class of weights that have a fixed oscillation around a given constant.  The second part of the project will mainly focus on two active scalar equations: the two-dimensional Euler equation of fluid dynamics and the surface quasi-geostrophic equation. Questions of instability will be addressed; in particular, patch dynamics will be studied and the merging mechanism of a centrally symmetric pair will be analyzed. The third topic of this project will address multidimensional scattering. The Schrodinger evolution with rough potential will be considered and the classical questions of the scattering theory will be studied. To carry out the proposed research, methods of harmonic and complex analysis will be used along with techniques from nonlinear analysis and the theory of partial differential equations. Through the training of graduate and undergraduate students the project will have an impact on human resource development."

Achieving deeper properties of their solutions (singular structures of the gradients, large time average, and so forth) will help a lot  in the design of fast numerical methods to approximate the solutions accurately and in the design of optimal strategies for the players in the games.<br/><br/>The proposed projects are to (i) continue developing a new approach to obtain large time behavior of solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations and related problems, (ii) discover game theory interpretation and dynamical properties of solutions of some weakly coupled systems, (iii) study homogenization of some Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and (iv) obtain a PDE approach to study asymptotic limit for the Langevin equation with vanishing friction coefficient. The topics consist of widely different nonlinear problems but they all satisfy maximum principle and hence admit viscosity solutions. The Crandall-Lions theory of viscosity solutions has been developed extensively in the last thirty years including the existence, uniqueness, stability of the solutions as well as some connections to differential games, front propagations, homogenization theory, optimal control, and weak KAM theory. However, many interesting properties of viscosity solutions, such as regularity, dynamical properties, gradient shock structure, and game theory interpretation of solutions, are still far from being well understood.

The Corona Problem can be phrased as a question about left invertibility of matrices in particular algebras of analytic functions.  Additionally, it has formulations in the areas of operator theory, complex differential geometry, functional analysis, and commutative algebra.  The Corona Problem has served as an impetus for research in four main areas of analysis: complex analysis, function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory. Additionally, it arises in real-world applications through the use of control theory to engineering questions. This research program utilizes knowledge and techniques from these broad areas of analysis to provide an array of tools with which to approach the challenging questions raised in this project.  The proposed research is based on recent, significant contributions made by the principal investigatorr and focuses on key questions connected to the Corona Problem.  In particular, the principal investigator will address questions that relate the Corona Problem to complex differential geometry via the curvature of canonical vector bundles associated with the problem.  The Corona Problem will additionally be studied for more general multiplier algebras of analytic functions.  Finally, the connection with the Corona Problem and control theory will be explored via the computation of the stable rank of rings of analytic functions.  <br/><br/>The project's educational component creates a novel ""Internet Analysis Seminar"" that provides a forum for researchers in these areas to interact and learn from one another, both academically and professionally.  The seminar includes three phases involving Internet lectures, working groups, and a final conference.  A primary goal is to increase the collaborative learning and mentoring between graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and senior faculty across the country. The seminar takes the standard dissemination of research results further, providing an open, inclusive setting for junior mathematicians to learn new research concepts and apply them through group projects with more senior researchers. Moreover, the project integrates the principal investigator's current and future research with an ambitious educational component: the cutting-edge research will provide many of the topics selected for the Internet seminar, and seminar participants will likely collaborate on future research projects. Solutions to the research questions investigated in this project will have countless applications in complex analysis, function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.  Not only will they open the way to additional mathematical inquiry, but they will also have significant application to real-world ideas, in particular in the area of control theory. The educational component seeks to broaden the participation of isolated researchers and underrepresented groups by creating an open and inclusive research forum in which any researcher can participate.

Equations of this type arise in models of several physical phenomena, including propagation of light in optical fibers, Bose-Einstein condensates, small-amplitude water waves, and waves in plasmas.  Despite their common occurrence, understanding of the behavior of solutions to such equations is limited by their mathematical complexity.  This project aims to extend current theoretical understanding of this important class of equations.  Training of junior researchers and students in this area of research is also an integrated part of the project.<br/><br/>The problems to be investigated are nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations with broken symmetries and/or non-constant coefficients. While some of these equations are very physical, such as the cubic-quintic nonlinear Schrodinger equation with non-zero boundary conditions, others have been carefully selected by the investigator to highlight certain deficiencies in our mathematical understanding of the underlying linear propagator. A major thrust of this project is therefore to resolve questions in harmonic analysis related to the linear propagator in various geometries. These range from proving Strichartz estimates powerful enough to resolve the small data energy-critical problem on high-dimensional tori to shepherding recent progress on the restriction conjecture into the realm of non-constant coefficients, which is a key step toward resolving mass-critical problems outside the translation-invariant setting."

Such a result would be of great physical and mathematical importance as it is known to be false for the compressible Euler equation in the absence of a self-consistent electromagnetic field. In a second part, a study is made of the Schrodinger equation on a curved background. In this case, many classical tools from the Euclidean theory break down and one expects the appearance of many new phenomena due to the influence of the geometry of the background. In particular, a study will be made of the effect of the growth of the volume on the global existence and global behavior of the solutions to the energy-critical equation. Finally, in a third part, ideas developed before are used to upgrade some known results about the homogeneous fourth-order equation to the more physical inhomogeneous equation. <br/><br/>Understanding how a fluid can be stabilized by a self-consistent electromagnetic field in the absence of any friction represents a cross-disciplinary collaboration between pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and physics, with applications in fluid engineering. More specifically, proving that a plasma at rest is stable under small perturbations would be a major physical discovery and would most certainly greatly enhance our ways to control plasma. This is especially fitting since plasma stability is one of the main factor limiting performances in tokamaks. Finally, beyond industrial applications, plasma represents the state of more than 99% of the matter in the universe and any work providing better understanding of this state would be of great importance. Dispersive equations and equations on curved spaces (manifolds) provide a rich area of interaction between various branches of mathematics as well as between different sciences. The study of equations on curved spaces is of interest to geometers, analysts, and number theorists in mathematics, as well as to theoretical physicists working in quantum chaos and general relativity. Fourth-order equations naturally arise in many different branches of physics and mathematics, especially those linked with elasticity and are critical to understand phenomena as diverse as the movement (and possible oscillations and breakdown) of bridges or the structure of blood vessels and the interaction between their membranes and the biofluids."

However, passing from the understanding of microscopic objects to moderately complex configurations remains a challenging problem. This projects aims at understanding simple but basic questions for slightly complicated systems, focusing on situations and models related to macroscopic plasma physics.  A plasma is a collection of many charged particles that, because of their long range interactions exhibit a collective macroscopic behavior which is complex and remains poorly understood. This in turns limits some potential major applications, controlled fusion being perhaps the most well-known. Thus, furthering the understanding of this ""small scale to large scale"" cascade of information can have major possible applications. The emphasis of this proposal is on large-time questions such as ""can a plasma macroscopically at rest spontaneously develop dramatic behavior such as high concentration or velocities, or spontaneously form a vacuum?"". Another related question is to find possible scenarios for the large-time behavior of a plasma that remains away from the quiet neutral equilibrium. Investigating these questions involve a fine study of the deep mechanisms of transfer of energy inside different parts of the plasma as a result of collective elementary simple interactions.<br/><br/>This projects aims at developing the study of two fundamental equations from physics. First we consider stability issues for the 2-fluid Euler-Maxwell equation in two dimensions. This is a fundamental equation modeling the dynamical properties of a plasma. The goal is to prove that under certain conditions, small perturbations of an equilibrium will not develop shocks and that actually, the plasma will get back to equilibrium, even in the absence of dissipation. Such a result would be of great physical and mathematical importance as it is known to be false for the compressible Euler equation in the absence of a self-consistent electromagnetic field. In a second part, we study the Schroedinger equation on a curved background.  This equation is a universal model appearing in many time reversible equations, notably in some plasma models. When this equation is posed on a nonconstant background, many classical tools from the Euclidian theory break down and one expects the appearance of various new phenomena due to the influence of the geometry. We study in particular the effect of the growth of the volume on the global behavior of the solutions and on the possibility to obtain asymptotic dynamics different from scattering. A unifying theme is to understand the asymptotic dynamics of solutions in a context where the dispersion is limited. Another unifying theme is to try to find simpler limit equations and understand their significance for the full model. A last unifying theme concerns the specificity and relevance of dispersive systems. Some tools we plan to use and develop are concentration compactness methods, study of the space and time resonances, study of dispersive systems and pseudo-products estimates with singular multipliers."

The basic questions concern existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions, as well as the question if solutions blow up (e.g. black holes in general relativity) and if not what the long time behavior of solutions are? More specifically, the PI is mainly working in two areas. One project is to study if Einstein's and related equations have solutions for all times or if the solutions blow up. A long term goal is to study the stability of large solutions like black holes and the big bang in general relativity. The motivation is to understand the large scale structure of our universe. The Physicists are building large gravitational wave detectors to observe the universe and the theory has to be developed together with observations. Another project is to study a class of problems that occur in fluid dynamics and general relativity, in particular, proving existence and stability for the free boundary problem of the motion of the surface of a fluid in vacuum (such as the surface of the ocean). A long term goal is to study the long time behavior of astrophysical bodies such as gaseous stars as well as other interface problems of fluids and solids. It is conceivable that understanding the properties of and controlling the interface between two fluids could have important applications. In particular there is a version of the problem in magneto-hydrodynamics and controlling the plasma is needed for constructing fusion reactors.<br/><br/>To solve these problems the PI and collaborators are developing new techniques that could be useful for studying many other problems as well. In particular, they are using geometric methods combined with frequency decomposition methods to study hyperbolic differential equations. The PI's and collaborator's greatly simplified existence proof for Einstein's equations and its generalizations and refinements will have a large impact. Moreover the detailed asymptotic behavior they prove in harmonic coordinates will be useful also for the physics community. The methods the PI has developed for the free boundary problem of fluids work also for the compressible case and also with vorticity since it uses interior equations and not just equations on the boundary. The methods PI and collaborators are developing to deal with nonlinear equations with variable coefficients will hopefully also be useful to show stability of perturbations of large solutions."

All Workshop participants will be invited to disseminate their work through seminars, and past experience suggests that most will take advantage of this opportunity.<br/><br/>The Workshop activities have a wide impact by providing intellectual stimulation for all participants as well as giving an opportunity to a diverse group of junior participants to increase the breadth and depth of knowledge and to interact with senior researchers in several areas of mathematics. There is also significant outreach to applied mathematics and computer science. Indeed, an important goal of the Workshop is to promote cooperation among researchers in different fields, and every Concentration Week involves participants from two or more research areas. The website of the Workshop is located at <http://www.math.tamu.edu/~kerr/workshop>."

University Blvd.","Denver","CO","802104711","3038712000","MPS","1281","","$0.00","In the current project, the PI will explore several questions and open problems in the area of symbolic dynamics.  Dynamics is the study of closed systems whose elements evolve over time according to deterministic rules; some examples include planetary motion, or a particle's movement inside a box.   Symbolic dynamics is the study of dynamics where the elements in question are infinite sequences of symbols, and the evolution over time comes from horizontally shifting the sequence.  Symbolic dynamics was introduced as a tool for studying more complicated dynamical systems, but has become a fundamental area in its own right, with applications and connections ranging from computer science (e.g. data storage in binary) to statistical physics (e.g. the Ising model for magnetism).   A current area of high activity is multidimensional symbolic dynamics, in which one considers not sequences, but multidimensional arrays of symbols, which can be shifted in any direction.  Though the core definitions and ideas remain the same, there are remarkable changes that occur for multiple dimensions; many questions that were easy to answer in one dimension become quite difficult, and classes of systems whose behavior was relatively simple in one dimension can exhibit strange and complex behaviors.<br/><br/>The research supported by this grant will treat a variety of problems in symbolic dynamics, ranging from the more classical one-dimensional case to the less well-understood multidimensional case.   A common thread throughout is the use of ideas, techniques, and viewpoints from other areas, including probability theory, statistical physics, and percolation theory, to attack fundamental problems.  The two projects on one-dimensional symbolic dynamics propose new directions of research about the classical notions of follower sets and the specification property respectively.  The first multidimensional project proposes a new method for the efficient approximation of entropies of multidimensional shifts of finite type (SFT) which, unlike existing techniques, can be used on systems with multiple measures of maximal entropy.  The final project will extend recent work by the PI and Kevin McGoff on random multidimensional SFTs, in which a probabilistic framework was defined where a ""typically"" chosen multidimensional SFT does not exhibit the worst pathological behaviors of the class; we now plan to use this framework to prove multidimensional probabilistic versions of some classical one-dimensional results.   All work will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and the author's continued collaboration with young researchers, including his two Ph.D. students."

For instance, in problems arising from electric fields, various geometric conditions can always be expressed in terms of functions of complex variables. By employing appropriate conformal maps, many inconvenient geometric configurations can be transformed to rather easy formats and hence be completely solved.  Some other types of real-world phenomena are modeled as solutions to certain partial differential equations. Methods developed in complex analysis, such as Fourier analysis, have played fundamental roles in solving those equations and giving interpretations for solutions. The current project will address related problems in holomorphic function theory. Progress of the project will help us understand more precisely properties of conformal maps in higher dimensions and explore new methods that can be applied into other fields. <br/><br/>The PI proposes to study a variety of problems in several complex variables and the corresponding partial differential equations, together with her collaborators. More specifically, the PI will investigate rigidity and classification problems of CR embeddings between some special types of CR manifolds, such as (generalized) Heisenberg hypersurfaces. Since transversality property of CR mappings is closely related to CR embeddability, she also plans to continue the work on CR transversality along the line of the conjecture of Baouendi-Huang for Levi non-degenerate hypersurfaces of higher codimension.  On the aspect of partial differential equations, the PI will work on regularity of solutions to Cauchy-Riemann equations over pseudoconvex domains through the method of integral representation theory. The method will involve strong correlation between holomorphic function theory and the geometry of the domains. The PI is also interested in the regularity problem for solutions to some Beltrami equations, as well as solvability and regularity to some general types of nonlinear elliptic complex partial differential equations on Heisenberg hypersurfaces."

The project will address important questions now open to exploration because of recent advances made by the principal investigator and his collaborators.  Resolution of these problems raised will find applications in function theoretic operator theory and yield new tools and techniques that can be adopted by the larger analysis community.  The principal investigator will advise graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, include them in the proposed research projects, and provide mentoring, in order to assist them in transitioning to the next stage of their careers.  Broad dissemination of the results will take place by participation in conferences and posting of the research to the arxiv preprint server.<br/><br/>This project will combine recent results of the principal investigator with motivation from function theory and operator theory to study questions related to the two-weight Hilbert transform and properties of model spaces.  The first research direction to be explored couples the results of the principal investigator with questions about boundedness and invertibility properties of products of Toeplitz operators.  In particular, the problems to be studied are aimed at obtaining a better understanding of the composition of paraproducts and determining necessary and sufficient conditions for their boundedness.  Connections to the two-weight inequality for the Hilbert transform suggest related problems to investigate.  Resolving the proposed problems will provide more insight into the recent characterization of the two-weight inequality for the Hilbert transform and related properties for Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space.  An additional research direction, based upon the principal investigator's recent results and their connection to the description of the Carleson measure for model spaces, will be pursued.  The open question of obtaining a characterization of the Riesz bases for model spaces leads to problems related to reverse Carleson measures for the model spaces, and their relation to two-weight inequalities for the Cauchy and Hilbert transforms.  Additional directions of investigation connect to bilinear forms and commutators on model spaces."

Some problems find their motivation in the applied sciences and therefore offer opportunities for collaborations among mathematicians and other researchers. For example, the so-called ""one-phase problem"" describes the motion of a fluid in which a cavity is present  that is a mixture of vapor and gas and the pressure on the cavity is constant. Other problems under investigation are related to issues of optimal transportation and allocation of resources. All such problems require the development of new sophisticated techniques, and progress will be disseminated to the scientific community to invigorate the advancement of the theory.<br/><br/>The PI will study the classification of cones in low dimensions for the ""one-phase"" free boundary problem. As a tool in the analysis of free boundaries, the PI will investigate some boundary Harnack type results. In the context of optimal transportation, the PI is interested in the higher regularity for a class of degenerate Monge-Ampere equations in which the right hand side vanishes on the boundary. Finally, parts of this project deal with the fundamental question of local regularity of minimizers in the calculus of variations. In particular, in the scalar case the PI will investigate situations in which the integrand becomes highly degenerate on some compact set. In the vectorial case, the PI plans to construct some interesting singular minimizers in low dimensions and will also explore a viscosity approach to regularity for certain types of functionals."

This project is concerned with topics in harmonic analysis that are designed to provide effective mathematical tools for these disciplines and that could well contribute to the unification of seemingly unrelated areas. The main goal of the project is to expand the mathematical toolbox in harmonic analysis along these lines. The project involves mentoring of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will to work on several projects in harmonic analysis. The first project is concerned with the functional calculus for selfadjoint elliptic and subelliptic partial differential operators. The research will focus on a model example in the subelliptic case, the Laplacian on the Heisenberg group. The goal is to derive new multiplier results on Lebesgue spaces, in particular for the model case of Bochner-Riesz means. In the Euclidean case such multiplier results can be based on Fourier restriction theory, which is not available on the Heisenberg group. A new approach is proposed based on the fine structure of the wave kernel on the Heisenberg group. A second project is motivated by a problem on the cost of mixing for incompressible flows that are generated by time-dependent vector fields. It turns out that this problem is related to boundedness questions on certain bilinear singular integral operators. A general theory will be developed that incorporates multilinear generalizations and is of independent interest. A third project is concerned with problems in approximation theory that involve function spaces of low order of smoothness. In many cases there are gaps between the known results for the categories of Besov and Sobolev spaces. As an example, the range for unconditional convergence of Haar wavelet expansions is well understood for Besov spaces but remains open for Sobolev spaces. One goal for this project is to determine the correct range for Sobolev spaces."

In broad terms, it asks one to analyze the orbits of several particles/bodies that initially move independently and circularly around a fixed point in a plane, and then start to interact with each other, possibly in a nonlinear fashion. The basic question of interest is the following: With the passage of time, under what circumstances do the orbits of these particles/bodies remain bounded? Examples include the Solar System, where the planets are moving around the Sun, and the (planar) galaxies, where the stars move around a black hole. Recently, it has been discovered  that there are deep connections between this problem and the field of harmonic analysis, and the present project aims to explore and understand these connections more quantitatively.<br/><br/>There are several extremely interesting nonlinear operators that one needs to understand from a harmonic analysis point of view in order to give meaningful answers to the question above, at least in some particular situations. Some of them include Carleson-type maximal operators associated to iterated Fourier integrals that are generated by combinatorial trees. The complexity of these trees is naturally linked to the complexity of the nonlinear interactions between the particles/bodies. For instance, quadratic interactions generate binary trees, cubic interactions corresponds to ternary trees, and so on. In particular, the simplest case of 1-ary trees is the one that comes from linear interactions, and it was studied by the principal investigator in collaboration with Tao and Thiele some years ago. This is the case that generated the standard iterated Fourier series and integrals. The aim of this project is to develop the necessary analytical tools to understand the boundedness properties of such nonlinear operators."

This project aims to advance understanding of important algebraic structures, with potential applications to number theory and theoretical physics.<br/><br/>This research project is concerned with symmetry breaking, that is, obtaining representations of a smaller Lie group from the representations of a large reductive semi-simple Lie group.  The representations of the large group are usually infinite dimensional, and the representations of smaller groups are related to quotients of the original representation of the large group.  Symmetry breaking of representations is far from well understood, and so the constructions and the understanding of examples are very important.
