Von Neumann algebras have since become a field of independent interest with further applications to areas such as ergodic theory, Voiculescu's free probability theory, Jones' theory of subfactors and planar algebras, knot theory, and many others. The development of von Neumann algebras has also historically been closely connected to the study of measurable dynamics and these connections have recently begun to reemerge in the presence of newly developed rigidity phenomenon. The investigation of this rigidity phenomenon has since led to new connections between von Neumann algebras and other areas of mathematics. Furthering the development of rigidity will in turn lead to new insights and connections among these various fields.<br/><br/>Developing alongside the theory of von Neumann algebras has been ergodic theory, and many results in one field has had major applications in the other. A reemergence of this collaboration has occurred in the last ten years with Popa's discovery of deformation/rigidity theory, which juxtaposes deformability properties such as Haagerup's property, free products, or unbounded cocycles, with rigidity properties such as property (T) or spectral gap, allowing one to discover hidden structure in a von Neumann algebra in the case when both types of phenomena occur. This project will investigate more fully these connections, focusing specifically on connections to the deep rigidity theory for ergodic actions of lattices in higher rank groups initiated by Mostow, Margulis, Zimmer, and many others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the context of the Mathematics Department, and more precisely, this Research Training Group project, the Principal Investigators (who have a broad expertise in Geometry and its connections with Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Topology, and Algebraic Number Theory) together with other faculty members, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students intend to focus on building communities which will impact, at all stages of the academic pipeline, the number and readiness of people entering the U.S. mathematical workforce (both academic and industrial), and bolstering in particular the representation of women and underrepresented minorities in the mathematical sciences. Moreover, structures put in place will see a vertical community of women mathematicians, a vertical community of mathematicians from low-income households and underrepresented minority groups, a community of young scholars who will pursue research careers in industry,  and a horizontal community of strong junior and senior math majors.<br/><br/>The RTG Senior Faculty will use their research expertise and previous experience to mentor research of junior mathematicians centered on Geometry. Reflecting the strongly collaborative relationship of the team, contributions will come from perspectives not only within but also across the disciplines of Analysis and PDE, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Topology, Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Number Theory. To that end, vertical integration of postdocs and students will allow collaborative research projects, and this will be aided by developing an expository writing seminar in the mathematical sciences for freshmen as an alternative entry point into mathematical thinking, as well as organize conferences of RTG programs to share ideas, the highlights of which will be stored in a public written record. The log-cabin conferences and undergraduate conferences will give participants the opportunity to disseminate their research and grow collaborative networks.

Hilbert's 20th problem was about existence of generalized solutions of partial differential equations and variational problems. This was a crucial question since the theory was at a dead end: the classical notion of a differentiable function was not sufficient for further development. This led to one of the greatest discoveries of mathematics of 20th century: the theory of Sobolev spaces. Without Sobolev spaces, further development (both theoretical and practical) of nonlinear partial differential equations would not be possible. Recent decades showed however, that the scope of applications of Sobolev spaces goes far beyond the theory of partial differential equations; the theory applies to differential geometry, geometric group theory, algebraic topology, sub-Riemannian geometry, and analysis on metric spaces, just to name a few. This is a very active area of contemporary mathematics with many unsolved problems and new emerging areas of research. This research project concerns analytic, geometric, and topological properties of Sobolev functions and mappings as well as other related classes of mappings that have low differentiability regularity. The focus of the principal investigator is on finding new bridges between seemingly unrelated aspects of the fields of analysis, geometry, and topology. Graduate students and young researchers will be trained through research involvement in the project.<br/><br/>In more detail, the principal investigator plans to explore the following topics. (1) Approximation of convex functions (which have second order distributional derivatives being Radon measures and thus low regularity from the differentiable viewpoint). (2) General theory of Sobolev extension domains. (3) Existence of translation-invariant operators (a question that does not deal with weakly differentiable functions). (4) Continuity of Orlicz-Sobolev mappings of finite distortion. (5) Regularity of Sobolev isometric immersions. (6) Sign of the Jacobian of a Sobolev homeomorphism. (7) Topologically nontrivial Kaufman-type counterexamples to the Sard theorem (while the Sard theorem deals with sufficiently smooth mappings, the principal investigator will investigate the case of mappings with low regularity). (8) Sobolev spaces on metric spaces. (9) Implicit function theorem for Lipschitz mappings into metric spaces. (10) Lipschitz homotopy groups of the Heisenberg groups. (11) Whitney extension theorem for contact mappings into the Heisenberg group. (12) Calculus of differential forms and Hölder continuous mappings with applications to the Heisenberg groups. (13) Preparation of a monograph about the Heisenberg groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second main object of this investigation are ""graphs"". In computer science they are used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices. An embedding of graphs, or more generally metric spaces, which may represent a large data set, into a Banach space, is necessary to be able to store this data set efficiently. Secondly it is necessary to provide the Banach space with the right coordinate system, it is therefore also necessary to be able to embed a Banach space, into a Banach space admitting the appropriate coordinate system. The problems that will be studied in this project revolve around the issue of embedding less structured mathematical objects like graphs or, more generally, metric spaces, into better structured objects like Banach spaces. On one hand the goal is to obtain information about the structure of the graph, from the property that it embeds in certain Banach spaces, and on the other hand deduce geometric properties of a Banach space, from the property that certain graphs embed or do not embed in it.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will investigate possible extensions of Ribe's Program on metric characterizations of local properties of Banach spaces to characterizing asymptotic properties. An important question for example is the question whether or not the property of a Banach space to be reflexive can be metrically characterized. Other important properties to be considered are uniform asymptotic convexity and uniform asymptotic smoothness. The principal investigator will also study the problem of isomorphically embedding Banach spaces, having a certain property, into Banach spaces with a coordinates system like a Schauder basis or an unconditional basis. Finally the principal investigator will continue the study of closed sub-ideals of the spaces of operators on specific Banach spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Roughly speaking, a dynamical system is a rule which predicts the motions of a point in a geometric space; examples of mathematical models of dynamical systems include the study of fluid dynamics, airflow dynamics, billiard trajectories, etc.  As a concrete example, consider a polygonal billiard table, e.g., an L-shaped billiard table; and to simplify the situation, let us assume that the table has no friction and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.  Behavior of billiard trajectories have long been fascinating to mathematicians and physicists--note that different trajectories can have different behaviors, e.g., some trajectories are periodic and some trajectories are dense (they make a visit near every point in the table). For instance, one can ask whether a billiard table has any periodic trajectories, or more quantitatively, one can ask how many periodic trajectories of a certain length exist?  Surprisingly, questions of this kind have proven to be notoriously difficult to answer and are connected to several areas of modern mathematics. It turns out that even to understand billiard trajectories on one single table one is led to the study of families of billiard tables which have same combinatorics, e.g., same number of edges for the table. These families turn out to have new symmetries and enjoy certain rigidity properties which help to unravel the original problem. This project studies questions with similar philosophical point of view.<br/><br/>The project seeks extensions and extensions of certain rigidity results where a rather weak initial data about an object yields an almost complete classification of the object; the goal is to provide a more quantitative account of these rigidity results with applications in mind. The following will be the main objectives: (i) Dynamical systems have become a major player in several unexpected areas in modern mathematics. Proofs relying on dynamical arguments, however, are usually existential and not constructive. For various applications, quantitative and effective accounts of dynamical arguments are much sought after and challenging. (ii) Discrete subgroups of Lie groups with finite covolume are central objects in mathematics and have been extensively studied.  In some natural settings -- e.g., Kleinian groups, several monodromy groups, Apollonian circle packings, and Zaremba's conjecture -- however, one needs to consider Zariski dense, discrete subgroups (and semigroups) of semisimple Lie groups with infinite covolume.  These investigations often lead to the study of group actions on infinite volume spaces.  (iii) The moduli space of a compact Riemann surface is one of the hubs of modern mathematics. Despite the very inhomogeneous nature of the moduli space, there are several similarities between this space and homogeneous spaces. Dynamics on moduli spaces presents a very exciting avenue for research with many outstanding and challenging problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Group actions arise naturally in many areas of mathematics.

One of such classes are actions on smooth manifolds by higher-rank commutative groups or by lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups. These actions are often expected to have rigidity, a phenomenon characterized by the scarcity of invariant structures under the action.  Another proposed line of research is the study of some special cases of the Mobius disjointness conjecture.

Hermitian symmetric spaces studied in the project play a fundamental role in mathematical physics. For instance, the classical domain of type IV is biholomorphically equivalent to the future tube.

Particular mathematical tools that have proved extremely useful in addressing questions of these types and providing a framework to analyze these simple building blocks lie within the realm of harmonic analysis.

Currently, there are two active areas of investigation of operator algebras---von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras. The project involves investigations into the classification of C*-algebras. Here a classification of a collection of complicated objects provides a simpler way to identify and distinguish between objects in the more complicated class. The classification theory for von Neumann algebras is relatively well developed. The classification was obtained by Connes (and others) in the 1970s. While on the C*-algebra side, it was only in the 1990s that one began to see rapid developments in classification theory. Since then, the classification of C*-algebras has blossomed into one of the central areas in the study of C*-algebras, and tremendous progress has been made in the last few years. The research in this project is to push the classification theory even further, and to seek more applications or interactions of the classification theory with other areas of mathematics, in particular with the study of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>Compared to the classification of unital C*-algebras, the classification of non-unital C*-algebras is far from complete. The principal investigator plans to use the strategy and techniques from the classification of unital simple C*-algebras to push forward the classification program for non-unital simple C*-algebras. In particular, this involves showing that an abstract non-unital C*-algebra can be tracially approximated by certain concrete type I C*-algebras (the reduction theorem), developing a classification theory for this semi-concrete class of C*-algebras, and then studying how these might be put to work together to obtain a full classification for abstract non-unital C*-algebras. The other purpose of the proposed research program is to continue the investigation on the interplay between the classification program and study of dynamical systems. In particular, the principal investigator would like to continue the study on whether the zero mean topological dimension of the dynamical system (for an action of the group of integers, or of a more general amenable group) would be equivalent to the regularity property of the crossed product C*-algebras. The principal investigator also would like to investigate possible impacts of the recent classification results on the study of the underlying dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many applications. In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the flow of air past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering (for instance: signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for instance: image processing and quantum computation). Moreover, complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. The primary aim of the efforts of the PI is to further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. <br/><br/>The PI will advance the understanding of the behavior of holomorphic maps between bounded domains in higher dimensional complex Euclidean space. In the field of several complex variables, there have been many deep investigations into when holomorphic maps extend continuously to the boundary, the behavior of iterations of holomorphic maps, and the properties of the biholomorphism group of a bounded domain. The standard approach to studying these problems uses methods from partial differential equations and differential geometry. The PI will study these problems using techniques from the theory of non-positively curved metric spaces. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory, where metric space techniques applied to group theory have lead to many important results. By using metric spaces techniques in several complex variables, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This part of the activity will enhance knowledge about the biholomorphism group of complex manifolds, connections between the boundary of a domain and its complex geometry, the iterations of holomorphic maps, continuous extensions of holomorphic maps, realizations of Hermitian symmetric spaces, and the complex geometry of certain smooth quasi-projective algebraic varieties."

The work funded in this project will take this challenge literally and study classical operations from calculus and introduce an order dependence for space, time and all the operations performed in space and time. A particular range of applications of the theoretical work will gain new insights in quantum information theory. Quantum information theory modifies Shannon's theory of sending reliable information through noisy channels to quantum devices in the hope of taking advantage of ""teleportation"" or other non-traditional ""spooky behaviour.""<br/><br/>More concretely, the proposed work aims to study the connection between noncommutative geometry and noncommutative harmonic analysis. The goal is to adapt some terminology from noncommutative geometry, for example curvature, and show that it an be used for estimates involving Laplace and Dirac operators on noncommutative spaces. The work in quantum information theory will develop inequalities for entropy related expressions and apply them to notions of capacity, asymmetry and time to equilibrium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fourier transform decomposes a function of time into different frequency components, similarly to how a music chord can be expressed as the pitches of its constituent notes. Harmonic analysis studies how the time information and the frequency information interact with each other. A fundamental question (i.e. Fourier restriction problem) that has been studied for decades is how the geometry of the frequency support of the Fourier transform dictates the size of the original function in time. Various quantifications of such relations are referred to as Fourier restriction estimates and turn out to be extremely challenging to study. Even for the simplest geometric objects such as spheres and paraboloids, many questions are still wide open. Restriction estimates are interesting also due to their connection with many other problems, within or outside analysis. It is well known that restriction estimates can be applied to study the Kakeya conjecture (on the minimum area of a set containing a unit line segment in each direction), the existence and growth of solutions to Schrödinger and wave equations, and the number of solutions to Diophantine equations in number theory.<br/><br/>This project studies several problems related to Fourier restriction estimates. First, the principal investigator intends to further the investigation of the Fourier restriction conjecture for the paraboloid and the cone via the polynomial method. This method explores the algebraic structure of the time-frequency decomposition of the function, and has shown to be extremely powerful in obtaining many state-of-the-art results in the theory. Second, the principal investigator proposes to continue the study of weighted restriction estimates (i.e. when the Lebesgue measure is replaced with a fractal measure) and apply them to estimate divergence sets of the Schrödinger or wave equations and to distance set problems (on how the size of a set dictates the size of its distance set). The major difficulty in this direction is the lack of a crucial tool (orthogonality) caused by the presence of the fractal measure. Here an interesting approach will attack the distance set problems directly by studying the behavior of the fractal measure. Last, the principal investigator wants to explore the role in restriction theory of a recently developed tool called sparse domination. This method, arising from singular integral theory, is a way to reduce the study of the original continuous, spread out operator to that of a class of much simpler dyadic, positive, local operators. This method has shown to be extremely useful in singular integral theory and has become a modern view of point in describing operators. The principal investigator plans to further the study of sparse bounds of operators related to restriction estimates and with a Kakeya nature, such as the Bochner-Riesz multipliers, singular integrals along manifolds, directional maximal operators, and multi-parameter singular integral operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harmonic analysis provides tools for answering these questions through decomposing a function in a convenient way, analyzing the components, and then reassembling the information about the components to provide an overall understanding. This project investigates and further develops a new, surprisingly powerful approach in harmonic analysis known as sparse domination principles. In broad terms, sparse domination gives a way of studying general functions by comparing them to positive, localized, easy-to-understand versions, thereby obtaining results of the same strength and sharpness as with much more involved techniques. One of the main advantages of this new approach is its versatility: it can be employed not only in the classical setting, but also, after a potential redefinition of the objects involved, in a variety of more general scenarios. This project intends to explore the full strength and versatility of sparse domination techniques.<br/><br/>The project comprises three research directions aimed at a deeper analysis of the concept of sparse bounds.  One direction concerns matrix weighted estimates on vector-valued function spaces, an area that has enjoyed renewed interest, partially due to its connections to elliptic partial differential equations. Some recent sparse domination results, which reinterpret the traditional definition of function averages, suggest that progress on resolving the so-called A2 conjecture may be within reach. The principal investigator plans to continue research into the matrix A2 conjecture, seeking both further evidence in support of the result and potential counterexamples. A second direction, the theory of discrete operators, relates analytic number theory and harmonic analysis. Until recently, no weighted bounds had been established in the discrete setting, but the use of sparse domination has yielded new results and problems, such as the question of weighted estimates for the discrete oscillatory Hilbert transform with a general polynomial phase and the problem of weighted bounds for discrete fractional singular integrals. The principal investigator intends to study such functions with the goal of providing a broader weighted theory for arithmetic operators. A third direction concerns a different interpretation of sparse collections, previously considered only with respect to cubes. The principal investigator is interested in developing methods with cubes replaced by rectangles to answer questions regarding Bochner-Riesz operators and boundedness results involving averages associated to the Kakeya maximal function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People have been fascinated with the symmetry phenomenon since ancient times and the examples can easily be found in visual arts, in particular architecture, poetry and music. Typically, the symmetry in these examples is either mirror, i.e., the objects are doubled across a flat surface, or translational when a pattern is repeated in space or time intervals of the same size. Nature is also abundant with symmetries. The most widely recognized examples are lightning, fern, and cauliflower or broccoli. The symmetry here is of a different type, namely it is self-similarity, and objects that possess such symmetries are called fractals. Fractals are roughly the same on different scales, i.e., parts of a fractal look like smaller copies of the whole fractal. This project studies geometric spaces that possess the above symmetries and generalizations of such symmetries, e.g., quasi-self-similarities. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project investigates dynamical properties and curvature distribution of fractal spaces that support dynamical systems. Here dynamics typically refers to the iteration of a map or a system of maps on a given fractal. More precisely, the PI plans to classify fractal spaces from various families according to their quasisymmetry groups, quasiregular dynamics that they support, or the asymptotics of the curvature distribution function of the packings associated to such fractals. The project concerns mainly fractals that are the Julia sets of postcritically finite rational maps or residual sets of various self-similar constructions, such as Apollonian gaskets. The methods to be employed come from dynamics of groups and rational maps, and from complex analysis as well as its more recent counterparts. For example, recent developments have shown that many fractal spaces can be effectively studied using combinatorial tools and techniques of analysis on metric spaces. Moreover, geometry of dynamical fractals influences certain analytic properties of packings associated to such fractals. E.g., the asymptotics of the curvature distribution function of various dynamical packings is related to the fractal dimension of the corresponding residual sets. It is the hope of the PI that the project would add new methods and ideas that, in particular, would shed more light onto the relationship of these fields, namely geometry, dynamics, and curvature distribution of associated packings. Complex analysis has often provided tools and methods for solving problems that come from natural sciences, engineering, and other fields of mathematics. Recent examples related to physics include the investigation of the conformal invariance of continuum limits of two-dimensional lattice models in statistical physics and applications to quantum gravity. The PI expects that his investigations would reveal additional geometric and other properties of fractals that arise, in particular, in natural sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consider a ball on a frictionless table. If the ball is set in motion, it will travel forever, making perfectly elastic collisions with the walls. If the table is a square or an equilateral triangle, there are only two possible behaviors: either the ball repeats the same periodic path forever, or it travels completely randomly in the entire polygon, eventually visiting every part of the table. This project is directed toward the basic mathematical problem of understanding the behavior of a ball when the table is a more general polygon. This is a basic problem arising in physics and statistical mechanics. The PI and his collaborators will also study other systems with similar behaviour. <br/><br/>The project concerns the study of measure rigidity for actions of non-abelian groups, in the general context of smooth ergodic theory. Measure rigidity is traditionally studied in the context of homogeneous dynamics. Some spectacular results, such as Ratner's theorem and other advances in this direction are at the heart of the subject and its many applications. In recent work with M. Mirzakhani and in part with A. Mohammadi, the PI was able to prove dynamical rigidity results similar to Ratner's theorem in the context of Teichmueller dynamics, which is a non-homogeneous setting (and is not conjecturally conjugate to a homogenous action). In joint work with E. Lindenstrauss, these ideas were used in the homogeneous dynamics setting to prove an improved version of the celebrated Benoist-Quint theorem. In this project, the PI intends to go beyond Teichmueller and homogeneous dynamics and prove similar rigidity theorems in the much more general setting of smooth dynamics. It is expected that the results will be applied to some explicit examples, without the need for perturbation. This should have some applications outside the field, for examples, to geometry and number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The educational component of this project focuses on supporting junior researchers, with the particular emphasis placed on encouraging female mathematicians. The principal investigator will organize two workshops for junior researchers, featuring research discussions during allocated time, and short lecture courses by leading experts in the field.

It describes how various abstract and real-life systems evolve over time, and so it has a wide range of applicability. This project is focused on systems that exhibit hyperbolic behavior, that is, exponential expansion in some directions and exponential contraction in other directions. The expansion and contraction produce a rich and complex behavior of the system, often described as chaotic, with individual trajectories highly sensitive to small changes in the initial conditions. Nonetheless, if a system is hyperbolic in a strong sense it is stable as a whole, that is, qualitatively similar to any small perturbation. Cocycles are a fundamental tool in the study of dynamical systems. For systems given by differentiable functions, the derivative and related objects are the prime examples of cocycles. Another important class of examples is given by random sequences of matrices or maps. Cocycles are useful in studying when two dynamical systems are similar and to what extent and, in particular, when a system is similar to a perturbation or to a standard model.<br/><br/>Cocycles appear naturally in dynamics and, more generally, in group actions. The principal investigator will study cocycles over hyperbolic, partially hyperbolic, and non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. The research will be focused on cocycles with values in non-commutative non-compact groups, such as the general linear group, groups of linear operators on Hilbert and Banach spaces, groups of diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds, and groups of isometries of spaces of non-positive curvature and their generalizations. The principal investigator will investigate cohomology of cocycles, regularity of a conjugacy between two cocycles, and existence of conjugacy to simpler cocycles. The principal investigator will also work on related problems of estimating growth of a cocycle and its Lyapunov exponents, with a focus on using the periodic data. These questions are motivated in part by problems in smooth dynamics and rigidity of systems and actions exhibiting some hyperbolicity. The principal investigator will use the results on cohomology of cocycles and on non-stationary normal forms to advance the development of this area.

Conversely, the C*-algebras associated to directed graphs have proved to be key examples which have enhanced our understanding of the class of C*-algebras as a whole.

In the 1960s, researchers at Princeton's Plasma Physics Laboratory demonstrated that this equation exhibits a wealth of novel features, which have sparked the interest of mathematicians and physicists alike.  However, despite all the attention it has received over the years, existence of solutions under minimal assumptions has been proved only recently by the PI and her collaborators.  One ingredient in their work is the recent discovery of new conservation laws.  This project outlines several additional problems that can now be attacked using this discovery.  Another major impetus behind this project is to prove that complicated transient dynamics resolve into simple dynamics in the distant future.  The physical significance of this phenomenon relies on its stability under perturbations.  While in the past, the PI has investigated deterministic perturbations to the equations, the current project takes this theme in a new direction by considering stability in the presence of (random) noise.  <br/><br/>The project focuses on several problems that lie at the intersection of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations, completely integrable systems, and stochastic partial differential equations.  The PI's discovery of new microscopic conservation laws for KdV has opened the door to treating three seemingly unrelated problems of long-standing interest regarding KdV on the line: optimal regularity well-posedness, symplectic non-squeezing, and invariance of white noise.  In addition, the PI is proposing a coherent plan for establishing invariance of the Gibbs measure for the Landau-Lifshitz model and invariance of white noise for the focusing cubic Nonlinear Schr\""odinger Equation (NLS).  This program involves establishing the analogous statements for the physical atomic models associated with these problems (which the PI has successfully completed) and then taking the continuum limit for the corresponding rough data.  This should reveal the physical renormalizations for the Landau-Lifshitz and the cubic NLS models that would ensure well-posedness for such data.  As the Gibbs measure for the Landau-Lifshitz model corresponds to Brownian motion on the sphere, this problem is also interesting from a purely probabilistic point of view as yielding a Hamiltonian measure-preserving flow on such paths.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the main objects of investigation is a random matrix, a large rectangular array of random data. The PI strives to understand the properties of such arrays which hold with high probability and the dependence of those properties on the nature of random entries and the structure of the matrix. This study will have potential applications beyond the realm of pure mathematics, as random matrices are used in statistics, computer algorithms, and wireless communication. The PI plans to put a special emphasis on the study of sparse matrices as these matrices naturally appear in  signal reconstruction and big data analysis. Another direction of the proposed research is the study of random graphs, which are random networks of nodes connected by roads (edges). Besides representing real transportation networks, graphs can be used to model interaction of atoms in a material, internet communities, etc.<br/><br/>The main direction of this research is the non-asymptotic theory of random matrices, a new and rapidly developing area of research analyzing spectral characteristics of a random matrix of a large but fixed size and striving to obtain bounds valid with high probability. The PI intends to study singular values, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of different ensembles of random matrices of a large size. The results obtained in this direction would have important applications within the random matrix theory in proving limit laws for the spectral characteristics of random matrices. They would be also useful in computer science, as the singular values control the rate of convergence of many numerical algorithms. Another part of the proposed research will address the problems arising in geometry of random graphs This direction is strongly related to random matrix theory as well. The PI will study delocalization and nodal domains of eigenvectors a random graph.

The purpose of this project is to improve the mathematical and scientific understanding of those equations via A) concrete research projects aimed at studying the long-time behavior of solutions to such equations, and B) an educational component aimed at introducing such problems to a new and diverse generation of mathematicians. The main focus is on the study of the so-called ""non-equilibrium behavior"" of nonlinear dispersive equations. Such a behavior is exhibited in many physically important phenomena, like turbulence in ocean waves or in the transmission of optical signals, to mention only a couple. While this turbulence is easy to observe and has very strong manifestations in nature, its scientific understanding is rather poor and the mathematical justification of the involved phenomena based on the model equations is rather difficult and is mostly still open. This project is aimed at rigorously proving turbulence phenomenon for certain nonlinear dispersive models.<br/><br/>The most important feature of the long-time behavior of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations (PDE) on compact domains is out-of-equilibrium behavior or long-time instability. This means that solutions do not exhibit long-time stability near equilibriums solutions or configurations. Such questions can be addressed from a dynamical systems perspective and from a statistical physics perspective, in what is often called in the physics literature as ""wave turbulence theory"". The proposed projects address this broad problematic from both perspectives. In terms of dynamics, the aim is to construct solutions exhibiting the so-called ""energy cascade"" phenomenon, in which the energy of a dispersive system moves its concentration zone between characteristically different length scales. On the statistical physics perspective, projects aimed at justifying the fundamental equations of wave turbulence are proposed. These are effective equations for the dynamics that are derived in the physics literature from heuristic considerations, and have very important implications on the long-time behavior of dispersive PDE, provided they are rigorously justified. The project also includes an educational component aimed at raising the interest of a younger generation of researchers in those fundamental problems through workshops, seminars, REU projects, etc."

(3) Can the solution be computed, either by hand or on a computer? The purpose of this project is to investigate a question that is not asked quite as often: (4) what does the solution actually look like? If we are heating a room with, say, four candles and a radiator, which spot is going to be the coldest?

The main types of applications will be (4) the analysis of spectral methods on graphs and (5) localization phenomena in mathematical physics. The main tools will be basic facts from geometry analysis to reinterpret analytic estimates geometrically and vice versa, the interpretation of elliptic equations as fixed points in time of an associated parabolic equation (as well as associated techniques from parabolic equations) and various aspects of spectral theory.

There are many systems that exhibit this behavior. The values of the temperature throughout an object, the concentration of some chemical, or the population density in migration are some examples of quantities that show diffusive behavior. In mathematical analysis, the prime example of a diffusive equation is the heat equation, or the more general family of parabolic partial differential equations. The purpose of this research project is to study non-standard diffusion. The project explores regularization effects in nonlinear equations that are outside the classical framework of parabolic equations. The research studies non-local equations, where the evolution of the value at any point depends on the global picture, and applies those methods in equations from statistical mechanics modeling the density of particles in a dilute gas. The project also studies conservation law equations, a fundamental class of partial differential equation, and aims to explicate regularization properties there as well. The project will involve graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the research.  Results will be disseminated through publications, conferences, and summer schools.<br/><br/>The study of non-local equations, and more precisely integro-differential equations, is a very active area of research. Recent work indicates that some of the ideas and methods developed in that area can be used to obtain regularity estimates for the Boltzmann equation from statistical mechanics. This research project aims at proving that if the solution of the Boltzmann equation ever develops a singularity, then some hydrodynamic quantity must be unbounded. These hydrodynamic quantities are the mass, energy, and entropy density, which correspond to physically meaningful properties of the fluid. Thus, the project aims to establish that if there is a singularity in the mesoscopic description of the fluid given by the Boltzmann equation, it must be apparent macroscopically. The Boltzmann equation can be rewritten as a parabolic integro-differential equation, and the restriction on its hydrodynamic quantities determines the non-degeneracy of the corresponding kernel. This connection between integro-differential equations and the Boltzmann equation is also useful as a guide for further development of the former subject. The study of regularization mechanisms using methods from parabolic equations applied to conservation law equations is arguably even more surprising. In scalar conservation laws, the solution is transported following a velocity that depends on the value at every point. Shock singularities are unavoidable for smooth initial data; however, the same shock mechanism forces some self-organization that translates into a regularization effect when starting from very rough initial data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another example is from statistical physics, where one would like to understand the statistics of the solutions of random polynomial equations (often of very large degree), in particular it is of special interest to estimate and determine the typical locations of the solutions that are real.

Nine years later, Ferdinand von Lindemann use Hermite's method to resolve the old problem that the number pi is transcendental. Hermite's tool was something we now call the Hermite-Padé approximant. His doctoral student Henri Padé studied a special case, a type of rational function that is now called the Padé approximant. These have turned out be a useful tool in problems as varied as scattering physics, numerical solution of differential equations, and rational approximation. Indeed, calculators still use rational approximations related to Padé approximants for calculating special functions. There are a great many unsolved problems about convergence of sequences of Padé approximants. One of the project goals  is to resolve some of these problems. Orthogonal polynomials turn out to be the denominator polynomials in certain Padé approximants, but are an even more important topic in their own right. They have applications in areas ranging from statistics to mathematical physics. <br/><br/>The specific goals of the project include investigating the notion of 'exact interpolation' for sequences of multipoint Padé approximants. The PI recently proved that when there is exact interpolation, namely no extra interpolation points, then subsequences or full sequences of Padé approximants converge uniformly in compact sets. The PI intends to establish explicit conditions for exact interpolation. On orthogonal polynomials, the PI recently discovered that universality limits for random matrices  can be turned into pointwise asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials at the endpoints of the interval of orthogonality. The PI intends to explore this in the bulk.

Concrete versions of this decomposition/filtering/reconstruction process, sometimes referred to as the ""time-frequency"" method, are performed in a broad range of real-world applications, such as audio or image compression, image pattern or facial recognition, data assimilation, compressed sensing and many others. A similar procedure is employed in tomographic imaging, where the shape of a solid body is reconstructed by means of sampling the body's density along penetrating waves, which can be mathematically described as lines in three dimensional space.  The first main component of this mathematics research project deals with toy mathematical models of sampling three and higher dimensional objects (for instance, solid bodies) along lower dimensional sets such as lines or planes. The second, deeply related component of this project is concerned with extending the time-frequency decomposition method to suitable vector-valued signals.

The non-commutativity which is a key feature of Quantum Mechanics, is an important aspect of operator algebras.  Vaughan Jones's subfactor theory is built on this non-commutative framework. Conformal field theory (CFT) is a theory describing critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, and it also plays an important role in string theory.

On the one hand, the PI will investigate the behavior of waves in space, as they interact nonlinearly with themselves and matter over large space-time scales. The ultimate goal is to explain how the  energy, which is stored in a wave undergoing a nonlinear dynamical evolution, ultimately  splits  into  quantized pieces and a wave ""at the horizon"". The latter refers to energy, possibly of large size, which  is infinitely spread out and does not interact with anything in a noticeable fashion. In contrast with this macroscopic behavior, the project also aims at understanding the behavior of waves on the microscopic scale, such as in crystals or quasi-crystals. The goal is to explain  transitions from an insulating state to that of a conductor, which these materials may exhibit as they undergo changes on the molecular level. Such changes may occur  through the insertion of impurities, or changes in the environment. Both the macroscopic as well as the microscopic behavior of waves is of crucial importance to science and engineering, and profoundly affects our daily modern lives. Modern communication relies on waves transmitted over large distances both in space but also along glass fiber cables. For the latter the properties of the material are crucial and both nonlinear effects as well as aforementioned microscopic phenomena decide the suitability  of the underlying medium. <br/><br/>More technically speaking, the PI intends to further investigate the rigorous mathematical theory of focusing dispersive semilinear evolution equations. A major open problem is to analyze  the resolution of any solution into moving solitons and radiation. Some success has been achieved in recent years on this important problem, but for nonintegrable equations we are far from a satisfactory understanding. The PI is currently involved in the study of this problem in the dissipative setting in which some damping is added to the equation. The Hamiltonian setting appears to be very difficult at the moment, especially in the subcritical regime. The methods involved derive from dynamical systems, invariant manifold theory, and dispersive PDEs. The quantum mechanical problems alluded in the previous paragraph belong to the area of Anderson localization. Together with his long-standing collaborator Michael Goldstein at Toronto, but also with young collaborators which are joining the field, the PI intends to bring the body of techniques which were developed over the past 20 years  based on large deviation estimates, the avalanche principle, semi-algebraic sets, and harmonic analysis such as (pluri)subharmonic functions and the Cartan estimate, to bear on both linear and nonlinear problems in dynamical systems and spectral theory.

In other words, can one ""see"" what is inside by making measurements on the outside?  An example are CT scans, a commonly used medical imaging technique. One measures the response of the body to X-rays and makes an image of what is inside from this information. The principal investigator will investigate ultrasound transmission and reflection tomography which uses high frequency sound waves instead of X-rays.  Also several inverse problems in cosmology will be considered. The main questions is whether one can determine the structure of the Universe billions of years ago from measurements made near the Earth.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will address the mathematical theory of several fundamental inverse problems arising in many areas of science and technology including medical imaging, geophysics, cosmology, and nondestructive testing. Three major topics of research will be investigated. The first one is Travel Time Tomography in anisotropic media. In mathematical terms this involves the determination of a Riemannian metric  or Finsler metric (anisotropic sound speed) in the interior of a domain from the lengths of geodesics joining points of the boundary (travel times) and from other kinematic information. The second is inverse problems for non-linear equations arising in many applications including general relativity, elasticity, fluids etc. The main idea is to use the nonlinear interaction of waves to produce new waves that will help solve the inverse problems. The third is Electric Impedance Tomography (EIT), also called Calderon's problem. In this inverse method one attempts to determine the conductivity of a medium by making voltage and current measurements at the boundary. In the project the quasilinear case will be considered as well as an analog problem for the fractional Laplacian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here, he was referring to hydrodynamic turbulence, which is the phenomenon one observes on numerous occasions in daily life, particularly when one travels through fluids either in watercraft on the ocean or in airplanes in the atmosphere. Despite its intuitive manifestations, the scientific understanding of turbulence is far from satisfactory. A related phenomenon is ""wave turbulence,"" which pertains to similar problems but for different physical systems involving wave interactions (e.g.,ocean or plasma waves). The aim of this project is to gain a better understanding of certain phenomena pertaining to wave turbulence from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint and thereby to take the first steps towards putting the theory on solid mathematical foundations.<br/><br/>The project addresses two different regimes of long-time behavior for nonlinear dispersive and wave partial differential equations. The first regime can be characterized by ""out-of-equilibrium dynamics,"" in which solutions do not exhibit long-time stability around equilibrium configurations. This is the typical behavior of nonlinear dispersive equations posed on compact domains, where dispersive effects do not translate to decay, and is the natural setting of wave turbulence theory. The other regime of long-time behavior concerns dispersive partial differential equations posed on Euclidean space, for which one can hope to have stable equilibrium points for the dynamics (stationary solutions). The ""asymptotic stability"" of trivial equilibria (zero solutions) is mostly well understood by now, but that of nontrivial stationary solutions is far from settled. The project suggests several avenues of research to improve our understanding in the two aforementioned directions."

The analysis of the equations governing physical  processes often requires a precise quantitative understanding of the relative sizes of various quantities involved in these processes, and this is provided by mathematical inequalities. An example familiar to the general public can be paraphrased as saying that ``entropy never decreases'' in physical processes;  the inequality in question says that the entropy at a later time is at least as large as the entropy at an earlier time. For more specific physical systems one can say much more, and the search for a better understanding of physical processes, and the evolution equations that govern them,  is in part a quest for new and more precise mathematical inequalities governing these processes. <br/><br/>The connection between mathematical inequalities and physical processes runs both ways, so that in trying to prove  such an inequality, one may try to relate it to a simple and well understood evolution equation.

The first direction involves the mathematical study of waves such as water waves or sound waves. Both physical experiments and numerical simulations exhibit the phenomenon of turbulence: fluids that are initially very smoothly-flowing and slowly-varying can develop much more complicated eddies and fine-scale behavior.  It remains unknown whether the equations that model fluid dynamics can give rise to ""blow-up,"" in which some portion of the simulated fluid achieves infinite velocity. This project studies the extent to which blow-up can be ""engineered"" by tweaking the equations that model fluid mechanics, such as changing the number of dimensions in space. The second direction involves questions related to the notorious twin prime conjecture in number theory. This conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that are separated by a distance of two, such as 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and 19, and so on.  It is still not known whether the assertion is true, but recently much progress has been made on understanding more tractable questions, such as how often it occurs that a pair of numbers, separated by a distance of two, both have an odd number of prime factors. This project aims to develop these promising new techniques further, with potential application to proving or disproving the twin primes conjecture and to other difficult, important questions in number theory. <br/><br/>In more detail, the fluid dynamical part of the project focuses primarily on variants of the Euler equations for incompressible fluids, especially higher-dimensional Euler equations on Riemannian manifolds. The ability to select the metric of such a manifold gives a promising way to ""program"" the equations to exhibit certain desirable behavior. Prior work has established that the dynamics of certain quadratic ordinary differential equations can be programmed into such systems.  The project will continue work towards exhibiting finite-time blow-up (or other interesting behavior, such as Turing universality) for these models. For the number-theoretic aspects of the project, the investigator and collaborators aim to establish further cases of the Chowla conjecture (or its logarithmically-averaged variants) on correlations of the Liouville function, by combining the recently-developed entropy decrement method with techniques from analytic number theory, combinatorics, and ergodic theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An example of the resonance phenomenon is the sound we hear after striking a bell: it has a frequency of oscillation (the tone) and a rate of decay (how soon we stop hearing the sound), which both depend on the shape of the bell. The frequency and the decay rate that we hear correspond to the real and imaginary part of the least-decaying resonance of the bell. Eigenvalues and resonances have innumerable applications in physics and engineering. A major goal of this project is to understand how the distribution of eigenvalues and resonances depends on the system (for example, how the shape of the bell determines how long it will sound); while this topic has seen recent progress, there remain many important open questions. The project includes research projects for graduate students and numerical experiments for undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The project employs microlocal analysis, which is the mathematical theory explaining the classical/quantum, or particle/wave, correspondence. For instance, the high-energy distribution of resonances in the simplest model of a bell is related to the classical dynamical system of billiard ball trajectories inside the bell: for bounded times, waves approximately propagate along billiard ball trajectories. However, for long times this approximation becomes worse and eventually breaks down. An especially interesting situation is when the classical system has chaotic behavior; the implications for eigenfunctions and resonances are studied in the field of quantum chaos. Part of the project is centered around the fractal uncertainty principle, which is a new tool beyond the classical/quantum correspondence, established through use of harmonic analysis, fractal geometry, and combinatorics. The fractal uncertainty principle has already seen several applications, including progress towards the conjecture that all strongly chaotic open systems have exponential wave decay. Another part of the project is the study of classical, or Pollicott-Ruelle, resonances, using microlocal methods -- a rare example of the reversal of the classical/quantum correspondence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerous practical everyday-life issues, as well as fundamental scientific mysteries, can be expressed in geometric terms. For instance, networks are ubiquitous in our modern society. From the World Wide Web and its powerful search engines to social networks, from telecommunication networks to economic systems, networks represent a wide range of real world systems. They can naturally be seen as geometric objects by considering the number of edges of the shortest path connecting two nodes as a quantity measuring their proximity. The study of physical laws has led as well to the development of a refined mathematical framework where elaborate geometric structures are able to depict and model the interactions of elementary particles and the symmetries underlying quantum physics. The notion of a metric space is a central concept that is pivotal in mathematical models of optimization problems in networks, and in a vast range of application areas, including computer vision, computational biology, machine learning, statistics, and mathematical psychology, to name a few. This extremely useful abstract concept generalizes the classical notion of an Euclidean space, where the distance from point A to point B is computed as the length of an imaginary straight line connecting them. The heart of the matter usually boils down to understanding whether a given metric space, in particular a graph equipped with its shortest path distance, can be faithfully represented in a more structured space, typically a Banach space with some desirable properties. Our ability to do so usually has tremendous applications.<br/><br/>The problems investigated in this project are motivated by their potential applications in theoretical physics and theoretical computer science. Most of the problems considered find their origins either in practical issues (e.g. the design of efficient approximation algorithms), or in fundamental mathematical problems in topology or noncommutative geometry (e.g. the Novikov conjecture(s), the Baum-Connes conjecture(s)). Embedding problems that arise in connection to these problems have been considered independently by several groups of mathematicians (Banach space geometers, geometric group theorists, computer scientists...). An underlined aspect of this proposal is to consider these embeddings problems from a unified and global standpoint. Fundamental and long-standing open problems in quantitative metric geometry (e.g. Enflo's problem, a metric reformulation of uniform smoothability, the coarse embeddability of groups and expander graphs into super-reflexive Banach spaces...) will be tackled from a different angle with new and innovative techniques. In particular, the project will develop a certain asymptotic theory of Banach spaces and explore its connections to the geometry of infinite graphs. The approach here to solve the local problems above, is to study asymptotic counterparts of the local properties involved, in order to gain new insights and to devise new approaches. This approach is motivated by the fact that the asymptotic setting usually provides a finer picture, is on some occasion better understood, and requires completely different techniques. A general outline of the research methodology of this project is to utilize powerful tools from surrounding fields (graph theory, probability theory, Ramsey theory...), and cross-over techniques (e.g. techniques from theoretical computer science to solve geometric group theoretic problems).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While basic aspects of wave propagation were understood about three hundred years ago, technology and science demand methods to analyze more and more sophisticated phenomena relating to waves. For example, information for the internet is passed along glass fiber cables in the form of light as well as  via satellites in space through electromagnetic waves.  Cell phone technology operates essentially the same way. The dramatic increase in speed in internet communication today as compared to the mid 1990s, for example, is due to a complete and radical change in the design of glass fiber cables. Instead of using the same material for hundreds or thousands of miles, the current design alternates between different materials thus allowing for subtle nonlinear effects to come into play. This revolutionary design is the result of interactions between engineers, applied mathematicians, and material scientists. Advanced mathematics very closely related to the subject matter of this project played a decisive role in the process. Mathematicians working in partial differential equations are cognizant of the importance of training students in the sciences in order to meet the high demands of industry and government. <br/><br/>This project aims at understanding the long-term dynamics of solutions to various systems of nonlinear partial differential equation of wave type. This typically means hyperbolic equations, but it can also refer to the Schroedinger equation. While much progress has been made on the defocusing case, where waves exist for all times and scatter to the vacuum state, focusing equations are much less studied. This type of equation can exhibit finite time blowup as well as small data scattering. The main goal is to determine whether or not global solutions scatter to a stationary solution also known as a soliton. The latter seems likely if basic invariances of the equations, such those given by dilation and translation symmetries, are excluded. This is precisely the case for Klein-Gordon equations in the radial setting."

Harmonic analysis provides tools for answering these questions through decomposing a function in a convenient way, analyzing the components, and then reassembling the information about the components to provide an overall understanding. This project investigates and further develops a new, surprisingly powerful approach in harmonic analysis known as sparse domination principles. In broad terms, sparse domination gives a way of studying general functions by comparing them to positive, localized, easy-to-understand versions, thereby obtaining results of the same strength and sharpness as with much more involved techniques. One of the main advantages of this new approach is its versatility: it can be employed not only in the classical setting, but also, after a potential redefinition of the objects involved, in a variety of more general scenarios. This project intends to explore the full strength and versatility of sparse domination techniques.<br/><br/>The project comprises three research directions aimed at a deeper analysis of the concept of sparse bounds.  One direction concerns matrix weighted estimates on vector-valued function spaces, an area that has enjoyed renewed interest, partially due to its connections to elliptic partial differential equations. Some recent sparse domination results, which reinterpret the traditional definition of function averages, suggest that progress on resolving the so-called A2 conjecture may be within reach. The principal investigator plans to continue research into the matrix A2 conjecture, seeking both further evidence in support of the result and potential counterexamples. A second direction, the theory of discrete operators, relates analytic number theory and harmonic analysis. Until recently, no weighted bounds had been established in the discrete setting, but the use of sparse domination has yielded new results and problems, such as the question of weighted estimates for the discrete oscillatory Hilbert transform with a general polynomial phase and the problem of weighted bounds for discrete fractional singular integrals. The principal investigator intends to study such functions with the goal of providing a broader weighted theory for arithmetic operators.

Many such chaotic systems have been proposed in both the mathematics and physics literature to model some real-life phenomena. For example, a deterministic system of interacting particles could model the microscopic motion of electrons. This research project studies such systems. The goal is to prove, in a mathematically rigorous way, that these systems on the long run behave as if they were random. Consequently, ideas from the theory of random processes can be applied to derive the emergence of statistical macroscopic order from microscopic disorder, that is when the system size or the time of observation is large and the initial state is typical. For the above-mentioned example, this approach provides a derivation of the heat equation from some microscopic deterministic models, which is a central question in the mathematical theory of statistical physics.<br/><br/>Specifically, three research projects will be studied. In the first one, some large system of deterministic interacting balls is considered. Motivated by the common separation of time scale phenomenon is physics, a so called rare interaction limit will be studied, that is when the system can be approximated by independent Sinai billiard particles between any pair interactions. The second project is about advanced statistical properties of hyperbolic systems in both finite and infinite measure case. For example, the local central limit theorem, as a very useful tool in many applications including project one, as well as its connections to infinite measure mixing will be studied for hyperbolic maps and flows. The third project studies stochastic systems of interacting particles. The problems to be studied include the emergence of local equilibrium for systems forced out of equilibrium and joint transport of mass and energy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A very challenging task is to sift through a large collection of data in order to find meaningful information. One would like to organize the data, or at least part of it, in such a way that it is easy to use. Imagine the data as being all images on the internet, and the ""organization"" that you seek is being able to map out which images are those of a specific person of your choosing, sub-ordered according to the activities in which he or she is engaged. Organizing large amounts of information in a useful way, or sorting through it and finding pieces you care about, are tasks that can be transformed, or related to, mathematical questions. This proposal attempts to address some of these questions. Basic questions are mathematical analogues of the following: What kind of structure can we hope to get after organizing the data? How much of the data can we expect to organize in a useful way? Do answers change if we are willing to ""lose"" some information in the process? Will we know the amount data lost? And, last but not least, can we, in a practical way, access the organized data or a significant part of it?<br/><br/>In many applications one is given a large data set represented as a subset of a metric space, such as R^d for large dimension d, and seeks to `faithfully' represent a `large' portion of this data set as a subset of R^k for dimension k much `smaller' than d. `Faithfully' here, means that one can still perform the same data mining tasks on the image of the data portion.  This task has thus far yielded much attention from computer scientists and applied mathematicians using a wide range of approaches. The framework of dimensionality reduction also includes data compression and data approximation. These have applications in many areas of science.  Geometric Measure Theory and Geometric Function Theory are tools whose use in this matter has not been fully exploited. A key point is that often the given data set has some additional geometric structure, for example small Hausdorff dimension (a discrete analogue), or being close to a union of low dimensional manifold. This allows one to use harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory.  The project aims at studying mathematical questions motivated by this. Basic questions to be discusses can be phrased as ""When is part of a metric measure space composed of Lipschitz images of `standard' pieces and how do we find these pieces?"" or ""When is a collection of points best described in a low-dimensional way?"". The tools to be used come from a combination of Harmonic Analysis and Geometric measure theory, which is usually referred to as quantitative rectifiability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They also appear in many areas of sciences and engineering such as economics, urban planning, meteorology, and geometric optics. For example, the Monge-Ampere type equations investigated in this project arise naturally in the optimal transportation problems (which consist of finding the least expensive way to transport a distribution of mass from one location to another) in economics and in traffic network planning in cities, in the design of reflector antennae in geometric optics and in the weather forecast models used in meteorology. The PDEs investigated in this project have two distinguished features: their key structural quantities could be possibly extremely small (degenerate) or extremely large (singular) and their settings frequently involve irregular geometries. Classical methods are usually inadequate in handling these equations and thus, their analysis calls for new methods, fresh perspectives and advancing knowledge in many fields of mathematics. The main goal of the project aims at providing deep insights into these problems, discovering novel methodologies to tackle them as well as revealing unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics. The results of this project will be widely disseminated via publications of research papers and lecture notes, via presentations at national and international venues, and via training of graduate students.<br/><br/>This project, in the field of analysis and partial differential equations (PDEs), focuses on regularity properties of solutions to the linearized Monge-Ampere (LMA) and degenerate Monge-Ampere equations and their applications in nonlinear PDEs arising from convex geometry, optimal transportation, and meteorology. The purpose of this project is to obtain fine and higher order regularity properties of some important classes of LMA and degenerate Monge-Ampere equations and apply them to several interesting problems in analysis, geometry, and PDEs. More specifically, the objectives of the project are to: (i) investigate higher order derivatives estimates for LMA equations with lower order terms having low regularity and their applications in the semigeostrophic equations as well as polar factorizations; (ii) study the sharp Sobolev estimates for the Monge-Ampere equation and its related maximal functions; (iii) settle a shape optimization problem concerning the minimum of the Monge-Ampere eigenvalue on convex domains subject to a volume constraint; and (iv) establish global regularity for degenerate Monge-Ampere equations on nonsmooth domains and the second boundary value problem for degenerate Monge-Ampere equations. The principal investigator and his collaborators have recently developed new methods and techniques including the Green function estimates, localization technique, iteration argument, sliding paraboloids method and geometry of the Monge-Ampere equation to solve some open problems related to these proposed problems.

Results and techniques in geometric function theory have recently found important applications in geometric group theory, structure of manifolds and analysis on fractals. Furthermore, besides their mathematical importance, physical applications of these theories include reconstruction theory, study of thin films, control theory, graphic imaging and analysis of large data sets.<br/><br/>This project features new approaches to three long-standing problems in the realm of geometric function theory that bring together several fields in analysis and geometry including geometric topology, sub-Riemannian geometry, PL geometry and geometric measure theory.

The principal investigator proposes to relate forms of discrete curvature with global parametrizations in high dimensions. The second problem asks for conditions for which an embedding of a set into a Euclidean space with some desired properties (e.g. quasisymmetric, bi-Lipschitz) can be extended to the whole Euclidean space with the same properties.

Potential applications are to signal processing, control engineering, and quantum mechanics. The proposed research will build bridges between different areas of the mathematical sciences. To do this, the principal investigator will collaborate with colleagues old and new, as well as sponsor undergraduate research. Indeed, many questions stemming from this project are suitable for undergraduate research and the principal investigator will recruit a diverse array of students to work on them. These students will be equipped with the skills, expertise, confidence, and passion necessary to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences. This project will create not only new mathematics, but also the new mathematicians necessary to enhance and enrich the nation's infrastructure for research and education.<br/><br/>A promising aspect of recent research concerns new links between discrete geometry (properties of lattices) and the asymptotic properties of structured matrices (such as Toeplitz matrices). In the other direction, the principal investigator and his collaborators have developed frame-theoretic constructions and operator-related methods to prove new results about lattices.  Together with collaborators, the principal investigator will also study complex symmetric operators and truncated Toeplitz operators. Complex symmetric operators are a broad class of operators that has not been adequately studied in generality until recently. The study of truncated Toeplitz operators, a rapidly growing branch of function-theoretic operator theory, has undergone spirited development stemming from a seminal 2007 paper of Sarason. A recent series of articles by the principal investigator and his growing list of collaborators have unearthed surprising links between these two classes.

Somewhat surprisingly, there are many basic theoretical problems in this area of mathematics which remain unsolved despite the many incredible successes the field has already achieved.

This project is concerned with topics in harmonic analysis that are designed to provide efficient  mathematical tools for these disciplines and that are expected to contribute to the unification of seemingly unrelated areas. Of particular interest is the study of various integral transforms, such as the Fourier and the X-ray transforms, and some  of their relatives. The Fourier transform decomposes a signal (mathematically a function) into the frequencies that make it up. It has been found to be relevant for solving  many mathematical problems arising in science and engineering and can be regarded as a special case of a larger class of oscillatory integral operators. The X-ray transform is an  operator that assigns to a function its integral over lines. It is relevant to problems in medical imaging and can be considered as a special case of a larger class of Radon type transforms and averaging operators. A main goal of the project is to expand the current mathematical toolbox in harmonic analysis to contribute towards a deeper theoretical understanding of these integral transforms and their generalizations.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will work on several projects in harmonic analysis. The first project is concerned with the application of decoupling theory to regularity questions for averaging operators and generalized Radon transforms, and to boundedness problems for  associated maximal functions.

The third project investigates spectral multipliers for the Kohn Laplacian on the Heisenberg group and the behavior of the corresponding multiplier transformations on Lebesgue spaces. It is proposed to prove  new space-time estimates for solutions of the wave equation associated with the Kohn Laplacian and to use them to bound the multiplier operators.

Mathematically speaking, these hexagons and pentagons can be viewed as the so-called ""Voronoi cells"" of their centers. From the mathematical perspective, these cells look very nice, in particular, they are all at almost the same width. It is an important and a computationally hard problem to produce points on a given shape whose ""Voronoi cells"" look that uniform. If we now show to a stranger only the vertices of the mentioned hexagons and pentagons, this stranger will likely think about a ball. This means that these vertices represent a ball well enough. The objective of this project is to prove that certain concrete algorithms are able to produce many points on a given shape so that if we look only at these points, we can recover the shape well enough. Such problems are of great interest and have applications to physics and chemistry, statistics and numerical integration.<br/><br/>More specifically, assume many particles are placed on a given manifold (shape), and it is known that these particles repel each other according to some potential. From physics, it is known that these particles will move around the manifold trying to minimize their potential energy. As soon as they minimize the energy, they will stop moving.  One would like to observe their locations at that time. It is conjectured (and in some cases proved) that for so-called s-Riesz potentials, these particles will fill the manifold uniformly in many senses (e.g., with respect to the limiting measure, separation and covering properties). One goal of this project is to prove a conjecture on separation distance for weaker (i.e., superharmonic) s-Riesz potentials and a suitable class of manifolds. It is anticipated that this will require developing a new approach to superharmonic potentials, as the current approaches do not work in this case. The principal investigator will further consider the somewhat dual ""Chebyshev problem"", which can be viewed as follows: one wants to place radioactive seeds in a tumor so that every point of the tumor receives some required amount of radiation. How many seeds, and at which locations, should they be injected in order to destroy the whole tumor? The second goal is to prove the uniformness properties (in terms of the limiting measure) for the specified locations, when the tumor is a ""d-rectifiable"" set. Since there is a lack of smoothness, the principal investigator intends to use methods from the geometric measure theory to approximate d-rectifiable sets by smooth sets. Finally, the third goal of the project is to compare the distributions of the deterministic configurations mentioned above to the distributions of random configurations. For uniformly and independently distributed points this has already been done by the principal investigator. Here it is proposed to work with so-called ""determinantal point processes"", which are random point configurations that arise from random matrices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to continue this line of investigation. More specifically, we aim to study 3-manifolds, harmonic maps, and Riemann surfaces. The study of 3-manifolds is in essence the study of the possible shapes of the universe and as such sits naturally at the intersection of mathematics and theoretical physics.  Surfaces are two-dimensional spaces like the surface of a ball or a doughnut. Their topological and geometric properties have been extensively studied and this research lies at the intersection of all fields of mathematics. The parameter space of all geometric structures on a given surface is called the moduli space. We study moduli spaces because to understand one particular structure on a space we must understand the structure of the space of all structures.  Theory of harmonic maps originates in the theory of minimal surfaces. It aims to establish important properties of harmonic maps which in turn provide useful information about minimal surfaces like the physical description of a soap film spanning a wire boundary.<br/><br/><br/>The principal investigator will study geometry of Teichmueller spaces, existence of equivariant harmonic maps for surface group representations, maps from surfaces into 3-manifolds, and the solutions of the 2D-Euler equation for incompressible fluids. The main goals are to: Classify Teichmueller discs where the Caratheodory and Teichmueller metrics agree; To build on the proof of the Schoen conjecture and establish results about the existence of  equivariant harmonic maps corresponding to representations of the fundamental groups of compact surfaces with boundary and  of surfaces of infinite rank; To investigate the simple loop conjecture for hyperbolic 3-manifolds; To consider whether the gradient of the vorticity in the 2D-Euler equation can achieve the double exponential growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most science and engineering problems in part boil down to separating random noise from structure, or sometimes utilizing random noise to amplify structure.  One of the great triumphs of 20th Century science was the development of many robust tools for understanding and analyzing random noise in many kinds of systems.  One such set of tools is stochastic analysis, which presents a rigorous mathematical treatment of ideas that first appeared in physics, adding random noise to the equations of state that describe our world.  These so-called stochastic differential equations have playing a fundamental role in advancing our knowledge in many area: economics, systems engineering, biological dynamics, and within mathematics, with applications to fields like differential geometry and quantum information theory.<br/><br/>This project addresses questions relating stochastic differential equations, heat kernel analysis, and random matrix theory. The central theme is understanding how differential equations with some randomness affect the evolution of eigenvalues of random matrices. These ideas connect with geometry, since the flow of heat on Lie groups (groups of continuous symmetries of geometric objects) can be characterized by such matrix stochastic differential equations.  Herein, ten research projects are proposed which yield connections between these topics and applications to others.  Generally, these problems can be described as studying the large-dimension asymptotic behavior of geometrically-motivated matrix-valued stochastic differential equations.  Of particular note are questions related to the fine (edge) structure of Brownian motion on high dimensional Lie groups from the classical compact families.  The intended research, upon completion, will settle several interesting open questions and present a major contribution both to the theory of stochastic differential equations and random matrix theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

He asked whether the properties of his integral are really fundamental and follow from more familiar integral axioms.  The class of amenable groups was introduced and studied by von Neumann in 1929, and he explained why a paradox appeared only in dimensions greater or equal to three. In the 1940s the amenability theory shifted into the field of functional analysis.  Currently amenability theory appears in many fields of mathematics, most notably in operator algebras, functional analysis, ergodic theory, probability theory, and harmonic analysis.<br/><br/>The core part of the project is based on the recent technique used by PI to prove that certain groups are amenable. PI plans to develop this technique in a more conceptual way using random walks on Schreier graphs. There are several classes of groups to which the technique can potentially be applied. They include Thompson group F, interval exchange transformation group, topological full group of abelian groups. The expected impact of the project is to give deeper understanding of analytic properties of the group actions and relate them to other fields. One of the central impact of this proposal is through its educational goals, in particular, in organizing of several summer schools and workshops.

Important examples include the Einstein equations of general relativity (which form the basis of modern cosmology), the Euler equations of fluid mechanics, the equations of elasticity, and the equations of crystal optics. Despite hundreds of years of mathematical progress, major gaps remain in our understanding of solutions. For example, although it is expected that solutions often ""become infinite"" there are few cases in which mathematicians have found a proof. Moreover, in other contexts, it is not even known if the equations have solutions. Thus, we still do not have a definitive understanding of the physical predictions of many equations of classical physics. The main obstacle is that the aforementioned equations are extremely difficult to study except under unrealistic simplifying assumptions. However, there have been some recent advancements in resolving some of these difficulties. For example, recent results provide a detailed description of Big Bang formation in solutions to the Einstein equations and shocks in solutions to the Euler and related equations. A major goal of this project is to extend these results to apply to other physically relevant equations and regimes. This work will provide new insight on the long-time behavior of waves and on the ways in which various physical theories can break down. <br/><br/>This research project involves the rigorous study of quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs and has three main research goals. The first is to provide a detailed description of singularity formation in various quasilinear wave-like equations of physical significance, with an emphasis on avoiding symmetry assumptions whenever possible. Examples include various Einstein-matter equations, the Euler equations, and the equations of elasticity. This research will expand our understanding of singularity formation by enlarging the class of equations and the class of initial conditions that are known to lead to blow-up. The second research goal is to prove local well-posedness for a class of physically relevant quasilinear hyperbolic problems with a free boundary along which the hyperbolicity of the equations degenerates. The third is to develop new tools for understanding the behavior of solutions to quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs with multiple characteristics in contexts where knowledge of the precise characteristics is essential. An ultimate goal is to use these tools to prove that for such equations, under suitable assumptions on the nonlinearities and data, shock formation occurs and is stable.  This proposal has several educational components that are intimately connected to the research problems. Many of the problems have components that can be investigated by advanced undergraduates, and the PI plans to supervise undergraduate research projects. There are also components suitable for PhD students. Moreover, the PI is organizing, with three co-organizers, a pair of summer schools targeted at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students from across the US and beyond. The PI will also develop curriculum materials that will be made freely available to the public online."

When we listen to music, when we use our cell phones, when we warm up a dinner in a microwave, when we look at the stars in the sky and when we relax on a sunny beach. But wave phenomena may also affect the lives of millions of people when earthquakes shake and propagate, tsunamis form or nuclear radiations get out of control.  Indeed, waves naturally arise occur in a variety of physical systems such as nonlinear optics, atmosphere and ocean waves, quantum mechanics and plasmas. The study of waves  is fundamental for the understanding of phenomena at both a very small scale, such as the Bose-Einstein Condensate, and at a very large one, such as collusion of galaxies. These expressions of nature are never too smooth and rarely too simple: interactions of small waves can produce very large outcomes, such as freak waves, while complicated objects such as  solitons almost do not see each other when they cross. Phenomena such as these are the byproduct of nonlinear wave interactions, and understanding what  are the possible outcomes, given the initial state of a system of waves, is fundamental to predict and  to control it, hopefully to our advantage. <br/><br/>In this NSF supported research the PIs present a series of projects at the cutting edge of research in nonlinear wave phenomena in which deterministic approaches, classically based on harmonic and Fourier analysis, are implemented alongside probabilistic ones to capture basic properties of wave phenomena. It has become clear in recent years that deterministic methods and probabilistic ones naturally feed off each other and when combined not only contribute to our understanding but also open the door to new paradigms to move research forward in various directions. More precisely, the PIs propose four  projects  at the forefront of nonlinear evolution equations, where the interplay of deterministic and probabilistic  approaches is the key to make progress. The problems range from the study of weak turbulence for dispersive and fluid equations to the analysis  of integrable structures, from  the definition of Gibbs type measures to the probabilistic existence and stability of certain geometric flows enjoying null form nonlinearities. The probabilistic component of PIs' work in the last few years has contributed in bridging the dispersive and wave  nonlinear equations community with that specialized in stochastic partial differential equations. This interaction has created ongoing collaborations between members of these two communities. The work that the PIs, their students and collaborators will generate in solving the problems described in this project will further solidify the interactions between these two vibrant communities.

These equations are widely separated in their physical and historical origins, however, the relevant mathematics is closely related, and techniques and insights in various areas of mathematics may be synthesized in fruitful ways.  Solutions to these equations exist at least for a short time, but beyond that, can either reach a singularity at some finite time, or extend to all time in which case they are called global solutions.  For singular solutions, the central questions are to find the mechanisms for the breakdown of the solutions and the structure of the solutions as time evolves toward the singularity.  For global solutions, the goal is to catalogue the different possible behaviors of the solution as time extends to infinity, which can include dispersion, the production of cohesive static waveforms or concentrating waveforms. <br/><br/>The mathematical analysis of these equations applies techniques from geometry, Fourier analysis, and spectral theory.  For some of the equations, the local in time theory is very well understood and is set in a scale-invariant function space that plays a crucial role in the long time analysis of solutions as well.  Despite numerous advances in the last several decades, in many cases it remains an open problem whether a certain initial condition will produce a solution that is singular or global.  It is expected that the solution will behave like a perturbation of a linearized version of the equation in many cases, although there are other known phenomena which occur.

Much research in dynamical systems focuses on closed systems in which the dynamics are self-contained.  In many modeling situations, however, such a global view is not possible and it becomes necessary to study local systems that are influenced by other unknown systems, possibly on different scales.  These considerations motivate many of the systems to be studied during the course of this award:  systems in which mass or energy may enter or exit through deterministic or random mechanisms, and large-scale systems of smaller interacting components that exchange mass or energy.  Such systems have been used in theoretical physics and chemical engineering to model atom traps, explore mechanisms for heat conduction in solids and investigate metastability in molecular processes.  Rigorous mathematical results obtained during the course of this award will aid in the interpretation of these studies as well as suggest new directions of inquiry.  This award also supports the involvement of undergraduates in mathematics research.  Using the highly visual nature and physical motivation of the problems outlined above, the PI will recruit undergraduate students to work on these topics during each summer funded by the award.  Special emphasis will be given to recruiting students from underrepresented groups in research mathematics.  Students will disseminate results of their research via poster sessions, conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.  By stimulating interest in research careers in mathematics and creating a peer community supportive of that interest, the award will contribute to the important goal of integrating research and education.<br/><br/>Motivated by the problems outlined above, this award is organized around three specific projects:  The first project investigates the statistical properties of both classical and non-equilibrium particle systems with collision interactions, an important class of models from statistical mechanics; the second concerns open systems, which relate on the one hand to models of physical systems in which mass or energy is allowed to escape, and on the other to the study of metastable states; the third project concerns the behavior of extended dynamical systems comprised of a finite or infinite number of smaller components linked together, with orbits or energy allowed to pass between them.  Important examples include the aperiodic Lorentz gas and mechanical models of heat conduction.  Using his recent work concerning spectral decompositions of transfer operators for dispersing particle systems, the PI will investigate equilibrium and non-equilibrium models from statistical mechanics and provide rigorous analysis of physically important quantities such as entropy production.  In addition, the PI will adapt and develop techniques using projective cones due to Birkhoff as well as the construction of Markov extensions (a generalization of Markov partitions) to the study of such systems.  None of these techniques require Markovian assumptions on the dynamics, making them widely applicable to a wide variety of nonuniformly hyperbolic and physically important systems.  The application of these tools to central models from equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics will represent significant advances in the study of such systems.  Efforts to understand these tools in one context, strengthens them and aids in their application to other areas of mathematics.  Their intellectual interest is enhanced by the application of these ideas to resolve problems posed and approached formally in the physics literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conversely, researchers in science and engineering fields often seek improvements in both theory and practice via mathematical arguments to explain and confirm experimental results. This project involves partial differential equations, geometric function theory, calculus of variations and related problems that arise in real-world applications including: nonlinear elasticity, microstructure of materials, and crystals to name a few. The proposed physical interpretations of mathematical objects, like Sobolev homeomorphisms that are viewed as elastic deformations, have proven useful in understanding and solving challenging problems in nonlinear elasticity. The primary aim here is to develop new, and improve old, methods to meet these challenges. The new mathematical concepts such as free Lagrangians allow one to establish the existence of traction free energy-minimal deformations. Further advances in Hopf-Laplace differentials could lead to predictions of the formation of cracks in deformations, and in understanding the principle of interpenetration of matter. Theoretical prediction of failure of elastic bodies caused by cracks would have a broad impact to both mathematical analysts and researchers in the engineering fields. The research topics in this project, although in general mathematically challenging, also take on questions that are suitable for graduate students. The ultimate goal is to attract graduate students and young scholars, both women and men, to geometric function theory with a wide range of applications, to encourage them to participate in the interdisciplinary efforts, and to prepare and help them to develop meaningful interactions with physicists and engineers.

It resulted in the solution of several mathematical problems such as the Nitsche conjecture in the theory of minimal surfaces, the Evans-Ball conjecture on approximation of Sobolev mappings with diffeomorphisms, the novel concept of free Lagrangians in the calculus of variations, formation of cracks along trajectories of Hopf differentials, rigorous description of the phenomenon of interpenetration of matter, and the partial answers in the dimension two to the legendary Morrey's conjecture on quasiconvexity of the rank-one convex functionals; in particular, sharp inequalities of Burkholder's stochastic integrals. The latter include the complex Beurling-Ahlfors singular integral transform. The eminence of this transform lies in the fact that it connects two homotopy classes of the first order elliptic systems in the complex plane: one whose solutions are orientation preserving mapping and the other with orientation reversing solutions. The notoriously difficult problem has been to identify the Lp-norm of the Beurling-Ahlfos transform. The status of the problem goes on as never before.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, the results of applying even simple rules many times may be complicated and hard to understand (think of a simple motion of a spoon in a cup of coffee; after a few repetitions the liquid is completely scrambled). It is well known that small disturbances can have rapid growth, as for example in the ""butterfly effect"" in meteorology.  Other systems where complicated effects take place include the motions of small celestial bodies subject to the changing forces of the sun and the planets. In some cases (for example, in the motion of satellites) it is of interest to devise maneuvers that take advantage of the natural amplification of disturbances to accomplish big effects with small efforts. To understand such complicated behavior, this research project searches for pieces that move in an orderly way and that act as anchors and reference points for all the other motions. This allows systematic classification of the possible motions. <br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, this project will employ methods from several parts of mathematics. The fact that an object behaves simply can be formulated as a functional equation that can be studied with rigorous mathematics using functional analysis and topology. One surprise in these studies is that delicate number-theoretic properties (for instance whether a frequency satisfies a polynomial equation with integer coefficients) play a practical role. The tools from functional analysis must be supplemented by a very strong geometric intuition. The project also aims to develop practical algorithms for calculation, so that the knowledge acquired in the theory can be made concrete. The mixture of tools (analysis, topology, geometry, and numerical algorithms) makes involvement in the project an effective training ground for students who can subsequently pursue either academic or industrial careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Banach spaces, in particular function spaces and sequence spaces, are an important tool used either directly or indirectly in scientific fields such as engineering and physics. Hilbert spaces, which are a special type of Banach spaces, and operators acting on such spaces, provide a theoretical framework that can be used to study problems in quantum mechanics and computer science. Therefore, there exists potential practical value in studying the fairly abstract notion of a Banach space and its space of operators. The project is centered around the study of old problems, as well as ones that have emerged from recent developments in the theory. Although it is formulated in terms of Banach space theory, many of the problems studied are related to other areas of mathematics, such as descriptive set theory and operator theory. The solution of those problems will require the combination of techniques from such areas as combinatorics, set theory and topology.<br/><br/>The project revolves around the investigation of a variety of problems. Emphasis is given on the local and asymptotic behavior of basic sequences, which can in fact have far reaching implications in the properties of operators on certain spaces. Some notions that are studied are those of spreading models, finite block representability, and script-L-infinity spaces. As already mentioned, one of the main intentions is to deduce properties of operators. There are two main approaches that can be used in this setting. The first one is the construction of spaces with hereditary heterogeneous asymptotic structure. This method was previously used by the principal investigator and S. Argyros to construct the first example of a separable reflexive Banach space with the invariant subspace property. The question as to whether the separable Hilbert space has this property as well, is one of the central problems of operator theory, in fact of mathematics. Further study of this method can possibly yield further examples of spaces which resemble Hilbert spaces, for example uniformly convex spaces, with the invariant subspace property. The second approach is related to the study of script-L-infinity spaces. This approach is based on the method developed by S. Argyros and R. Haydon to construct the first known Banach space with the scalar-plus-compact property. This means that every bounded linear operator on this space is a compact perturbation of a scalar multiple of the identity. This method has its roots in a construction of J. Bourgain and F. Delbaen. Further study of this method may lead to the characterization of spaces with the aforementioned property."

A further quantitative condition must be then provided at the free boundary to exclude indeterminacy. Problems of this sort arise in a large number of areas of applied and industrial interest. The paradigm example is the classical Stefan problem describing the melting and solidification of the ice: the free boundary here is the moving interface between the regions occupied by the water and the ice. Other important examples occur in filtration through porous media, where free boundaries occur as fronts between saturated and unsaturated regions, and others come from combustion (propagation of the flame front), mathematical finance (optimal time for exercising an option), biology (regions occupied by different species) and so on. Because of the abundance of applications in various sciences and real world problems, free boundary problems are considered today as one of the most important directions in the mainstream of the analysis of partial differential equations and offer opportunities of collaboration among mathematicians, physicists, engineers, material scientists, finance practitioners and other industrial researchers, biologists, and other scientists.<br/><br/>This project consists of two main parts. The first part concerns problems that naturally exhibit free boundaries of codimension two, which are often called thin free boundaries. Such problems appear in many applications, such as elasticity, math finance, boundary phase transitions. They are also related to problems for nonlocal integro-differential operators such as the fractional Laplacian through extension operators. The second part concerns the fascinating limiting configurations in various growth/aggregation models such as the Abelian sandpile growth model, which can be viewed as a discrete version of Poincare's balayage problem in potential theory and is closely related to the classical obstacle problem. While there has been a significant progress in such problems in recent years, there are still many important questions that remain to be answered and the current project aims to contribute in that directions. Particular questions to be studied include various thin free boundary problems: for parabolic PDEs with variable coefficients, for almost minimizers (elliptic case), properly stated two- and multi-phase problems, as well as the systematic study of the limits of discrete-valued least superharmonic majorants (so-called discrete-valued Perron method). This may lead to better understanding of the formation of polygonal and piecewise-quadratic limits in Abelian sandpile and other growth/aggregation models and related PDEs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This very paradoxical behavior underlies the theory of thermodynamics in physics, in which complicated systems of particles admit a simpler global description (involving just a few variables, such as pressure and temperature) when the number of particles becomes large.  A mathematical theory of free probability, initiated by Voiculescu in the 1980s, has shown that von Neumann algebras can be viewed as systems of 'thermodynamic variables' for asymptotic behavior of random matrices. A distinctive feature of the theory is that the variables no longer commute: the order of their multiplication matters.  This results in an extremely rich theory that leads to free probability generalizations of classical objects such as partial differential equations, Brownian motion, and so on. The present project concerns questions of better understanding of asymptotic behavior of random matrices and of the resulting asymptotic limit through construction of invariants, which are both algebraic and analytic in nature. <br/><br/>The project's aim is to continue the study of cohomological invariants associated to subfactors and more general inclusions of algebras, in particular L^2 invariants and their analogs. The study of some of these invariants turns out to involve many analytical tools supplied by free probability theory, such as free probability analogs of Brownian motion and of the associated Laplace-like operators. The study of these operators - arising in the asymptotic limit of random matrices - is of significant interest in random matrix theory as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large part of the theory of dynamical systems deals with long-term behaviors of typical trajectories in certain mathematical or physical systems, such as hyperbolic systems or Hamiltonian systems. A key task of spectral analysis of the ergodic Schroedinger operators is to study the asymptotic behaviors of the solutions of the associated eigenvalue equations. Bridges between two different areas can then be built since ``asymptotic behaviors of solutions'' may be interpreted as ``long-term behaviors of certain systems''. The goal of this project is to develop dynamical techniques that are driven by building such bridges and that may benefit both areas.<br/><br/>Different disordered media lead to different type of ergodic base systems. The famous and intensively studied Anderson model corresponds to i.i.d. random variables which can be generated by full shift. Two types of base systems with which this project is concerned are quasi-periodic systems, typical almost periodic systems, and hyperbolic systems, classic type of strongly mixing systems. Various levels of randomness may be detected by a dynamical object, the Lyapunov exponent, which is the main object of study of this project. One focus of this project is the study of positivity and large deviation estimates of the Lyapunov exponent. These properties are super sensitive to the randomness of the base dynamics, are generally difficult to obtain, and are thus among central topics in dynamics systems. From the side of spectral theory, they are strong indications of the Anderson Localization phenomenon and imply immediately certain regularity of both the Lyapunov exponent and the integrated density of states. Deep investigation of the two properties for both quasi-periodic and hyperbolic base dynamics may shed light on how to obtain positive Lyapunov exponent of the standard map. This is one of the most notorious unsolved problems in dynamical systems where the difficulty lies exactly in the complicated coexistence of both elliptic and hyperbolic behaviors. Another fundamental relation between dynamical systems and spectral theory is the Cantor Spectrum phenomenon. The most famous physical example regarding this phenomenon is the Hofstadter's butterfly. In dynamical systems, Cantor spectrum phenomenon may be viewed as some kind of ubiquity of uniformly hyperbolic systems.  Another focus of this project is then to investigate Cantor spectrum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these tools were initially intended for certain problems about differential equations, they have also led to important breakthroughs in number theory. More precisely, Diophantine equations are potentially complicated systems of equations involving whole numbers, and mathematicians are interested in counting the number of solutions to such systems. Unlike waves, numbers do not oscillate, at least not in an obvious manner, but one can think of numbers as frequencies, and thus associate them to waves. In this way, problems related to counting the number of solutions to Diophantine systems can be rephrased in the language of  quantifying wave interferences. This project will further extend the scope of decouplings towards the resolution of fundamental problems in harmonic analysis and number theory. The project will make new tools accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community.<br/><br/>Decouplings have proved remarkably flexible in addressing a wide variety of problems in such diverse fields as number theory, partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. One important circle of questions that remain to be addressed concerns the decoupling inequalities for curves on small spatial balls. Also, the cone poses a lot of interesting problems, even in three dimensions. The square function estimate, the local smoothing conjecture and, the decoupling into small caps are just a few examples of related problems for the cone. Progress on these problems is likely to lead to progress on many other problems.

However, there are many natural ""geometric objects"" in both mathematics and physics, especially quantum mechanics, where the coordinates no longer commute. Noncommutative geometry is a branch of mathematics that is designed to handle just such noncommutative ""geometric objects"".

Analytic number theory is a branch of number theory which uses tools from mathematical analysis to solve problems about the integers. Harmonic analysis has its roots in the work of Fourier, who studied the way general functions may be represented by sums of simpler trigonometric functions. It has applications in various areas including mathematical physics, signal processing, and digital image processing. The project involves a series of problems in harmonic analysis related to Radon transforms and X-ray transforms. A deeper understanding of these transforms will produce a number of applications in areas such as computed tomography (CT) scan, sonar techniques, and radar techniques. On the other hand, the proposed project will stimulate interactions between harmonic analysis and analytic number theory. The principal investigator proposes to study a few famous open problems in analytic number theory, via tools recently developed in harmonic analysis. <br/><br/>The project involves work in three directions, focusing separately on decoupling theory, time-frequency analysis, and certain oscillatory integrals that connect the previous two topics. One problem that is proposed in decoupling theory concerns Parsell-Vinogradov systems in all dimensions. The goal is to establish certain sharp decoupling inequalities that would imply sharp upper bounds on the number of integer solutions of these systems. Progress on this problem will allow a representation of every polynomial of a given degree by fewer linear forms. In the direction of time-frequency analysis, the principal investigator proposes to study an important special case of the famous Zygmund conjecture. This conjecture states that the maximal operator associated with a planar Lipschitz vector field is weakly bounded on the space of square-integrable functions. The principal investigator proposes to study the conjecture by further assuming the vector field to be constant along each vertical line on the plane. One problem that is proposed in the area of oscillatory integrals aims at proving sharp Sobolev regularity estimates for an averaging operator along the moment curve in every dimension. Sharp decoupling inequalities established by the principal investigator and collaborator will provide necessary tools from decoupling theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For short times, the behaviour of solutions is understood in many cases. However, the theory of existence (or not) of singularities, and long term behavior of solutions, is far from well-developed. An example of singularities are the breaking of waves, the formation of a tornado or the splash of a drop.<br/><br/>This project takes two directions: on the one hand it addresses the fundamental question of whether there exists breakdown of smooth solutions in finite time, paying particular attention to the type of breakdown and to the quantity that blows up and on the other the existence of global solutions that exist for all time. Two equations are considered: the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic (gSQG) equation- both in the smooth and the patch case -, a family of models which interpolates between the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation and the Euler vorticity equation; and the two dimensional free boundary Euler equations. In order to carry out the project, a combination of techniques among an interdisciplinary tool set is required.

To have  physical reality  they have to possess  properties  which  make them detectable to observations. Chief among them is stability to perturbations. This translates to a very difficult, deep and beautiful mathematical conjecture which is the main  focus of the proposed   research.  The goal is to show that any  small perturbation, at a given time, of a given black hole solution remains small for all later  times. Thus all the important features of a unperturbed black hole are preserved by the perturbations.<br/><br/>To solve the problem of stability of black holes one has to overcome a large range of difficult issues. The high non-linearity of the Einstein  equations makes it hard to separate them; they are all interconnected.  At the heart of all these difficulties is the issue of gauge. That means, roughly,  that one cannot solve the stability problem without finding a specific coordinate system  in which  one can  establish decay of the perturbations, i.e. to show that the perturbations converge to zero for large times. In collaboration with J. Szeftel in France the PI had proposed a new method to construct these coordinates  based on the full covariance properties of the  Einstein equations. The main methodology of the PI is to combine this new method, called Generally Covariant Modulation theory, with the the so called vector-field method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historically, a method of studying and understanding such operators is to break them down into simpler components, based on spectral decomposition.  This consists of describing parts of the operator that behave like multiplication by certain numbers, and to explain how these parts assemble into the whole.  One major goal of this project is to advance such understanding of large classes of operators.  Another major goal is to study families of operators that arise in various quantum mechanical models, in light of certain deep mathematical conjectures regarding finite dimensional approximations of infinite dimensional objects.<br/><br/>More specifically, the principal investigator, together with collaborators, has made advances in recent years on spectral decomposition results for non-selfadjoint elements of finite von Neumann algebras. These are centered around upper triangular forms, analogous to the classical results of Issai Schur for matrices, and both utilize and extend results about hyperinvariant subspaces found recently by Haagerup and Schultz.  Particular proposed projects include (a) studying norm convergence properties of bounded operators and (b) extending spectral distribution and upper-triangular form results to unbounded affiliated operators. In related directions, the principal investigator will work on the hyperinvariant subspace problem for elements of tracial von Neumann algebras and to investigate the Murray--von Neumann puzzle, which is akin to the Heisenberg relations.  A second area of proposed research concerns the notion of bi-freeness and bi-free products.  A third area of proposed research concerns quantum correlations.  Recent results of the principal investigator showing non-closedness of the set of quantum correlations for five inputs and two outputs open the door to new understanding of these small cases, which the principal investigator proposes to pursue.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When we listen to music, when we use our cell phones, when we warm up a dinner in a microwave, when we look at the stars in the sky and when we relax on a sunny beach. But wave phenomena may also affect the lives of millions of people when earthquakes shake and propagate, tsunamis form or nuclear radiations get out of control.  Indeed, waves naturally arise occur in a variety of physical systems such as nonlinear optics, atmosphere and ocean waves, quantum mechanics and plasmas. The study of waves  is fundamental for the understanding of phenomena at both a very small scale, such as the Bose-Einstein Condensate, and at a very large one, such as collusion of galaxies. These expressions of nature are never too smooth and rarely too simple: interactions of small waves can produce very large outcomes, such as freak waves, while complicated objects such as  solitons almost do not see each other when they cross. Phenomena such as these are the byproduct of nonlinear wave interactions, and understanding what  are the possible outcomes, given the initial state of a system of waves, is fundamental to predict and  to control it, hopefully to our advantage. <br/><br/>In this NSF supported research the PIs present a series of projects at the cutting edge of research in nonlinear wave phenomena in which deterministic approaches, classically based on harmonic and Fourier analysis, are implemented alongside probabilistic ones to capture basic properties of wave phenomena. It has become clear in recent years that deterministic methods and probabilistic ones naturally feed off each other and when combined not only contribute to our understanding but also open the door to new paradigms to move research forward in various directions. More precisely, the PIs propose four  projects  at the forefront of nonlinear evolution equations, where the interplay of deterministic and probabilistic  approaches is the key to make progress. The problems range from the study of weak turbulence for dispersive and fluid equations to the analysis  of integrable structures, from  the definition of Gibbs type measures to the probabilistic existence and stability of certain geometric flows enjoying null form nonlinearities. The probabilistic component of PIs' work in the last few years has contributed in bridging the dispersive and wave  nonlinear equations community with that specialized in stochastic partial differential equations. This interaction has created ongoing collaborations between members of these two communities. The work that the PIs, their students and collaborators will generate in solving the problems described in this project will further solidify the interactions between these two vibrant communities. The broader impact component of the project aims at fostering the training of doctoral graduate students and junior researchers in the US, thus fundamentally contributing to the STEM workforce.

In different contexts, different notions of distance are relevant. For example, when parallel parking, the goal is to move a car horizontally into a parking space, but this takes a lot more time than driving the car the same distance forwards or backwards. It is natural, therefore, to treat such a horizontal distance in parking as being further than the comparable distance in driving straight forward. Distance measures of this type are known as ""sub-Riemannian"" distances and have played a decisive role in several areas of mathematics. This project concerns generalizations of such distances and their applications to open questions. The principal investigator will consider two important questions in harmonic analysis where such distances are a key component, with the goal of using a deeper understanding of these distances to make progress on open questions. The tools to study these generalized sub-Riemannian distances are borrowed from several different areas of mathematics: differential equations, geometry, and harmonic analysis. They are then applied to questions from other areas of mathematics: several complex variables and singular integrals. The project thus brings together ideas from several areas of mathematics to attack important open questions.<br/><br/>By defining a generalized notion of a sub-Riemannian metric, this project introduces two primary areas of inquiry where geometric methods can be applied. The first area is the study of the Bergman and Szego projections on a class of domains of finite type. To study this, the principal investigator plans to develop a generalized notion of scaling in the holomorphic category. This is presented as a quantitative version of the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem. This is the holomorphic analog of the quantitative theory of sub-Riemannian geometry, which has proven to be useful in many areas of analysis and geometry. The second area of study is providing a measure-theoretic approach to singular Radon transforms. Singular Radon transforms have been an active area of research for fifty years, though work has mostly focused on results where the underlying surfaces are smooth. This project introduces a geometry that is intrinsic to a singular Radon transform, through which one can study these operators from a purely measure-theoretic standpoint. The project aims to use this framework to address questions regarding curves where certain types of curvature vanish to infinite order, a topic which has proven unamenable to current methods. The project also explores a new kind of differential equation that arises in inverse problems. In some settings, this differential equation exhibits existence but not uniqueness, while in others it exhibits uniqueness but not existence. Study of this differential equation will be the topic of an undergraduate research project and will use methods developed to study a special case.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Muskat in 1934 to describes the mixture of water into an oil sand.  The second part of this project considers the study of a highly accurate mathematical model for a dilute hot plasma.  These types of plasmas appear regularly in fundamental physical problems from astrophysics, nuclear fusion, and tokamaks.  In the third part of this project the PI will study fundamental partial differential equations from relativistic particle dynamics and it is expected that this research will increase our physical understanding in a variety of places in astrophysics, for instance in high atmosphere aerodynamics where the air is a very rarefied gas and fluid equations are no longer a suitable mathematical model.   This project will involve training in research and teaching of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduate students from the University of Pennsylvania and other universities. The project will also involve outreach to undergraduate students through the UPenn Center for Undergraduate Research & Fellowships program. The PI is fully committed to facilitate the training and education of these students through teaching courses, regular direct mentoring, and running regular research seminars.  The PI is actively working to develop new innovative mathematics courses at the University of Pennsylvania in order to further the goal of developing a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce and to improve STEM education at the collegiate level. The PI is engaging in outreach activities to groups that are traditionally under-represented in mathematics, and these activities will continue over the course of this project.   <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to fully understand both global existence and singularity formation for several different fundamental physical models in non-linear partial differential equations.

The simplest one is the flow of a fluid, say water in a river. In some regimes, the flow is very smooth, but in other situations it appears very chaotic, with eddies at various scales, interacting in a very complicated manner: the flow is then said to be turbulent. While turbulent flows are very hard to understand, and constitute to this day a scientific riddle, an approach was suggested by Kolmogorov in 1941. Kolmogorov's approach is instead of trying to fully describe the flow focus on statistical quantities that can be measured in the flow.  In other words, instead of understanding everyting about the flow, which might not be possible, certain averaged quantities should follow precise physical laws. While this approach was very successful in many respects, it remains mysterious in many others. In particular, at a very fundamental level, no rigorous justification of the laws of turbulence is known: these laws seem to be valid experimentally, but how they exactly arise from first principles  is not known. The aim of the program is to investigate this very fundamental question, which is related to very practical concerns. While turbulence in fluid flows is the first example that comes to mind, another type of turbulence, known as weak turbulence, might be more tractable, and provide the right entry point. <br/><br/>Weak turbulence describes turbulence as it arises in nonlinear wave equations (of which there are many instances, from waves propagating on the surface of the ocean to electromagnetic waves or quantum physics). It was conjectured by several scientists, in particular Zakharov in the 70's and 80's, that weak turbulence is described by a specific equation, known as the kinetic wave equation. The central aim of the PI is to investigate this conjecture with the help of mathematical tools: in particular, the theory of partial differential equations, in connection with probability theory. This effort will hopefully enable us to validate Zakharov's claim under appropriate conditions, which would then open the way to a theoretical and rigorous understanding of weak turbulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the surface of the ball curves of least length (geodesics) emanating from a point in different directions tend to not move away from each other in the short term, or at least less rapidly than in the flat surface, whereas in the saddle surface the geodesics curve away from each other rapidly. This behavior is related to the curvature of the surface, with the sphere of positive curvature, the flat surface of zero curvature, and the saddle of negative curvature. Analogs of this behavior hold in higher dimensional objects that occur in nature. Curvature plays a key role in how natural phenomena such as dissipation of heat and electricity behave, and this is true also in objects that are not as smooth as the three types described above. Such non-smooth objects occur in nature and have creases, bumps and fractal-like structure, and so the classical theory of curvature does not apply to them. The focus of this project is to use the analog of curvature developed for the non-smooth setting recently, and explore how that dictates the behavior of natural phenomena such as heat dissipation in such objects.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to explore links between the notions of negative curvature of a metric space on the one hand, and nonlinear potential theory and quasiconformal mappings on the other hand. The spaces considered are equipped with a uniformly locally doubling measure supporting a uniformly local Poincare inequality. A prototype space equipped with a uniformly locally doubling measure supporting a uniformly local Poincare inequality but does not support their global analogs is the smooth hyperbolic manifold, and experience tells us that such spaces have exponential volume growth at large scales. This project is divided into three parts. In the first part of the project, the focus is the large scale negative curvature of the space (as given in optimal mass transportation) and its connections to large-scale potential theory (non-linear ``heat"" energy dissipation) and hyperbolicity of ends. In the second part the aim is to construct geometric families of curves connecting pairs of points in the space when the space has lower bounded Ricci curvature in the sense of Lott and Villani. The third part of the project is to consider bounded doubling nonsmooth spaces as boundaries of Gromov-hyperbolic filling and use this perspective to study non-local potential theory and regularity of nonlocal energy minimizers on poorly pathconnected spaces. The research described herein forms a part of the program of quasiconformal classification of nonsmooth spaces. Such spaces arise in the study of smooth manifolds when considering Gromov-Hausdorff limit spaces as in the works of Cheeger, Gromov, and Perelman.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first of these deals with the notions of volume and size, the second with proximity and convergence, and the third with symmetry and the idea of displacement in space or time. When combined together they form the subject of dynamical systems,  which in its classical origins models the time evolution of physical systems but is nowadays applicable to a wide range of phenomena involving transformations from one state to another. The project will pursue novel relationships between measure and topology that have recently begun to emerge within this dynamical framework and are tightly linked to the related field of operator algebras. The goal is to use this perspective to develop new ways of understanding how  the particular symmetries of a given dynamical system may condition different types of asymptotic behavior, from the deterministic to the chaotic.<br/><br/>While the topological and measure-theoretic perspectives have long between fruitfully intertwined in the theory of operator algebras, in the last several years this symbiosis has been reinvigorated through not only the elaboration of surprisingly far-reaching analogies but also the discovery of new kinds of applications of von Neumann algebra techniques to C*-algebras with structurally profound consequences. The central aim of the project is to reimagine these analogies and techniques in dynamical terms. This will on the one hand forge a novel line of investigation in topological dynamics that intertwines finite approximation properties with asymptotic phenomena like mean dimension, and on the other establish broader connections between group actions and C*-algebras as part of the effort to understand general types of crossed products and their K-theoretic classifiability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like a bell sounding its last notes, these problems all share a common feature: they exhibit oscillations with exponentially decaying amplitudes around an equilibrium state. A famous theoretical example concerns gravitational waves, recently detected by the LIGO detector. In technological settings, the ratio between the oscillation and decay rates to equilibrium is called the quality factor. Minimizing this ratio improves the stability and rigidity properties of the materials involved. Such technological applications include engineering graphene-like insulators; conception of waveguides and optic fibers; and design of high-quality microelectrical systems. <br/><br/>The mathematical study of such phenomena relies on a unified framework called resonance theory. It investigates natural  generalizations of time-harmonic states in situations where the energy may escape or decay. Generalized energies of such states form a discrete set of complex numbers called quantum resonances (in quantum scattering), quasinormal modes (in general relativity) or Pollicott--Ruelle resonances (in dynamical systems). Their imaginary parts describe the typical frequency of the associated resonant states while the real parts describe their decay or growth outside bounded regions. Mathematically, they are the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the Hamiltonian resolvent. Much of the theoretical work consists in studying their stability and asymptotic distributions; and how they affect time evolution. This project specifically deals with the emergence of resonances under symmetry-breaking perturbations in periodic structures; the exponential convergence of Hawking radiation in black-hole spacetimes; and the relation between topology and Pollicott--Ruelle resonances in dynamical systems.

Random environments are ubiquitous to many physical systems: gases, condensed matter, chemical reaction, etc. The inherent complexity of these phenomena motivates the use of noise in their mathematical description. A fundamental challenge is to interpret how this noise affects the dynamical aspects of the system. In condensed matter physics, the lack of synchrony between random scatterers can eliminate all propagation of waves-- a phenomena known as Anderson localization. On the other hand, disordered gases exhibit high diffusivity properties, with applications in imaging. A mathematical understanding has impact on technological applications in atmospheric science, wireless communications in urban environments, physiological imaging and electronic transport in nano-structures. <br/><br/>This workshop will present recent developments on wave propagation, scattering and diffusion in random medias at the interface of probability theory, mathematical physics and partial differential equations.

Understanding the ""typical"" behavior of these systems has many applications, such as problems in material science involving signal degeneration in optic fibers. For the last few decades, research on these equations has centered around questions on the existence of solutions, their long time behavior, and the possibility of singularity formation. Fundamental progress has been made in many settings, yet in some regimes, the nonlinear interactions are so strong compared to the dispersion of the waves that typical methods break down. In those regimes, probabilistic tools have been instrumental in analyzing the behavior of these systems, enabling researchers to answer new and exciting questions in a variety of settings.<br/> <br/>This project aims to investigate the behavior of solutions to nonlinear wave and Schrodinger equations, and more generally Hamiltonian equations in infinite dimensions. More specifically, the PI will address several problems, including probabilistic existence and long-time behavior for power-type nonlinear wave and Schrodinger equations, the analysis of integrable structures, and the definition of invariant Gibbs-type measures. These problems have several common goals, many of them motivated by recent developments in the study of nonlinear dispersive and wave equations via probabilistic techniques. The PI will refine existing probabilistic tools and develop new ones in order to treat new settings, such as certain geometric flows. Additionally, to tackle these problems, the PI will employ a combination of tools from harmonic analysis, probability theory, spectral theory and the theory of Hamiltonian systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the one hand, the PI will investigate the behavior of waves in space, as they interact nonlinearly with themselves and matter over large space-time scales. The ultimate goal is to explain how the  energy, which is stored in a wave undergoing a nonlinear dynamical evolution, ultimately  splits  into  quantized pieces and a wave ""at the horizon"". The latter refers to energy, possibly of large size, which  is infinitely spread out and does not interact with anything in a noticeable fashion. In contrast with this macroscopic behavior, the project also aims at understanding the behavior of waves on the microscopic scale, such as in crystals or quasi-crystals. The goal is to explain  transitions from an insulating state to that of a conductor, which these materials may exhibit as they undergo changes on the molecular level. Such changes may occur  through the insertion of impurities, or changes in the environment. Both the macroscopic as well as the microscopic behavior of waves is of crucial importance to science and engineering, and profoundly affects our daily modern lives. Modern communication relies on waves transmitted over large distances both in space but also along glass fiber cables. For the latter the properties of the material are crucial and both nonlinear effects as well as aforementioned microscopic phenomena decide the suitability  of the underlying medium. <br/><br/>More technically speaking, the PI intends to further investigate the rigorous mathematical theory of focusing dispersive semilinear evolution equations. A major open problem is to analyze  the resolution of any solution into moving solitons and radiation. Some success has been achieved in recent years on this important problem, but for nonintegrable equations we are far from a satisfactory understanding. The PI is currently involved in the study of this problem in the dissipative setting in which some damping is added to the equation. The Hamiltonian setting appears to be very difficult at the moment, especially in the subcritical regime. The methods involved derive from dynamical systems, invariant manifold theory, and dispersive PDEs. The quantum mechanical problems alluded in the previous paragraph belong to the area of Anderson localization. Together with his long-standing collaborator Michael Goldstein at Toronto, but also with young collaborators which are joining the field, the PI intends to bring the body of techniques which were developed over the past 20 years  based on large deviation estimates, the avalanche principle, semi-algebraic sets, and harmonic analysis such as (pluri)subharmonic functions and the Cartan estimate, to bear on both linear and nonlinear problems in dynamical systems and spectral theory.  Ultimately, the goal here is also to better describe the behavior of wave propagation in disordered media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Free boundaries correspond to sharp changes in the variables describing the problem. While significant progress has been made in the study of free boundary problems, many important questions have yet to be studied in the case of nonlinear partial differential equations and especially equations of mixed type. For these cases, a better understanding of properties of free boundaries, such as stability, regularity and geometric structure, would make it possible to study complex phenomena in real-world applications. The primary focus of this project is the study of shock reflection problems in gas dynamics, one of the most fundamental multidimensional shock wave problems. The project will also have a broad impact through close interactions with engineering and meteorological communities and through training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The project consists of two main topics: (1) Free boundary problems in shock analysis. The PI will continue his work on self-similar shock reflection for potential flow and for full and isentropic Euler system. Shock reflection problems arise in many physical situations. Moreover, such problems are important in the mathematical theory of multidimensional conservation laws since their solutions are building blocks and asymptotic attractors of general solutions to the multidimensional Euler equations for compressible fluids. Self-similar equations of compressible fluid dynamics are of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type. Shocks correspond to discontinuities in the solution for Euler system, and in the gradient of the solution for potential flow equation. Type of equation may change from hyperbolic to elliptic across the shock. Shock reflection problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem in which unknown are the elliptic (subsonic) region and solution in the elliptic region. The PI will continue his work on existence, stability and regularity of global solutions of the regular reflection, to extend the global existence results to the case of compressible Euler system, which is a fundamental model of gas dynamics.  Further study includes uniqueness and stability for regular reflection problem in various classes of solutions. (2) Another area of the proposed research is semi-geostrophic system.  The PI will study semi-geostrophic system with variable Coriolis parameter.

These are algebraic inequalities whose variables (unknowns) represent numbers.  Because their importance, polynomial inequalities have been studied intensely for many centuries.  Matrix inequalities, algebraic equations whose variables are matrices, also appear in many applied areas, such as linear systems engineering, and mathematical fields. A key difference between polynomial and matrix inequalities is that for matrices X and Y, unlike real numbers, it can happen that XY and YX are not the same and if X and Y are ""positive"",  XY need not be ""positive"".   A major theme of this project is the development of a mathematical theory of matrix inequalities with an emphasis on convexity.  A set is convex if the line segment joining any two points in the set lies entirely in the set.  While it is easy to draw pictures of convex sets in two variables, the notion makes sense and is immensely important in the cases where there are a large number of variables, for instance minimizing cost or in design problems where it is crucial to identifying worst case performance. In many settings, when searching over a convex set, there is a unique minimum (or worst case) and there are very reliable computer algorithms to find the minimum.  On the other hand, when searching for a minimum over a set that is not convex it is difficult to be certain that the minimum, and not a value that is simply smaller than those nearby, has been found.  The solution set of a linear matrix inequality is convex, but in general solution sets to matrix inequalities are not. A goal of the principal investigator and his collaborators is to determine when the solution set of a matrix inequality is convex, can be converted in a tractable way to, or approximated reasonably by, a convex set described in some fashion by a linear matrix inequality.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the mathematical foundations of convex matrix inequalities, developing the subject both in parallel to semialgebraic geometry and as a non-linear version of the theory of operator systems and spaces and completely positive/contractive maps. Motivation flows from the deep scientific interactions with applications such as engineering systems theory. It will advances the understanding of both linear matrix inequalities, now standard tools in science and engineering, and matrix inequalities that arise in systems engineering problems, particular for many of those that arise from a signal flow diagram. An important aim is to determine and automate the identification of matrix inequalities with convex solution sets, mapping a non-convex solution set to a convex one (currently done on an ad-hoc basis for some special cases in the systems engineering literature), and otherwise approximating non-convex solution sets by convex ones. The methods employed involve ideas from functional analysis, operator theory, complex analysis and several complex variables, operator systems and spaces, completely positive maps, semidefinite programming and semialgebraic geometry. Conversely, a significant aspect of this proposal is the development of techniques and results that contribute to the theories of operator systems, spaces and algebras and completely positive maps and of (freely) noncommutative analogs of the theory of analytic functions in one and several variables. In another direction, the distinction between positive and completely positive maps on natural operator algebras of functions arising in one and several complex variables will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first question considered is to what extent can the geometry of a body be determined from information about a force field associated to the body (for instance its gravitational field)?  Such inverse problems in potential theory have a rich history, but the mathematical tools needed to answer this question are currently underdeveloped.  The investigation will focus especially on what can be said if one only knows that the field has bounded magnitude, which is of particular interest in applications.  A second question to be explored is how, and to what degree of accuracy, can one determine the asymptotic (or long term) behavior of a random function that evolves with time, based on certain empirical measurements?<br/> <br/>More specifically, the principal investigator proposes to research several questions concerning the relationship between the geometrical properties of a measure and the regularity properties of an associated operator. The primary question of interest is the following: What can be deduced about a measure from the knowledge that singular integral operator associated to it has good regularity properties?  Under these circumstances, can the measure have a fractal structure, or must its support be contained in (a countable number of) Lipschitz sub-manifolds of appropriate dimension? Attempts to solve this problem has led to theory which has found recent applications in the calculus of variations, the study of free boundary problems, and the geometry of harmonic measure.  The principal investigator intends to further develop tools that serve as a bridge from the analytic condition on the singular integral operator to the geometric structure of the measure. A second topic of research concerns understanding the long-term behavior of a stationary Gaussian process given information about its spectral measure, building upon recent work involving the principal investigator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, wave- or dispersive-type equations display this kind of behavior. These evolution equations provide the possibility of constructing solutions from prescribed initial conditions. In some evolution processes, a prescribed restriction (or boundedness) over time is given and the question is then whether the boundedness property persists forever or whether some sort of ""unboundedness"" can arise (e.g., a freak wave suddenly appearing in the ocean or a self-focusing burn in laser optics). These evolution processes are fundamental in nature, yet we are still in the infancy of their full analytical description. This project seeks to shed new light on the global behavior of solutions to nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDE), in particular, of dispersive PDE for which the nonlinearities cause a significant difference in global behavior compared with linear evolution. A special emphasis will be placed on the study of singularity formation, such as collapse and blow-up. The principal investigator's research program starts from advancing the theory of collapse for the simplest models in nonlinear wave equations, proceeds by expanding this theory to more generalized models and equations, and then goes on to explore the dynamics of solutions for simple dispersive systems, which have hitherto been studied little but which describe important models in the physical world. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop singularity theory for dispersive systems like the Davey-Stewartson system. These equations arise in physical contexts such as the description of water waves or acoustic waves, and in various fields such as laser optics and fluid and air dynamics.<br/><br/>This project will advance the frontiers in the theory of nonlinear evolution equations, in particular, improving our understanding of collapse phenomena. It will produce a rigorous analytical description of concentration and aggregation for physical applications in real life. This work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen interinstitutional ties, for example, between the George Washington University (GWU) and Howard University. In addition, the project will provide mathematical training and educational experiences at all mentoring levels, reinforcing future US competitiveness. It will focus on attracting, training, and retaining in mathematics and science outstanding female students and students from underrepresented groups. Vertical integration of educational activities, from middle school to the graduate level and beyond, will help to reinforce the project's agenda and contribute to the recruitment and retention of skillful workforce in the STEM fields. These activities will occur at the middle school level through the DC Math Circle program; at the high school level through the GWU summer precollege program (which annually recruits over two hundred students nationally); at the undergraduate level by engaging the principal investigator in the supervision of senior research theses and her serving as a mentor and  guest lecturer at the GWU ""Summer Program for Women in Math"" ; and, finally, at the graduate level by organizing the DC Grad Camp, with the emphasis on attracting female and underrepresented minority students."

The Fourier transform decomposes a function of time into different frequency components, similarly to how a music chord can be expressed as the pitches of its constituent notes. Harmonic analysis studies how the time information and the frequency information interact with each other. A fundamental question (i.e. Fourier restriction problem) that has been studied for decades is how the geometry of the frequency support of the Fourier transform dictates the size of the original function in time. Various quantifications of such relations are referred to as Fourier restriction estimates and turn out to be extremely challenging to study. Even for the simplest geometric objects such as spheres and paraboloids, many questions are still wide open. Restriction estimates are interesting also due to their connection with many other problems, within or outside analysis. It is well known that restriction estimates can be applied to study the Kakeya conjecture (on the minimum area of a set containing a unit line segment in each direction), the existence and growth of solutions to Schrödinger and wave equations, and the number of solutions to Diophantine equations in number theory.<br/><br/>This project studies several problems related to Fourier restriction estimates. First, the principal investigator intends to further the investigation of the Fourier restriction conjecture for the paraboloid and the cone via the polynomial method. This method explores the algebraic structure of the time-frequency decomposition of the function, and has shown to be extremely powerful in obtaining many state-of-the-art results in the theory. Second, the principal investigator proposes to continue the study of weighted restriction estimates (i.e. when the Lebesgue measure is replaced with a fractal measure) and apply them to estimate divergence sets of the Schrödinger or wave equations and to distance set problems (on how the size of a set dictates the size of its distance set). The major difficulty in this direction is the lack of a crucial tool (orthogonality) caused by the presence of the fractal measure. Here an interesting approach will attack the distance set problems directly by studying the behavior of the fractal measure. Last, the principal investigator wants to explore the role in restriction theory of a recently developed tool called sparse domination. This method, arising from singular integral theory, is a way to reduce the study of the original continuous, spread out operator to that of a class of much simpler dyadic, positive, local operators. This method has shown to be extremely useful in singular integral theory and has become a modern view of point in describing operators. The principal investigator plans to further the study of sparse bounds of operators related to restriction estimates and with a Kakeya nature, such as the Bochner-Riesz multipliers, singular integrals along manifolds, directional maximal operators, and multi-parameter singular integral operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
