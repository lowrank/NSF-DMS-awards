The first part   discusses some problems in infinite dimensional Banach space   theory.The developments in structure theory of Banach spaces   over the  last four years led to exciting results and new   problems.The second part of this proposal treats a Gaussian correlation    problem.

This is a field which combines the algebraic insights of the older field of self-adjoint operators, from which it grows, with the techniques of single operator theory. The aim in this proposal is to build on the success that recent applications of a new circle of ideas have had with important and difficult problems in the field. The last few years have seen the interplay of two ideas, ""infinite multiplicity algebras"" and ""interpolating operators"" lead to the solution of a number of longstanding problems in the field. The effect has been to open up one class of non-selfadjoint operator algebras to a whole new level of understanding. In individual work, one investigator proposes to further study and classify maximal triangular algebras, while Pitts proposes to study (and hopefully complete) the similarity theory for distributive commutative subspace lattice algebras and to classify the analytic algebras of this type.       Operators can be viewed as finite of infinite matrices of complex numbers. In this way a collect of operators can often be given an algebraic structure and referred to as an operator algebra. The study of these algebras of operators is rooted in mathematical physics. The main problem in the theory of algebras is to classify these algebras so that equivalent or similar algebras can be recognized. This project deals with the classification problem for operator algebras that have elements (viewed as matrices) in triangular form.  ***"

Primary emphasis will rest on the study of certain important spaces of analytic and harmonic functions and operators on these spaces. The topics to be considered include approximation by harmonic functions, iterations of the Berezin transform, hypercyclicity, Koenigs functions, composition operators, Toeplitz operators, Hankel operators and Bergman spaces. The project will also include the development of software for the symbolic manipulation of harmonic functions, appropriate for use by pure and applied mathematicians and scientists/engineers who utilize harmonic functions in their research.  Operator theory has its origins in mathematical physics, in particular, in the study of quantum mechanics. The modeling of the atom required the development of non-commutative analysis. The commutator of operators is the measure of non-commutativity. Harmonic functions are encountered in the study of potential functions whose origins can be traced to electrostatics. Analytic functions are complex analogues of  harmonic functions. A good portion of this project deals with operators and the analysis of their commutators that acting on spaces of analytic functions. The research on this project should be of benefit to the mathematical analysis community and to other scientists whose work involves non-commutative models and potential theory.  ***"

They will also investigate geometric conditions equivalent to compactness of the d-bar-Neumann operator.  The techniques to be used combine ideas from function theory, geometry, partial differential equations, and functional analysis.    Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the century  as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex  variable.  It became clear early on that the theory differed  widely from its predecessor.  The underlying geometry was far more  difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity  with partial differential operators of first order.  It thus grew  as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of  differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of the  fundamental structures were defined in the last three decades.   Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic  mathematical forms."

Such processes  involve a large number of components (particles) with   either  deterministic or stochastic dynamics, governed by local laws of   interaction. It appears that  large groups of particles, which in principle   evolve  in an unorderly manner, tend to organize themselves in a coherent   pattern at some larger space or time scale. In particular, these rescaled,   possibly stochastic,  microscopic models are expected to give rise to   deterministic Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations  describing the evolution  of   macroscopic  quantities.     One of the problems  addressed here, is the rigorous derivation of nonlinear   partial differential equations  from interacting particle systems . Proceeding   a step further,  one would hope that for   finer scales of the particle systems,  the local random fluctuations are preserved in the macroscopic equation, while   microscopic details still remain hidden. In this framework, we propose  to study  (i) Interacting Particle Systems with long range interactions and weakly   propagating interfaces, and (ii) Stochastic discrete velocity models and fluid   dynamics systems of equations. We are particularly interested in understanding   the convergence of particle systems to weak solutions of the macroscopic   equations, past the formation of shocks  for the fluids equations and past all   possible geometric singularities of the  propagating interfaces. The proposed   techniques are drawn from Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations, as well as,   Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes. A crucial part in the analysis of   the interacting particle systems, lies in the interplay of the different   space-time rescaling regimes present, each one with its own limiting   deterministic partial differential equation.                                PARAGRAPH 2      This research project is concerned with the mathematical analysis of microscopic  and macroscopic models of non-equilibrium phenomena arising in material science,  biology and fluid mechanics. The first part of the proposal is concerned with   the derivation of transport properties for materials undergoing phase   transitions (for example alloys changing crystallographic structure). Similar   techniques will hopefully prove useful in the prediction of nonequilibrium   behavior in biological processes. The mathematical tools employed here, are   expected to provide  new detailed quantitative information about our physical   systems, going one step beyond phenomenology. In the second part of the project,  we study the convergence of discrete random models, to gas and fluid dynamics   equations. In addition to the issues proposed in the first part, here we hope   that such discrete models may yield robust algorithms for the numerical   computation of gas dynamics flow, particularly in the presence of  shock waves."

Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics studies properties of dynamical systems describing big or infinite systems of interacting particles.  The Hamiltonian structure of the equations of motion allows one to define in the phase space the so-called Gibbsian measures, invariant under the dynamics.  These measures are usually constructed form the basic Hamiltonian and other classical conserved quantities such as the number of particles, integrals of momentum and angular momentum.  Statistical mechanics is based on Gibb's postulate which states that this finite parameter family of measures exhausts the class of all translation invariant measures with weak long-range dependence."

More  specifically, he is studying what are known as Steinberg symbols,  a generalization of multiplicative commutators in such algebras.  Steinberg symbols are factored by means of a Koszul complex  construction, and this gives rise to a new invariant, the joint  torsion.  This invariant is related to a local or maximal ideal  index in the setting of commutative operator algebras, and it  provides new understanding of the principal function in the non-  commutative case.  Similar constructions involving higher algebraic  K-groups will also be investigated.       The study of Wiener-Hopf integral equations began more than  sixty years ago in connection with physical problems such as the  diffraction of electromagnetic or sound waves.  A natural operator  W arises.  The investigator's contributions began with the  introduction of a naturally paired operator U for which a  combination of the two operators known as the determinant took on  a particularly simple and useful integral form.  Using this  determinant, he found that the study of the Wiener-Hopf operator W  could be deepened, that new solutions could be found to the  original integral equations, and that the study of functions h(W,U)  of the pair of operators could be put into a new geometric context.   This was an early step in development of the hugely successful new  area of modern mathematics sometimes known as ""non-commutative  geometry.""  Now non-commutative geometry has drawn together several  diverse areas of mathematics, and ""algebraic K-theory"" figures  prominently among them.  In the context of algebraic K-theory, the  further analysis of the structure of the determinants mentioned  above has led to a new object called the joint torsion of the pair  {W,U}.  This object in turn is linked to geometry in still another  way and occurs in the study of differential equations and in the  study of dynamical systems.  ***"

Geometric operators on noncompact complete Riemannian manifolds are generalized Fredholm in the sense that they are invertible modulo the ideal of all locally traceable operators with bounded propagations, called the Roe algebra. The K-theoretic indices of geometric operators live in the K-theory of the Roe algebra. An important and interesting feature is that the computation of K-theoretic indices depends only on the coarse geometry of Riemannian manifolds. The K-theoretic indices of geometric operators have important applications in geometry, topology, and the analysis of noncompact Riemannian manifolds.      This project lies at the interface between geometry, analysis and algebra. A modern approach of Connes studies geometrical invariants using non-commutative algebraic structures. These invariants have been explicitly realized only in a few cases. The completion of this project should provide new   explicit examples of these invariants from non-commutative geometry.  The work will contribute to geometric classification of manifolds.  ***"

Continuous Krein space operators have natural isometric and   unitary extensions, allowing a reduction of the study of general   operators to a more tractable case. New tools in the form of   index formulas give conditions for the existence of   factorizations. A new form of the Krein space commutant lifting   theorem is sought which has applications similar to the Hilbert   space case. A related prmblem is to develop a unified algebraic   and analytic theory of the Krein space Schur class of   operator-valued holomorphic functions.

Examples from interpolation theory and univalent   functions will be considered.

It is only recently that mathematicians have been   looking into the possibility of generalizations to new settings   such as indefinite inner product spaces.  Preliminary results   indicate that this line of investigation could turn out to be as   fruitful as the classical theory has been.  The problems   naturally raise new questions about other areas of operator   theory on indefinite inner product spaces.

Finally an investigation will be made of a well-known example of two-dimensional shift of finite type - the ""golden mean"" shift. The goal is to compute the entropy of this shift.      Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Tilings and repeated convolutions can be viewed as dynamical systems. In this way, ergodic theory makes contact with geometry and analysis. This project involves ergodic theory problems along the interface with these areas.  ***"

A typical example is the electrical spot welding of metal sheets in the  manufacturing of such products as automobile bodies, tanks, and armored  vehicles. The mathematical modeling of such processes often leads to systems  of degenerate partial differential equations with diffusive and convective  couplings. The study of these systems leads to deep and intriguing questions  in nonlinear analysis. In these considerations, the presence of strong  nonlinearities and degeneracy gives rise to very rich structures of solutions.  Our recent research findings indicate that solutions of these systems display  new phenomena that cannot be incorporated into the classical variational  formulation, and a new notion of a capacity solution is, therefore, introduced  to study these systems. In this proposal, we propose to study the finer  properties of capacity solutions, such as regularity, partial regularity,  large time behavior, and other related questions.  The proposed research is  important from the point of view of industrial applications. The mathematical  results we wish to obtain can lead to a more efficient production line, a new  or better product. For example, in the welding of metal sheets, one of our  objectives is to find out how the welding time is related to the material  properties and the current applied. This information is critical to the  automation of the welding procedure."

The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of algebras of operators on Hilbert space. Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers.

The first of these problems concerns the existence and   intermediate asymptotic behavior of self-similar solutions to the porous   medium equation (a degenerate nonlinear parabolic equation) and to the   Navier-Stokes equations of gas dynamics.  The objective here is to obtain   the asymptotic description of various critical transitions in the flows   involved, such as the closing of holes (focusing) in porous medium flow   or the implosion of shock waves in gas dynamics.  The second problem   concerns the study of the dynamics of of load coupled arrays of Josephson   point junctions. These arrays are modeled by nonlinear systems of   ordinary differential equations, and the object of the study is to   understand the onset of stability and instability of various kinds of   phase locked solutions.  Particular emphasis will be placed on   predicting the loss of stability of phase lock and the dynamical   consequences of such a loss.     Self-similar solutions to partial differential equations are   solutions of a particularly simple structure determined by the underlying   symmetries of the equation.  They often arise in the asymptotic   description of critical transitions in the flow, because these   transitions are characteristic of the equations themselves and do   not depend on the details of the particular flow.  An example of this   phenomenon occurs in engineering practice in connection with coating flows   of very viscous fluids.  The process of filling holes in such flows is   often described by a porous medium equation, and our results will be   useful in developing numerical methods for the study and control of such   processes.  Large arrays of load coupled Josephson junctions are used in   many electronic devices such as  microwave generators and parametric   amplifiers.  In all these devices the most desirable operating condition   is one in which all of the junctions oscillate in unison.    Unfortunately, for various junction characteristics and load   configurations this phase locked state is not stable. It is therefore   important to know how to predict the stability and instability of the   phase locked state in terms of the parameter values for any particular array."

Semilinear Elliptic equations with Singular behavior (in collaboration with M. Del Pino).  3. Uniqueness of signed solutions to the Porous Medium equation - A continuity result for certain Degenerate Linear Parabolic equations (in collaboration with C. Kenig).    The equations proposed have both physical and theoretical significance. For example, from the physical point of view, they arise as models for the dynamics of thin liquid films  and also as models for the limiting density distribution in the kinetics of two gases obeying Boltzmann equation. Also, interest in such equations has long existed in other fields such as metallurgy and polymer science.  From the mathematical point of view, they exhibit a qualitative behavior that has remarkable features, different than in previously studied cases. Their investigation leads to the development of new techniques of mathematical analysis.  Another attractive feature  of the proposed problems is their connection to Differential Geometry, as they arise in the so called Ricci Flow, which has recently gained remarkable attention."

Analysis is the area of mathematics that has grown directly from   the invention of calculus and differential equations.  It provides   a framework for attacking problems that range from the purely   mathematical and geometrical to the most concrete scientific and   technical questions.  In turn, these problems have provided the   motivation for the continued refinement of the subject and, not   incidentally, its continued utility.  Thus there is no precise   dividing line between pure theory and potential or actual   application.

Some have a history of a century   or more and come from classical analysis and geometry, others   have a history of decades and are motivated by physics and   geophysics, others have arisen in the last decade and are   connected with signal processing and the concrete use of   computers in science and technology."

In addition to continuing   work on other topics,  specific problems are outlined in the following   subjects which are the main focus of the research: 1.   Interpolation problems for matrix and operator valued functions; 2.   Completions of finite and infinite matrices and operators; 3. Riccati   equations; 4. Krein space operators; 5.Applications. The principal   investigators strive to develop new results that can be proved in an   abstract mathematical context (e. g., in terms of *-algebras), and that at   the same time yield new and useful information in various more specific   settings.    The principal investigators plan to relate the newly obtained abstract   results to the original areas of application. Applications that are   emphasized in the proposal include Advanced Manufacturing (engineering   control systems) and High Performance Computing and Communications   (tomography), which have been identified as two of the strategic areas with   impact on national need.  Other areas of relevant application are:   engineering control systems, optics of polarized light, kinetic energy   minimization in quantum chemistry, diffraction of waves, signal processing,   and pattern recognition.  Interactions with many researchers in different   fields (mathematics, computer science, engineering),  various countries   besides the U. S. (Canada, The Netherlands, Italy, Israel, Norway, France,   United Kingdom), and scientists in industry and government (the National   Institute of Health, NEC Research Institute)  are planned and form an   integral part of this project."

The idea of representing a general operator in a specified class of operators as part of a nice operator in the class has had many successes. This project further develops this point of view with a primary focus on unsolved problems in operator theory and the theories of one and several complex variables.      Hilbert space operators are infinite generalizations of matrices. The infinite generalization of a vector is frequently a function and for this reason Hilbert space operators are frequently modeled as the operator of multiplication on a space of functions. This project involves finding models for operators. Once such models are obtained many basic questions about the structure of these operators become more natural.  ***"

OPTIMIZATION OVER SPACES OF ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS    Qualitative theory, computer algorithms based on this theory,   analysis of such algorithms.  Connections of this work with other   branches of mathematics.The engineering motivation here is strong; these   are the key optimization problems which arise il design of   systems and amplifiers where there are competing constraints,   time as well as frequency domain constraints, or uncertainty  in the math model of the physical system one is trying to control.  2.

That theory is the   core of linear control theory. Many systems which people wish to control   are nonlinear (e.g., jet engines), so there is a big demand for an effective nonlinear theory.

COMPUTER OPERATOR ALGEBRA  Linear engineering systems theory and operator theory are   rife with calculations in a noncommuting algebra.   Thus it is likely that someday there will be a branch of these   subjects devoted to their symbolic computational aspects.       Helton's group have, support, and are upgrading extensive   software, called NCAlgebra, for performing noncommuting   calculations in Mathematica.  The software is currently   at the level of a very powerful `yellow pad'.  The main issue now is what `intelligence' should go in   noncommuting packages. For example,  calculations with energy conserving systems  produce polynomials in matrices satisfying certain relations.   Thus it is natural to find a list of rules for simplifying   such polynomials tailored to this particular situation.  The goal is to find and understand `complete' lists of   simplifying rules.  Helton and collaborat ors   have successfully studied several situations of this type and   more are in progress.  ***"

In particular, they will focus on geometric and analytic invariants of these manifolds under holomorphic changes of coordinates.  Special consideration will be given to those manifolds globally defined by real polynomial equations.  For many manifolds defined by the vanishing of real polynomials, any component of a holomorphic transformation from one such manifold to another must also be a root of a complex polynomial.    Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the century  as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex  variable.

By the Kolmogrov-Seliverstov-Plessner method, it suffices   to study the mapping properties of the corresponding linearized operators.   The local smoothing properties of the solutions are also the mapping   properties of some linear operators.  To study the mapping properties of the associated linear operators,  the main idea of our approach is to estimate the kernel functions first   and then apply classical Fourier analysis theories   such as the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev theorem for fractional integrals,   the Sobolev embedding theorem, the Calderon-Zygmund singular integral   theory, and Stein's complex interpolation theorem for an analytic family   of linear operators. The Tomas-Stein restriction theorem for the   Fourier transform is related to these mapping properties. For certain   special case, the orthogonality method plays an important role.   The main difficulty is in estimating the kernel functions. Some oscillatory   integral estimates, such as van der Corput type lemma, can be applied.  The ideas of Carleson, Kenig and Ruiz, Sjolin, Vega, Ruiz and Vega seem   to be important here.    The Schrodinger equation is the basic equation of motion in Quantum Mechanics,   which is an important branch of modern Physics.   The results about the existence and the regularity of the solutions of   the Schrodinger equation can be used to explain some phenomena in Physics.   In January, 1926, Schrodinger  invented the Schrodinger equation, which describes the discrete states of   an atom. Since then, the existence and the regularity of the solutions of   the Schrodinger equation have been i mportant research topics in Mathematics   and Physics. In this project, we employ some important techniques in modern   Mathematics to study the regularity of the solutions of the Schrodinger   equation. The complete understanding of these problems will   have some important applications in the areas such as  Fourier Analysis, Partial Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics."

Specifically, Odell will study whether there are Banach spaces   of bounded distortion, or of arbitrary distortion but not biorthogonal   distortion. These questions are strongly motivated by Odell's recent joint   discovery with Schlumprecht, that Hilbert space is distortable in the strongest   sense. He also intends to study whether certain almost isometric asymptotic   assumptions  on a Banach space insure that it contains one of the classical   spaces   lp   for    1  < or =  p  <  infinity  or c subscript 0. Odell will   also investigate whether the Huff criterion characterizes spaces isomorphic   to those with the uniform Kadec-Klee property, and whether the Point of   Continuity Property is basically determined. Rosenthal will study further   possible characterizations of spaces containing c subscript 0, related to   his recent characterization that a non-reflexive space contains   c subscript 0   provided all its subspaces have weakly sequentially complete duals. For   example, he will study the question of whether an script L infinity saturated   space contains   c subscript 0, and whether a Banach subspace   X   of   C(K)   contains   c subscript 0  provided the complement of X in X** contains   functions whose   alpha-th  oscillation is bounded, for all countable ordinals   alpha. Rosenthal also wises to investigate Banach spaces with separable duals,   for example the problem of whether such spaces are isomorphic to subspaces of   quotients of  C(alpha)  (for   alpha  a countable ordinal), with particular   attention given to the Hilbert space case. Rosenthal will also study the   long-standing open problem of whether  complemented subspaces of  C(K)  spaces   are again isomorphic to a  C(K)-space.       The study of structural properties of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces   is one of the most profound, fundamental research areas i n modern analysis.   These spaces underlie  the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics,   and understanding and penetrating their structure is basic for modern research   in functional analysis and its applications to physics.  Recently there have   been spectacular advances in this area.  Deep long standing open problems have   been solved, and both proposers have been heavily involved in these advances.

Some of these   questions concern the almost sure convergence of averages of   measurements made on a stochastic process at a random sequence of   times that is  chosen in advance. Other questions concern subsequence ergodic  theorems for subsequences coming from members of Hardy fields, along   bases for the integers, and along sequences with big gaps.      Ergodic theory grew out of statistical mechanics, the statistical   description of matter. This latter means, for example,  that instead   of describing the behavior of each individual water-molecule in a cup   of water, one is satisfied with finding the AVERAGE speed, energy etc.   of the molecules. But then the fundamental question arises: HOW can we   measure the average speed or energy.  It is clearly impossible to measure the speed of each individual   molecule and then take the mean of the data. The   ergodic theorem says that it is enough to select   a SINGLE molecule, measure its speed in each second, and if  we make enough measurements and take the average of the data the   number will be basically the average speed of ALL the molecules in the   cup of water. This amazing theorem has one drawback: it requires that   the measurements are taken EXACTLY at every second. But in practice,   the measurements might be made at,say, 1.1, 2.4, 2.9 .... seconds   instead of at 1, 2, 3 ... seconds. Obviously, we would like to know   whether we still can compute accurately the  average speed from the   measured data. The proposed work addresses this VERY difficult   question from various point of view (depending on WHAT causes the   imperfect timing of measurements).  ***"

This invariant is related to a local or maximal ideal  index in the setting of commutative operator algebras, and it  provides new understanding of the principal function in the non-  commutative case.

The investigator's contributions began with the  introduction of a naturally paired operator U for which a  combination of the two operators known as the determinant took on  a particularly simple and useful integral form.  Using this  determinant, he found that the study of the Wiener-Hopf operator W  could be deepened, that new solutions could be found to the  original integral equations, and that the study of functions h(W,U)  of the pair of operators could be put into a new geometric context.   This was an early step in development of the hugely successful new  area of modern mathematics sometimes known as ""non-commutative  geometry.""  Now non-commutative geometry has drawn together several  diverse areas of mathematics, and ""algebraic K-theory"" figures  prominently among them.

This is a  branch of harmonic analysis closely allied with applications to  many areas of science.  The underlying goals of wavelet analysis  are (i) to determine functions whose integer translates and  dyadic dilates form orthogonal (or biorthogonal) bases for  square-integrable functions (ii) to ensure that the basis  elements localize both time and frequency and (iii) that they  have the requisite smoothness dictated by the problem.  Normally,  wavelets are also expected to have compact support.  This project will focus on construction of compactly supported and orthogonal wavelets in two and higher dimensions, new filter-bank constructions, and application to image processing and numerical methods for differential equations.          The theory of wavelets, as it has become known, is actually  a body of ideas which has developed dramatically over the past  decade, following several important discoveries by physicists,  computer scientists and engineers concerned with signal  processing and data compression.  It evolved into a synthesis of  many existing techniques into a framework which offers  possibilities for improved applications and challenging  mathematical ideas which will require years to reach what might  be considered a mature stage.  Many areas of science are now  adapting wavelet constructs to important problems currently under  investigation.  These included statisticians looking for patterns  in large data sets, compression of fingerprint data, edge  reconstruction of images and the generation of fractal sets with  prescribed characteristics."

Every multidimensional continuous-time dynamical system can be represented as a tiling based dynamical system. There is a natural discrete-time dynamical system associated to each such representation. This investigation will explore the intrinsic relationship between discrete dynamical systems arising from different representations of a fixed continuous-time system.  Tiling based problems are interesting in their own right. They provide a link between crystallography, multidimensional continuous-time and discrete-time dynamical systems. They also make it possible to pose problems of abstract measurable dynamics as concrete tiling geometry questions. This investigation will provide insight into some of these connections.

The functionals in question remain bounded when applied to holomorphic functions for which the area of the range is bounded by pi.  For functionals satisfying appropriate convexity properties it is known that the maximum over functions with range in a fixed domain is attained for the covering plane and is equal to the value of a certain harmonic majorant at the origin.  It is known for some functionals that extremal domains are simply connected and hence the maximum coincides with the maximum over the ball of the Dirichlet space.

Compared to the case of one variable, zeros of polynomials in several variables and high dimensional quadrature formulae are much more difficult and the results have been scattered. Recently the a new approach was used to study the topic and showed that positive high dimensional quadrature formulae can be characterized through the existence of real common zeros of certain set of quasi-orthogonal polynomials; necessary  and sufficient conditions for the existence of such zeros were also obtained, which are given in terms of certain nonlinear matrix equations.  The project will involve the continuation of this study and will use this approach to conduct a systematic study of this topic. It is very likely that the approach will enable one to tackle several fundamental questions, such as the  connection to moment problems in several variables which may lead to an analytic characterization of common zeros, structure of minimal and ``near'' minimal cubature formulae, and construction of new efficient numerical integration formulae. The goal is to establish a unified theory for high dimensional numerical  integration formulae based on the common zeros of quasi-orthogonal polynomials.    The outcome of the project will help in understanding the structure of high dimensional numerical integration formulae and the structure of the common zeros of polynomials. The information will be very useful in finding new formulae for practical evaluation of high dimensional integrals, which is one of the essential questions in numerical analysis and is often taken as a test problem in high speed computing; it can also be very useful in  constructing formulae with special properties, for example, the equal-weight formulae on spheres, which have applications in coding theory. The project is also motivated by the potential a pplications of the outcome in other areas of numerical mathematics, such as orthogonal polynomials in several variables and interpolation by polynomials which are basic tools for data fitting and surface reconstruction."

Shock-waves are modeled by discontinuous solutions in  inviscid equations, and shock-waves are what introduce  time-irreversibility, decay, loss of information, dissipation and  increase of entropy into the dynamics of solutions. The author's  recent construction of a shock wave solution of the Einstein  equations takes advantage of the fact that the gravitational  metric is continuous across a shock, even though the fluid  variables are discontinuous. This allows for solutions that are  weaker than shock wave, and the proposal explores the organizing  effect that the gravitational metric has on the geometry of shock  wave propagation. In the nonlinear theory of sound waves, the  authors address the open problem of explaining the stability of  periodic solutions. Their idea is to treat Lie bracket errors in  wave interactions as virtual waves, and thereby they can identify  and study a nonlinear cancellation mechanism that explains why  the dissipation due to increasing entropy defeats the  amplification of waves due to nonlinear interaction in the long  time.  The proposal involves the analysis and interpretation of  the author's recent construction of a new shock wave solution of  the Einstein equations of general relativity. This exact solution  resolves a problem that was first posed in a famous 1939 paper by  J. Robert Oppenheimer and his student H. Snyder. The new shock  wave solution of the Einstein equations of general relativity  provides a model in which the universe begins with a shock wave  explosion instead of the well established ``Big Bang'' scenario  (in which the entire universe burst from a single point). The  proposal explores the possible application of this construction  to modeling the dynamics of stars."

The proposed research concerns the structure of triangular AF algebras and their lattices of ideals, the radical structure and classification of various types of ideals in triangular AF algebras, factorization questions in operator algebras, the geometry of the unit ball of triangular AF algebras, and algebraic topology considerations within the context of operator algebras.       Operators can be viewed as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers. In this way a collection of operators can often be given an algebraic structure and referred to as an operator algebra.

The first topic is the   continued development of methods of Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser (KAM)   that are suited to systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This   includes nonlinear evolution equations such as the nonlinear wave   equation, nonlinear Schrodinger equation, versions of the Korteweg deVries   equation, and the water waves system of equations for the free surface of   a fluid. The intent of the work is to understand the stable motions of   these nonlinear evolution equations, and to describe some of the principal   invariant structures of the infinite dimensional phase spaces in which   they are posed. The second project concerns further the water wave system,   and its asymptotic scaling limits in the most physically important scaling   regimes. This analysis sets rigorous bounds on the descriptions of waves   in free surfaces by modulation theory and by long wave theories described   by the Boussinesq and the Korteweg deVries equations. Several new elements   of analysis have already been introduced which are useful in numerical   modeling of the fluid dynamical problem.   The third research project concerns the evolution of singularities of   Schrodinger's equation, in both the linear and nonlinear cases. The goal   is to understand the location and structure of the singularities of the   fundamental solution, which is microlocal information and is related to   the classical trajectories of the high energy particles. Finally, the   fourth subject concerns the quantum mechanical inverse spectral problem,   the object being to understand the spectral transform in the three principal   settings of scattering theory, Floquet theory and the theory of random   potentia ls, and to quantify the similarities between these settings.       As mathematics is the language of the sciences, physical phenomena   are understood through the properties of solutions of the equations  of physics, which are for the most part partial differential equations.   The investigator's principal interests are in the equations which   describe conservative phenomena, which are most often Hamiltonian   systems. The problems that are addressed in this project proposal  are all of central importance in the physical and engineering sciences,   and govern a remarkable variety of systems, from fluid motions of  the ocean surface to the nonlinear quantum mechanics of semiconductor   devices. The goals of all four projects are to understand important   aspects of the solutions of these equations, all of which are relevant   to the understanding of the systems, and many of them which also present   very challenging problems in mathematical analysis. One observation is   that it is remarkable that one finds related structure in systems which   describe very different phenomena. For example in the first project   there is a relation between the description of nonlinear quantum   mechanics and wave phenomena in water surfaces; this becomes clear   only in the mathematical analysis of the two systems. Furthermore the   mathematical analysis has in some cases led to improvements in the   modeling of the physical systems, and to the implementation of new   computational procedures for predicting wave phenomena, which is a   topic relevant to ocean and climate modeling in the Federal strategic   interest area of global change and the environment."

In contrast to the   case when no magnetic field is present (which is now well understood),   very little was previously known about it despite its mathematical and   physical significance. The main task will be to prove asymptotic   completeness for such operators, i.e., to give a complete classification   of all solutions of the corresponding time-dependent Schrodinger equation   according to their large-time asymptotic behaviour. Recently C. Gerard and   the author proved asymptotic completeness for N-body systems containing no   proper neutral subsystems (this class includes atoms and positive ions).   The aim of the proposed research is to extend these results to the case of   general N-body systems, including negative ions and molecules. The main   problem here will be to analyze the dispersive behaviour of the neutral   subsystems. Their dynamics depends on their internal structure and   therefore may be very unstable under perturbations. A deeper understanding   of the geometrical structures related to the magnetic field will also be   required.    This research deals with fundamental questions about how the structure   matter is affected by the presence of a magnetic field. Almost all of   the earlier results on this subject were obtained under the simplifying   assumption that the motion of the nuclei is negligible; mathematically,   this means studying an approximation where nuclei have infinite mass.   However, this simplified model is not always appropriate in physics,   especially since our research has shown that there are important   qualitative differences between the properties of this model and a more   realistic one with finite nuclear masses. Furthermore, although this   problem is of considerable interest in physics and astrophysics (for   example, strong magnetic fields are ex pected to exist on the surfaces   of neutron stars), no predictions could be made on the basis of  experiments. The reason for this is that the magnetic fields that can be   generated in the labolatories are not strong enough for their effect on   the systems in question to be detected. One thus has to rely on a   theoretical analysis of the problem."

Symmetrization is a process in which sets or functions are changed into other sets or functions of the same ""size,"" but with more symmetry.  For example, a set of given measure in Euclidean space might be replaced with a ball, centered at the origin, with the same measure.

A principal component of the project is to establish a connection between certain semigroups and continuous tensor products of Hilbert spaces. more precisely, the classification of E_0-semigroups up to cocycle conjugacy was shown to be equivalent to the problem of classifying these continuous tensor product systems. In turn, the latter structures give rise to computable invariants of various types: numerical (an index invariant), topological (a non-commutative topological space, the spectral C*-algebra). Moreover, such continuous tensor products occur naturally in probability theory; for example, they can be associated with random distributions having stationary independent increments, and with other martingale-type processes as well. A secondary project is to continue the proposer's recent work on the role of operator algebras in the problem of computing the spectra of infinite dimensional self-adjoint operators.       The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of algebras of operators on Hilbert space. Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These seemingly abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.

These include regularities of solutions to variational   problems, local structure and unique continuation of solutions to differential equations. One of the central problems he will continue to work on is the variational problem with free interfaces. It is closely related to the general regularity theory of minimal surfaces. The functional under the consideration consists of the modified Dirichlet integral and surface area. The difficulty arises as the two terms in the functional have different scaling factors. Behaviors of solutions under such scalings would be investigated. He will also study the structure of the singular sets of solutions to elliptic and parabolic differential    equations. This is one of the fundamental problems in the theory of  differential equations. He will investigate the effect of the smoothness of coefficients on the structure of singular sets. Such problems are related to the unique continuation of solutions. Another related problem is the size of the singular sets. It is expected that the appropriate Hausdorff dimension of such sets should be controlled by the frequency of solutions.           The problems of free interfaces and the singular sets originate from the material science and the control theory. In reality it is impossible to eliminate the singular sets, the so-called ""bad sets.""  Hence one of the central tasks is to investigate under what condition the singular sets can be controlled and under what condition such sets are small. Another    application involves the high-performance computing, in particular image processing. One problem is to recover the image from a distorted copy and the difference is measured exactly by the free interfaces and their singular sets. It is expected that such sets should be small enough to be neglected. The problems mentioned abo ve in the project are simplified mathematical models. It is expected that the discussion of these mathematical problems will improve the methods  to control the singular sets in various applications."

Popa plans to broaden his wide-ranging   studies in the rapidly evolving field of subfactors, using both analytic and   algebraic points of view. Popa is one of very few researchers who has been   working on theanalytical aspects of subfactor theory. It may be argued that this   technically difficult area has thus far constituted the deepest aspect of   the subject. Takesaki, together with several coworkers, has very recently   completed one of the central classification programs for discrete amenable   group actions on operator algebras.  He would like to build on this success   by returning to the largely unexplored area of continuous group actions.    He also plans to work once again on his earlier theory of duality, which   is currently playing a major role in quantum group theory.    Quantized analysis was introduced in the 1930's by John von Neumann in   order to provide a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. This   development has had a profound effect on the field of mathematics itself,   since it has enabled researchers to formulate non-commutative or   ""quantized"" versions of many quite distinct mathematical disciplines. We   now have quantized versions of ergodic theory, the non-commutative geometry   of Alain Connes, the non-commutative probability theory of Dan Voiculescu,   and the remarkable interactions of operator algebras, knot theory, low   dimensional topology, and conformal quantum field theory in large part   pioneered by Vaughan Jones.  Effros, Popa and Takesaki have been actively   involved in working on the frontier of some of these exciting new areas of   mathematics.  ***"

The proposed research involves a study of unbounded derivations of von Neumann algebras building on Weaver's characterization of the domains of such derivations as Lipschitz algebras, in the commutative case. Operators on a Hilbert space are infinite analogues of finite matrices. They have applications throughout mathematics but the proposed research relates specifically to mathematical physics. Algebras of operators have been used to model certain quantum mechanical systems, particularly those arising in quantum statistical mechanics. The proposal involves a change of the type of operator algebra used in this manner, with the double aim of clarifying the general theory and giving insight into specific examples. ***"

She will also consider the problem of classifying all genuine unitary representations of the metaplectic group. In particular, she will consider the Adams-Barbasch correspondence between these representations and a set of unitary representations of certain inner forms of the metaplectic group and determine if the representations go to Zuckerman functor modules under this map. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics."

For planar, compressible, inviscid fluids, classes of initial data will be identified which delay the appearance of singularity formation. Smooth global solutions for the equations of motion for planar, inhomogeneous, incompressible, viscous fluids will be constructed. These problems have some features in common, and their analysis will require inter-related techniques. Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions. This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations."
