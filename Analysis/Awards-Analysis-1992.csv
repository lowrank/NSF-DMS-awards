The goal is to make yet clearer the               role of the Minkowski dimension of the boundary in this                         distribution.  There are analogous formulas for the trace of the                associated heat semigroup.  The case in which not only the                      boundary of the domain, but the domain itself, is fractal will be               studied.                                                                             The relationship between the geometry of a manifold and the                invariants of the elliptic differential operators on it is one of               the main unifying themes of contemporary mathematics.  The case                 of a region with fractal boundary, so irregular that its                        dimension is no longer an integer, has been the setting for some                recent breakthroughs relating spectra information to geometry.                  This work has applications to the study of porous media and the                 scattering of waves from fractal surfaces."

Some work will be conducted jointly while other will               be addressed by single investigators.  One can divide the studies               into three main themes: nonlinear partial differential equations,               wavelet analysis and complex function theory.  In the first,                    efforts will be made to explore how the one-dimensional quantum                 version of the inverse scattering methods which replace the                     classical action-angle variables can be applied to understanding                the corresponding higher dimensional systems.  Work is also                     progressing on the investigation of inverse geophysical problems                involving surface wave phenomena.  Progress on model scalar cases               suggests that analysis of the full system of equations can be                   obtained.                                                                            Studies of adapted wave form analysis, a collection of FFT-                like adapted transform algorithms, continues to discover and                    refine new orthonormal bases which decompose functions and                      operators into almost diagonal form.  The interplay between these               theoretical advances and the application to numerical signal                    processing has led to highly successful decomposition techniques                using entropy based stopping time searches.  The applications                   lead, in turn, to a host of new questions in harmonic analysis.                 One of these will be that of creating a new concept of                          theoretical dimension of a function designed to measure the                     number of parameters necessary to describe the function with wave               forms taken from a given library.  Studies on the fine structure                of harmonic measure also continue.  Here the goals are to find                  the asymptotic behavior of harmonic measure in a variety of                     settings.                                                                            Work will also be done estimating the length of level lines                of the Green's function on bounded simply connected domains.  It                is believed that level line length varies with the fourth root of               the value of constancy.                                                              Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them and validate methods for                     expressing solutions.  Harmonic analysis focuses on the                         decomposition of functions into component parts which best                      reflect their oscillatory characteristics, while complex function               theory seeks to describe the geometric and analytic properties of               differentiable functions of a complex variable and their                        generalizations to higher dimensions."

The crystallographic groups arising in the very rigid geometric                 structures known as locally symmetric spaces of higher rank have                been classified by Margulis.  Witte will investigate whether                    these important groups can be realized as symmetries of                         one-dimensional spaces.  Witte will also investigate the                        crystallographic groups that arise in homogeneous spaces other                  than the usual symmetric spaces.                                                     This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                 theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of                systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                      followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading ""dynamics can                be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                           transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory               makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                   homogeneous spaces."

When one transforms a differential               operator by means of a classical transform, the operator often                  appears as a multiplier of the transformed solution.  This                      multiplier becomes the symbol of the operator.  The asymptotic                  expansion of smooth and nonsmooth symbols has been obtained in                  different contexts.  One barrier to going further has been the                  lack of method of stationary phase for integrls with a nonsmooth                amplitude fundtion.  Recent developments now allow one to derive                complete expansions for certain classes of discontinuous symbols.               It is the purpose of this work to continue in this direction,                   taking on more difficult and more interesting cases.  Ultimately                one will look for a precise general theory."
