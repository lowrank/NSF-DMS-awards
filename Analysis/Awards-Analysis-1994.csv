Work by this investigator and co-workers on quasitriangularity  led to the development of a sub-optimization formula which has  impacted recent work by others in control theory with  applications to electrical and aeronautical engineering.  The  plan is to continue work in this direction.  A second area of the  plan concerns problems related to triangular and semitriangular  operators, and to reflexivity, that arose out of prior work by  this investigator and co-workers which yielded counterexamples to  open questions on these topics.  The third area of the plan  concerns an operator-theoretic approach to certain aspects of  orthogonal wavelet theory obtained by interpreting orthogonal  wavelets as wandering vectors for a special set of unitary  operators on Hilbert space.  The new idea used is that the set of  all orthogonal wavelets for the usual dilation-translation  wavelet system (D,T) on the Hilbert space of square- integrable  complex functions on the real line can be parameterized in a  natural way by a single wavelet v together with the set of all  unitary operators in the local commutant of the system at x.   Analysis of this unitary set yields information concerning the  set W(D,T) of all orthogonal wavelets.       The research plan involves three separate but related  projects.  The first builds onto  previous work by this  investigator in the area of operator algebras.  A  formula which  was derived three years ago to solve an open problem in pure  mathematics has recently  impacted  applications-oriented  research projects of several mathematicians and engineers working  incontrol theory. Further work in this connection is being  pursued.  The second project continues previous work on  properties of single operators and dual operator algebras.   Recent successes here include counter examples which have  impacted work of several other mathemati cians.  The third project  concerns wavelets.  Wavelet analysis has been the scene of a  sizable research drive in mathematics and engineering during the  past few years.  The new concept utilized in this project is the  idea of determining new wavelets and functional properties of  wavelets by analyzing structural properties of a certain  naturally related set of operators, using established techniques  of single operator theory and operator algebras.  This overall   plan accomodates the dissertation research of four doctoral  students.  ***"

(1) A  continuing investigation of the notion of exponential rank in C*-  algebras. In particular, an attempt will be made to obtain a  better understanding of the exponential rank of homogeneous C*-  algebras and stable C*-algebras. (2) Investigation of related  work involving multiplicative commutators. (3) Continuation of  work on the K-theory of smooth crossed products. (4) A study of  spectra of elements of the reduced C*-algebras of free groups.       Operators are infinite dimensional generalizations of  matrices. There is a natural multiplication and addition of  operators and, consequently, some collections of operators can be  considered as mathematical structures called operator algebras.  There is an involution on operators much like the transposition  involution on matrices. An operator algebra that is closed under  the action of this involution is called a star algebra. A C*-  algebra is a star operator algebra that has additional  topological properties. In many commutative algebras, elements  that have multiplicative inverses have logarithms or,  equivalently, can be written as an exponential. This is not the  case in non-commutative C*-algebras. A portion of this project is  aimed at determining the number of exponential factors required  to write invertible elements as products of exponential.  ***"

(2) Infrared behavior of weakly perturbed Gaussian measures  arising in statistical mechanics of systems that are near a  second order phase transition. (3) Epsilon expansions for models  with nearly Gaussian fixed points for the renormalization group.

(5) Non-perturbative renormalization group for  strong coupling problems such as the non-linear sigma model. The  theory of elementary particles, the prediction of the size and  shape of long chain molecules in solution, and the study of phase  transitions are related problems from the view of mathematics;  they require a calculus for the approximate evaluation of  integrals over spaces of infinite dimension. In the 1970's the  Nobel Laureate K. Wilson, made fundamental progress in this  calculus, which is called the renormalization group. He  left mathematicians with the challenge of filling in his many  leaps of faith and creating a systematic theory. The first three  parts ofthis proposal hope to achieve this for a class of  integrals that are almost close to Gaussian integrals - a special  class that can be evaluated exactly. The last two parts are more  speculative attempts to create the same theory for integrals that  are much further from being equal to Gaussian integrals.  ***"

Recent developments by many researchers are providing further  ties between the selfadjoint and non-selfadjoint aspects of the  theory. The proposed work focuses on the theory of tensor  products of operator algebras, complete boundedness for operator  algebras, cohomology theory, and its connection with algebraic  topology. Schur multiplier theory, the structure of derivations  and automorphisms of non-selfadjoint and selfadjoint algebras and  compact ideal perturbations in semifinite algebras will also be  studied.       Operator theory is concerned with infinite generalizations  of finite matrices. When operator multiplication and addition are  defined on a collection of operators the resulting collection is  called an operator algebra. Cohomology is a theory that examines  when local pieces can be put together to form a global object.  This project is concerned with cohomology on operator algebras.  The goal is to contribute to an old conjecture which asserts that  certain cohomologies of operator algebras are trivial. This would  mean that local objects can always be pieced together into a  global object.  ***"

Hypergroups are relatively new  mathematical constructs.  They arise when one wishes to perform a  harmonic analysis of functions defined on subsets of Euclidean  space when the sets are not groups.  This loss of structure can  often be compensated if the measures on the set form a hypergroup  or some more general measure algebra with basis functions as  characters.  Building on the previous work which focused on  compact one-dimensional hypergroups whose characters are  polynomials or eigenfunctions of Sturm-Liouville equations,  efforts now will be made to extend the structure theorems to non-  compact hypergroups.  Work will also be done investigating those  hypergroups on n-dimensional space that have polynomials  characters and those which have characters which satisfy  differential equations.  The development of harmonic analysis of  hypergroups, and, in particular, understanding the structure of  hypergroups through their subgroups will also be carried out.   Finally, the properties and harmonic analysis of non-hypergroup  measure algebras with character sets consisting of spherical wave  functions and other special functions will be studied.   Undergraduates, supported by the grant, will participate in  developing examples and computer checks of relevant symbolic  computations.        Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics  best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to decompose  complex problems into fundamental components.  These components  are then analyzed for their basic characteristics.  Finally, the  solution is reconstructed through a recombination of the  components.  The Fourier series and Fourier transform are  examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other  representing a continuous d ecomposition.  Orthogonal polynomials  play an important role in certain segments of harmonic analysis  because (a) they arise naturally in the study of differential  equations (b) they can be used to represent large classes of  functions and (c) they are often easily computable.  ***"

The proposed research includes rigorous renormalization  group methods in the theory of critical phenomena (self-avoiding  walk and other interacting polymer systems, random Schroedinger  operators).  Additional research is planned on the phase  structure of supersymmetric field theory models and the way it is  constrained by index theorems.  Further problems include the  study of the crossover from lattice- constrained interfaces to  continuum interfaces near the critical temperature in Ising-like  systems.       Physical systems such as magnets or polymers  exhibit characteristic behavior as they undergo a change of  state. For example, the length over which atoms are  correlated grows without bound as a magnetization begins to set  in. Length scales for correlations grow as a power law in the  temperature or other parameters.  The goal of this proposal is to  develop the mathematics needed to understand these phenomena.  Application of these ideas will be pursued in the study of  polymers, particles and fields, and surfaces.  ***"

The equations are an  outgrowth of the classical wave equation which lies at the heart  of the theory of hyperbolic equations.  Refined estimates in the  linear case will be derived, to analyze the properties of  solutions to the physically more realistic nonlinear problems.  Among the questions to be considered are:  estimates of time  decay for appropriate measures of the size of a solution  and analysis of nonconstant coefficient problems corresponding  to nonuniform media in which wave propagation takes place.   Such estimates will also be considered for solutions to wave  equations on domains with boundary, such as in the exterior of an  obstacle, to find the best possible time decay subject to the  weakest restrictions on the data.  Finally, smoothness properties  of solutions to nonlinear wave equations as determined by  the corresponding properties of the data will be treated.   The general propagation of smoothness in a wave satisfying  a nonlinear equation will be reconsidered in a setting of  less initial smoothness.  Examples will be considered where  the formation of nonlinear singularities develop in cases in  which nonsmooth surfaces appear, both for interior domains and in  the presence of a boundary.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***"

In  particular, work will be done extending known results in the  isotropic case to the physical case of non-smooth conductivities,  to characterize, in two dimensions, all the possible outcomes of  the experiments performed at the boundary and to consider the  identifiability problem for anisotropic conductivities in  dimensions three or greater.  The project furthers work on other  inverse boundary value problems arising in applications.   They include the question of determining the Lame parameters of  a medium by making measurements of displacements and stresses  at the boundary and the problems of determining the magnetic  and electric potentials of a body by making measurements at  the boundary.  Plans to consider two formally determined  inverse problems which involve scattering observations will also  be carried out.  One is the inverse scattering problem at a  fixed energy in two dimensions; the other is the inverse  backscattering problem for singular potentials.  Finally, work  will be done on the admissibility problem in tomography, i.e.  determining families of k-planes on which the k-plane transform  is injective. It is planned to find relative inversion formulas  (modulo smoothing) in such cases.       This work falls within the general area of research on  nonlinear partial differential equations and inverse problems.   The questions often lie close to physical applications arising  from diverse areas as tomography, conductivity and scattering.   That is, to find characteristics of some unknown by observing  the effect of some physical process which involves the unknown.  ***"

The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in  twentieth century mathematics.

As specific examples in the last three categories, he hopes with  collaborators and students to --characterize the ordered groups  which arise as the ordered first Cech cohomology group of a  homeomorphism of a zero dimensional dynamical  system --characterize the nonzero spectra of integral  nonnonegative matrices by solving an associated factorization  problem in the ring of formal power series with integral  coefficients --extend the definition of residual entropy to  smooth dynamical systems and determine whether in that case it is  a nontrivial invariant (as it can be in the zero dimensional  case). Among the topics proposed by Rudolph for study in  measurable dynamics are restricted orbit equivalence and  characteristic factors for generalized ergodic theorems.       The notion of restricted orbit equivalence is intended as a  method to investigate the nature of a dynamical system  by considering the perturbations of its orbit structure.   The choice of restriction one places on the kind of  perturbation allowed controls the type of structure observed. --  In investigating the convergence of various kinds of  generalized ergodic theorems, one searches for natural splittings  into parts converging to zero, and parts with  nontrivial convergence, but very limiting, usually algebraic  structure. This latter ""characteristic factor"" of the averaging  method not only controls the convergence, but also gives  insight into the dynamics of the underlying system.         This is pure mathematical research in the general areas of  dynamical systems  and  matrix  theory.  The dynamical  parts   largely involve theoretical  problems  in symbolic dynamics;   this  abstract s ubject is involved  in practical problems of  encoding data in magnetic media, and  it  has  a  finite  aspect  which  has  lent  itself  to applicability. (Abstract   classficiation schemes gave rise to an  algorithm which is  now   part of an IBM product.) The matrix research  is  a continuation  of  a  successful,  novel application of  symbolic  dynamics  techniques and viewpoint  to  some  old, basic and  difficult   problems  in another subject, the   theory   of   nonnegative   matrices.  The   underlying philosophy of measurable dynamics is  to use observations  of the  behavior of a system over time to  gain insight into the structure of the system.  In this one can  loosen the  notion of  ""time"" to include the spatial dimensions  of a crystal or the linear dimension of a DNA molecule.  Such  simple changes of  perspective can lead to deep and fruitful  insights  into how  the  structure of the system is encoded in  its temporal behavior.  A central theme of the work is to use  such simple real-world   models  to  obtain  deeper    understanding   of dynamical systems.  ***"

The first concerns the  problems of prescribing scalar curvature on the n-sphere with  certain hypothesis on the critical points.  The problem has been  solved in dimensions two and three, this project will consider,  with flatness assumptions on the critical points, the existence  of a prescribed curvature(s) for a given infinitely  differentiable function.  The second area involves the Weyl  problem with nonnegative Gauss curvature.  Roughly this problem  focuses on whether or not a sphere, with a given Riemannian  metric an everywhere positive Gauss curvature can be  isometrically embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space with  the standard flat metric.  While this problem has been solved,  only partial results exist for the case where the curvature is  only nonnegative.  To find necessary and sufficient conditions  for smooth isometric embedding when the Gauss curvature is only  nonnegative is the goal of this effort.  Finally, work will be  done in the study of the compressible fluid model of uniformly  rotating white dwarf stars.  Equilibrium solutions have been  established for small angular velocity and the nonexistence of  equilibrium solutions for large angular velocity has also been  shown.  What now must be done is to establish the existence of a  global branch of equilibrium solutions - which amounts to solving  a certain free boundary problem.

The first concerns higher order elliptic  operators on non-smooth domains.

The second set of questions  lies in second order elliptic theory, motivated partially by  examples connected with the square root problem of Kato.   The question of solving the regularity problem, which is the  essential goal, for certain complex elliptic equations has  only been completely solved for the one-dimensional equation.

There are several equivalent definitions ranging from the  probability that a Brownian path hits a fixed set to the  equilibrium distribution of that set as understood in potential  theory.  In recent years there has been considerable interest in  the study of global metric properties and characteristics of  harmonic measure such as the dimension of the minimal Borel  support, the size of exceptional sets for the boundary behavior  of the Green function, the bounds for the dimension distortion  under conformal maps, etc.  At the same time close connections  with the ergodic theory of analytic dynamical systems have been  established.  Harmonic measure has a natural characterization in  dynamical terms for boundaries which are like Cantor sets or  Julia sets, and ergodic theory provides a powerful tool for the  study of its metric properties.  In the opposite direction, the  estimates of harmonic measure describe the geometry of the  fractals and certain properties of the dynamics.  The main goal  of this project is to explore the fine structure of harmonic  measure for general plane domains as well as for some important  particular classes of fractals.  A continuation of studies on  various multifractal spectra that characterize the global metric  properties of harmonic measure.  Application to the ergodic  theory of Julia sets deal with the problem of analyticity of the  corresponding pressure functions and with the phase transition  phenomenon.  Efforts will be made to understand the evolution of  fractality in the structure of harmonic measure on the boundary  of diffusion limited aggregates.       Harmonic measure lies at the intersection of several  important areas of analysis and probability.  It seeks to measure  fine structure of sets.  It provides quantitative information of  highly complex object like fractals and badly disconnected sets  with  hidden structures arising in the study of two-dimensional  dynamics.   ***"

The  work focuses on three problem areas.  The first concerns Stein  spaces of dimension n with isolated singularities.  It is  proposed to investigate whether or not any relatively compact  subset can be mapped biholomorphically into an affine algebraic  variety of the same dimension.  This is not necessarily the case  if the singularities are not isolated, thus the result would be  best possible in this sense.  The second goal of the research  concerns points of finite type on smoothly bounded pseudoconvex  domains.  These are points on the boundary at which the tangent  space acts reasonably like Euclidean space.  It is planned to  show that at each point a peaking function can be found.  These  are functions which achieve their maximum (modulus) at the given  point and nowhere else.  Finally, it is planned to examining  smooth pseudoconvex compact CR-manifolds with strictly  plurisubharmonic functions.  Then, work will be done to show that  the manifold can be extended to a smoothly bounded integrable  almost complete manifold in which the original appears as the  inside boundary.       Several complex variables grew from the classical theory of  functions at the turn of the century into a separate and profound  discipline of its own.  The problems of interest are  significantly different from those which originally motivated the  field: to find that part of the one-variable theory which  generalized to several.

The emphasis will  be on identifying positive energy representations, putting at  disposal methods from operators in Hilbert space. The problems  include: stability of isomorphism classes under variation of the  deformations and also continuity as fields of C*-algebras for  variations within the stability domain. He will also work on  spectral duality for Borel sets in n-dimensional Euclidean  space of finite measure; and, more generally, on duality theory  for operator algebras, e.g., for periodic elliptic operators.  The isomorphism invariants for spectral pairs turn out to be  affine fractals with self-dualiy in their harmonic analysis.  Jorgensen plans to study this, as self-duality appears also to be  an important tool for other fractal objects arising in geometric  iteration theory. The methods include a recently discovered  (by Jorgensen in joint work with S. Pedersen) duality for pairs  of representations of the Cuntz-C*-algebras. This project  involves multi-dimensional wavelet generators. The method of  wavelets is a new mathematical field which, in the past few  years, has attracted much attention from natural scientists,  engineers, and experts in signal processing. Among new  mathematical disciplines, it is unique in providing so  many immediate and medium-term applications in so many diverse  fields. With wavelets, one can now expect, for example, clearer  transmission and more bands in such down-to-earth applications  as cellular phones, high-definition television and  high-fidelity music reproduction. Wavelets appear to imitate  biological processes like the eye and ear in that they  concentrate on borderlines or edges. Thus they are potentially  the natural interface for neural nets, the brain imitators of the  computer world. Though wavelet theory as a scientific discipline  was ""born"" in 1988, it  has its roots in the work of geophysicist  Jean Morlet, who devised an ad hoc wavelet-type tool to help  find underground oil deposits. The problem involved was a  familiar problem of inverse scattering. This is the point at  which Jorgensen's research in operator theory and harmonic  analysis can be applied.  ***"

A fairly well-developed theory has been attained  in previous work for flows in one space dimension and for flows which  are spherically symmetric.  More recent research has extended some of  these results to general multidimensional flows.  A great deal of work  remains to be done for multidimensional flows, however, and this will  occupy the greater part of the project.

While the main purpose for  constructing these models is to achieve a predictive capability, they  are far too complicated to be ""solved"" in any explicit sense.  On the  other hand, adequate approximate solutions can often be generated  by computer methods. However, the intelligent design of such methods  depends crucially on a rigorous understanding of why solutions do  exist, in what sense, and in what ways they are sensitive to noise in  the data.  The primary goal of this project is therefore to provide  such a rigorous mathematical analysis for these models; a secondary  objective is to apply these mathematical insights to the intelligent  design and analysis of algorithms for generating approximate  solutions."

This research is directed at  specific goals in this regard - the development of relevant new  techniques such as global stability of the Minkowski  space-time and the analysis of the Einstein and other classical  field theories.

Of the two central themes, one concerns Lagrangian coordinates  and allocation problems.  In its physical interpretation, the  work is concerned with the deformation or evolution of a material  body.  In particular, efforts will be made to understand how  compression and rotation control the deformation.  For instance,  if the infinitesimal compression is controlled, what other  quantity of the rotation must be controlled to assure that  the deformation be smooth?  This question, a Lagrangian version  of the Helmholtz divergence-curl decomposition for a velocity  or instantaneous deformation field, has arisen naturally in  several areas where one must compute large deviations  (computational plasticity, models for front formation in  meteorological sciences, discretization of incompressible flows)  as well as problems of allocation, where one tries to allocate  resources into a new distribution which minimizes the allocation  costs.  A second theme concerns free boundaries and their  singular perturbations.  These arise in continuum mechanics when  a rapid transition takes place in which the model assumes the  presence of a sharp interphase (the burning of a flame, the  solidification of a liquid, etc.).  Studies of how well the sharp  transition approximates the continuous phenomena will be carried  out.  For instance, the geometric properties of the sharp  transition versus a narrow band of continuous transition, or when  the limit of the continuous phenomena is actually the expected  sharp transition will be analyzed.

One can also consider the geometry and complexity of  sets in Euclidean spaces for their own sake, and look for methods  to detect when a set has some nice interesting structure, e.g.,  when it can be parametrized in a nice way with estimates. For  this latter endeavor harmonic analysis has a slightly  indirect relevance, by providing guidance for what ""interesting  structure"" might mean, as well as useful techniques. However,  many of the traditional tools of harmonic analysis do not apply  in this inherently nonlinear setting, and in fact there are  results in the geometric setting whose counterparts in classical  analysis are false.       The  work  of  Semmes involves the  interplay   between measure  theory, geometry and analysis. Given a set of  points  in space, one can ask whether it can be measured. In the  case  of  a one  dimensional  set, this is the question  of   whether  it  has finite  length. This can be a very subtle  question  in  analysis. Classical  answers to this question often  involve boundedness  of certain  operations on spaces of  functions on the  set.  In  this project answers to the question  of ""measurability"" will be sought where  the  classical  approaches cannot work. This  will  involve replacing  the  classical operations by more complicated nonlinear operations.  ***"

Connected sidelines are applications to Banach spaces, to  combinatorics, to probabilistic analysis of hard problems, to  random Fourier series and of course to more classical  probabilistic questions such as trajectories of stochastic  processes and gaussian processes.  The central philosophy is to  give priority to tools that require very little structure over  more specific arguments.  The ideas of isoperimetry in product  spaces, that have given a new understanding of the notion of  probabilistic independence will continue to be a central tool.  The true scope of these ideas has been realized only recently,  and the potential for future progress and applications should not  be underestimated.       The main thrust of this research is to pursue the  development of abstract tools of probability in particular in  relationship with the classical idea of isoperimetry. It was  realised by the investigator that the classical idea of  isoperimetry can be made meaningful in a much more general  setting than was previously believed. This gave rise to new  families of inequalities that have solved numerous problems in  abstract probability, and had impact in areas where probability  is a tool rather than an object of study in itself, and in  particular operation research and theoretical computer science.  The potential of these idea, both at the theoretical level and  the level of applications starts only to be understood, and  appears very promising."

The work involves extremal problems, ordinary and  generalized polynomial inequalities, difference and differential  equations, spectral theory of real, complex and matrix-valued  tridiag  gonal (Jacobi) and banded matrices, Toeplitz and Hankel  and Hilbert space operators.  Work will also continue on the  development of software directed at analyzing the numerical  aspects of orthogonal polynomials.  Specifics of the research  include investigations into conditions on assuring boundedness  for solutions of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous perturbations  oflinear difference equations in terms of their unperturbed  counterparts.  The ratio and comparative asymptotics of extremal  problems involving weighted best approximation of monomials by  lower degree polynomials will be taken up.  Efforts to understand  the connection between a Jacobi matrix and its spectral measure  and its analogues on the unit circle will also be made.  Work  will be done extending recent results on the asymptotic behavior  of Christoffel functions to measures in the complex plane and on  generalized polynomials and their suitability as means of  approximation.        Approximation theory and especially the theory of orthogonal  polynomials has fruitful connections with many branches of  mathematics such as differential equations, operator theory,  numerical integration, continued fractions and control theory, to  name a few.  These subjects have received strong impulses from  the theory of orthogonal polynomials in the past and this process  continues with increasing vigor.  ***"
