The conference brings together three leading researchers, Professors Tadeusz Iwaniec of Syracuse University, John Lewis of the University of Kentucky, and Juan Manfredi of the University of Pittsburgh to give the main lectures.  Professor <br/>Iwaniec's work on quasiharmonic fields of unbounded distortion has <br/>applications to non-uniformly elliptic PDEs including non-isotropic PDEs.  Professor Lewis has recently coauthored the successful resolution of the long-standing Kato-square root problem, and his past work has included nonlinear potential theory and the study of parabolic PDEs.  Professor Manfredi's recent work is on the infinity-Laplacian and past work includes contributions to the study of the p-Laplace equation.  We expect the meeting to bring together these and other experts in the <br/>field as well as newcomers.<br/><br/><br/>There are no standing conferences in analysis and only rarely other conferences in this region in the fall.  The organizers have structured the conference in such a way so as to keep the costs for the host university and participants to a minimum.  This allows a wide range of mathematicians to attend--mathematicians at all stages in their careers and from a variety of institutions.  In particular, we encourage mathematicians in the early stages of their careers to attend and give a contributed talk, giving them an opportunity to show their work and increase their visibility in the mathematical community.  The conference has historically attracted a number of researchers from small universities and colleges throughout the region.  This has fostered fruitful interaction among these institutions, and between these institutions and ours. It is the intent of the organizers to continue to work to attract<br/>these researchers.  It is the intention of the main speakers to publish a proceedings of the conference.  Dissemination of this knowledge will be of use to those in the field and related areas.  It is to be emphasized that in all announcements of the meeting, and through their professional contacts,  the organizers encourage and<br/>particularly support participation of mathematicians early in their career and of traditionally underrepresented minorities."

While there certainly is some interest in studying dispersive phenomena for linear partial differential equations, the main motivation comes from nonlinear partial differential equations. Indeed, nonlinear effects (which can possibly lead to blowup) are stronger in regions of spatial concentration of the solutions. Hence the dispersion reduces the potential for blow-up.  If nevertheless blow-up occurs, its pattern should largely be determined by the worst type of concentration allowed by the dispersion.  On the other hand, nonlinear interactions can affect the dispersion.  Thus one is led from the study of linear dispersion to bilinear estimates and further to the analysis of fully nonlinear interactions. In recent years this line of attack has proved to be highly successful in the study of nonlinear dispersive equations. Yet much more remains to be<br/>done, and one has the feeling that we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.<br/><br/> A simple way to describe dispersion is to say that waves  (e.g. sound waves, elastic waves, water waves, electromagnetic waves, etc) cannot stay spatially concentrated for a long period of time; instead they must spread out and decay. In linear problems different waves cross each other without interaction. However, in nonlinear phenomena waves will always interact. The strength of this interaction depends on the strength of each wave but also on their intersection pattern. These nonlinear interactions play an essential role in both the study of the short time behavior and of the long time behavior of various physical systems. Examples include elastic waves in solids, gravitational waves in general relativity, and many others. The goal of the proposed work is to contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of nonlinear wave interactions in the context of physically motivated dispersive systems."

A typical model consists of a chain of coupled anharmonic oscillators (or a non-linear field) coupled to two linear fields. The linear fields are given Gaussian distributed random initial conditions with, in general, different covariances corresponding to different temperatures. Depending on the couplings, the resulting equations for the oscillators or wave equations for the non-linear field are stochastic ordinary or partial differential equations. The goals of the research include showing the existence of invariant measures for the system of equations and elucidating the steady state thermodynamics of these measures, e.g., that there is heat-flow and entropy production. An ultimate goal is to understand the thermodynamic limit of such measures.<br/>2) Dynamics of an Elastica and Related Models as Problems in Wave-Maps. An example of a dynamical elastica is a curve (e.g., a thin but massive inextensible wire), moving in space, having both a non-relativistic kinetic energy and an internal potential energy given by the integral of the curvature squared over the curve. The Euler-Lagrange equations governing the elastica include a wave equation, 4th order in the spatial variable, and an auxiliary equation for the curve tension. The elastica equations are closely related to those for wave-maps such as the Landau-Lifshitz equations of ferromagnetism, and their respective analyses share commonalities such as use of the Hasimoto transformation. In previous work with a collaborator, the investigator has shown local existence for the elastica for initial data in suitable Sobolev spaces. His immediate research goal is to resolve the question of whether there is global existence or whether in some circumstances the elastica actually tears itself apart in a finite time.<br/><br/>General description: <br/>  1) Models in Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics. Non-equilibrium but steady state phenomena are familiar and ubiquitous in nature.  Good examples are steady heat flow through a material body with fixed thermostated temperatures over its surface, and an electrical current through a wire with different fixed voltages at its ends.  Surprisingly, there is no satisfactory mathematical theory or formalism for describing these phenomena, at least none starting from<br/>the level of particles and fields making up the material body. By contrast, equilibrium phenomena, for example the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility of a material and their dependence on temperature and pressure, are well understood from the microscopic point of view.  The investigator will consider specific models described by differential equations, the goals being to provide formalism for non-equilibrium phenomena and to develop the mathematical tools necessary to apply it.<br/>  2) The Dynamics of an Elastica and Related Models as Problems in Wave-Maps.  A dynamical elastica can be thought of as a thin inextensible wire (a curve) which is massive and which can flex in space. The differential equations of motion for the elastica are closely related to those for wave-maps, which describe, for example, the dynamics of ferromagnetic materials or more exotic sigma-models from particle physics.  The investigator is studying the long-time behavior of the elastica with the objective of determining whether it vibrates indefinitely or can in fact tear itself apart in a finite time.  A better understanding of the elastica behavior and related problems would be useful in applied settings including continuum mechanics and even the mechanics of large biological molecules. <br/>"

The systems of equations modeling the physical situation at hand are the conductivity equation, a class of Hamiltonian equations in phase space, the system of elastodynamics and Maxwell's equations.  The inverse problems consist in determining the interior conductivity, the Hamiltonian system, the elastic and electromagnetic parameters, respectively, in the interior of a body or object by making measurements at the boundary. We propose four major topics of research. The first one is Electric Impedance Tomography. In this inverse method one attempts to determine the conductivity of a medium by making voltage and current measurements at the boundary. The second topic is the determination of a Riemannian metric (anisotropic sound speed) in the interior of a domain from the lengths of geodesics joining<br/>points of the boundary (travel times). The third topic is seismic imaging. We plan to use the methods of microlocal analysis to generate wave-equation solutions that will help to image the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the Earth's upper crust.  The last topic is Electromagnetic<br/>Systems and Maxwell's equations. In particular we propose to utilize the fact that electromagnetic fields can be polarized to determine electromagnetic parameters like chirality, which measures the asymmetry in the molecular makeup of a material.<br/><br/><br/>Inverse problems arise in all fields of sciences and applications where causes for a desired or observed effect are to be determined.  We know about the interior structure of the Earth by solving inverse acoustic problems, the structure of DNA from solving inverse X-ray diffraction<br/>problems, and the structure of the atom and its constituents from studying the scattering when materials are bombarded with particles.  There are numerous other examples of inverse problems of practical importance. Material science provides one class of examples. One important task is to<br/>figure out what is inside a material without destroying it in the process. Medical diagnosis provides another area where inverse problems are of vital importance.  X-ray tomography and CAT scans, which are used in everyday life as diagnostic tools, are particularly familiar examples of inverse methods. In X-ray tomography high frequency X-rays are sent through the body and then the density is determined from the recorded information. The mathematics needed to recover the density was developed by Radon in the early part of the century.  The goal of the proposal on inverse boundary problems is to develop mathematical reconstruction formulas for several inverse problems arising in geophysics, medical imaging and optical imaging, analog to the one developed by Radon for the case of X-ray tomography.<br/><br/>"

The first one concerns the free boundary regularity problem below the continuous threshold. In the search of the right formulation for the two-phase free boundary regularity problem below the continuous threshold, the PI and C. Kenig made an important discovery. The common theme to most of the results in the literature concerning the regularity of the free boundary is that near a flat point the free boundary is regular. The PI and her co-author found a global criterion which guarantees the regularity of the free boundary but which does not involve flatness. Motivated by this, they are in the process of developing a new<br/>set of techniques to prove regularity of the free boundary in several different setups. The second question addressed in this proposal concerns the existence of smooth solutions for the Schroedinger flow. In the last couple of years several authors have focused their attention on the Schroedinger flow, which is the geometric equivalent of a dispersive PDE. The approach of the PI and co-authors establishes a bridge between the theory of dispersive equations and the traditional techniques in geometric analysis.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems arise naturally in physics and engineering. The free boundary may appear as the interface between a fluid and the air, or water and ice. In the filtration problem, which studies how water filtrates from a dam made of a porous medium (say earth), the free boundary separates the wet part from the dry part. Many authors have studied the central problem of characterizing the regularity of the free boundary. For the last 8 years the investigator and C. Kenig have undertaken a joint program whose main goal has been to fully understand the boundary regularity problem below the continuous threshold (in the example above this corresponds to the case when the speed of the water is not a continuous function). The success of this program has enhanced the idea that weak notions of regularity are suitable to study problems that so far had only been considered in terms of classical notions of regularity. <br/>The approach proposed to study free boundary regularity problems should have an everlasting impact. It offers an alternative to the standard techniques used in geometric analysis to prove that a set is ``smooth'' which require that it be flat, in some appropriate sense, which is well adapted to the given problem. The proposed program concerning the Schroedinger flow is a significant step forward in the development of the area of geometric dispersive systems. The success of this project will benefit both geometric analysis and the field of dispersive equations. Furthermore by virtue of being related to the Heisenberg model for a ferromagnetic spin system it might yield some insight into this physical problem.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

It involves the continuing development of non-perturbative methods for the<br/>proofs of localization and other properties as well as studying phenomena that demonstrate the limitations of non-perturbative results. Another major goal is the development of methods to study anomalous quantum transport to be applied to both deterministic and random potentials.<br/><br/>Our research concerns the anomalous spectral and diffusive properties of quasiperiodic and other deterministic and random structures. This is therefore research on the fundamental properties of disordered systems that serve as models of systems with impurities. Deterministic ergodic,<br/>particularly quasiperiodic, potentials are often used to model quasicrystals.  Study of the spectral and quantum transport properties of the microscopic models is important to understand and interpret much of the experimental data on quasicrystals. Such understanding may lead to finding new materials with desired physical properties.  Disordered systems are also used in modeling many other micro and macro effects: from quantum localization to earthquakes.

The main goal is to study analytically the behavior of the solutions <br/>of the partial differential equations, describing these processes. <br/><br/>The PI will concentrate on the study of the following equations: the Wave map problem, the Schroedinger map problem and the Yang-Mills fields equations. Following the fundamental physical principle that every physical system is trying to minimize its energy, one form and studies the solutions to these nonlinear partial differential equations, which arise as the minimizers of the corresponding energy functionals. The questions for existence, uniqueness and stability for these equations have been studied extensively in various settings. However to conform to a more natural physical situation, one needs to consider low regularity data. Stefanov will concentrate on showing regularity for solutions with critical degree of regularity. That is, one requires the least possible amount of smoothness in order to show that the solution exists globally in time. In the physically interesting case of small energy data (modeling systems that are very close to their equilibrium), the proposal will address the question of stability, i.e. whether the system will remain close to its initial state or will eventually develop some singularities. Stefanov proposes to study these problems, by using a variety of techniques including frequency analysis and gauge theoretic methods. A concurrent aim of the project is to make these methods more readily applicable to other problems.  <br/><br/>The wave equation models the propagation of different kind of waves in materials. Nonlinear models of conservative type arise in the study of vibrating systems and semiconductors.<br/>The nonlinear Schroedinger equation describes the propagation of a laser beam in a medium whose index of refraction is sensitive to the wave amplitude. Better theoretical understanding of the time evolution of these models will allow one to better predict the physical behaviour of such systems. For example, if a physical system of the kind described above, is stable (rigid) with respect to small perturbations, one could afford to have certain amount of noise/impurities in the<br/>system. The analytical study of the equations governing such processes will lead to a better understanding of the corresponding physical phenomenon. <br/>"

The principal investigator proposes to explore several interesting variations on this theme, each with a distinctly structure-theoretical flavor. A counter example to aforementioned question would present the first example of an infinite dimensional Banach space for which it is known that every operator on it has an invariant subspace. Secondly, he presents an approach to the most general formulation of the invariant subspace problem, namely: does every adjoint operator have a nontrivial invariant subspace?

Recently, there has been great progress in the problem of the existence of invariant subspaces of operators relative to a von Neumann algebra having a finite trace. A von Neumann algebra with a finite trace is an infinite dimensional, noncommutative analogue of a probability space, and many important classes of operators can be found inside von Neumann algebras having finite traces. However, the essential unsolved case and a key class of operators left virtually untouched by this recent progress is the class of quasinilpotent operators in a finite von Neumann algebra. The proposed research seeks to find invariant subspaces for them, relative to their von Neumann algebras. Free probability theory is an analogue of usual probability theory where independence is replaced by freeness, a completely noncommutative notion. Free probability theory and its off spring, free entropy, have been at the heart of much progress over the last decade in understanding certain classes of operators and von Neumann algebras with finite trace, called the free group factors. However, an outstanding open problem on them is whether all free group factors are isomorphic to each other or whether they constitute a diverse family. At the moment, this problem seems intimately bound up with the question of whether free entropy dimension is an invariant for von Neumann algebras having finite trace, or whether it can take different values on different sets of generators of a given von Neumann algebra. A second part of the proposed research will test this invariance question by computing the free entropy dimension of certain recently discovered ""exotic"" generators of free group factors. <br/>"

Christopher Phillips, proposes to follow up on his recent joint work with Qing Lin on crossed products by minimal diffeomorphisms, and on his recent results on crossed products by free minimal actions of finitely generated free abelian groups on the Cantor set. These results, and particularly the methods of proof, suggest that much stronger theorems should hold. Specifically, consider a minimal and essentially free action of a countable amenable group on a compact metric space with finite covering dimension. The ultimate goal is to prove that the transformation group C*-algebra of such an action is a direct limit, with no dimension growth, of recursive subhomogeneous C*-algebras. In particular, it should have stable rank one, real rank zero or one, and cancellation of projections. While the conjecture as stated is still far from being proved, the Principal Investigator hopes to make substantial progress by analyzing various aspects of it in isolation from each other; the idea is to put the pieces together afterwards. The Principal Investigator also proposes to investigate, where appropriate, the smooth counterparts of such algebras, to investigate the isomorphism classification of the resulting C*-algebras, and to investigate connections with orbit equivalence problems in topological dynamics.<br/><br/>A dynamical system consists of a space and a collection of transformations of this space satisfying suitable mathematical conditions.  As an example, consider the set of possible states of a physical system and its time evolution: the transformations specify for a given time and initial state what state the system will be in after that much time has passed. Another example would be a physical space and its underlying symmetries, such as the Lorentz group acting on space-time in special relativity. If the relation between the space and the transformations is simple, the dynamical system can be studied directly. When this relation is complicated, it is often useful to introduce additional objects; one natural such object is the transformation group C*-algebra. An additional reason for studying this algebra is that sometimes objects of physical interest are more closely related to it than to the original dynamical system; an example is the Schroedinger operator for an electron moving in a quasicrystal. The purpose of this project is to understand the transformation group C*-algebras in cases in which the dynamical system is complicated, but in which the C*-algebra seems likely to be amenable to analysis. (This incluse the quasicrystal case.) It also seeks to better understand the relation between the dynamical system and the C*-algebra, and to begin the analysis, in appropriate cases, of objects that are related to the C*-algebra but preserve more information about the original dynamics.<br/>"

Zeng, University of Virginia<br/>DMS-0239389<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>This project is concerned with various perturbation problems in the dynamics of some Hamiltonian or near Hamiltonian PDEs, such as nonlinear wave equations and nonlinear Schroedinger equations, etc. The main issues include: a) finding correct formal asymptotics and<br/>their rigorous justification when singular perturbations are present; b) studying the dynamics in neighborhoods of special orbits representing typical qualitative properties, such as periodic, quasi-periodic, homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits. Three types of interrelated problems involving perturbations will be investigated: 1) Regular Hamiltonian perturbations of systems with homoclinic orbits to saddle-centers, e.g. perturbations of sine-Gordon breathers. 2) Perturbations containing highest order derivatives. With this type of perturbations to PDEs, the nature of the systems can be changed dramatically, e.g. loss of finite speed propagation and/or disappearance of solutions backward in time. Impact of both dissipative and conservative perturbations on the dynamics will be studied. 3) Hamiltonian motions with fast oscillations. Averaging method and formal multi-scale analysis are applied in deriving the limiting wave or Schroedinger maps. In addition to justifying the convergence on various time scales, the structural stability will be studied, which are in the form of normally elliptic type geometric singular perturbation problems.<br/><br/>Many well-known evolutionary PDEs, as mathematical models, are approximations of real world dynamical systems. In order to have better understanding of the original problems, we need to study not only these PDEs, but their perturbations as well, which may include factors like small viscosity or weak elasticity, etc. On the other hand, while there are some special well-understood ones, it is usually rather difficult to study the qualitative properties and temporal asymptotic behavior of many evolutionary PDEs. Rigorous and formal asymptotic analyses provide effective ways to study the dynamics of systems close to those special ones. This proposal focuses on certain regular and singular perturbation problems related to waves, ferromagnetism, etc., involving rapid oscillations, strong dissipation, strong dispersion etc. In conjunction with this, it is also proposed to incorporate several aspects of this research into curriculum development. This effort will include an application-minded reform of some current courses and the development of a new graduate PDE dynamics course presenting the dynamical system point of view for PDEs. In addition, research and education will be woven together through the development and improvement of seminars and vertically integrated work groups.<br/><br/>"

The unifying theme for these topics is their relation to homogeneity statements.  At their most basic level, homogeneity questions ask: given two distributions, what is the largest set of functions on which the two distributions will agree?  The first topic concerns the homogeneity question for invariant distributions supported on the compact elements in the group.  This is the last unproven (in general) homogeneity statement, and it has implications for the ""fundamental lemma"" (which is a conjecture).  The second topic concerns questions of stability for distributions supported on the unipotent set.   The final topic concerns the meaning of the constants occurring in the Harish-Chandra-Howe local character expansion.<br/>The topics discussed above fall under the rubric of harmonic analysis on Lie groups.  This area of mathematics, which is solidly rooted in physics, was pioneered by Harish-Chandra beginning some fifty years ago.  Since the 1970s, much of the work in this area has been directed toward questions which arise naturally in the Langlands program (which seeks to relate, in a strong sense, number theory, representation theory, and harmonic analysis).    For example, Harish-Chandra studied the distributions which arise when one integrates over a conjugacy class.  From the perspective of the Langlands program, it is also important to study the distributions which arise when one integrates over certain stable conjugacy classes, that is, classes which become conjugate over an algebraic closure of the ground field.  The investigator hopes his program of research will contribute to future progress in this area.<br/><br/>"

The motion of the interface of general two layered fluid flow includes vortex sheet motion as a  special case. In a recent work, the PI shows that arbitrarily specifying independent position and velocity data generally will yield no Sobolev class vortex sheet for any positive time. Some crucial assumptions in this work are: the fluids are inviscid, there is no surface tension, and the interface remains a regular surface at positive time.  A problem of interest is therefore a well-posed model for the vortex sheet motion. The PI proposes to reintroduce viscosity into the fluids, and to understand the effect of the viscosity near the interface. This leads to the study of the zero viscosity limit of two layered viscous fluids. A related problem of both mathematical and practical importance is the boundary layer problem. The question is to find the zero viscosity limit of the incompressible Navier-Stokes flow in a domain with a fixed nonempty boundary. It is well-known that the difficulty is in the boundary layer, within which the normal velocity gradient generally becomes very large. The PI's approach is different from the usual one, in the sense that the PI will assume no knowledge of the possible limit equations. The PI proposes to analyze directly the Navier-Stokes flow, and to obtain the qualitative behavior of the boundary part and the interior part of  the solutions of Navier-Stokes equation. The method will be from harmonic analysis. It is expected that the techniques and results developed in solving the boundary layer problem will provide insight in finding a well-posed model for the vortex sheet motion.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to continue her study in the water wave problem. Recently, the <br/>PI proved the existence and uniqueness of solutions locally in time for the <br/>Water wave problem.

The method will be from harmonic <br/>analysis and Clifford analysis.<br/>The methods and techniques developed by the PI in solving the water wave problem<br/>has found applications in the vortex sheet problem. <br/>Success in this project will enhance our understanding of the wave motion, of <br/>the mixing of fluids, separation of boundary layers, generation of sounds<br/>and coherent structures in turbulence models.<br/>"

Roughly speaking, in <br/>harmonic analysis one investigates properties of<br/>functions and ``operators"" (i.e., mappings which transform one function<br/>into another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces,<br/>which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the pieces.  The<br/>name itself arose by analogy to the decomposition of a musical sound<br/>into its various frequency components, or ``harmonics"".<br/>geometric measure theory involves the study of the relationship between<br/>geometric properties of sets, and their ``measures"" (the latter are<br/>generalizations of the notions of length, area, and volume).  Partial<br/>differential equations of elliptic and of parabolic type describe a <br/>wide variety of phenoma in the real world, including electrostatics, <br/>certain fluid flows and elastic deformations, and various diffusion<br/>processes such as the conduction of heat, the flow of ground water, certain<br/>phenomena arising in the mathematical theory of population biology, and the <br/>pricing of options in financial markets.

The questions, however, differ from the classical theory (e.g. classification of irreducible representations).  The goal is to a) better understand finite factor representations of certain quasidiagonal C*-algebras, b) study approximation properties of traces and c) work on applications of the previous two topics to various open questions in operator algebras.  At this point, our hope is that this work will shed light on Elliott's classification program and Connes' embedding problem.  However, there may be more as we have recently noticed that these ideas have K-homological implications, can be used to prove a general existence result for the finite section method (from numerical analysis) and we would not be surprised if connections with geometric group theory were soon worked out.  Though these ideas are certainly in their infancy, they have solid historical foundations (e.g. Connes' uniqueness theorem for finite injective factors) and we believe the theory shows promise. <br/><br/>One very successful idea in mathematics is that problems about complicated objects can sometimes be solved using approximations by simpler objects.  For example, in calculus we teach students that to compute the area under a curve one should first approximate by rectangles since the area of a rectangle is easy to compute.  Operator algebras are (usually) infinite dimensional objects which provide the natural framework for many questions in quantum physics.  Moreover, deep and unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics such as geometry, topology and probability were discovered over the years.  As such, a solid understanding of the structure of operator algebras is important.  The general philosophy of using approximations by simpler objects becomes especially relevant here since the objects of interest are infinite dimensional.  The investigator will continue an established tradition of trying to use finite dimensional approximations to better understand some fundamental infinite dimensional objects."

Specific problems proposed are (1) Obtaining space-time Strichartz estimates for solutions of the linear wave and Schroedinger equations in presence of potentials with critical (i.e. inverse-square) decay at infinity and/or with local singularities.  (2) Proving stability of vortex-like wave maps from the Minkowski space into the sphere, utilizing the above estimates. (3) Obtaining a sharp dispersive estimate for solutions of the anisotropic Maxwell equations of crystal optics, one that encodes the direction-dependence of the decay.  (4) Proving global existence of small-amplitude waves for the Euler-Maxwell system describing the dynamics of plasma modeled by an electron fluid moving in a constant ion background.  (5) Using the wave map formulation of symmetry-reduced Einstein equations of general relativity to obtain results on the future and past asymptotic behaviors of Gowdy metrics, on the existence of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in symmetric spacetimes with twist, on the oscillatory approach to the initial singularity in these spacetimes, and on the global existence for the Einstein-Vlasov system in cylindrical symmetry.<br/><br/>Field Theory is the most enduring paradigm of classical as well as modern physics.  Electromagnetics, fluid and solid mechanics, weak and strong interactions of elementary particles, and Einstein's theory of gravitation are all describable in the framework of a field theory.  One of the most important physical phenomena to be understood in this framework is the  phenomenon of waves, their creation, propagation,  interaction, and dispersion.  Some examples are electromagnetic waves, material waves, and gravitational waves.  Each of the problems proposed here has a direct consequence in the understanding of a specific aspect of the wave phenomenon.  With the dawn of a new century, as advances in technology force scientists to address the inherently nonlinear behavior of nature in more detail than ever before, mathematical analysts are in a position to take up the challenge of doing research in those areas of physical mathematics that have long been neglected by others.  This fundamental research involves going beyond numerical simulations and approximate equations, and addressing the hard problems that lie at the core of the subject, i.e. in the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations.   Understanding nonlinear waves is an important step in this direction. This is very much a collaborative effort, and in particular collaborations with members of mathematical communities in <br/>other parts of the world where a tradition of caring about physical problems is well-maintained, provides us with an opportunity to play a role in preventing the erosion of the leading status of the US in these key areas of mathematical sciences.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The randomness is typically associated with singular dependence on the state variables and lack of compactness. Overcoming both issues requires the development of new methods and tools.<br/><br/>Nonlinear stochastic pde are very often used to model complex phenomena, like turbulent combustion, nucleations, phase transitions at low temperature, etc., It is therefore self-evident that there is a pressing need for the development of a mathematical theory for such equations. The theory of stochastic viscosity solutions, which is been developed by the PI and Lions, is of fundamental importance, since it allows for the study of a completely new and, at the same time, very rich class of nonlinear stochastic pde arising in many of the aforementioned contexts. As this theory becomes more available, known and developed, it is expected that it will play an important role also in applications, since it will provide the necessary tools to analyze previously intractable models.<br/><br/>The mathematical modeling of phenomena with many scales at the microscopic level, like turbulence, front propagation in phase transitions, spatial ecology, polymer growth, composite and perforated materials in mechanics, often necessitates the use of random pde with oscillating random parameters. At the macroscopic level these parameters ""average out"" and the phenomena are then described by an averaged (homogenized) equation. This leads naturally to questions of homogenization of nonlinear pde in spatio-temporal stationary ergodic settings, which, roughly speaking, are the most general settings where ""self-averaging"" is to be expected.<br/><br/>"

However, in this proposal we focus on practical questions<br/>only through  mathematical formulations, sometimes without proclaiming<br/>definite answers. We emphasize the fundamental role of the Jacobian<br/>determinant and other nonlinear differential expressions, called  null<br/>Lagrangians, which have driven (over the past twelve years) a very<br/>productive study of mappings with unbounded distortion. The present<br/>knowledge of null Lagrangians will tell us something about the regularity<br/>and topological behavior of those mappings. This also brings  us closer to<br/>the methods of harmonic analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations. However, we depart<br/>from the earlier theories, which are governed by<br/>uniformly elliptic systems, and move into the realm of degenerate elliptic<br/>equations, where important new applications lie. <br/><br/> Broader Impact.<br/><br/>Hopefully this proposal gives some appreciation of the<br/>diversity of applications and directions in which current research of the<br/>PI is moving, as well as a glimpse of the substantial body of joint work<br/>with young scholars. It is at this point where the proposed research meets<br/>the broader impact criteria, such as: effective training and educational<br/>materials, enhancing partnerships, participation of under-represented<br/>groups from non-PhD granting institutions in the USA and abroad, women and<br/>men. <br/>The Principal Investigator plans to organize a conference at Syracuse to bring together<br/>researchers in geometric function theory and in applied areas. The<br/>proposed program reflects continued efforts of the PI to reach out<br/>graduate students. In the final analysis, education is the path to<br/>opportunities for countless individuals, and the mathematical community as<br/>a whole is the beneficiary.<br/><br/>"

Phong, Columbia University<br/>DMS-0245371<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/><br/>It is proposed to address several problems at the interface of analysis with geometry and physics. A first problem is the development of stable analytic methods. Stable methods have emerged as essential for the study of singularities and oscillatory integrals, and for the basic problem of finding canonical metrics in differential geometry. Canonical metrics are expected to be equivalent to the notion of stability in the sense of geometric invariant theory, and the relation between this global notion and stable estimates is to be investigated. The second problem in the proposal is the development of Feynman rules for string scattering amplitudes. Feynman rules had been unavailable due to a geometric difficulty encountered for two-loops or higher, namely ``supermoduli"". But the situation is now much more promising, thanks to the recent success of Eric D'Hoker and the PI in overcoming this difficulty in the simplest case of two-loops. The third problem in the proposal is the construction/identification of integrable structures in supersymmetric gauge and string theories. A basic tool is a new Hamiltonian approach to soliton equations developed by the PI in collaboration with Igor Krichever.<br/><br/>These are core problems in theoretical physics and applied mathematics. The search of natural laws at their most fundamental level relies more and more on geometric principles and symmetry.<br/>The problems addressed in the present proposal - stability and canonical metrics, Feynman rules for string theory, soliton equations - are essential to the understanding of the two theories which have led research in both mathematics and theoretical physics for the last two decades, namely string theory and supersymmetry, together with their underlying geometric structures.<br/>"

The author intends to pursue his work on Schroedinger equations with both deterministic and random potentials. Some questions remain on discrete Schroedinger operators on the line with quasi-periodic potentials, whereas the case of potentials given by non-independent but more strongly mixing dynamics than quasi-periodic presents many serious challenges and more needs to be done in this area. For time-dependent equations questions remain concerning dispersive estimates, both for time-dependent and time-independent potentials. For the latter, it is unknown whether or not the usual dispersive estimate holds for potentials that decay faster than an inverse square power, at least for dimensions two and larger. The author recently established this in one dimension, but in two dimensions dispersive estimates<br/>under the assumption of strong polynomial decay are unknown. He believes, however, that dispersive estimates in the  two-dimensional case under the assumption of sufficiently fast decaying potentials is an accessible problem. The main interest in linear estimates lies with nonlinear applications. One example is given by the proof of asymptotic stability of weakly interacting multi-soliton solutions, which was recently established by Rodnianski, Soffer, and the author. It relied heavily on dispersive estimates for charge transfer models. Much remains to be done in this area, both in terms of nonlinear Schroedinger equations in general (global solutions for the critical defocusing three-dimensional equation), as well as questions concerning the dynamics of nonlinear bound states (solitons). In addition, the author intends to work on problems in harmonic analysis or applications thereof to problems outside of mathematical physics.<br/><br/>Much of the success of science and engineering lies with its effective use of mathematical tools, both in terms of modeling and numerical studies on computers. Mathematicians play an important role in developing those methods and making them available to scientist and engineers. This proposal aims at addressing mathematical problems that for the most part originate in mathematical physics. The aforementioned nonlinear Schroedinger equations arise in various<br/>applications, e.g., optics. A bound state (soliton) for such a nonlinear equation represents a particle or beam that travels without disintegrating. An important issue is to understand the stability or instability of such an object. I.e., do they persist under small perturbations or not?<br/>Clearly, any commercial application of a soliton in optical media will require stability of the soliton. It turns out that the theoretical understanding of these issues is very difficult, often requiring new insights into mathematical problems. This proposal aims at addressing such problems.<br/>"

Roughly speaking, the conjecture asserts that the representation theory of a reductive algebraic group over a local field is dual to a geometric category of equivariant sheaves on an associated dual space.  In this formulation, the Arthur conjectures may be interpreted as suggesting a very precise relationship between local components of automorphic forms and the microlocal geometry of the dual space (codified in the characteristic variety of certain equivariant perverse sheaves).  When the local field is archimedian, the local Langlands conjecture is a theorem, but the Arthur conjectures are ineffective in the sense that they fall well short of providing a conjectural enumeration of the automorphic spectrum.  We propose a project to extend the framework of the local Langlands conjecture to real groups that arise as nonalgebraic ""metaplectic"" double covers of the real points of algebraic groups.  Our approach is predicated on an intricate relationship between the algebraic and nonalgebraic theories which may be interpreted as a kind of ramified local Shimura correspondence.  This allows us to pursue some of Arthur's ideas in the nonalgebraic setting.  Finally in a separate project we propose a series of nontrivial and computationally powerful restrictions on the form that the characteristic variety computations can take.  (These computations are relevant for the Arthur theory for both algebraic and nonalgebraic groups.)  The restrictions we pursue give insight into making the Arthur conjectures effective for real groups.<br/><br/>The proposed research deals with understanding the theory of semisimple (real) Lie groups.  These objects arise most naturally as symmetries of finite-dimensional structures; the modifier ""semisimple"" means, roughly speaking, that the Lie group cannot be broken into smaller Lie groups.  An example of historical import is the Lie group of rotations in three dimensions (which codifies the symmetry of the spherically symmetric hydrogen atom).  One is often interested in how Lie groups can act on infinite-dimensional linear spaces (like the solution space of the Schroedinger equation for the hydrogen atom).  Such actions are called representations.  In the 1960's, Langlands suggested an astonishing relationship between the representation theory of semisimple Lie groups and a set of data of essentially arithmetic origin.  This is remarkable because it connects two subjects-representation theory and number theory-which are ostensible unrelated.  Subsequently the arithmetic parameters that Langlands suggested (and much more of Langlands ideas) became understood as a shadow of a deep geometric theory of singular algebraic varieties.  The proposer's research seeks to extend some of the ideas of Langlands, and consequent refinements due to Arthur, to a larger class of ""nonalgebraic"" Lie groups than originally considered in the original ""algebraic"" setting.  (The distinction is a little too delicate to make precise here, but suffice it to say that the nonalgebraic setting has been demonstrated to be very interesting from many perspectives.) Our research has a representation theoretic part and a geometric part.  Qualitatively the representation theoretic part is predicated on a precise relationship between the nonalgebraic and algebraic theories (revealing new information about each) and the geometric part turns on a latent structure of the parameter set mentioned above.  It is worth mentioning that for particular examples, these latent structures amount to a lovely (and very concrete) combinatoric which is accessible to bright undergraduates; I plan to direct undergraduate research projects based on this combinatorial theory."

More recently, it has led to classification results of braided tensor categories whose Grothendieck semi-ring is the one of a representation category of a classical Lie group or one of the associated fusion categories.  Wenzl plans to continue this study for the missing cases of spinor groups and exceptional groups.  Such a classification provides a bridge between different approaches towards subfactors via quantum groups, loop groups and braid groups, which is useful for a number of constructions. In particular, this will be applied to constructing additional important examples of subfactors related to coproduct actions and twisted loop groups. Moreover, Wenzl's analysis of certain braid representations have already found applications in other approaches to subfactors, such as  planar algebras  or loop group constructions; so similar applications would seem likely for the current  project.<br/>Classically, the study of symmetries in physical systems was closely linked to representation theory of groups. In recent years, however, results in areas such as conformal field theory, statistical mechanics and topology required more complicated mathematical tools. In particular, one has encountered tensor structures where the usual symmetries given via permutations of tensor factors are replaced by more complicated braiding symmetries. This has the advantage that one can read off much more information using the representation theory of the infinite braid groups than it would be possible with symmetric groups. So one can construct and classify such tensor categories  in many cases by just using results about braid representations.  This has been exploited in Wenzl's previous research, and he plans to apply this strategy for more complicated cases. This also has the potential for new results in the classical cases of group symmetries as limiting cases.<br/><br/>"

The novel planar algebra techniques will be used to investigate and construct subfactors through a generators and relations approach to the associated planar algebras.

For instance, the Fuss-Catalan algebras of Bisch and Jones, whose representations have been used to construct new integrable lattice models in statistical mechanics, appear as an important part of this classification program.  Annular Fuss-Catalan algebras will be investigated with the ultimate goal of using them to answer questions related to intermediate subfactors.  Obstructions for compositions of subfactors and rigidity properties of subfactors will be analyzed. Potential applications of subfactor ideas and techniques to statistical mechanics and quantum information theory will be investigated.<br/>Ideas from operator algebras and non-commutative geometry have gained increasing importance in conformal field theory, string theory and quantum information theory. It has become clear that the symmetries of non-commutative spaces and quantum physical systems can no longer be understood through classical mathematical objects alone (such as groups).  A subfactor can be viewed as a mathematical object that captures these new symmetries and operator algebra techniques can be used to analyze and understand them. A particular intriguing structure that appears naturally in this context are the planar algebras, a structure that allows one to compute with very abstract mathematical objects by simply manipulating planar diagrams topologically. Such a formalism is tailor-made for applications in statistical mechanics and new solvable models based on these ideas have already been constructed. One of the founders of the theory of operator algebras was John von Neumann who in the 1930's discovered that certain algebras of operators on a Hilbert space are the natural framework for understanding symmetries of quantum physical systems. His ideas play an important role in quantum mechanics and fundamental laws of nature such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle appear as a natural consequence of von Neumann's abstract theory. The theory of subfactors, which is based on von Neumann's concepts, had an important impact across several fields in mathematics and physics with profound applications to knot theory, low dimensional topology, statistical mechanics and conformal field theory to mention just a few.<br/>"

The first<br/>project concerns the interrelated analytic study of<br/>rational billiards, moduli spaces of abelian<br/>differentials, and the dynamics of the Teichmuller<br/>geodesic flow. A recent theme has been the interplay<br/>between the dynamics on flows on homogeneous spaces on the<br/>one hand, and the dynamics of flows on rational billiards<br/>and flat surfaces on the other.  This synergy has led to<br/>recent breakthroughs in both subjects.  Broadly speaking, the<br/>principal investigators propose to apply the methods and<br/>ideas developed in the case of homogeneous spaces to study<br/>rational billiards and dynamics on Teichmuller space.  <br/>The second project is to give a combinatorial approach<br/>to the study of Teichmuller Space and its geometry.  One<br/>of the major goals is to develop a complete analogue<br/>between this theory and the classical theory of the<br/>geometry of the modular curve.<br/><br/>Many natural phenomena are studied via the branch of<br/>mathematics known as dynamical systems.  One important<br/>example is planetary motion. Another centuries old example<br/>is the theory of billiards, or the study of collisions of<br/>molecules. Triangular billiards occur in the study of<br/>elastic collisions of two masses in an interval.  The<br/>study of a dynamical system can take many forms. One<br/>example is to study periodic orbits (or repeating<br/>behavior); another is to study choatic behavior.<br/>The principal investigators plan to study a variety of<br/>dynamical systems that occur in mathematics. One of the<br/>prominent topics will be billiards in polygons in the<br/>plane, and a generalization known as flat surfaces.  <br/>These surfaces also fit together into a family known as a<br/>moduli space, and the principal investigators plan to<br/>study dynamics on moduli spaces.

From the very beginning this field has had connections to potential theory, partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, and geometric topology.  The second half of the twentieth century brought about new areas like quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings, with links to nonlinear PDEs and harmonic analysis.  The research group is planning to tackle some of the most important open problems in this broadly construed field by using our diverse strengths.  Examples of the problems include understanding the integrability properties of derivatives of conformal mappings, finding criteria for recognizing metric spaces up to bi-Lipschitz or quasiconformal equivalence, further developing the theory of holomorphic curves and its quasiregular generalizations, and investigating algebraic conditions related to quasiconvexity of energy functionals.  The intellectual merit of our activity will be found in a deepened understanding of fundamental questions in Geometric Function Theory, in an increase of the links to other fields of mathematics, and in a broader scope of possible applications.<br/><br/>Core mathematics keeps reappearing outside its own realm with dramatic success and consequences. Recent examples range from cosmology (where deep topological issues arise regarding the proposed new dimensions for the universe) to material science (where deformation of elastic bodies are studied by methods of the Calculus of Variations) to engineering (where function theoretic methods have led to advances in control theory). The latter two examples are directly connected with the work of our research group, as are topological issues pertaining to the geometry of three dimensional spaces. Another new feature with possible far reaching reverberations is to use function theoretic methods in studying spaces that are not smooth in the classical sense; such spaces naturally occur when Riemannian structures degenerate and form singularities. The main strength of our group is that its members have common roots, but multifarious interests, so as to make advancement in and connections between separate fields. The broader impact of our activity will be the education of new scholars who understand the methods and techniques in the field, and who know how to find applications of their knowledge to other parts of mathematics and sciences. We will put great weight on passing on the important questions to the younger generation and on enabling them to perform independent research.<br/>"

The focus is on questions related to Arnold diffusion.  For small perturbations of strictly convex integrable systems in 2   or  3 degrees of freedom, Mather has recently succeeded in proving a strong form of Arnold diffusion.

In each case, it has to do with whether certain orbits of dynamical systems wander.  In the case of the tokomak, the mathematical questions is related to the physical question of whether the hydrogen atoms in the plasma collide with the walls of the container; in the case of the solar system it is related to the question of whether the planets remain orbiting the sun for all time, or whether the mutual gravitational attraction of the planets could cause one of the planets to wander away from the sun over a very long period of time.  It needs to be pointed out, however, that this project deals with a fundamental mathematical problem that originated in the study of physical problems of this sort; it does not address these problems directly.<br/>"

This involves interesting and nonstandard issues in singular perturbation theory, dynamical systems and bifurcation, spectral theory of linear operators, and nonlinear partial differential equations, and should result in the development of new mathematical tools of general application. The ultimate physical goal is an understanding of stability phenomena that is both more complete and more precise than can be obtained within simplified models: on the one hand resolving philosophical puzzles at the level of mathematical foundations and on the other yielding quantitative predictions at the level of practical application. The plan of attack centers around Evans function and related spectral techniques developed recently in the study of stability of viscous shock fronts.<br/><br/>The stability of regular flow patterns is an old and central topic in fluid, gas, and plasma dynamics, deciding which (stable) patterns will typically be observed, and which (unstable) are only mathematical and not physically observable solutions.  The transition from stability to instability is of particular importance, since it usually signals the arising of alternative, more complicated flow patterns close to the original (now unstable) one- this is a way to understand complicated flows by the study of simpler and better-understood ones.  Despite a large and well-known body of theory on this subject, dating back to the late 1800's, there are still many aspects that are poorly understood, particularly for compressive, viscous, or reacting flows.  Here, we propose to study several of these issues arising in compressible gas and plasma dynamics, and in combustion, applications in which such usually neglected effects are of considerable practical importance.  Our goal is, by including these mathematically problematic terms, to move existing theory from the qualitative to the quantitative regime, obtaining new information of use to practitioners at the same time that we advance the mathematical theory. The planned activities have both analytic and numerical components, and involve collaboration with domestic and foreign colleagues and with current and former graduate students and post doctorates. This may be expected to strengthen and extend existing networks of cooperation across field and institution, and to aid in training of graduate and postdoctoral students.  The ultimate aim of these investigations, of quantitative predictions of transition to instability, would, if achieved, be of direct and practical use at the level of engineering, in chemical, manufacturing, and other processes.<br/>"

For example, we intend to study harmonic maps from higher dimensional <br/>Riemannian manifolds into general target manifolds. We also plan to study nonlinear wave equations, using methods from harmonic analysis as well as vector field methods originating in differential geometry. In addition, we aim for a general convergence result for the Yamabe flow in conformal geometry. All known results in this direction either assume the manifold to be locally conformally flat (such as the work of R. Ye), or they require a rather restrictive bound on the initial energy (such as the recent work of M. Struwe and H. Schwetlick). It is known that shortly before a singularity the solution must look like a superposition of ""peak solutions"", whose asymptotic profile is explicitly known. A careful analysis of the interaction between different peaks suggests that it costs energy to make the peak higher, i.e. to concentrate the energy on a smaller region. Since the evolution equation is designed to decrease the energy, this indicates that no singularities should form. While the result is known for initial energy less than two peaks, the general case offers a more interesting picture.<br/><br/>The questions to be studied in this project are mainly motivated by differential geometry. However, it may seem surprising that many of these equations also play an important role in applied sciences. For example, harmonic maps into the two-dimensional sphere are closely related to the Landau-Lifschitz equation for a macroscopic ferromagnetic continuum. <br/>Moreover, the Yamabe flow in conformal geometry can be reduced to the fast diffusion case of the porous medium equation.

This new insight enables us to show a  noncommutative analog the maximal ergodic theorem for completely positive maps and study square function inequalities in this setting (joint work with LeMerdy/Xu).  The formulation and properties are motivated by the theory of Operator Spaces.  On the other hand martingale inequalities are crucial in understanding independent, indiscernable and exchangeable sequences in noncommutative Lp spaces and properties of almost uniform convergence. Martingale inequalities and noncommutative probability are also fundamental  tools in  analyzing the operator space OH and its realization in the predual  of type III von Neumann algebras.  These  techniques are similar to those used by Pisier/Shlyaktenko in proving  the noncommutative version of Grothendieck's inequality.  Surprising the analog of the 'little Grothendieck inequality' in the context of  operator spaces only holds up to a logarithmic factor.<br/><br/><br/>Quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and mathematical models realizing these phenomena changed not only our perception of the world but also the mathematical discipline. Many noncommutative (=quantum) generalizations of classical mathematical theories for example the theory of quantum groups and noncommutative  (=quantum) probability theory. Very interesting new phenomena  and difficulties arise when adopting classical concepts to this noncommutative framework. Noncommutative  measure theory and the theory of von Neumann algebras provide plenty of examples of genuinely new phenoma. Indeed, von Neumann's  motivation for his work on operator algebras (now called von Neumann algebras) was to provide a good mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics.  In this tradition the theory of Operator  Spaces provides the right language for quantizing Banach spaces, a notion developed  to describe the spaces of solutions of differential equations. For example, using this language  it is now possible to talk about the expected exit time for a noncommutative domain although we can never see the 'points' of this domain. As a long term perspective these mathematical  theories  provide new features which may  be used to understand phenomena in physics and other natural sciences.<br/>"

Because nuclei have large masses, their motion is well approximated by classical mechanics.  Electrons have much smaller mass, and their motion is truly quantum mechanical.  The electronic motion is influenced by the more slowly moving nuclei, and it is well described by the quantum adiabatic approximation.  This intuition is the basis for Born-Oppenheimer approximations.  Professor Hagedorn, his graduate students, and his collaborators will study situations where Born-Oppenheimer approximations are not sufficiently accurate to describe all the phenomena of interest. For example, they plan to develop accurate ""surface hopping models"" to include the possibility of electrons making non-adiabatic transitions.  Models of this type have been proposed in the chemistry and physics literature, but they have not been derived from first principles.  The main goal of this project is rigorously to derive and implement such models.  In addition, several other closely related questions involving semiclassical and adiabatic approximations to quantum mechanics will be studied.<br/><br/>The motion of electrons and nuclei in molecules is extremely complicated, and all theoretical knowledge of chemistry and molecular physics has come from approximations.

Tracy and the fourth joint with Estelle L. Basor. The first is to search for a system of partial differential equations for the finite-dimensional distribution functions for the Airy process, which is expected to describe all growth processes in the KPZ universality class. (This has already been accomplished.) The second project is to find limit theorems for the Hall-Littlewood polynomials, interpolating known results for the Schur functions (Johansson) and the shifted Schur functions (Tracy and the PI). New methods are needed here because of a lack of determinantal representation. The third project is to complete earlier work on the asymptotics of solutions to the periodic Toda equations by determining the asymptotics on the critical curves, where the asymptotics will take a very different form. The fourth project is to prove correct the conjectured constant in an asymptotic expansion of Dyson related to the spacings between eigenvalues of random matrices in the GUE universality class. To this end it is hoped to refine the method recently used by Basor and the PI to obtain the asymptotics of Wiener-Hopf determinants with Fisher-Hartwig symbols. <br/><br/>Many physical systems possess such complicated behavior that exact predictions become impossible. Random matrix theory provides mathematical models that allow a simulation of such behavior and predictions that allow comparison with experiment. This was its original motivation, but it has since had significant applications in other areas of mathematics, science and technology. Work of the PI (largely collaborative) in this subject has had application in statistics where it has been applied to the analysis of large data sets, in communications where it has been used to study the start-up behavior of a long production line or the transient flow of messages over a long path in a communications network, and in physics and technology where it has had an impact on the theory of gap fluctuations in a metal grain or quantum dot. This project is concerned with different aspects of the theory including the search for the solution to unsolved problems. The project is also concerned with the connection of random matrix theory with<br/>combinatorics and growth processes. This is a more recent development that could shed light on the question of universality of probability distributions related to the Airy process mentioned above. <br/>"

There is a rich and distinguished tradition <br/>of using these powerful tools in other mathematical disciplines, <br/>most notably in number theory and combinatorics. The research <br/>proposed is connected to several of the most exciting possible <br/>applications, including new implications to the theory of <br/>quantum chaos in mathematical physics.<br/><br/><br/> <br/>"

We have been and will continue to be particularly interested in two specific models: the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity, and micromagnetics. In the area of micromagnetics, we studied previously some simplified two-dimensional model in the asymptotic regime corresponding to sharp ""domain-wall"" transitions. We established some optimal energy estimates, and exhibited optimal patterns for the transition profile, which fit very well with the ""cross-tie wall"" observations, and gave a first example of a non one-dimensional optimal profile in a vector-valued phase-transition problem. We intend to pursue this analysis towards more physically relevant models. In the area of the Ginzburg-Landau model, we previously focused on understanding the apparition, structure, and location, of vortices. We established a Gamma-convergence result deriving a limiting free-boundary problem, and proved convergence to some limiting vortex-densities, which we characterized, for minimizers as well as critical points. The project is to pursue further the analysis in the regime of high-applied fields, and turn towards the study of the associated dynamical models. We hope to establish the limiting dynamical laws obeyed by the vortices, first for a finite number of them, then for an infinite number of them, via some new estimates and an energetic approach to gradient-flow. Beyond that, we will be interested in understanding better the convergence of gradient flows for general Gamma-converging energies.<br/><br/>This project, in the field of analysis and PDEs, is concerned with the analysis of statics and dynamics in some models from physics, in particular the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity and microagnetics. In both cases the focus is on understanding, via rigorous mathematical proofs, the qualitative behavior of solutions to such models, and in particular explain the structure and the dynamics of singularities arising in some asymptotic regimes.<br/><br/>The purpose of such research is thus two-fold. First to shed light on the understanding of the specific physical problems themselves: by obtaining asymptotic expansions and explicit formulas, one can explain physical experiments, confirm or disprove the validity of models, and by rigorous<br/>analysis one can one also derive reduced simplified models (for example reducing the dimension) that are easier to work and compute/simulate with. The second purpose is more mathematical. As mentioned, the underlying philosophy is to manage to reduce the original asymptotic problems to simpler limiting problems (of lower dimension) on which the core phenomena (here singularities) can be tracked down. This is the main philosophy of ``Gamma-convergence''. In order to perform such analysis, one needs to develop appropriate mathematical tools and provide the right settings to understand the phenomena. One also wishes to understand how much of the behavior is particular, and how much can be extended and understood as a more general mathematical phenomenon, with the hope that what is understood for one specific model may in turn help to understand others. <br/>"

Nachtergaele will work on model problems to develop such methods. Particular emphasis will be put on interfaces between magnetic domains and their dynamics. This is a fundamental problem in understanding the dynamics of magnetic memory devices, such as computer hard disks. The same mathematical techniques also apply to the new field of spintronics. The approach is to study a number of specific models with the expectation that a sufficiently detailed solution of these models will point the way to answers for similar questions in more general systems.

Considering for instance the 2D defocusing cubic NLS with periodic boundary conditions, what can one say about transition of energy to higher modes for large time? Only power like upper bounds seem presently known. The PI proposes to explore dynamical systems methods in this context.<br/><br/>In linear Schroedinger equations, things are better understood, partly due to progress in quasi-periodic localization.

They are supposed to model certain phenomena and their relevance here is often confirmed numerically. But while this stage of development from phenomenology to mathematical modeling is by most scientists considered satisfactory, it is usually only the beginning of purely mathematical exploration. The aim now is to study these equations rigorously as mathematical objects, independently of any a priori assumptions, and to try to recover the expected behaviour as mathematical theorems. On one hand, this line of thought has in the past led to some of the great mathematical theories of modern days (integrability, turbulence, etc.).

More specifically, in the first problem mentioned, they will be studying the distance from equilibrium of a many particle system as measured by entropy<br/>or related Lyapunov functions.  The goal will be inequalities that yield realistic rates of approach to equilibrium for initial conditions that are far away from the equilibrium state.  In recent work on the Kac model of molecular collisions, the investigators developed a method for controlling the rate of dissipation as a function of the number of molecules in the system.  New work will extend this to other measures of the distance from equilibrium that is better suited to initial data far from equilibrium.  The second problem is concerned with understanding the stability of matter problem for relativistic models with pair creation taken into account.  Moreover, various questions concerning the self-energy of systems interacting with radiation and the existence of ground states will be investigated.  All these problems will be treated from a non-perturbative perspective.<br/><br/><br/>It is a fundamental observation that many laws of nature can be formulated as maximization or minimization problems.  It is therefore important to describe the configurations of the physical systems that yield these minima or maxima, as well as understanding how these equilibrium configurations are reached by the system.  This proposal investigates such problems in specific but fundamental models.  These models are physically diverse: both classical and quantum, deterministic and probabilistic.  The common mathematical thread that binds these problems, and many others discussed in the proposal, is that they all lead to challenging problems in the calculus of variations.  Thus, they are tied together in that their solutions require new a--priori estimates, in the form of inequalities. This can be an estimate on the ground state energy in field <br/>theory or an estimate on the rate of dissipation in kinetic theory.  Ideally, these inequalities should be sharp enough to serve as the basis of exact calculations, and have applicability to problems other than the one that motivated them, as in the previous work on the Kac model.  What makes it especially attractive to work in this area is that it cuts across the boundaries of mathematics and other scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>"

And several different problems such as work distribution for equipment, the best use of sowing area, use of complex resources, distribution of transport flows, have a similar mathematical form. The understanding of the properties of optimal maps has also possible implications in numerical computations.

The P.I intends to study free boundary problems of interest in flame propagation, and related to Lord Rayleigh's conjecture that among all clamped plates of a given area, the circular one gives the lowest principal frequency. One of the main objectives of the proposed research is to prove regularity properties of the free boundary. Another area of interest is the optimal regularity of the solution and of the free boundary in the subelliptic obstacle problem. The necessary tools from harmonic analysis and PDEs for the study of these problems will be developed concurrently. The P.I. has also a program aimed at developing the regularity theory of minimal surfaces in Carnot groups. Such program entails the study of several basic questions. Among these, we mention the existence and characterization of traces on lower dimensional manifolds of Sobolev or BV functions. This issue is instrumental also in the study of the Neumann problem for sub-Laplacians. In connection with questions arising in geometry, the P.I. intends to develop a regularity theory for subelliptic fully nonlinear equations modeled on the classical<br/>Monge-Ampere operator. This program involves establishing an appropriate version of the celebrated Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci maximum principle, which in turn requires the investigation of a suitable notion of convexity. The P.I. is also interested in studying the method of ``moving spheres"" for so-called Weingarten hypersurfaces, and in its use to prove symmetry properties of solutions to fully nonlinear equations. The P.I. proposes to integrate this research plan with several educational activities. In particular, we mention the organization of an annual Summer Symposium at Purdue University. The P.I. will supervise undergraduate research projects as part of Purdue's REU program. At the K-12 level, the P.I. hopes to hook receptive young minds organizing fun, hands-on mathematics workshops at the local science museum, as well as in the framework of Expanding Your Horizons conferences. To increase the representation of women in the scientific community, the P.I. will also continue mentoring women in science.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems naturally arise in physics and engineering when a conserved quantity or relation changes discontinuously across some value of the variables under consideration. The free boundary appears, for instance, as the interface between a fluid and the air, or water and ice.  One of the proposed projects aims at studying regularity properties of the free boundary in burnt-unburnt mixtures. The results of this investigation will lead to a better understanding of the models, to the improvement of simulation methods, and ultimately to a precise description of how flames propagate in non-homogeneous media. The P.I. has also a research program that lies at the interface of calculus of variations, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory. The focus is on the study of analytic and geometric properties of solutions to variational inequalities and PDEs involving a system of non-commuting vector fields. The problems described in the proposal not only arise in a variety of mathematical context (e.g. optimal control theory, mathematical finance, and geometry), but are also of interest in other fields such as mechanical engineering and robotics. The P.I. is committed to the training of future generations of mathematicians, and to increasing the representation of women in the scientific community, via the organization of a variety of educational activities for graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students.  <br/>"

While most of these problems have by now been settled in the classical Euclidean or Riemannian settings, their sub-Riemannian counterparts presently form a body of fundamental open questions. One of the broader objectives of this proposal is to study some of them. This PI is concerned with developing a new theory of minimal surfaces, or more in general surfaces with bounded mean curvature, in sub-Riemannian spaces, study their regularity and classify the isoperimetric sets in some model spaces with symmetries. He proposes a calculus on hypersurfaces which hinges on the idea of horizontal Gauss map, and leads to a new notion of mean curvature The analysis of the ensuing nonlinear equations and systems constitutes a challenging new avenue of study. Within such calculus, minimal surfaces are thus hypersurfaces of zero mean curvature, and a problem of fundamental interest is a sub-Riemannian version of the famous conjecture of Bernstein. The latter displays a marked discrepancy with its classical ancestor and there is a host of new geometric phenomena connected with the singularities of the Gauss map which generically occur at those points where the subbundle which generates the sub-Riemannian structure becomes part of the tangent space to the hypersurface. Given the role of the classical Bernstein problem in the development of last century's mathematics, it is foreseeable that the theory of sub-Riemannian minimal surfaces and the corresponding Bernstein problem will sparkle a broad development. The PI also proposes to find the minimizers in the Folland-Stein embedding for groups of Heisenberg type and Siegel domain of type 2, and thereby compute the best constants. This program is instrumental to attacking the compact CR Yamabe problem for CR manifolds of higher codimension. In connection with the CR Yamabe problem the PI proposes to investigate a CR version of the positive mass theorem from relativity due to Schoen and Yau. It is expected that the theory of minimal surfaces previously mentioned will play an important role. Another emerging theory in sub-Riemannian geometry is that of equations of Monge-Amp\`ere type, which occupy a central position in geometry as well as in the calculus of variations in view of their tight connection with the problem of mass transport. The PI proposes to investigate a new estimate connected with a sub-Riemannian version of the geometric maximum principle of Alexandrov, Bakelman, and Pucci. In joint work he has recently obtained results for the appropriate class of ``convex"" functions, and, inspired by N.Krylov's approach, established monotonicity type results for a functional involving the symmetrized horizontal Hessian along with some appropriate commutators. Another problem included in this proposal is the optimal regularity for nonlinear equations arising in the study of quasiregular mappings between Carnot groups. This is presently a fundamental open question and, without its solution, it will be impossible to make substantial advances in nonlinear potential theory for sub-Riemannian spaces. In this connection the PI also plans to analyze the delicate question of the uniqueness of the fundamental solution and Green function, and study the geometric properties of their level sets. Other directions of investigation are the analysis of boundary value problems (Dirichlet, Neumann) for subelliptic equations and their associated heat flows, the study of free boundary problems, and the analysis of global properties of solutions to some pde's arising in geometry and mathematical physics. <br/>Partial differential equations and systems formed by the latter are the basic laws, which describe most natural phenomena. An understanding of the physical world also requires grasping the underlying geometric structure of the latter in its various forms. The present proposal belongs to the mainstream of research, which sits at the confluence of the theory of partial differential equations and systems, mostly of nonlinear type, and their connections with an emerging type of geometry, called sub-Riemannian geometry. Both theories have witnessed an explosion of interest in the last decade and they continue to attract the interest of various schools of mathematicians both nationwide and abroad. This proposal is also concerned with problems from mathematical physics and geometry in which symmetry plays an important role. Symmetry is present everywhere in nature, a remarkable instance being the fundamental laws of gravitation and electrostatic attraction. The study of conditions under which a natural phenomenon develops symmetries is important both for practical consequences and for its implications in the furthering of our knowledge. <br/><br/>"

From the very beginning this field has had connections to potential theory, partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, and geometric topology.  The second half of the twentieth century brought about new areas like quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings, with links to nonlinear PDEs and harmonic analysis.  The research group is planning to tackle some of the most important open problems in this broadly construed field by using our diverse strengths.  Examples of the problems include understanding the integrability properties of derivatives of conformal mappings, finding criteria for recognizing metric spaces up to bi-Lipschitz or quasiconformal equivalence, further developing the theory of holomorphic curves and its quasiregular generalizations, and investigating algebraic conditions related to quasiconvexity of energy functionals.  The intellectual merit of our activity will be found in a deepened understanding of fundamental questions in Geometric Function Theory, in an increase of the links to other fields of mathematics, and in a broader scope of possible applications.<br/><br/>Core mathematics keeps reappearing outside its own realm with dramatic success and consequences. Recent examples range from cosmology (where deep topological issues arise regarding the proposed new dimensions for the universe) to material science (where deformation of elastic bodies are studied by methods of the Calculus of Variations) to engineering (where function theoretic methods have led to advances in control theory). The latter two examples are directly connected with the work of our research group, as are topological issues pertaining to the geometry of three dimensional spaces. Another new feature with possible far reaching reverberations is to use function theoretic methods in studying spaces that are not smooth in the classical sense; such spaces naturally occur when Riemannian structures degenerate and form singularities. The main strength of our group is that its members have common roots, but multifarious interests, so as to make advancement in and connections between separate fields. The broader impact of our activity will be the education of new scholars who understand the methods and techniques in the field, and who know how to find applications of their knowledge to other parts of mathematics and sciences. We will put great weight on passing on the important questions to the younger generation and on enabling them to perform independent research.<br/>"

The work in  (1) uses an important result of Wolff in the theory of Fourier-analytic estimates associated to the light cone. Possible areas of application include (a) multipliers related to space curves, (b) generalizations of local smoothing to special classes of Fourier integral operators, (c) local smoothing of maximal averages associated with space curves, and (d) Hausdorff dimension of Kakeya-type sets. The projects in (2) deal with special cases of degenerate oscillatory integrals and integral operators in high dimensions (larger than two) that are known to exhibit features absent in their two-dimensional counterparts. The analytic machinery is that developed by Phong and Stein for the two-dimensional case, but the results obtained are of a very different nature. A long-term goal here is to devise an analytically accessible method of resolution of singularities. Another part of this work concentrates on the double Hilbert transform along polynomial surfaces, following Carbery, Wainger and Wright.  The projects in (3) are part of an effort to understand the spectral theory of Schroedinger operators with matrix-valued potentials. This draws on earlier work of Guillope and Zworski, Laptev and Weidl, and Korotyaev.  <br/><br/>The following is a more nontechnical description of the projects outlined above, with a brief note about applicability in scientific disciplines. The projects in (1) may be viewed as a study of wave propagation in non-uniform media (as used in seismic imaging). ``Local smoothing'' quantifies the gain in regularity of the propagating wave viewed as a function of space-time compared with the same wave considered as a function of space alone for a fixed time. Offshoots of this problem have combinatorial flavors in terms of arrangements of circles in the plane, as pointed out by Wolff. The projects in (2) deal with integrals and integral operators which come up in solutions to partial differential equations, including fundamental ones like the heat equation, wave equation and Korteweg-deVries equation. An important feature of these integrals is the presence of a complex-valued exponential factor in the integrand. In the case under study, the exponent is typically a polynomial that vanishes to high degree at a point. The ``order of vanishing'' of the polynomial contributes to the rate of decay of the integrals. A main ingredient in the analysis of these objects is a technique from algebraic geometry known as resolution of singularities -- a systematic method for factorizing polynomials and studying their roots.  The spectral theory of Schroedinger operators, which is the basis for the projects in (3), is intimately related to quantum mechanics, which finds vast applications in physics and many disciplines of the engineering sciences. The current project is to understand the spectral properties of the Schroedinger operator in dimensions larger than one, and more specifically to count the number of resonances of such operators. Resonances are generalizations of the concept of bound states or eigenvalues, and have a physical significance in terms of exit times in electron motion. The interdisciplinary nature of these projects has proved an extremely rewarding research experience for the applicant."

This research project concerns analysis on compact extensions  of nilpotent Lie groups. One says that the action of a compact Lie group K on a nilpotent Lie group N yields a Gelfand pair when the integrable K-invariant functions on N commute under convolution. The investigators will continue their study of such Gelfand pairs, in particular their study of the associated space of spherical functions, especially when N is a Heisenberg group. Specific goals include further development of algorithms for computing spherical functions and their eigenvalues, study of identities for generalized binomial coefficients, a description of the topology of the Gelfand space, and applications to questions concerning hull minimal ideals in Schwartz spaces.<br/><br/>The techniques of Fourier analysis, which traces its roots to the study of problems in heat conduction, are among the most powerful tools in the mathematician's arsenal. An important construction in Fourier analysis is the so-called convolution product. In the classical setting, convolution has the important property of commutativity. That is, one can rearrange the order of the factors in the product without affecting the result of the multiplication. There is, however, a modern and far-reaching generalization of Fourier analysis, like its ancestor linked to important problems in physics, in which convolution often fails to be commutative. In many problems in this type of analysis, which is done in the framework of objects known as ""Lie groups,"" noncommutativity arises quite naturally and cannot be avoided, leading to great technical difficulties. Gelfand pairs provide a device to recover the simplicity of commutativity in certain noncommutative settings. Each Gelfand pair provides an environment with enough symmetry to ensure commutativity of the convolution product. Such pairs are named in honor of the Russian mathematician I. M. Gelfand and have been studied since the 1950s. Their usefulness is now well established in connection with analysis in the noncommutative setting of semi-simple Lie groups. In the past decade, it has been shown that Gelfand pairs also arise in another non-commutative setting, that of  nilpotent Lie groups. The goals of this research concern the systematic study and mathematical analysis of this new class of Gelfand pairs, including the development of algorithms for explicit computations.<br/>"

The PI's will consider semilinear equations that model flame fronts, free boundary problems that are the singular limits of semilinear equations, and other models mentioned in the next paragraph.  The regularity for two-dimensional free boundaries in three-space was only recently established.  The PI's propose to show that such regularity results extend to a broad class of equations in three space dimensions, including as many physically motivated examples as possible.  In view of the strong analogy between the existence and regularity for free boundaries and the corresponding questions about minimal surfaces, it is suspected that regularity will break down in higher dimensions, where one expects to find singular energy-minimizing solutions, analogous to the celebrated examples of the Simons cone and of counterexamples to the Bernstein problem. Finally, the PI's will examine global behavior of level sets. For example, consider a Neumann eigenfunction corresponding to the smallest, nonzero eigenvalue in a convex planar domain.  J. Rauch conjectures that all its level curves touch the boundary.<br/><br/>This project focuses on problems in nonlinear differential equations in which the boundary is unknown and has to be determined: a so-called free boundary.  The classical Stefan problem of melting ice is an example.  In the Stefan problem, the question of interest is the location, as a function of time, of the interface (``free boundary'') between water and ice. The particular problems to which the methods of the present proposal apply also include flame fronts, the interface between oil and water in a flow and the profile of the wake of a boat. The PI's treat both equilibrium and evolution problems.  Recently PI Jerison established that certain equilibrium problems in three dimensions have well-behaved solutions, where previously only the two-dimensional case was understood.  Because three is the dimension of physical space, this discovery opens the door to other physically meaningful mathematical models, such as models of compressible fluids and capillarity.  Another kind of free boundary problem, one which is not at all physical in origin but to which mathematical free boundary theory applies, is the sort that arises in decision theory (PI Stroock).  For example, one wants to know when continuing a medical trial is likely to cause more harm than good.  Similarly, in a financial context, one wants to know when interest rates and stock prices indicate that it would be wise to buy or sell a stock option. Such questions arise when one is trying to price an American option, that is, an option that can be exercised at any time before it expires instead of at a fixed time.<br/><br/>"

The best and most completely understood example in this field is the unilateral shift, which simply takes every element in an orthogonal basis of a Hilbert space indexed by the nonnegative integers and ""shifts"" it to the element with one higher index.  This operator is the simplest example of a nonnormal operator with genuinely infinite dimensional properties and its study has been of major importance in Operator Theory. The unilateral shift is modelled by the operation of multiplication by the coordinate function z on the Hardy space of complex analytic functions on the unit disc in the complex plane. It is this modelling that has been at the heart of the study of the unilateral shift and that has led to our remarkably thorough understanding of it, and also to important results in the theory of general contraction operators. There has been much research since the 1980's that has shown that the ideas used in connection with the study of the unilateral shift have interesting and important extensions to the study of operators modelled in function spaces other than the Hardy space.  Among the important examples of such spaces are the Dirichlet Space, the Bergman Space, and the weighted Bergman spaces. Richter and Sundberg will continue to study these and other spaces with a view especially to a better understanding of their lattices of subspaces invariant under the operation of multiplication by z, as well as related questions concerning zero sets, nontangential limiting behavior, and polynomial approximations.<br/><br/>The proposed work involves several areas of Pure and Applied Mathematics.  Operator Theory as a branch of Functional Analysis, arose in the 1880's in the study of Partial Differential Equations arising in Physics and Engineering, and became increasingly important in the twentieth century with the advent of Quantum Mechanics. Complex Analysis is a subject with a long and distinguished history and a wide applicability - it has in fact important applications in almost every area of Mathematics as well as many areas of Physics. In particular, Complex Analysis has been of importance in Operator Theory from its inception and the investigations and connections between these areas continues to be a very fruitful area of research. One important source of connections is the modelling of operators by natural operations on spaces of analytic functions. The study of such operators on a space called the Hardy space has been of great importance in both Pure and Applied Mathematics.

The PI plans to further develop the applicability of the method of Bellman functions to a broader range of problems and study its connection with other common tools that appear in harmonic analysis.<br/>This method plays a crucial role in the PI's work concerning singular integral operators in weighted and unweighted spaces. The problems include sharp numerical bounds for the Beurling operator in Lebesgue spaces (the famous p-1 problem) as well as suitable sharp norm estimates for Riesz transforms in n dimensional weighted Lebesgue spaces, preferrably independent of the dimension. A related direction the PI is interested in is concerned with boundedness of a particular singular integral operator such as the Hilbert transform if the source and the target space have a different weight. <br/><br/>This project lies in harmonic analysis, which has been a <br/>central area of mathematics for a long time. Many questions in other fields reduce to questions best posed and solved in the framework of analysis. Such questions include the existence of <br/>special building blocks of functions (wavelets) that are particularly well-suited for applications in signal processing. Other questions include the boundedness property of so-called singular integral operators, which are of extreme importance in problems in partial <br/>differential equations, and physics. The PI's work consists of studying the continuity properties of such operators in detail.<br/><br/>We often study singular integral operators through their actions on the building blocks, using a technique inherited and modified from stochastic optimal control. This method, called method of Bellman functions, provides a simpler yet often more powerful alternative to very involved tools in harmonic analysis. In addition, through its relative simplicity still being accessible to those with less specialized background knowledge, for example scientists in other fields. As such it serves both as link to other scientific fields, furthering interdisciplinary communication and provides a possibility of early involvement of undergraduates or beginning graduate students into research."

It will concentrate on: groups generated by finite automata, hyperbolic groups in the sense of Gromov, Burnside groups, lattices in Lie groups, groups of intermediate growth, and<br/>discrete groups of Lie type. The questions concerning these groups are related to many areas of mathematics mentioned in the next section. The subjects discussed during the conference will be related to growth of groups, subgroup growth, property (T), expanders and Ramanujan graphs, amenability, non-commutative dynamical systems, random walks on groups, formal languages, branch groups, automata groups, fractal groups and fractal sets, computation of spectra of Hecke operators, L2-invariants, bounded cohomology, and the structure of lattices in Lie groups.  A special emphasis will be put on branch groups, as this conference is dedicated to R. Grigorchuk on the occasion of his 50th anniversary.  The main topic of the conference belongs of course to Group Theory, but it is also closely related to Dynamical Systems, Ergodic Theory, Geometry of Metric Spaces, Low-dimensional Topology, Discrete Mathematics, Harmonic Analysis, Operator Algebras,<br/>Representations of Groups, and L2 Cohomology.<br/><br/>                  Non-Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The planned conference ``Groups--2003'' in Gaeta, Italy intends to be a meeting point for mathematicians with various specialties, with group theory serving as a unifying ground. While centered on abstract algebra, participants with a background from statistics, theoretical physics as well as the broad spectrum of pure mathematics will contribute talks that stress as much as possible the unifying nature of mathematics in general, and group theory in particular. Time will generously be alloted for informal discussion and fruitful exchanges between the participants. These will comprise both internationally<br/>renowned experts and graduate students or young researchers who wish to embark in the rapidly progressing field. Proceedings of the conference will be edited, and assemble contributions from the participants. This conference is fittingly dedicated to Professor Grigorchuk for his 50th  birthday, who by his numerous contributions to various diverse fields of mathematics has illustrated the goals of this conference.<br/><br/>"

What are the conditions on the initial profile that guarantee ``a long life'' for the wave? And if the wave  does ``live'' for a long time, which of its initial properties are preserved? A satisfactory analysis of these phenomena requires answering questions on long time existence and uniqueness for the solution of the associated Cauchy problem, as well as regularity properties of the solution. It requires also analyzing continuity with respect to the initial profiles, possible blow-up of some energies in finite time, and rate of blow-up. A mathematically rigorous approach to the questions of long time existence and blow-up is very difficult. Certainly  numerical methods provide a guide for theoretical results. But it is  believed that the analytic techniques available at the moment are not  fine enough to recover the predictions of the numerical work. The techniques that proposer uses are purely analytical. The tools that she employs have been recently developed in the general area of Fourier Analysis and Harmonic Analysis.

For those representations occuring in the Plancherel density of the associated Riemannian symmetric space they used their construction to identify a natural Kahler structure on these domains. We shall attempt to enlarge the class of the unitary representations so related to complex differential geometry by studying Kahler structures on vector bundles over the previously constructed domain. The success of such a complex differential geometric formulation of parts of the unitary dual should have interesting applications to harmonic analysis. Also following up on our previous work, we shall attempt to obtain estimates on the Fourier coefficients of automorphic functions by analyzing the boundary values of their holomorphic continuation on the distinguished boundary of this domain. A different project is joint work with Slupinski in which we propose to obtain very detailed structure of the topology and differential geometry of nilpotent co-adjoint orbits of semisimple Lie groups. We have identified a class of orbits associated to 5-gradings of the corresponding Lie algebra and have substantial progress towards relating this to an extended version of conformal geometry. Possible payoff of these investigations include a compactification of the moduli space of exceptional holonomy structures on low dimensional manifolds as well as a geometric construction of representations associated to these orbits.<br/>Any complex nxn matrix may be written as a sum of two matrices where one is diagonalizable and the other is nilpotent, i.e. the matrix times itself some number of times is the zero matrix. The group of invertible matrices acts via conjugation (i.e. pre-multiply by the matrix and post-multiply by the inverse) on the vector space of all complex nxn matrices. As the sets of diagonalizable and nilpotent matrices are preserved it is reasonable to seek for each matrix a representative from these classes which is in some uniformly recognizable form.  For the diagonalizable class the diagonal matrices are a natural choice and are universally used. On the other hand, the nilpotent elements have only a finite number of possibilities leading to the familiar standard form called Jordan blocks in linear algebra. These finitely many possibilities of a fixed block seem to be richer in geometric structure that those of the semisimple classes but much less understood. The proposed research is give a detailed description of the differential geometry of these class of nilpotent matrices. Somewhat surprisingly, the geometry these classes lead to include ones of current interest to theoretical physicists in string theory as well as geometers. One of the applications of our work is to present a space of such geometries, and to examine possible degenerations in the geometry as one approaches the boundary of the space. Another possible application of our description is towards identifying new geometries associated with certain algebraic structures on the space of matrices. Our approach has many points of contact with a construction proposed many years ago in relativity theory by the physicist Penrose using an algebraic object called spinors. Indeed, the use of higher dimensional spinors is critical to our investigations.<br/>"

The continuous extension of biholomorphic mappings between general smoothly bounded, pseudoconvex domains, in higher dimensional complex space, to their boundaries; B). The square-integrable cohomology of the Cauchy-Riemann operators in the Bergman and other Kaehler metrics; C). Hoelder regularity of solution operators to the Cauchy-Riemann equations; D). Potential-theoretic conditions related to compactness of the Neumann operator associated to the Cauchy-Riemann complex. Our attack on these problems will be through certain partial differential equations associated to the Cauchy-Riemann and Laplace operators. In our problems, we are in a situation where classical estimates do not provide enough information on the Cauchy-Riemann and Laplace operators to conclude the results we expect. Thus, our approach will be to perturb the  Cauchy-Riemann and Laplace operators suitably, obtain strong estimates on the perturbed operators, and then connect these estimates to the unperturbed operators.<br/>The starting point is a twisted version of the Cauchy-Riemann complex.This twisted complex has already produced some powerful results in complex analysis and it is currently being extended to other contexts by several mathematicians, including the proposer. We view its continued development as one of the very fertile ideas presently ongoing in several complex variables.<br/><br/>We also currently have three graduate students who are working on problems closely related to these topics; their problems deal with estimating the weighted Bergman projection on some finite type domains, studying the condition of self-bounded gradient and its relationship to subellipticity of the Neumann problem and hyperbolicity, and strengthening the Sobolev embedding theorem on convex domains of finite type.<br/><br/><br/>Our proposed research will make a significant contribution to certain broad,general question: by how much may one perturb a system of partial differential equations and still obtain information on the unperturbed system from the perturbed system? The results we expect will have many connections to areas of mathematics outside complex analysis, especially topology (through the connection between square-integrable cohomology and ordinary homology), differential equations,and algebraic geometry (by deepening our understanding of order of contact between algebraic and analytic varieties).In addition, however, since partial differential equations are ubiquitous throughout science and engineering, our perturbation methods will be useful outside pure mathematics. We believe that adaptations of our perturbation methods will apply to partial differential equations which arise in parts of current scientific theory and our proposed research will thereby strengthen ties and establish new connections between complex analysis and other fields of science.<br/><br/>"

When the models are nonlinear the long-term behavior, or dynamics, of these models can be chaotic and the dependence of the dynamics on the parameters of the model can be extraordinarily delicate. One classic approach to understanding the fundamental mechanisms that explain nonlinear dynamics is to look for generic behavior in the collection of all maps or diffeomorphisms; another approach is to look carefully <br/>at well chosen special families. Recent advances in one variable dynamics show that these approaches can be complementary. In particular the study of the complex quadratic family has led to new results about analytic and smooth unimodal families of real maps. The PI will study a particular family of two-dimensional dynamical systems: polynomial diffeomorphisms in two complex dimensions. These will be studied from many points of view. The PI will use ideas from <br/>the study of smooth diffeomorphisms of surfaces,  methods from potential theory, methods from dynamics in one complex variable and computer tools. The hope is to provide a pathway for the migration of ideas from one-dimensional complex dynamics to higher dimensional real and complex dynamics.<br/><br/>The understanding of mathematical models that describe how systems evolve with time continues to provide essential insights in many areas of science.  Such models are used to describe the rhythms of the heart, the pulsing of lasers and the spread of disease. Despite the progress that has been made there are still fundamental problems remaining in the study of such mathematical models. Even seemingly simple models can present formidable mathematical difficulties. In the past 20 years important progress has been made in using ideas connected with fractal objects such as Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set in understanding the dynamics of systems with one degree of freedom. The aim of the proposed research is to bring some of these new methods and concepts to bear on the problem of understanding systems with two degrees of freedom. If these ideas prove fruitful there could be a positive effect on the field of dynamical systems. This could in turn have an influence on a range of scientific fields in which mathematical models of time evolution play a role.<br/><br/><br/>"

A main new objective consists in the application of this program to the context of modular forms and modular correspondences, in order to uncover  the hidden compatibility between the pointwise product of modular forms and the action of the Hecke operators.  Another major goal of the proposed research is the elaboration of a K-theoretic interpretation for the Godbillon-Vey class and for other secondary invariants, by means of a refinement of the operator-theoretic local index formula that lies at the core of the program. <br/>The proposed work will contribute to the development of new mathematical tools for the treatment of a multitude of non-classical spaces, which have a discernible geometric meaning but cannot be adequately described by means of commuting coordinates.  Such spaces, arising in many areas of mathematics and physics, have in common the feature that their observable local parameters behave like infinite-dimensional matrices rather than numerical variables.  To deal with them efficiently much stretching and rethinking of the known geometric techniques is required, process that has led to the development of noncomutative geometry. A distinctive feature of the present project is the systematic utilization of non-classical symmetry principles.  <br/>  <br/>"

The proposed work falls into three areas as follows:<br/>(i) (jointly with S Vaienti) The first area of research is to investigate under what conditions `cylinder neighbourhoods' if a dynamical system have mesures that are lognormally distributed. We are moreover interested in the speed of convergence to the Central Limit Theorem for a wide class of dynamical systems where the mixing is allowed to be `delayed' according to the smallness of the return neighbourhood.<br/>We expect that our techniques will also enable us to do a fine analysis of the repeat time statistics in terms of the Law of the Iterated Logarithm and the Invariance Principle.<br/>(ii) (jointly with S Vaienti) In the last three years we have developed a general scheme that can be used to determine the limiting distribution of return times. We wish to carry this scheme further by basing it on the `tower construction' which was used by L S Young to obtain rates of decay for the correlation function.<br/>(iii) (jointly with H Hu) The third area of research is on parabolic maps that have very pronounced parabolicity so that the generic invariant measure is infinite. The transfer operator in this case converges to a constant which is entirely determined by the behaviour of the map at the parabolic point. We want to determine the rate of convergence using the Hilbert metric method and some results from renewal theory.<br/><br/>Out of the three problems considered the first two in particular have their origin in Shannon's work in information theory: Dynamical systems are characteristically analysed by using the coding which is derived by tracing orbits and identifying them according to the partition elements they pass through. In this way a `cylinder set' represents a given sequence of symbols and it is a classical problem in coding theory to determine the return statistics of this sequence. Shannon and others have shown that expected return time is typically exponential where the rate is equal to the metric entropy (i.e.\ the average information content). The study of return times has for instance been beneficial in the implementation of data compression schemes.<br/>Generally a detailed knowledge of the distribution of return times is necessary to do a reliable analysis of time series that might come from experimental data or numerical simulations. The proposed research focuses on finding general conditions for a large variety of dynamical systems under which the return times are in the limit lognormally distributed and also to provide error terms. The error terms will depend on the dynamical parameters of the system."
