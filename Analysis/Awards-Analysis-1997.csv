This lack of group structure can   often be compensated  if the measures on H form a hypergroup or some   more general measure algebra with the basis functions as characters.   The research proposed here falls into several areas: (1) Extend the   proposers' work on the  classification of hypergroups with polynomial   characters to those with multivariable polynomials as characters,  (2) continue to investigate the relation between hypergroups and   linear (partial) differential operators, (3) develop  the abstract   harmonic analysis of hypergroups, especially in the light of the  behavior of the maximum subgroup, (4) investigate the harmonic  analysis of the spheroidal wave functions which arise in signal   processing and other applications, (5) study the properties of   non-hypergroup measure algebras with orthogonal polynomial characters.  and (6) a student research project.     It is well known that any sound, no matter how complicated,   can be decomposed into a series of pure tones, such as those produced   by a tuning fork. This kind of decomposition of a complicated object   into simple building blocks (such as the tuning fork tones) is at the   heart of many modern technologies such as signal compression and high   definition TV, cat scans, nmr scans and image processing. It also   plays a role in mathematical modeling of climate and other physical   phenomena as well as for many important problems inside of mathematics.   In many of these situations, the basic building blocks are more   complicated than the pure tuning fork tones. The purpose of this   project is to study and understand the properties of a variety of   these systems of building blocks and to discover new systems that  may prove to be useful in the future."

The main steps in solving this problem are: (1) Study a canonical boundary condition defined by the Calderon projector constructed from the bounding manifold.  (2) Reduce the K-theoretic index of the boundary value problem to the noncommutative spectral flow from the original bmundary condition to the Calderon projector.  These steps provide an identification of the boundary value index at the K-theory level. To get more explicit formulae for the index, one then needs to calculate the Chern character of the index in cyclic homology. Using the formula for the cyclic character for the spectral flows, this amounts to identifying the higher (cyclic) eta-invariant of the boundary Dirac and the Calderon projector in terms of the geometry of the bounding manifold.     A successful solution of the higher index problem would lead to many interesting applications in differential geometry and topology.  It also provides valuable theoretical understandings to the study of boundary value problems of elliptic partial differential equations arising from various applied scientific fields and engineering."

The goal of this special year is to develop some of   the new connections between nonlinear partial differential equations and   such diverse areas as fluid mechanics, phase transitions, free boundary   problems, materials science, and mean curvature flow. The focus of this   emphasis year will be an International Conference on Nonlinear Partial   Differential Equations and Applications in the Spring of 1998. During the   year, a series of visits of experts and junior researchers in the indicated   areas is planned.    Nonlinear partial differential equations arise in almost all areas of science   and engineering. In particular, they arise in materials science, biophysics,   environmental and global change processes, and industrial manufacturing   processes.  These equations are predominant in such areas as elasticity,   plasticity, semiconductors, biological transport of ions, phase transitions,   multi-phase processes, combustion, and etching and deposition  processes.   Understanding solutions of such nonlinear equations enables one to gain   new physical insights, to discover the intrinsic laws, and, in turn, to solve   some challenging problems in these areas.  The proposed project is intended   to bring together a diverse group of applied mathematicians and theoretical   analysts in partial differential equations and their applications who are able   to explore connections between their fields.  Individuals will be selected   who can share expertise with an eye toward applications in the indicated   areas in applied sciences and other mathematical areas represented by the   Northwestern faculty.  Researchers with such diverse expertise have often   unexplored common interests which, by means of fruitful exchanges, can   lead to novel results and discoveries.  Particular attention will be focused on   the p articipation of recent doctoral recipients and/or graduate students in   order to foster their interests in nonlinear partial differential equations and   applications in science and engineering."

Following are brief descriptions of the proposed research.    (1)Research on strong moment problems will be focused on determining   all solutions of a given problem when more than one solution is   known to exist.  For certain classes of problems we propose to show   that there are infinitely many solutions in the form of step-functions.    For the infinite family of moment problems associated with   bi-sequences of log-normal moments, we propose to obtain explicit   expressions for all solutions of the moment problems, by using the   Nevanlinna parametrization.  (2) A primary goal for research in this   area is the determination of explicit formulas for OLPS's  that are   analogues of the classical orthogonal polynomials of Jacobi, Hermite   and Laguerre. Explicit formulas will also be sought for recurrence   formulas, Rodrigues' formulas, differential equations, quadrature   formulas and other known properties of the classical polynomials.    For areas (3) and (4) our primary goal is to investigate computational   methods for use in applying recently obtained Theoretical results to   problems of science and technology.    Orthogonal functions are used as building blocks to describe in   mathematical language a large number of  physical phenomena; for   example:  (a) the magnetic field of the earth   (for navigation and   geophysical research), (b) musical tones, (c) motion   of ocean tides, (d) alternating electrical currents and   (e) force fields  due to gravitational attraction (orbiting planets   and satellites) and electrostatics.  Examples of orthogonal functions   that help form the basis of mathematical physics (and its engineering   applications) are spherical and cylindrical harmonics, Fourier series   and orthogonal polynomials.  OLPS's are r elatively new orthogonal   functions introduced in the 1980's by the principal investigator and   collaborators (Thron, Waadeland and Njastad).  Originally they were   used to solve strong moment problems.  Jones proposes their   application to quadrature formulas for efficient computation of   integrals that arise in science and engineering.  Szego polynomials are  applicable to frequency analysis problems that arise in such fields as  communication (digital transmission of radio, television and telephone  signals), radar, phonetics, speech processing, speech therapy, and  teaching the deaf to speak.  Our research will compare Szego polynomial  methods with other known methods, seeking to refine the Szego method  and exploit its application."

A generalized Fredholm Determinant Theory on the space of Zygmund functions on the circle is investigated. Notice that the space of Zygmund functions on the circle can be treated as the tangent space of the universal Teichmuller space. It is hoped that the knowledge of the spectral properties of transfer operators may be applied to the study of Teichmuller theory and vice versa. An especially interesting case is when a transfer operator is the tangent map of a non-linear map of the universal Teichmuller space. A technique called Yoccoz puzzles is also investigated as a replacement of the Markov partitions in the study of the thermodynamical properties of a non-renormalizable quadratic polynomial. In the second part of the project, the Mandelbrot set at infinitely renormalizable points and the   topological properties of the Julia sets of infinitely renormalizable quadratic polynomials are investigated because these are the only remaining points to prove that the Mandelbrolt set is locally connected. A generalized Feigenbaum conjecture for folding mappings with arbitrary exponent and asymmetry is investigated in the project.    The study of one-dimensional dynamics has lead to the discovery of many physical laws. One recent discovery is the universal law in chaotic phenomena: in a one-parameterized system like the family of quadratic polynomials (such a system appears in fluid and celestial mechanics, in chemistry and biology, and in social sciences), regular motions evolving into a chaotic motion can be characterized by a universal number. This new paradigm provides a rich supply of mathematical problems. In return, the study of these problems gives a deeper understanding of concepts connected with universality and develops some new tools to ma ke further progress. The goal of the first part of this project is to attack some unsolved problems and to develop new results concerned with universality. More specifically, some thermodynamical and geometric properties of one-dimensional and complex dynamical systems are investigated. The discovery of the Mandelbrot set, which was one of the direct important results from the development of a fast computer, breaks the barrier to develop some traditional geometric concepts. Traditionally, the mathematical study of geometry concentrates on smooth objects like circles, lines, and spheres. But in the real world, most geometric objects are more fractal in   shape when one looks into the microscope at a geometric object. The Mandelbrot set not only breaks the visual and psychological barrier of the study of fractal geometry but also carries the universal fractal structure in a large class of systems. However, a complete understanding of the geometric structure of the Mandelbrot set is far from being finished.   The goal of the second part of the project is to study the topological structure of the Mandelbrot set, and also to investigate the topological structure of the Julia set for a corresponding infinitely renormalizable point."

Recent results  in this area are connected in particular to the majorizing measure  approach, introduced by Talagrand. This method enabled the solution  of several deep problems in Combinatorics, Harmonic Analysis, and  Convex Geometry. This work will continue investigation of constructions  of majorizing measures as well as study possible applications of this  method to concrete problems of Local Theory and Harmonic Analysis.  Another direction is related to the study of convex bodies which are  not necessary symmetric. This is a new project inspired by recent  progress in generalization of the results of the Local Theory to   star-shaped bodies. It turned out to be possible to prove the most  important results of the Local Theory, including inverse Santalo and   Brunn-Minkowski inequalities, for p-convex bodies. Unlike p-convex  symmetric bodies, in the case of general convex bodies almost  nothing is known. The basic technical tools, which work for convex  and p-convex symmetric bodies, do not work any more if general   convex bodies are considered. Moreover, the known facts about  non-symmetric convex bodies suggest that there might be a significant  difference between their properties and the properties of symmetric  bodies.The aim of the project is to construct a theory of general  convex bodies which is parallel to the existing theory of convex  symmetric bodies.    Convex Geometry is a field of Mathematics which studies the properties  of convex bodies of high dimension. This includes finding sections of  a given body with certain nice properties, computing the volume of a  body, approximating a convex body by another one having a better  structure, etc. While these problems cannot be solved in general by  an explicit construction, it is often possible to show that a randomly  chosen section or a random modification of a body has the desired  prop erties. This approach enables the reduction of the analytic and  geometric problems to the investigation of the behavior of a certain  random process. The project will concentrate on developing a method  to analyze such processes and on the investigation of the structure  of general convex bodies. The results obtained in this direction are  applicable to various problems in Harmonic Analysis and Banach   Space theory as well as in Computer Science, like construction of   effective optimization algorithms and fast computation of the volumes of   convex bodies."

The first focuses on problems related to the structural theory of non-selfadjoint operator algebras.  Prior work by the investigator on quasitriangularity considerations within von Neumann algebras has impacted some work of others outside the area in applied control theory and in function theory.   He will continue this direction of research.   The second ongoing project concerns a new functional- analytic approach to some basic issues in wavelet theory.  The PI has shown that certain classical orthonormal wavelets could be derived using operator-algebraic techniques, and he also proved the existence of single-function dyadic orthonormal wavelets in all dimensions greater than one.  This was a surprise to some other researchers because it contradicted a wavelet folklore which indicated that such wavelets were impossible.  He has also shown that  the unitary group of a von Neumann algebra can in some cases be used to parameterize a norm-path-connected family of wavelets.  This suggests the possibility of perturbation techniques.  The third  thrust extends prior work of this investigator and collaborators in which counterexamples were obtained to some old open problems concerning operator-algebraic reflexivity and related properties of single operators.      In prior supported work this investigator solved, with collaborators, a  conjecture in the area of non-selfadjoint operator algebras that had been posed about ten years earlier by another researcher.  This led to an unsuspected development in the applied area of control theory which impacted work of others outside of mathematics.  He will continue pursuing this line of research.  In a second ongoing direction,  this investigator and a former student have shown that some aspects of wavelet theory are amenable to operator algebraic computations of a nature that were previously unsuspected.  Wavelet analysis and wavelet oriented technology has been the scene of a tremendous research  drive in mathematics and engineering during the  past few years.  Primary applications have been to signal processing and data compression.  They showed that certain classical wavelets could be derived using their techniques, and  they also proved the existence of certain wavelets in higher dimensions which were previously thought to be impossible by many specialists.   In a third direction the PI has recently extended some prior work in which counterexamples were obtained to some old open problems concerning properties of single operators.  Several doctoral students have been involved in all of this work."

Christopher Phillips, proposes three lines of research: (1) work on the classification and structure of simple C*-algebras; (2) a functional analytic characterization of the algebra of smooth functions on a smooth manifold; and (3) a continuation of his previous work on exponential rank. In (1), he proposes to work with   Qing Lin on understanding the structure of transformation group C*-algebras of minimal diffeomorphisms. The eventual goal is to show that they are direct limits of sub-homogeneous C*-algebras, which would put them close to the classifiable class of stably finite simple C*-algebras. Several already interesting intermediate results, such as cancellation results in the K-theory of these algebras, are closer to realization. He also proposes to follow up recent work on the purely infinite case of the classification in several ways: a possibility of interesting invariants in the non-nuclear case, a long shot possibility for proving that nuclearity implies the Universal Coefficient Theorem, and a very plausible approach to the real case of the known classification theorem. In (2), he proposes to try to prove a functional analytic characterization of the algebra of smooth functions on a smooth manifold, in an effort to gain a better understanding of what a noncommutative manifold should be. In (3), he proposes to search for a simple C*-algebra with large exponential rank, and to try to understand better the exponential rank of stable and homogeneous C*-algebras.    The purpose of this project is to improve the understanding of he ""simple"" C*-algebras. A C*-algebra is a kind of algebraic system (somewhat like the set of real numbers, with its operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but somewhat more complicated). It has additional structure which, roughly speaking, describes when   something is ""large"" or ""small"" (again, somewhat like the set of real numbers). C*-algebras turn out to be one of the more impor tant kinds of structures in mathematics. They have significant applications to other parts of mathematics which at first sight seem rather unrelated (geometry, for example), and they are also one of the kinds of structure that is important in quantum mechanics, the (rather counterintuitive) physical theory needed to deal properly with atoms and other very small objects. The simple C*-algebras are those that cannot be broken into smaller pieces, and in some sense all C*-algebras are built out of them. The project has two main goals. One is to advance the understanding of the ""internal structure"" of simple C*-algebras, more or less to know about each one all that it is possible to know. This is relevant when they are used in other subjects. The other is to improve the knowledge of the classification of C*-algebras: one wants a complete list of  all of them, with a recipe for deciding when two simple C*-algebras, obtained in different ways, are actually the same."

The analysis of the cocycle conjugacy classes of discrete endomorphisms is related to the Jones theory of index for subfactors and has numerous connections to the classification theory of Connes of the outer conjugacy classes of automorphisms on the tracial hyperfinite factor.  An important family of endomorphisms is the family of Powers shifts, which appear naturally in the construction of shifts on Jones tunnels of subfactors and as restrictions of endomorphisms with finite relative commutant index.  Using a connection between Powers shifts and linear shift register systems, Price will attempt to complete his classification of the rational Powers shifts.  Price has also computed the entropy of all rational Powers shifts and expects to work with E. Stormer on the problem of determining the range of values of the Connes-Stormer entropy among the family of all Powers shifts.  In addition, a number of combinatorial problems have arisen from the interplay between the study of Powers shifts and shift register systems, and as part of this project Price will work with some undergraduate students to answer some related questions about the ranks of Toeplitz and Hankel matrices over finite fields.    This research project represents an attempt to exploit connections which Price has shown to exist between two fields of mathematics, one of which is relatively abstract and one of which is comparatively concrete.  Since the 1930's operator algebras have been used as mathematical constructs to model the behavior of quantum mechanical systems.  The field   of shift register systems, on the other hand, is a branch of cryptology, and is one of the means by which secure messages are encoded and transmitted.  Using some number-theoretic aspects of linear shift register systems, and with the participation of undergraduate research assistants, Price will con tinue his program of classifying families of mappings known as Powers shifts. Powers shifts are mappings which may be viewed as determining the forward time evolution of a particular algebra of physical observables.

Connes and N. Higson.  All three involve the notion of asymptotic homomorphisms of C*-algebras which provide an elegant realization of K-homology, the generalized homology theory dual to K-theory.  The first is motivated by work of P. Baum, R. Douglas and M. Taylor calculating the image of the K-homology class of a first order, elliptic differential operator on a manifold with boundary under the boundary map in K-homology.  The second is based on the observation that a quantization of a classical mechanical system based on a continuous parameter of Planck's constant may be used to construct an asymptotic morphism and hence an element of a K-homology group.  The third is a joint project with N. Higson and J. Trout.  Our equivariant groups will prove useful in a number of contexts.  In particular they have applications to the Baum-Connes conjecture.  The proposed research deals with index theory on non-compact, complex manifolds possessing a large number of symmetries.  The geometric structure of the boundary of these manifolds plays an important role in index theory.  I propose to study its precise relationship to the analytic properties of elliptic differential operators on the manifolds themselves using the techniques of coarse geometry and the newly developed E-theory.  The second project is based on the close relationship between elliptic differential operators on these manifolds to certain quantum mechanical systems.  My methods can be used to obtain new topological invariants of these systems and relate them to index theory.  The research should lead to a better understanding of a number of quantum mechanical systems from mathematical physics and also has bearing on a number of outstanding problems in  index theory including the Baum-Connes Conjectupe."

It tries to specify the following        problem: Given the norm topology of a Banach space, how        different are the equivalent norms generating this topology?        Our main question is the following: Are there any Banach        spaces which are distortable but not arbitrarily distortable?        Directly connected to the concept of distortion is the concept        of stabilization and  the spectrum of Lipschitz functions on        the sphere of an infinite dimensional Banach space. It was introduced        by V. Milman in 1971. The author intends to discuss the         question whether, after stabilization, the spectrum of a        Lipschitz function must be a connected set. Furthermore it is        intended to work on several problems concerning the asymptotic        structure of Banach spaces. They could be summed up as follows:        How much information about the infinite dimensional         properties of a Banach space can be deduced from its asymptotic        properties? The second part of this proposal treats the following        problem about Gaussian measures: Are two n-dimensional convex        symmetric sets positively correlated with respect to the standard        Gaussian measure?              Banach spaces were introduced to provide a frame in which        solutions of Differential Equations exist, i.e. equations which        model dynamic systems. The author intends to continue his study        about their structure. Roughly speaking, one might summarize the        problems as follows: What are the building blocks of Banach spaces,        are there ""atomic"" spaces? The second part of the proposal treats        a group of questions concerning multi-dimensional normal distributions.        The following question is a generic problem in statistics: One has        tables for standard normal distr ibutions, but no tables for             multi-dimensional normal distributions (there are simply       too many of them). So, if we are dealing with a multi-dimensional        problem for which the data can be approximated by a multi-dimensional             normal, how can we deal with it? In order to find estimates of        confidence regions the author intends to  find lower estimates for               probability of multi-dimensional events using the one dimensional        standard distribution."

The second part of the proposal deals   with the analysis of the cardinal-interpolation  operator. Stability   estimates relating to  scattered-data interpolation constitute the   subject of the third part of the proposal. The final section concerns   interpolation of scattered data on Euclidean spheres.  The focus   here is on interpolants which are closely related to RBFs, and the   goal is to develop a substantive quantitative theory of such   interpolation methods.    As evident from the preceding paragraph, the leitmotif of this  proposal is the theory of Radial-Basis Functions, a subject  which has been vigorously researched over the last 15 years.  These functions provide a viable tool for the interpolation (i.e.,    modeling)  of scattered data.  Modeling scattered data is as    natural as it is inevitable.  Data gathered for experiments in many    areas of science (e.g., geophysical or meterological data collected  over the surface of the earth via satellites or ground stations)  invariably come from scattered sites.  It is therefore important to  have at one's disposal, flexible and useful methods of producing  interpolants (i.e., surface fits) to such scattered data.  The   radial-basis-function method accomplishes precisely that; indeed,   its use was pioneered by the geophysicist Rolland Hardy in his  studies on topography.  The current proposal seeks to undertake  theoretical studies connected with radial-basis-function  interpolation.  Some of these issues, especially those   addressed in the third and fourth parts of the proposal, also  have some practical significance.  These issues concern  the so-called quantitative theory of interpolation which  strives to explain how stable the interpolation (modeling)  process is likely to b e."

Chaos Theory, one of the most important new fields of mathematics to  arise in the last few decades, is concerned with systems which can  exhibit a very erratic motion. The most common example is the turbulent  flow of water from a pipe when a faucet is turned on hard. A famous  early example concerned computer models of the weather, where the  occurrence of chaotic behavior makes it impossible to predict the  weather more than a few days in advance. Perhaps the most important  discovery has been simply the realization that, far from being rare,  chaotic behavior is not only very common, but in some sense, is actually  the most common type of behavior. The systems usually studied in Chaos  Theory are described by Classical Mechanics, the theory initiated by  Isaac Newton which describes ordinary objects like those we experience.  Microscopic systems like atoms, molecules, and electrons are not at all  like the objects of ordinary experience, and are described by a strange  theory known as Quantum Mechanics, which was developed in the first  quarter of this century. The main thrust of the present project is to  study Chaos Theory in the context of atomic and molecular systems. This  is quite difficult because, since Classical Mechanics and Quantum  Mechanics are so very different, there is no agreement on exactly what  it is that one wants to study. This is still a field where most experts  feel that some sort of new ideas and approaches will be needed before  the problem is understood. An example of the type of system that is of  interest is a Hydrogen atom in a laser field. As simple as this seems  physically, it is quite a difficult mathematical problem. In the  present  project, simple models of such a system will be studied in order to try  to come to some understanding of how they work."

Another goal is to extend the types of disorder allowed  to more realistic models such as the Poisson and random  displacement models. This will require an improvement of the  Wegner estimate obtained in previous works.  These techniques will be useful in studying the question of  correlated systems and high-energy localization for  two-dimensional disordered system.

The construction of Euclidean  quantum field theory is a closely related problem.  The standard tools  in theoretical physics used for these calculations are the epsilon  expansion and the 1/N expansion, but neither of these are known to be  correct methods of calculation. The epsilon expansion is particularly  perplexing, because it involves analytic continuation in the dimension  of space from 4 to 4 - epsilon.  This continuation is made term by  term in perturbation theory, but it is not known that the resulting  expansion is the perturbation theory of any model.  This proposal  considers a different way to introduce a parameter epsilon, where there  clearly are models for epsilon not = 0, and yet the epsilon parameter  plays the same role of moving four dimensional theories off a  bifurcation. The objective is to study the properties of expansion in  epsilon and also expansion in 1/N. It is believed that methods based  on previous work by the author and his collaborators can be extended  to prove that these expansions are correct for epsilon small and for  1/N small. One possible outcome of this study is the construction of  quantum field theory in three dimensions using the 1/N expansion.  This theory should obey all Wightman axioms, but the perturbation  theory in the coupling constant will be non-renormalizable.      Quantum field theory originated in elementary particle physics, but it  is really a mathematical framework for systems with very large numbers  of degrees of freedom. Important applications include: predicting the  size and shape of polymers, the physics of sound waves and electrons  in crystals, the physics of phase transitions.

The research of Professor Pietro Poggi-Corradini stretches across the fields of complex analysis and functional analysis. The objects of study are on the one hand the analytic maps defined on the unit disk that are bounded by one in modulus, and on the other hand, the composition operators that these maps induce on classical function spaces of the disk. The motivations and the questions come from the theory of operators, but the tools used are drawn from complex analysis (harmonic measure, extremal distance, hyperbolic metric,   etc...). The results, at least in the case when the map is one-to-one and has the origin as an attracting fixed point, are twofold. While  describing properties of the associated composition operator, such as the spectrum and the essential spectral radius, new properties of the analytic map, such as the dynamical behavior near the boundary of the unit disk, were discovered. The link between the map and the operator is given by the linearization map near the fixed point provided by iteration theory, i.e. the Koenigs map. Properties of the Koenigs maps which had not been considered before, such as their Hardy   class, are determined and these in turn shed light on the inner workings of the subject. P. Poggi-Corradini intends to continue his study in three different directions. The first consists in dropping the requirement that the maps be one-to-one.  A second topic of inquiry is to ask similar questions on the Bergman spaces instead of the Hardy spaces. Many fundamental aspects of the theory of Bergman spaces have received much attention lately.  A third line of research deals with the general problem of describing the spectrum of composition operators. It is clear that the properties of the spectrum and the linearization theory both depend on the location of the Denjoy-Wolff point. The results mentioned above only dealt with the case when this point does not have modulus one and the multiplier there is non-vanishing. So ther e is space for generalizing the techniques used to new situations. Finally, this study might help answer a question of M. Heins about generalizations of the Denjoy-Wolff Theorem to arbitrary Riemann surfaces and some questions of J. Cima about Cauchy-Stieltjes integrals. On a wider level, since, in recent years, both composition operators and complex dynamics have been studied intensively in the context of several complex variables, it would be interesting to see if the interplay between spectral theory of composition operators and the dynamics of analytic maps at the boundary of the disk carries over to self-maps of the ball or the polydisk.      More generally, the research of P. Poggi-Corradini tackles fundamental issues in a classical mathematical field known as function theory, which has many applications to engineering and the applied sciences (e.g. iterative methods, aerodynamics, control theory, etc...). Much of the classical theory is devoted to the study of a single function or transformation. The innovative point of view is to extract information about a single transformation by iterating it repeatedly and analyzing the behavior ""in the limit"" of the ensuing dynamical system."

Finally, he proposes efforts on constructive problems, in particular exotic   Markov randomfields and smooth examples related to the classical T,T-inverse map.    Most if not all interesting phenomena have some random character.  Ergodic theory, as envisioned in this project, is the attempt to ferret out the nature and origin of this randomness in phenomena modeled abstractly as probabilistic processes.  This is done by examining the behavior of the process over ever larger blocks of time and attempting to analyze or recode the information gained.  The principle investigator has developed an approach to this analysis that considers controlled distortions of time in the process to attempt to modify it to some simpler form.  The degree or manner of distortion one allows will determine what properties of the process are preserved or lost.  This allows one to focus on some particular properties to save allowing others to be eliminated.  One particularly interesting case of this is when randomness appears spatially in a crystal or tiling and ""time"" is two or three dimensional.  The crystal structure or tile shapes will determine what ""distortions"" are allowed. This ""time distortion"" approach, called ""restricted orbit equivalence"" has already shown itself well-suited to understanding   a wide variety of properties of random processes and appears applicable to  many others.  Pursuing these possibilities is the main focus of this project."

Ultimately it may reduce the study of characters of non-linear groups to linear groups, which are more well understood, and thereby bring non-linear groups into the Langlands program.  In joint work with Steve Rallis and Carey Rader, Adams will also look at a conjectural geometric matching of orbital integrals between SO(2n+1) and Mp(2n,F) over a p-adic or real field F. Finally Adams plan to continue his joint project with Dan Barbasch on the dual pair correspondence over R.    Lie groups (named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie) are among the most ubiquitous objects in mathematics and science. Lie groups are the mathematical framework for the study of symmetry. They play an important role wherever symmetry is found, for example in the design of particle accelerators. Typically a Lie group is not seen   directly, but appears via a ""representation"" of it, which gives rise to the study of representations of Lie groups, In recent years more exotic ""non-linear"" Lie groups have played an increasingly important role, although their representation theory is not as well understood as in the linear case.  The main goal of this project is to bring the study of representations of non-linear Lie groups up to the level of linear Lie groups."

The main focus is on bound states of atomic  and molecular Hamiltonians with a new emphasis on systems in magnetic fields.  In particular, one-dimensional models will be used to study the maximum  negative ionization of atoms in strong magnetic fields.  The contraction  of relative entropy for general quantum systems will also be studied  using monotone Riemannian metrics on non-commutative probability spaces,  and some related operator inequalities will be considered.       Because real atoms and molecules exist in ordinary 3-dimensional  space with well established integer values for the nuclear charges,  models of systems in one or two dimensions with fractional, or  asymptotically infinite, nuclear charge may seem somewhat artificial  and esoteric.  However, real atoms do not exist in isolation, but  within various kinds of materials ranging in size from microscopic  computer chips to stars.  The behavior of electrons within such  complex materials may be accurately modelled by using a fractional nuclear  charge or by supposing that they are confined to one or two dimensions.  For example, semiconductor scientists have recently manufactured  microscopic materials called ""quantum dots"" which behave like  two-dimensional atoms with fractional nuclear charge.   At the other  extreme, one finds that atoms in extremely strong magnetic  fields, such as those found on the surface of a neutron star, behave  as if the electrons were confined to one dimension.  Thus, the  systems proposed for study have a wide range of applicability.  The other part of this proposal is concerned with the generalization  of an important class of entropy inequalities to quantum systems.    Entropy and the related functionals have significant applications  in such diverse fields as economics, statistics, population biology,  information theory, and physics.

Paulsen will continue to study the completely bounded Hochschild cohomology through its presentation as a completely bounded relative Yoneda cohomology, some problems concerning polynomially bounded operators, and questions in interpolation theory.    The study of operator algebras originally grew out of quantum mechanics. The set of ""observables"" in a quantum mechanical system is described as an algebra of operators. For this reason, it is often important to see how formulas involving numerical variables behave when these variables are allowed to be operator variables. This process is often referred to as finding ""quantized"" versions of the old theories and it was out of this process that the theory of completely bounded maps grew. Blecher and Paulsen's research focuses mainly on questions of how various theories behave under this type of quantization. On the other hand, interpolation theory started as a purely mathematical exercise, and only in the past 20 years has it been found to have important applications in engineering. For example, in electrical circuit design, one starts with a desired frequency response, for a few given frequencies, and wishes to design the simplest circuit with that given response. Mathematically, this problem becomes one of finding the simplest function of a given type that achieves some given values at given points. This last problem is what we call an interpolation problem. Already the demands of electrical engineering take us beyond the known interpolation theories. Surprisingly, interpolation theory and the study of operator algebras is interwoven, and this interplay has lead to some new interpolation results. We ha ve found that a better understanding of the ""quantized"", i.e., matrix-valued, interpolation is what is needed to answer many ordinary interpolation questions."

The theory of dynamical systems is the mathematical foundation of the rapidly developing fields of non-linear dynamics and chaos theory which provides these fields with their principal paradigms and tools of rigorous analysis. Those paradigms in turn play a key role in the development and analysis of mathematical models for numerous problems within natural and social sciences and engineering.  The standard setup in dynamics considers time as one-dimensional, either discrete or continuous. One of the central conclusions is that in a variety of situations, the orbit structure is rich and its robust features can be described by well-understood symbolic models.  The research under the present grant looks at the situation when the time is multi-dimensional while the phase space is still finite-dinemsional, i.e. the state of a system under consideration can be described by a finite set of numerical parameters.  The leading paradigms in these cases turn out to be strikingly different. On the one hand, the symbolic models are no longer valid. On the other, the orbit structure turn out to be ""rigid"", i.e. not only its robust f eatures, but much more subtle  structure, including the fine statistics of asymptotic behavior, do not change under perturbations.

Projects in the dimension theory of dynamical systems include: the description of several multifractal spectra (including dimension spectra, entropy spectra, and spectra for Lyapunov exponents) and the corresponding multifractal decompositions for various classes of dynamical systems of hyperbolic type (non-conformal expanding maps, Axiom A diffeomorphisms, etc.); and the establishment of the multifractal rigidity phenomenon for multidimensional conformal expanding maps (the classification of dynamical systems up to multifractal spectra). In the theory of coupled map lattices (CML), the principal investigator will study: infinite-dimensional SRB measures for CML, which includes establishing the characteristic property and thermodynamical limit, describing the Lyapunov spectrum, and proving the entropy formula; and the stability of traveling wave solutions of CML and relations between traveling wave solutions for CML and the corresponding PDE (such as Ginzburg-Landau equation, Kolmogorov-Petrovski-Peskunov equation, Huxley equation, etc.).   The principles of symmetry and self-similarity are nature's most beautiful creations. For example, they are expressed in fractals which are famous for their beautiful but complicated geometric shapes.  Examples of fractals vary from well-known ones-cost lines or mountain ranges-to less known-distribution of stars in galaxies and galaxies in the universe or root systems of plants. Dimension theory is a mathematical theory which is designed to explain fractals' structure. And in dynamics the presence of invariant fractals often results in unstable ``turbulent-like'' motions and is associated with ``chaotic'' behavior. Thus the study of fractals can help understand the most complicat ed phenomena such as turbulence in the ocean or atmosphere.  The proposed work involves research in a recently developing area which lies in the interface between dimension theory and the theory of dynamical systems. Focusing on invariant fractals and their influence on stochastic properties of systems, the principal investigator intends to provide a comprehensive and systematic treatment of modern dimension theory in dynamical systems.  Results are expected to be of great importance not only to advanced mathematicians but to a wide range of scientists who depend upon mathematical modeling of dynamical processes, including physicists, specialists in numerical modeling, engineers, molecular biologists, etc."

This proposal involves the continuing investigation of the fine structure of these multifractals and an attempt to use the MF analysis to give new insights into dynamical systems and possibly yield a new (physical) classification of dynamical systems.  In addition, the proposed work involves various problems in dimension theory which arise in mathematical biology as well as research on the relations between non-negative curvature and complicated dynamics of the geodesic flow.

Mathematically such objects are called multifractals.

The plan is to extend this work to larger classes of systems and to use this mathematical analysis to help understand the underlying physical or biological systems.  The PI is particularly  interested in applications to plant biology. In a different area, a large class of physical systems which are central to celestial mechanics and plasma physics can be studied by first transforming them to a ''geometric system'' called a geodesic flow and then studying the geodesic flow. In previous work, the PI showed  that a large class of these flows, which some thought were easily understood  and mathematically and physically boring, have extremely complicated behavior and are in fact chaotic.  The investigations into some specific examples including an example from gauge field dynamics, which is one of the central theoretical problems in particle physics will be continued."

The real part is about poly-modal mappings of the interval, i.e., smooth maps of the interval with finitely many turning points; a map with only one turning point is a  unimodal transformation.  Here the goal of the proposal can be very simply summarized:  what can be carried ovep from the unimodal theory, so successful in the last five years, to the poly-modal case?  The complex problem is about Siegel disks.  Siegel disks are sub-domains of a complex dynamical system, usually a rational map, where the dynamics can be brought to a linear rotation by a holomorphic change of coordinates.  A lot of mystery has surrounded the boundaries of Siegel disks.  First insights were gained only in the mid-eighties with the work of M. Herman.  The project proposes to refine some of the analytic tools used in his work to get more information.  Finally, some research is proposed in areas that do not belong to conformal dynamics, namely induced hyperbolicity in two-dimensional systems and combinatorial optimization viewed as an applied  problem in a very high-dimensional setting.  Unlike the rather conservative goals set in the first two problems, these should be termed exploratory research.     The proposal is concerned mostly with one-dimensional dynamical systems.  Such systems generally come from models which describe time changes of an observable parameter.  Year-to-year changes in a single animal population lead to this type of system, provided one assumes that the population in the next year is determined by the current-year count and no other factors.  Some examples that will be studied, notably the logistic family, grew from models of interest in  diverse areas including physics, ecmnomics and ecology.  The questions that the proposal addresses, when translated back to these models, are related to the long-term behavior and stability of such systems.  For example: will the population tend to a long-t erm equilibrium?  The proposal is also concerned with the problem of combinatorial optimization.  Practical problems such as the ""traveling salesman"" problem are believed by many experts to be intractable if one insists on the exact solution.  The proposal will examine a new approach based on the ideas of thermodynamics with the goal of getting high-performance approximate solutions."

First, it is the analysis in flag domains which extends the analysis in noncompact Hermitian symmetric spaces. The first step is the definition of analogs of elementary functions which we call the determinant functions. The well known examples of such functions are the norm-functions for symmetric domains (or Jordan algebras), but for flag domains there is a richer collection of new functions. Using these functions we hope to obtain several explicit formulas and results: descriptions of Stein neighborhood of Riemann symmetric spaces where it might be possible to holomorphically extend solutions of the Schmid equations, parametrizations of complex cycles in flag domains, generalizations of the Hua - Poisson integrals and the Hua equations for them, their computations on the language of integral   geometry and multidimensional residues, the generalized Penrose transform etc. The essential role in these constructions are played by the boundary values of the cohomology in nonconvex tube domains. Another direction in this project is an axiomatic of the method of horospheres and its applications. Several years ago in the process of solving the Gelfand problem I gave some axiomatic conditions on a family of submanifolds of a complex manifold providing an explicit local inversion formula of the corresponding problem of integral geometry. These conditions are satisfied for the horospheres on complex semisimple Lie groups, and it is the way to invert the horospherical transform without using group structures. Now we extend this axiomatic in such a way that it becomes possible to invert the horospherical transform for some nonsymmetric homogeneous manifold. The integral geometry is a direction of geometric analysis  which connects analysis on manifolds with geometrical structures on them. The philosophy of integral geometry is that there are geometrical structures more general than group invariance which give a base  for the development of a rich multidimensional analysis with   important applications to analysis on homogeneous manifolds, complex analysis, nonlinear differential equations , mathematical physics, etc. Integral geometry is a theoretical base of computer tomography."

Results for the classical  wave equation on a spatial domain which is exterior to a convex  obstacle will be extended to handle more general natural conditions at  the boundary of the obstacle.

Waves have been studied classically in terms of a size quantity like  energy, which is typically conserved or behaves in a fashion which is  easy to understand.  In order to go beyond the simpl est mathematical  approximations to understand the small- and large-scale properties of  true physical waves, other means of measuring the wave size must be  used.  Only the simplest model problems have been fully understood in  this context in the past - those for which the large-scale behavior is  merely a simple magnification of the small-scale behavior (such as  unperturbed waves in free space).  In true physical problems, waves  encounter obstacles and are reflected or absorbed; they travel in  media which are not uniform; they interact with themselves and with  the media in which they propagate.  The size behavior of such waves,  and in particular the decay of their amplitudes in time, will be  analyzed, in order to understand what information can be deduced about  the wave source from measurements of such size quantities made far  away (or long after the wave is generated)."

A thorough  understanding of those phenomena and effects of diffusions will  enhance our ability in modelling more complicated or realistic  situations in applied sciences.  It seems that substantial  progress has been made in the last ten years, and the stage is set  for even more exciting mathematical breakthroughs, especially in  diffusion related pattern formation.  In this project, Professor  Ni will study the following three closely related aspects:    (I) Systems of semilinear diffusion equation    (II) Systems of self-diffusion and cross-diffusion equations    (III) Spike-layers (point condensation solutions) in                     diffusion/cross-diffusion systems.    The purpose of this project is not only to separately develop  these directions further, but to synthesize the results obtained  and to build a theory to give a systematic point of view in  understanding those ""concentration"" phenomena in differential  equations.    In an attempt to understand segregation phenomena in population  dynamics, in 1979 several Japanese scientists at Kyoto University  incorporated the notions of ""self-diffusion"" and ""cross-  diffusion"" into the classical Lotka-Volterra model for the  dynamics of two competing species.  In a slightly broader  context, these ""bio-diffusions"" could also be viewed as special  cases of combinations of random diffusion and taxis (i.e.  directed movements).  Chemotaxis would be another such example.   These have greatly enriched our diffusion-related models -- from  the celebrated ""diffusion-driven instability"" of A. Turing in  1952 to recently discovered ""diffusion-induced extinction"" and  ""diffusion-induced blowup"" -- and have therefore enhanced our  ability in modelling those biological and physical phenomena.   The research in this proposal would provide a first step toward  the understanding, in a mathematically rigorous manner, of t he  concentration/segregation effect of the various types of   ""bio-diffusions"" (namely, random, repulsive, and attractive)   as well as ""taxis"" (namely, positive and negative)."

When the groups are of higher real rank, local rigidity and superrigidity of the groups often contribute to the corresponding properties for actions of the groups. It is conjectured that to some extent, all ergodic, volume-preserving actions of higher rank lattices can be built up from a list of standard actions: (a) actions by isometries on Riemannian manifolds, (2) actions on compact nilmanifolds by automorphisms, and (3) actions on homogeneous spaces by left translations. In particular, Anatole Katok, James Lewis, and Robert Zimmer conjectured that for any higher rank lattice action, there is a smooth invariant connection on an open dense set. The objectives of this research are to establish the local rigidity of the standard actions and to establish the algebraicity of group actions under favorable conditions. The investigator will employ Zimmer's cocycle superrigidity  to establish the rigidity properties of the actions in measurable tangential level. Then he will apply dynamical systems techniques to obtain the rigidity properties in topological tangential level. The transition from topological tangential level to smooth level -- which is the key step to his objectives -- will rely on the use of techniques from dynamical systems, Lie theory and representation theory, ergodic theory, harmonic analysis and differential geometry.  Another goal of his research is to find smooth invariant connections for the group actions.    A group action, when preserving some appropriate structures, is a part of the group of symmetries of the object on which they act. One anticipates that the object is in some sense regular if there are sufficiently many symmetries of the object. One may further imagine that if the symmetries have many relations, there is no way to deform the object and keep those symmetries.  The proposed research takes the objects to be manifolds. T he researcher investigates essentially two problems. The first is to find the structure for the symmetries when there are many symmetries. The second is to identify the symmetries for which the manifolds cannot be deformed.  The significance is to provide unified approaches to the research of the rigidity of group actions, develop new methods to tackle the often encountered problems in this field of research, and ultimately establish that under certain conditions, a higher rank group action must be a part of the group of symmetries for a structure (so-called connection)."

She is also interested in investigating further properties of this lifting correspondence, and continuing to study induced representations for non-connected linear reductive p-adic groups.    The theory of Fourier series was developed, starting in the 18th century, to study periodic functions of a real variable.  The idea is to write an arbitrary periodic function as a sum of the well-understood trigonometric functions, that is expand a function in terms of its ""harmonics.""  This theory has many applications in the sciences, in engineering, and in mathematics.  Many of the basic ideas involved in Fourier analysis can be extended to analyze functions on any space with sufficient symmetry.  For a given space, the problem is to find a collection of especially nice elementary functions, and then study how to expand arbitrary well-behaved functions as a sum or integral (continuous sum) of these elementary functions.  These generalizations of Fourier series are known as representation theory or harmonic analysis.  One class of spaces of special interest in physics and mathematics is the class of semisimple real Lie groups.

To have a crude initial idea of symbolic dynamics, think of studying problems involving very long tapes of zeros and ones. An appropriate idealization is to consider infinite tapes.   Such a study is significant when one considers problems of data transmission and storage.  It also is one key to the study of how physical systems evolve over time: imagine cutting up a system into (say) two pieces, and associating to a point a sequence of zeros and ones according to its itinerary through the two pieces. It is actually useful to study a system by way of the associated itineraries ...    As happens in math, the theory developed for this   has turned out to be relevant to superficially unrelated problems in other areas. Two examples are objects of study of this proposal: understanding the algebraic structure of nonnegative matrices, which are basic in many applications of mathematics, and improving   a framework for understanding certain relations with the mathematical subject of C*-algebras.

Previous work by the project's principal investigator suggests that Rudin's question may be answered through an analysis of properties of the Nevanlinna counting function and radial subharmonic functions.  The project also involves a continuation of the principal investigator's study of the behavior of functions and operators under iteration:  chief objectives  here are to characterize the cyclic behavior of a certain class of  composition operators acting on the classical Hardy space and to resolve  the invariant-subspace problem for hyponormal operators on Hilbert  space.  Methods to be employed include computer studies of the Nevanlinna  counting function (carried out by undergraduates) and an analysis of the  extent to which information about orbits of a linear operator can contribute to the establishment of the   existence of a nontrivial, invariant subspace for that operator.      The project focuses on problems in the areas of function theory and operator theory.   The goal of work in function theory is to provide information and tools that enable scientists to understand/predict how functions of certain types will behave in various situations.   For   example, the study of the behavior of functions under iteration (which forms a component of the project) connects function theory to the analysis of dynamical systems, including systems that behave chaotically.  The goal of much current research in operator theory   (including the operator-theoretic component of the project)  is to determine when a given linear operator preserves a small part of the whole space on which it acts.  When smaller parts are preserved, one hopes the whole operator may be understood in terms  of its simpler parts.   Linear operations include simple processes such as rotation in space and complex processes such as the application of Schroedinger's equation of quantum mechanics to certain function spaces. The project will also contribute to the development of the nation's human-resources:  three undergraduate students will receive significant training and research experiences through their participation in the project."

The focus will be on the categories of Hilbert modules associated with operator algebras.  Inspiration for this derives from finite dimensional pure ring theory, but the key is to understand the interplay between the algebra and the metrics involved.  In Muhly's work, groupoids provide concrete coordinates for representing operator algebras.  The projects under this rubric are natural continuations of his earlier efforts.  Most important among them, perhaps, is the problem of developing a good, topological cohomology theory for groupoids.  The problems on Toeplitz operators that he proposes to investigate also derive naturally from his earlier work and progress on them should help shed light on important new connections between classical function theory/harmonic analysis and operator theory.  Although in many respects, the detailed aspects of the problems Muhly will investigate are inspired by questions from core mathematics, their significance to applied mathematics and the ""real world"" is substantial.  Much of Muhly's work contributes to the mathematical underpinning of control theory, H-infinity control theory, in particular, which, in turn, is the theoretical framework on which engineers base the design of aircraft, automobiles, robots, and other devices that need to respond to external stimuli and to be controlled to perform within specified guidelines.  His work on groupoids and some of his work on Toeplitz operators is closely connected to issues of stochastic control, i.e., control problems where there are random uncertainties involved and one tries to steer a course that is best on the average.  His work on operator algebras, generally, c ontributes to the field of multivariable control theory and to non-stationary control problems, i.e., problems where the control response is a function of the time of the input.

The main tool here is the Harvey and Lawson theory.  2. Analytic  disks and Gromov's method. The method of Gromov's well-known  1985 paper on Lagrangian manifolds and pseudo holomorphic  curves was adapted and applied in a paper of the proposer to  study analytic disks with boundary in totally real manifolds. This  study will be continued. 3.  Hulls of sets in the torus. Well-known  examples of Stolzenberg and Wermer give polynomial hulls  without analytic structure. The proposer is interested in the  problem of finding hulls, without analytic structure, of sets in the  unit torus.  4. Fabre's Theorem. 5. Integrals involving  analytic functions. Possible quantitative versions of Siu's recent  lemma on the inheritance of non-integrability by restriction will  be explored.          This project involves the study of problems in complex  analysis. The word ""complex"" here does not mean ""complicated""  but rather makes reference to ""complex numbers.""  Complex  numbers are nowadays routinely studied in high-school and a  college course in ""complex variables,""  because the material is so  useful, is part of the basic undergraduate curriculum for  engineers and scientists. The current project is directed toward  better understanding ""multidimensional complex space."" Recent  research in this area of mathematics continues to have  applications; for example, in the engineering field of control  theory."

This is an essential ingredient in the study of spaces of harmonic   maps, and also of independent interest, being related to recent   developments in the topology of moduli spaces.    This work is motivated by the role played by symmetry in solving   equations of mathematics and physics.  Over the past thirty years,  mathematicians have come to realize that some of the most important   differential equations which describe the real world are subject  to very extensive but ""hidden"" (and therefore somewhat mysterious)  symmetries.  Even when the equations describe a finite-dimensional  process, such as a simple mechanical system, hidden symmetries can  be infinite dimensional in extent.  Such symmetries often turn out to  be the key to solving the equation. As a consequence, mathematical  research in this area aims to predict the existence of hidden  symmetries for a particular equation and then attempts to use  these symmetries to solve the equation.  The inves tigator aims to do   this for the harmonic map equation. Studying the symmetries of  individual equations like this will lead eventually to a general theory of  equations with hidden symmetries.  Such a theory would be a significant  advance in understanding the many natural phenomena which are  governed by equations of this type."

It is planned to continue this study in order to make some of the proofs more self-contained, and to include some additional cases not covered so far in the non-simply laced case. More importantly, it is expected that the understanding   of the C* structure in the quantum group context would also be useful to get a conceptual understanding of the asymptotic inclusions derived from these categories. Besides its relevance for classification of subfactors, it would potentially also be useful for getting  a better understanding of the algebra behind the Reshetikhin-Turaev-Witten type invariants of 3-manifolds connected with such categories. In related research, Wenzl's graduate student Orellana is studying Markov traces of Hecke algebras of type B.   For Hecke algebras of type A, such a study led to the construction of subfactors closely related to quantum groups of type A.  For type B, the situation is quite different. But preliminary results nevertheless suggest that one can also obtain subfactors from Hecke   algebras of type B.    The original motivation for Wenzl's research was the construction of examples of subfactors of a certain algebra, the so-called hyperfinite von Neumann factor of type II_1. By now, a lot of examples of subfactors are known, and a complete explicit classification seems to be out of reach. Wenzl's research  focuses on certain classes of examples with connections to other areas of mathematics and physics. The examples he constructed  are closely connected to the representation theory of quantum groups and Kac-Moody algebras, which in turn figure prominently in models in theoretical physics referred to as conformal field theory. The subfactors which would arise from his graduate student's work would be connected to Hecke algebras of type B and knot theory in a torus. Such   examples have the advantage that one can use addition al information for their study. In the other direction, we expect that operator algebra techniques can provide new insights to the related areas, such as it has already happened in e.g. knot theory, study of 3-manifolds or representation theory. This could be understood as part of von Neumann's program of using operator algebras as  a tool for representation theory and quantum physics."

These include 1)   applications of martingale inequalities to investigate the  operator  norm of the Beurling-  Ahlfors operators in two and several dimensions, 2) the use of Brownian motions to   investigate sharp bounds for the fundamental frequency and fundamental gap of the   Laplacian in Euclidean domains, and 3) the use of asymptotic expansions for Wiener   functionals to investigate the asymptotic expansion in the trace of Schrodinger operators   and  how the signs of the coefficients in such  expansion depend on the sign of the   potential.    Probability Theory has its roots in various fields of applied sciences and hence it should   not be surprising that modern stochastic analysis draws many of its technical tools from   several distinct areas of mathematics.  What is often far from  obvious  is that probabilistic   ideas and techniques can be effectively used to investigate problems and applications   which on the surface do not seem to be related to probability at all. The problems   discussed above fall in this category.  The Beurling-Ahlfors operators are (singular)    integral operators which describe regularity (smoothness) properties of solutions to   various nonlinear  equations arising from, among other topics, elasticity.  The computation   of their operator norms is a fundamental problem with many applications.  On the surface   this operator  appears to be very far from probability.  The Principal Investigator, in   collaboration with G. Wang and A. J. Lindeman, has successfully used the theory of   martingales (fair games) to study this problem.  The first part of the project describes   various new probabilistic approaches for further work in this direction.  Bounds  on the   fundamental frequency and fundament al gap of the Laplacian operator are basic quantities   in the theory of vibrating membranes. The trace of Schrodinger operators plays a   fundamental role in  various problems in mathematical physics related to, among other   things, scattering theory. Here, too, the connection to probability is not transparent. In the   second part of the project the PI proposes to use the theory of Brownian motion and   stochastic calculus to investigate several open problems in this areas. It is expected that   these investigations will lead, as it has happened many times in the past, to new and   surprising applications of probability to analysis, geometry, partial differential equations,   and the application of these subjects to mathematical physics.

The first two of these  projects involves the use, and further development, of renormalization  group techniques. In a previous renormalization group analysis of  ferromagnetic spin models, some fundamental questions were answered in a  simplified hierarchical setting. Ongoing work now deals with the problem  of restoring some of the ingredients that have been missing. The  investigation of quasiperiodic motion for Hamiltonian flows is based on a  new class of renormalization group transformations that was introduced in  a previous project. One of the goals is to develop these transformations  into tools for studying non-perturbative phenomena, such as the breakup of  smooth invariant tori. Other interesting questions concern the accumulation  of closed orbits at invariant tori and the interplay between renormalization  group transformations that correspond to different frequency vectors.  The third project deals with a promising but largely unknown class of  statistical mechanics models: Lattice gases with non-periodic Gibbs states.  The current investigation focuses on a few examples, based on aperiodic  tilings, for which the minimum energy configurations are well known.  The goal is to identify and understand the low temperature properties of  these models and to develop the appropriate methods for analyzing them.    Professor Koch's study of ferromagnetic spin models is part of a long-term  effort toward a mathematical foundation of the modern theory of critical  phenomena in condensed matter physics. One of the striking phenomena is that  there are observable quantities (critical indices) which seem to be  independent of the system considered, within large classes of different  systems. Starting from some basic assumptions, the current theory allows  an approximate computation of  these universal quantities. But it is still  an open problem to show that these assumptions hold, within a class of  reasonably realistic models. Ongoing investigations in this area use  computer-assisted proofs and involve further development of these techniques.  This includes validated numerics -- a technique which is of increasing  interest also in engineering and modern industrial design. Another critical  phenomenon investigated in this project is the loss of stability of quasi-  periodic orbits in classical Hamiltonian systems. In certain cases, this  loss of stability is believed to be associated with a significant increase  in ""chaotic"" motion. The process appears to be universal, in the sense  described above, but it is not yet understood. Interest in this problem stems  from celestial mechanics and plasma physics, where questions of stability  play an important role. And of course, the mathematics involved is  interesting in itself. The third project deals with statistical mechanics  models whose minimum energy configurations are non-periodic. Some of these  models are believed to describe quasicrystals, and others may have features  similar to spin glasses. They are unusual by current standards, but not  exceptional. In fact, non-periodicity is a generic property for ground  states in a standard class of statistical mechanics models. So far, almost  all investigations of such models have been limited to studying the zero  temperature state. The goal now is to obtain some useful information about  the behavior at positive temperatures, using a combination of (large scale)  numerical simulations and analytical techniques."

Problems in dilation theory, as well as, joint similarity problems for commuting N-tuples of operators, can be formulated and studied in the general framework of bounded cohomology.  The cohomological groups can be realized concretely as quotients of bounded operators and thus   these groups, as well as, the techniques used to compute them, should be of interest to both operator theorists and operator algebraists.    A significant portion of the cohomology theory developed for Banach modules is not, in general, applicable in the study of Hilbert modules over operator algebras.  Consequently, there are no standard techniques one can use to compute cohomology groups.  The methods employed so far involve homological algebra together with operator theoretic techniques, two seemingly disparate areas of mathematics.  Consequently, computations   of these groups leads to new insight and new techniques in operator theory.  Also important is that certain problems in operator theory when formulated in the general context of bounded cohomology become more transparent and  simple algebraic computation often leads to a significant reduction in the problem.  For this reason alone,   bounded cohomolgy for Hilbert modules will likely become a powerful tool for those working  in operator theory."

Free boundary problems arise naturally when a constitutive relation  or a conserved quantity (a temperature, a pressure, a density)  changes  discontinuously its behavior across some value of the variables under  consideration.  Typical examples are solid-liquid interphases,  burnt-unburnt mixtures in flame propagation, and flow in porous media.  Understanding of the geometry and stability of the solution  and its interphase is important to select and evaluate simulation methods,  as well as to understand the models themselves.  The theory of optimal transporation discusses how to transport a variable  x from a state S  to a state T in a least expensive fashion (or how  nature would  do so).  The variable x could represent goods, trainees,  information, or, as in the quasi-geostrophic model, optimal disposition of  air  masses. The links of these models to non-linear partial differential  equations need much further exploration.      The focus is on several fundamental problems of nonlinear analysis in two  areas: fast and abrupt transitions, allocation and optimal transportation theory.  Fast and abrupt transitions occur in many fields.  Typical examples are  the evolution of solid-liquid interphases in melting or solidification, the  propagation of gases or fluids in porous media or the elastic to plastic  transition in  some materials in  continuum mechanics. In the field of  financial mathematics there is the threshold state of variables after which an  option is executed, a good is restocked, or, in short, when a ""discontinuous""  decision is taken. We study the stability of such processes, the way to simulate them  numerically, etc. The second area of interest consists of the  equations that model optimal transportation.  This arises for  instance  when goods must be delivered from one set of locations (warehouses) to  another (distribution points).  Of course we want to do it minimizing transp ortation costs.  Not surprisingly,  the basic equations governing this problem reappear in meteorology (the   quasi-geostrophic equations of front formation), where air masses ""transport""  themselves optimally, and in the numerical simulation of different  fluid flows (lubrication, bubbles in fluids, etc.).  We hope that this  approach will provide a new understanding of the phenomena and better  computational techniques."

Special issues include   the local regularity of the solutions, intrinsic   Harnack estimates, the boundary behavior, and Quasi--Minima   in the Calculus of Variations. For evolution equations   bearing logarithmic singularities the solvability of   the Cauchy problem will be studied. In space-dimensions   higher than two, this hinges upon  a preliminary description   of the asymptotic behavior permitted by the possible solutions,   as well as the solvability of the corresponding elliptic   equation. This is a severely ill-posed problem, as, for   example, compactly supported data do not generate a solution.   Solvability depends on the possibility of generating   uniform lower bounds for approximating solutions at one   single point. Then the global Harnack estimate we have developed   would yield a lower bound in the whole space. The main difficulty   in this process is that there is not a natural   topology by which to approximate the data.      The flow of two immiscible fluids in a porous medium   (Buckley--Leverett model)  is modeled by evolutions equations   bearing singular terms. One asks whether, despite the jump in   internal energy, the saturation remains continuous. This would   amount to say that the interface of contact of the two fluids   occurs in such a way that the mass is locally conserved.   A class of singular equations arises in the slow evolution   of thin colloidal films spread over a flat surface. The singularities   are logarithmic and are due to the van der Waals forces.   As the film spreads, it may undergo a spontaneous rupture. Since   the film is applied as a coating to protect metal surfaces, one is   interested in the evolution of such a process and possibly    in some sort of understanding of the phenomenon of rupture.  The solvability of these equations, their structure, and possibly   an understanding of the rupture phenomenon will be investigated."

The study of such stochastic processes and their connections with one another, as well as their connections in terms of their fine structure with other less random processes, is a central one in modern mathematics.

Mathematically, one has to know how to describe complicated bifurcation structures to be able to make qualitative predictions about an experiment. In the non-linear regime, one cannot hope for many quantitative predictions (or quantitative tests on the validity of models). It is then important to remember that, in the non-linear aspects of classical statistical mechanics, the theory can only predict numbers at transition points.  At some transitions, the main observables are universal in that they do not depend on a precise experiment but on a small number of (generically) small integer numbers. Not so surprisingly, most of the numbers non-linear mathematics can predict about non-linear sciences are also universal and associated to transitions. These transitions can be local (and one then uses local bifurcation theory; for instance one describes in this way most instances of onset of periodic behavior) or global (like the transition from order to chaos). In the global case, as in statistical mechanics, the main theoretical tool is a renormalization group, indeed, essentially the same sort of renormalization group as in statistical mechanics.  The goal of this research is twofold.  One aspect of the work will involve locating new examples of renormalization groups for dynamics and using them to understand dynamical properties.  A second aspect will involve investigating the bifurcation structure of parameterized families of maps which exhibit both simple and complex dynamical behavior, focussing in particular on the transition between order and chaos (more precisely the transition between zero and positive topological entropy).  The  basic aim of the project is furthering the understanding of complicated dynamic s and the transition from order to chaos which appears as essential to understanding climate changes and other major ecological events such as earthquakes or population dynamics. More specifically, renormalization is essential in explaining a variety of phenomena, from the transition to turbulence to the dynamics of some basic pieces of electronic circuits such as digital filters. Global bifurcation theory is the branch of mathematics which addresses our need to understand quantities which vary in time under adjustable or varying constraints."

This is because the  measure of angles remains the same whether the angles are viewed  through a microscope or through the wrong end of a telescope, i.e.  these very elementary quantities are scale invariant. In contrast, our  idea of how smooth the surface of some material might be changes  dramatically upon magnification, i.e. change of scale. By grounding  our theory in quantities more elementary than those which describe  smoothness and obtaining various results and estimates on the  quantities modeled (temperature, etc.) we obtain a theory that can be  applied both to bodies with rough boundaries or to bodies with smooth  boundaries. The proposal can be seen as a search for other more  elementary quantities  leading to further generalizations or  applications."

The mappings in question solve  important first order systems of PDEs analogous in many respects to  the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The solutions of these systems can be  viewed as ""absolute"" minimizers of certain energy functionals. It is  striking how tight the connection is between quasiregular mappings and  the recent development of the nonlinear elasticity theory whose  mathematical principles were already formulated by S.S. Antman   and J. Ball in 1976-77. Roughly speaking, the theory of elasticity   studies mappings, referred to as deformations of elastic bodies,   which minimize the so-called stored energy functionals. These   functionals are not always convex and the deformations need not be   quasiconformal but the governing PDEs are much the same. The   Jacobian determinant, in particular, has been subjected to a great   deal of investigation.  Ths project accounts for this study   together with some generalizations concerning wedge products of   closed differential forms.    Quasiconformal mappings generalize to higher dimensions the concept  of analytic functions that is so fruitful for science and engineering  in two space dimensions. Trying to extend this theory to three or  more space dimensions proved quite difficult and the mathematics of  such extension is being developed now. Iwaniec will work on how  to extend familiar concepts in the plane, like degree, to similar  concepts in space. The theory of non linear elasticity, among others,  will benefit from this developments."

The first component is the study of the dynamics of polynomial maps of two variables.  The primary goal of this component is to show that the topological notion of Omega stability is equivalent to the analytic notion of hyperbolicity.  Similar programs have led to a great deal of activity and many new results in the fields of one complex variable dynamics and real dynamics.  The second component is the study of polynomial mappings of three variables using techniques of pluripotential theory.  Pluripotential theory has been an effective tool in the study of the dynamics of polynomial mappings of one and two variables.  The main goal of this component is to determine the extent to which this tool can be applied to higher dimensional polynomial diffeomorphisms, whose dynamics have been studied very little.  The third component is the classification of algebraic surfaces in terms of a weak notion of hyperbolicity.  The main goal of this component is to show that the existence of a rank-two holomorphic map from complex 2-space to an algebraic surface is equivalent to the existence of a Zariski dense image of the complex plane.     The main focus of this project is the study of iterated maps, which are mathematical abstractions for processes which are repeated many times.  Such repeated processes are commonly found in many diverse fields.  For instance, many biological processes, such as DNA replication, are simple procedures which are repeated many times.  More directly related to the current project is the notion of a genetic algorithm, which is an attempt to use some of the features of biological reproduction, such as genetic crossover and competition, to produce effective computer algorithms.  The crossover part of this procedure can be modeled by iterated maps very similar to those under study in the current project.  An important feature of repeated processes is that many times, a slight change in the parameters of a process which  is repeated many times can lead to a drastic change in the final outcome.   While this may be desirable behavior in some cases, it is more common to prefer systems which are reliable and relatively unaffected by small errors or changes in conditions.  Hence it is natural to ask which processes are stable in the sense that a small change in parameters leads to a small change in the final outcome.  Resolving this question for some systems is the primary aim of the current project."

The research topics come from three areas: the   Ginzburg-Landau model for superconductivity, the Cahn-Hilliard model   for phase transitions, and the structure  of stable solutions to  volume-constrained least area problems. A common goal throughout  the proposal is to study the existence, disappearance, and structure  of local minimizers to problems arising in continuum mechanics when  relevant parameters are altered. In the work centered on   superconductivity, the P.I. will focus on problems concerning the  complex relationship between the size of an applied magnetic field   and the behavior of vortices which appear within the superconducting   sample.  The projects related to phase transitions concern the   structure of transition layers bridging two (or more) phases within   the context of the Cahn-Hilliard theory of phase transitions. This   work is inextricably linked to the study of volume-constrained least   area problems. These geometry problems are quite subtle, and their  resolution should shed light on the structure of phase transitions in  the Cahn-Hilliard setting as well.         This proposal concerns research projects related to the study of  superconductors and to the study of phase transitions in fluids or   alloys. In the production of superconductors, a major concern is the   emergence of vortices which are little ""defects"" in the sample leading  to a loss of perfect conductivity. In this proposal, the P.I. will use  the so-called Ginzburg-Landau theory as a model for the superconductor  in order to investigate the emergence, disappearance, and placement of  these ""defects"" when the sample is subjected to a magnetic field.  In  the research devoted to phase transitions, the P.I. will study  mathematical models for binary alloys (Cahn-Hilliard theory) and for  two-fluid systems (van der Waals the ory). The goal is to understand  the possible shape of the boundaries between different phases of a   medium. Particular attention will be paid to the effect of the   boundary of the container holding the medium on the structure of these  so-called transition layers. These studies are related to questions  about the possible shape of bubbles confined to a container. Since  these bubbles tend to hug the wall of the enclosing container, one  wants to understand how the specific shape of the container will  affect the structure of the stable bubble."

The dynamics of polynomial maps of C has been studied in depth and has produced a theory which is both a beautiful and compelling model for many systems in nature.  The principal emphasis is a two-part investigation of polynomial diffeomorphisms of C^2.  The first part involves mappings for which the Julia set is connected:  to analyze the structure of the dynamical set J and the structure of parameter space (a higher-dimensional Mandelbrot space).  The second part involves diffeomorphisms of C^2 which are quasi-hyperbolic: these mappings are not uniformly expanding on the infinitesimal level but have uniform expansion and bounded geometry at a fixed (finite) level .  This work involves several mathematical techniques from complex analysis:  harmonic measure, pluri-potential theory, and the geometry of currents.    Many physical processes are modeled as dynamical systems:  systems which evolve over time as the iteration (repetition) of  a specific rule.  An interesting discovery has been that even if the defining rule is rather simple, the resultant  behavior can show surprising complex behavior over time.  One of the most intriguing features of this model has been the way the behavior of the system depends on parameters (the period-doubling cascade to chaotic behavior).  This is more clearly seen when we pass to the (seemingly more complicated) complex system.  The behavior in the complex leads to an interplay between dynamic space and parameter space.  The resulting parameter (bifurcation) space is the Mandelbrot set, which has been shown to have ""universal"" properties.  We consider the dynamics of polynomial mappings of two complex variables, which are what is obtained when the analogous behavior is considered in two variables.  Our research seeks to identify the analogue of the Mandelbrot in two complex dimensions and to ident ify its associated dynamical properties."

Of special interest are   defects in liquid crystals and vortices (filaments) in superconductors. One  describes the geometrical properties, topological structures, and  dynamical behavior of these defects by analyzing the so-called defect  measures. It is a rather formidable task. For liquid crystals one has to  study first a certain nonlinear coupling of equations of Navier-Stokes type  with those of evolutionary approximate harmonic map systems. For  superconductivity, one studies then the flow of Yang-Mills with certain  nonlinear effects (Eliashberg-Gorkov equations). The next key issues  are understanding the development of singularities of solutions, such as  energy concentrations, sharp interfaces, and bubbling phenomena. In  particular, one must examine singularities in the flow of harmonic and  approximate harmonic maps and the dynamics of vortices and filaments in  Ginzburg-Landau equations. This study should also  give insight into other problems that arise in classical fluid dynamics.         Various natural phenomena can be described by solutions of certain  partial differential equations. Often singular behavior of solutions reveal  not only facets but also essential characteristics of the problems they  describe. The latter is very important for technological and industrial  applications. For example, the type II superconductors (high-temperature  super-conductors) are characterized by the existence of a certain lattice structure  of vortices and filaments. To  control the dynamics of these  vortices and  filaments is one of the central issues for the applicability of these   high-tech materials. It is, therefore, a very basic problem of continuing  interest. Despite many serious efforts, very few mathematical methods exist  so far to tackle such problems. The present proposal presents  a new and novel theoretical approach which has already been shown, by   preliminary analysis, to be useful for a class of problems arising in  material science. Modern technology needs high performance, high energy  efficiency, and high accuracy. Both liquid crystals and superconductors are  in such a category. This study will yield new and insightful qualitative  and quantitative information regarding these fascinating materials, in  addition to having its own intrinsic mathematical importance and interest."

These operators are the dynamics generators of the systems governed by three-dimensional wave equations with spatially non-homogeneous non-spherically symmetric coefficients containing first order damping terms.  This proposal is based on twelve works by PI (supported by NSF Grant DMS-92 12037 and two Texas Advanced Research Program Grants: 00364-116, 93-95 and 0036-44-124, 95-97).  In these works, the PI carried out a detailed asymptotic analysis of the spectrum and proved the Riesz basis property of the root vectors for two classes on non-selfadjoint operators: the dynamics generators for the equation of a non-homogeneous damped string with dissipative boundary conditions at the ends of a finite interval and the dynamics generators for three-dimensional damped wave equation with non-constant spherically symmetric coefficients with dissipative boundary conditions on a sphere. The first objective of this project is to make the next significantly more difficult step:  to extend the spectral results to the three-dim damped wave equation with non-spherically symmetric coefficients and dissipative boundary conditions on a sphere.  The plan of this analysis is based on a combination of the methods developed in the aforementioned works and the PI's earlier works on resonances and resonance states for three-dimensional Schrodinger operators with non spherically symmetric potentials.  The second objective is to apply the results to the control and stabilization problems for linear distributed parameter systems using the spectral decomposition method.     An important area of modern mathematical analysis, which has a wide range of applications to engineering problems, is related to control of the so-called distributed parameter systems.  Examples of such systems include complicated vibrating elastic structures containing as their elements membranes, shell s, etc.  The objective of control is to achieve the desired behavior of the system by applying an external control force to it.  Problems of this type are of the primary importance in robotics (e.g., manipulation of a robot arm) and in aerospace engineering (e.g., stabilization of an aircraft).  The aforementioned control problems were considered in recent years in extensive mathematical literature and a considerable progress towards their solution was made.  In many cases, however, only the existence of the desired control functions was rigorously proved which left an open question of direct and efficient numerical computations of the controls.  A method that provides explicit algorithms for the computation of controls is known.  This is the method of the spectral decomposition.  The application of this method, however, encounters serious mathematical difficulties which significantly restricts its area of applicability to practical problems.  Namely, the method deals with a complicated area of modern analysis- ""the spectral theory of non-selfadjoint operators.""  The spectral theory of ""selfadjoint operators"" is a classical chapter of mathematics and serves as a main tool in quantum physics.  Because of the difficulties in the area, the applications of the method were until recently restricted to one- dimensional structures (like strings or rods).  Moreover, the phenomenon of the energy dissipation due to the internal friction was not taken into account in these models.  The main objective of this project is to extend the results to the most practically important three-dimensional systems with the internal friction."

Although the hairy ball theorem was proved long ago, its higher dimensional cousins have resisted attack. The most notorious is the Seifert Conjecture, a question asked in 1950 by Herbert Seifert of the University of Heidelberg.   ...  The surprising answer, just announced by Krystyna Kuperberg of Auburn University  ...  destined to change the face of higher-dimensional dynamics.""  Hairy Balls in Higher Dimensions, by Ian Stewart, New Scientist, 23 November 1993, page 18.  Seifert proved that under certain conditions a non-singular vector field on the 3-dimensional sphere has a periodic orbit. The statement that there are no aperiodic vector fields on the 3-sphere, the Seifert Conjecture, remained unsolved until a 1974 counterexample of P.A.Schweitzer (class C-1, improved to C-2 by J.Harrison).  The vector field constructed by the P.I. to answer Seifert's question is much smoother than the previous examples-  C-infinity, and even real analytic.  As usual, new methods raise more questions and more possibilities for theoretical investigations, and in this case also computerized simulations."

The best known problems of this type, in fluid mechanics,   concern the regularity of the  three dimensional  Euler and   Navier-Stokes equations. Another well known problem is   that of finding a correct concept of global   generalized solutions, including shock discontinuities,  to compressible Euler equations.  Similar questions arise also in General Relativity. The   problem of regularity has been formulated, by Penrose,   under the code name of ""Cosmic Censorship"". It states,  roughly, that the stable solutions of the  Einstein Field Equations should exclude ""naked   singularities"", i.e. singularities not hidden by black holes.    Most of these problems are today out of reach. My objective is  to help develop tools for attacking these fundamental problems    by concentrating my attention on the simplified   situation of the Yang-Mills and Wave Maps field equations. As  is known, the Yang-Mills equations are at the heart of our  most successful particle physics theory, the so called standard  model. The Wave Maps equations appear naturally when we look  for special solutions of the Einstein equations.        The question of break-down of solutions to the Euler and Navier-Stokes  equations governing  the behavior of  fluids and  gases  and of the Einstein field equations of General Relativity is of  fundamental significance.  In the case of the former,  this problem is intimately tied to the highly unstable behavior  of fluids and has bearing on the practical problems of taming   turbulence and predicting the weather. In the case of General  Relativity, the problem has deep significance to our understanding  of the Universe, since black holes and singularities are the  most important, and least understood, predictions of General   Relativity.  While from a physical point of view these  theories seem very different,  mathematically they bear a lot of  similarities. Due to the non-linear character of these problems,  they have led, throughout this century, to the development  of new qualitative techniques in which mathematicians have  played a leading role. Some of these techniques are now  routinely used in practice. The final goals remain  distant, and the investigator would consider this    proposal a ringing success if it can help make a dint on  these difficult problems."

These concern structure and   stability of interfacial solutions arising in singular   limit problems, specifically SHOCK WAVES and PHASE   BOUNDARIES.  Stability is a central topic in shock   wave theory, connected with such issues as physical   admissibility of hyperbolic waves, convergence of   difference schemes, and the inviscid limit problem.    Zumbrun proposes to study a variety of related questions,   from stability of  multidimensional viscous shock waves   in compressible Navier-Stokes equations to physical   significance of oscillatory shock layers in a nonlocal,   dispersive sedimentation model. The planned methods of   analysis include, among others,  pointwise, Green's   function techniques which have proved to be useful in   other situations of delicate stability, spectral analysis   using matrix perturbation theory, and Evans function   techniques borrowed from the study of reaction diffusion   fronts.  Likewise, structure of phase boundaries is a   central topic in the study of phase transitions.  In the   limit of zero transition layer thickness, Cahn-Hilliard   models for phase transition reduce to idealized minimal   surface problems, and the phase boundaries to minimal   surfaces.  This link is a rich source of intuition,   suggesting new problems in both the geometry and pde   setting.  Zumbrun proposes several of these for study,   most notably the regularity of ""Neumann"" solutions   for the minimal surface problem.  The planned method   of analysis is by a combination of pde and geometric   measure theory techniques.    The behavior and structure of interfaces is a topic  of basic physical interest, as the organizing principle   for a variety of effects seen in nature.  For example,   soap bubbles are well known to form minimum interfacial   energy structures identified by the property that they   have minimal surface area.  These are also STABLE under   small perturbations , by the principle that systems move   always toward lower-energy states, in this case back toward  the minimal energy configuration.  At the same time, the    large-scale distribution of matter in the visible universe   seems to have a similar structure, with vast voids surrounded   by  thin layers of galaxies. Apparently, we live on an   interface--evidently, also, the minimization of quite   different energies can lead to similar structure through a   common mathematical mechanism.  The examples given above  are just two  instances of the interfaces known as  PHASE   BOUNDARIES.   Other important interfaces are SHOCK WAVES,   or moving boundaries separating substances of very different   properties (most usually, a ""front"" separating air of very   different temperature or pressure).  Like phase boundaries,   these are ubiquitous in nature, from sonic booms to ""waves""   of concentration in a chemical reaction.  Again, it is   stability or instability that determines whether a particular  shock structure will persist or break up.   The mathematics   governing stability of  interfaces is rather subtle and is   by no means completely understood.  Indeed, the projects   proposed by Zumbrun concern basic theoretical questions   that must be answered before we can confidently pursue   practical applications such as computer modeling of these   phenomena in the variety of settings to which they pertain."

The first is related with Voiculescu's free probability theory and harmonic analysis. An important direction here is the sudy of limit laws for the multiplicative free convolution. Unlike classical harmonic analysis, the study of multiplicative convolution cannot simply be reduced to the additive case by taking logarithms. It is already known that there are some unexpected `Poisson like' probability distributions related with multiplicative free convolution. An important obstacle is the correct formulation of the classical limit theorems, even the central limit theorem, in the free multiplicative case.  The second line of Bercovici's research is in operator theory and its interactions with function theory, control theory, and other areas.  Among the specific problems in this area are the model theories of restrictions and compressions of operators, and the study of dual algebras generated by commuting families of operators. He also plans to return to the study of skew Toeplitz operators beyond the fairly well understood   scalar case.    In order to give some motivation for the research in this proposal I would like to recall that in the current description of subatomic processes one has to deal with probabilistic processes. Thus, for instance, the location of a particle is not known with precision at any given moment. One has instead the probability that that particle appears in a given region of space.  Some versions of noncommutative probability theory deal with some of the aspects of quantum chemistry for instance.  Free probability theory is likely to occur at some point in the quantum description of nature.  Besides, it is an interesting object of study because it provides, in some sense, the `only' alternative probability theory.  The operator theoretical part of this project stems to a great extent from problems raised by the control theory of large structures. Some earlier results in this theory were proposed a s the main control mechanism of the NASP.  While Bercovici's expertise in the practical side of this theory is limited, control theorists can formulate their problems in theoretical terms, thus making the application of operator theoretical methods possible."

Traditional methods for planar   constructions exploit translational invariance, absent for   triangulations on the sphere. b) Irregular subdivision schemes   construct curves or surfaces from irregular grids, placing new grid   points in positions that are not equally spaced (even locally) as   the grids are refined. Similar to the equally spaced  case, preservation of polynomial behavior plays an important role in  determining the smoothness of the limit curve or surface. Such   irregular subdivision schemes are being explored. c) Approaches to   decompose wavelet filters into elementary matrices in an  efficient manner, and possibly using only integers. d) Frames of   wavelets can be used for multiplexing of signals, similar to  CDMA, as well as for sending information efficiently over multiple  channels. e) The role of smart coding strategies in realizing the   full potential of wavelet-based nonlinear approximation theorems.    Wavelets are a mathematical technique that allows us to view a   complex structure as consisting of several, increasingly detailed   layers. This ""multi-resolution analysis"" is analogous to viewing   a painting from a distance, where only large features can be   distinguished, and then, as we approach closer, perceiving more   detailed, smaller features, until, when we are very close, we can   detect even individual brush strokes. As a  mathematical tool that has this potential to ""fill in"" detail at  increasingly small scales, and only where needed, wavelets have   turned out to be useful in computer aided graphic design, in image   and data compression, and in mathematical analysis and numerical    computation, in particular for composite materials. Several of the   mathematical problems in this proposal are inspired by such   applications of wavelets, and their solutions will widen the scope   of settings in which we can use multi-resolution analysis."

A multiplicative index theory will be studied and its connections with the Hirzebruch proportionality principle and the Selberg trace formula will be pursued.  Also, a general index theory for eroupoids will be worked out and applied to problems of quantization.    This project deals with using  mathematical methods to study situations that occur when describing the physical world.  In general, when modeling phenomena using mathematics, slight changes in measurements can radically change the predictions of the theory.  This is one aspect of the notion of ``chaos''.  The classification of the kinds of ``chaos'' which can occur is one of the goals of the present work.  The methods used arose first in the early stages of quantum mechanics and have become a well developed part of mathematics.  They take advantage of the simple idea that the order in which one does two operations   effects the outcome.  Developing that notion mathematically leads to the study of matrices, or ``generalized numbers''.  This, in turn, lead to associating these ``generalized numbers'' to chaotic systems.  Moreover, they are computable and go a long way to  providing a complete list of the possibilities.  It is interesting that these mathematical ideas originally would not have been expected to be useful in this setting, and it was only after their intensive development from a purely mathematical point of view that the idea of   applying them in this way occurred.  This work introduces the use of ``wavelets'', which had been developed for practical work in sending televised images in the most cost effective way.  It is very surprising that they can also be used in the study of ``chaos'' and we expect that this relation will lead to progress in the general theory of wa velets."

In particular, dynamical systems arise in physics (Lorenz map), biology and environmental studies (population dynamics) and chemistry (e.g. modeling the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction). The development of the system depends on its initial state and parameters coming from the ""environment.""  It is of great importance that we understand the future behavior which may be exhibited by the system for the ""majority"" of its initial states; this corresponds to the description of so-called attractors to which the first part of the project is devoted. Also in the first part of the proposal we study how properties of some important dynamical systems depend on ""environmental"" parameters. Sometimes phenomena exhibited by a system are related to one another and information about some of them allows one to make a judgment about the existence of others; in other words phenomena coexist. A good example here is periodicity, i.e. cyclic occurrence of the same states in the system. It turns out that the existence of a cyclic process with a given period for some initial state guarantees that another cyclic process with a different period can be realized for a different initial state and the same environment.

The previous two conferences, in 1967 and 1980, contributed significantly to the development of the area.     The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of algebras of operators on Hilbert space.  Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an algebra , naturally called an operator algebra.  These seemingly abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.

The first   project investigates the following three related topics:  (i)  the  scaling limit of  tagged   particles, (ii) the equilibrium fluctuation and  (iii) the appropriate time scale for dimensions   1 and 2.  The first problem emphasizes the  individual behavior of a typical particle instead   of the collective behavior of all the particles. The second problem is a question about the  central limit theorem. The third problem addresses  the time scale  in dimensions 1 and  2,   which is conjectured  to be very different from the diffusive scale in dimension 3. The   second project  studies the relaxation  rates of the Kawasaki dynamics of  Gibbs states in   infinite volume. This is believed to be  a power law. The method is  based on the Poincare   inequalities (spectral gap), logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and some entropy estimates.   The third project concerns the scaling limit of a quantum particle in a random potential.   There are two limiting cases: the low density  limit and the weak coupling limit. In both   cases, the phase space density of the quantum evolution  defined through  the Wigner   transform or the coherent state is expected to converge weakly to  a linear  Boltzmann   equation with  collision kernel given by the quantum   scattering  cross section.   This research addresses in particular the following two questions: (1) What is the   typical behavior of an individual particle in a fluid? Though the collective behavior of fluid    has been studied intensively, the important  question of the propagation of individual    particles in the fluid has not. The project will study this question with stochastic models   which are believed to capture the essential behavior of  the fluid.  (2) How does a wave   travel in random media. It is believed that  with high disorder, a wave in random media    becomes loca lized. The important question is to analyze the low disorder region when a   wave propagates. This can be considered as a model for conduction  of current in a   semiconductor, or propagation of radio waves or seismic waves. The practical  equation   governing all these diverse phenomena  is the  Boltzmann equation. This study will try to   validate the Boltzmann equation from more basic models involving  wave equations in   random media and to understand its next order corrections or fluctuations."

The main principle at work here is that there are fundamental connections between classes of operators arising in harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, and probability theory.  For example, there is a very strong connection between the behavior of martingales and the averages in ergodic theory.  This is clear where maximal functions are concerned, but it also is an important principle in regards to upcrossings of both processes.  Using estimates on the degree to which ergodic averages are a perturbation of suitable martingales, precise estimates on oscillation of ergodic sums can be analyzed.  There has been a good deal of success in this direction in the work of Jones, Kaufman,   Rosenblatt, and Wierdl, but additional studies of these properties are much needed .  In particular, it is proposed here to show that the best possible jump and upcrossing  inequalities in ergodic theory are the ones that can be obtained by relating the ergodic averages to martingales.  In this same spirit, the variational behavior of ergodic averages  is linked closely to the behavior of martingales. In recent work in ergodic theory, the importance of square functions for measuring the oscillation of general averages of ergodic transformations has become very clear.  This work has also led to obtaining estimates on the square function of the difference between ergodic sums and martingales.  Such analysis is yet in progress.However, the analysis of square functions of moving averages and of related operator sequences is not yet at all complete.  Also, other aspects of differences in ergodic theory, like unconditionality, and how they mimic the  behavior of martingale difference sequences, is well worth more investigation.      This grant is to fund the study of the long term behavior of dynamical systems and stochastic processes.  Many important physical phenomena, as varied as the beha vior of the stock market, lines in the supermarket, and data being received from a distant transmission source, exhibit locally erratic behavior which can be understood better by looking at the long term average behavior instead.  The study of such stochastic processes and their connections with one another, as well as their connections in terms of their fine structure with other less random processes, is a central one in modern mathematics.  It is only through such studies that we will be able to understand better and thus  be able to control or predict the evolution of the physical phenomena which this mathematics can model."

The proof of the corresponding equivariant index theorem, namely that this topological index is equal to G.

The proposed research deals with the index theory of elliptic differential operators   on manifolds which commute with the action of a locally compact transformation group,   i.e., studying the spaces of solutions of differential equations which exhibit certain degrees  of internal symmetry. Associated with each elliptic operator is an ""analytic index,""   which can carry important topological and geometric information about the manifold  the operator is associated with. However, this analytic index is very difficult to compute  in general, requiring a great deal of detailed analysis.

Being able to compute the  indices of these elliptic operators should lead to a clearer understanding of a variety  of problems in geometry and representation theory, which are important to physics.

Two scale dilation   equations arise in a wide variety of applications, including   orthonormal wavelet bases and subdivision schemes for computer   generation of curves and surfaces. Self-affine tiles are closely  related to two scale dilation equations in the sense that the  characteristic function of any self-affine tile satisfies a two scale  dilation equation. While the study of two scale dilation equations in   higher  dimensions has always attracted attention, the study of   selfaffine tiling has gained considerable momentum recently due to   its applications in constructing orthonormal wavelets and the growing   interests in aperiodic tiling and quasicrystals. Wang intends to study   non separable wavelet bases in higher dimensions, self-affine tiles,   and mathematical quasicrystals.    Orthonormal wavelets in dimension two or more are extremely   important for numerous applications, especially in signal processing   and image compression.  In the later case, for instance, a wavelet   transform is applied to a  given image and compression is then carried  on the transform. The  wavelet used will be two dimensional, as an   image. Up to now, we have not had a good method  to construct these   wavelet other than by multiplying  two one dimensional wavelets.  These wavelets lead to subtle  artifacts in the decompressed   images such as jagged diagonal lines and slight blackness. It is   believed that those artifacts can be reduced by using genuinely two   dimensional wavelets. Wang has outlined certain approach which may   potentially lead to the construction of this kind of wavelet.  Recently Schechtman and others have formed metal alloys that have  aperiodic atomic structures, generating great interests among   chemists, physicists, and mathematicians in the study of   quasicrystal . Wang proposes to study this quasicrystals from the   mathematical point of view."

Obtained by taking a closure of analytic functions with respect to   function operations (algebraic operations, including division,   composition, differentiation, integration, etc.) they preserve many   analytic function properties, including unique representation by   expansions (formalizability) and permanence of relations. In addition  to the intrinsic interest in exploring the limits of formalizability,   there is a major practical interest in reconstructing actual   solutions from formal expansions for a wide class of equations.   A complete theory of analyzable functions is likely to have an   impact in many branches of pure and applied analysis.    Costin has carried out this construction rigorously for functions   arising as solutions to linear or nonlinear differential systems   near generic singularities. Costin will use new techniques in the   classification of nonlinear differential systems near irregular   singularities, up to analytic equivalence, in providing sharp   information on the nature and location of singularities of nonlinear   systems, in the study of solvability in closed form of equations,  in solving connection problems and in justifying and improving   hyper-asymptotic numerical methods.  The technique will also be   extended to cover PDE's and difference equations.    Asymptotic analysis is an important method of  investigation in complex systems. In many important cases however,   the quantities of interest are influenced by parameters too small   to be controlled by classical asymptotics. The field of exponential  asymptotics has been introduced as a successful theoretical and  computational framework to deal with these situations and applied in  problems ranging from number theory to optics and quantum  mechanics.

Shapiro   proved that if a multiple trigonometric series is everywhere Abel   spherically summable to an integrable function and if Shapiro's   condition holds, then it is the Fourier series of that function.    Shapiro's condition states that the ratio of the sum of the absolute   values of the coefficients lying in an annulus of unit thickness   to the radius tends to zero as the radius tends to infinity. A  more natural condition is Connes' condition: that the sum of the   squares of the coefficients lying on the surface of a sphere tends   to zero as the radius tends to infinity. Since Connes' condition   is a consequence of everywhere convergence, Bourgain was able to   avoid any coefficient growth assumptions when he proved that a   multiple trigonometric series everywhere spherically convergent to   zero is the zero function. Ash and Wang will try to prove Shapiro's   result with  Connes' condition replacing Shapiro's condition in the   hypothesis. A corollary of this theorem would be spherical uniqueness   for trigonometric series that converge everywhere to an integrable   function. Furthermore, Ash and Wang would like to lighten the   hypothesis of everywhere convergence, by allowing an exceptional set   on which convergence is not assumed.  Such a set is called a set of   uniqueness. Ash and Wang would like to show that all countable sets   and certain uncountable  sets are sets of uniqueness.      Almost any surface is composed of simpler ones by a process called  multiple Fourier analysis. A major long standing problem in pure   mathematics is to show that this construction can be accomplished   in only one way. This is called the problem of uniqueness. There are   about a half dozen main varieties of this problem depending on just   how the simpler surfaces are c ombined to make the general surface.   In particular, Ash and Wang will try to determine if uniqueness   holds for square convergent double trigonometric series.  Ash and Wang will also try to  show that certain thin sets may be   ignored when considering the question of uniqueness for spherically   convergent multiple trigonometric series.  Since we live in a four   dimensional world of space and time, it is also necessary to study   a higher dimensional version of a surface.  Such an object is called   a manifold.  Just as surfaces are associated with double   trigonometric series, manifolds are associated with  multiple trigonometric series. Thus, Ash and Wang will also try to   determine if uniqueness holds for spherically convergent   multiple trigonometric series."

It is both basic  and applied and can be divided into two parts: partial  differential equations in infinite dimensional  spaces and applications to stochastic optimal control, and  elliptic and parabolic equations. As regards the first part, the  investigator plans to continue research in the development of  the theory of viscosity solutions (i.e. generalized solutions)  of second order HJBI equations in Hilbert space. The basic  issues are the existence and uniqueness of solutions, their  regularity, convergence properties, etc. HJBI equations are  of great importance from the point of view of applications,  since they are so-called dynamic programming equations,  corresponding to problems of stochastic optimal control of  dynamical systems driven by stochastic partial differential  equations. The second part of the proposed research concentrates  on some fundamental problems in the theory of fully nonlinear,  second order, uniformly elliptic and parabolic partial differential  equations. The major issue is the regularity and uniqueness of  solutions of nonlinear, uniformly parabolic and elliptic  equations which are not continuous in the space variable and,  on a larger scale, the development of a theory of generalized  solutions for fully nonlinear equations with measurable  ingredients. Despite some recent results, uniqueness is in general  still a major open problem, even for linear equations, where it is  connected to the uniqueness of so-called martingale solutions of  stochastic differential equations with discontinuous diffusion  coefficient. Finally the investigator proposes to work on a notion of  weak solution for degenerate elliptic and parabolic partial differential  equations with measurable terms. Equations of this type appear, for  instance, in problems involving motion driven by mean curva ture.  The classical theory of viscosity solutions does not apply here.  Its extension to such cases is needed.    The notion of viscosity solution is widely used by applied   mathematicians, and the proposed research has a potential of having  far-reaching consequences in applied sciences, especially the part  of it dealing with HJBI equations and control of dynamical systems  driven by stochastic partial differential equations. In real life  these are systems governed by partial differential equations that  exhibit noisy behavior. Applications range from engineering to  mathematical finance. One has to mention stochastic optimal  control of nonlinear partially observed systems (so-called  nonlinear filtering), distributed and boundary control of systems  modelled by stochastic partial differential equations, minimax  type control of infinite dimensional systems widely used in  engineering (which is connected to infinite dimensional differential  games), risk-sensitive control of small noise systems  (important in control of adaptive tracking devices), and recent  market models of interest rate dynamics (option pricing). The  investigator is convinced that the proposed research will help  understand the above problems and will provide a mathematical  framework that can be used by people working in these areas."

The mechanism   for combining the structural decomposability features of harmonic   analysis and operator theory will be the transference theory   initiated by A.P. Calder n and Coifman-Weiss.  Studies aimed at   expanding the scope and vistas of transference theory will be   involved, as will applications of transference theory to harmonic   analysis.       The central theme of the project will be a unified overview   providing new avenues for applying classical analysis to its own   settings and to general mathematical analysis.  The broad scope of   the methods will be aimed at new vistas and discoveries applicable   to a wide variety of mainstream mathematical subjects.  From the   standpoint of human resources, the NSF support awarded for the   operations of the Wabash Modern Analysis Seminar, which functions as   a Mid-Western regional seminar attracting national and international   participation, will provide ready access to the frontiers of knowledge   for many young researchers and graduate students, while furthering   a wide array of research programs."

Nachtergaele will uork on three classes of problems in quantum  spin (and related) systems. The first is the characterization of the complete  set of ground states in infinite  volume. Here, ground states are defined in  the sense of stability under arbitrary local perturbations. This problem is  best tractable for models with a unique ground state, such as the AKLT model. A  harder but also more important problem is to characterize the complete set of  ground states when this set includes non-periodic states, such as interface  states, which is the case, e.g., for the XXZ Heisenberg model. A second problem  is to study the fluctuation  properties and low-lying excitations of interface  states in quantum statistical mechanics models both at zero and non-zero  temperature. The proposal is to prove stability of the 111 interface at  sufficiently low temperatures in the Falicov-Kimball model, and, in a second  phase, to study 111 interfaces in the XXZ Heisenberg model, where new   phenomena related to continuous spectrum should be expected. The third proposed  line of research is to analyze and use a new implementation of the Density   Matrix Renormalization Group method to study various phenomena in   quasi-one-dimensional systems.      Quantum statistical mechanics is an area of growing interest because many of   the phenomena that are being discovered and studied today are intrinsically   quantum mechanical: Bose condensation, superfluidity, superconductivity,  quantum optics, quantum computation, and many of the most interesting aspects  of magnetism.  Quantum spin models are models for the magnetic properties of a  large variety of materials, many of which have only been recently synthesized.  The importance of magnetic properties is not just that they allow us to  understand the behavior of magnets. Often there is an interaction between  magnetic (spin) structure and elect ronic and geometric structure of the  material. The novel spin-Peierls materials that in the last couple of years  received so much attention are a good example of this interaction. It has been  known for some time that antiferromagnetic correlations are an important aspect  of high-temperature superconductors. Another example where magnetic and  transport properties influence each other are the Giant Magneto Resistance  materials. The approach in this project is mathematical, and is complementary  to the experimental and theoretical research on the same materials by chemists  and physicists. This proposal addresses fundamental questions about the  mathematical structure of quantum lattice models.  Nachtergaele will also work  on the implementation of new mathematical insights into more efficient  computational methods.  This research will provide hands-on learning  opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students who not only want to  become well-versed in mathematics  but also have an interest in concrete  applications. In the process these students will become familiar with the  language of physicists and chemists working on the same or related problems.  This will prepare them better for future careers in an interdisciplinary  environment."

However,   this theorem is of limited use due to two reasons.  The first is   the  requirement that all characteristic roots of the limiting   equation have  distinct moduli.  The second reason is that the   theorem does not provide  explicit asymptotic representations of   solutions of difference equations.   Levinson's Theorem or rather   its discrete analogue addressed the second  deficiency by providing   the desirable asymptotic representation of solutions  of difference   equations.  However, Levinson's Theorem puts a severe restriction   on the coefficients of the difference equation in question since   it requires that they  are summable.   The latter condition makes   the applicability of the the theorem  rather limited, particulaply   in orthogonal polynomials, combinatorics, special  functions, and   continued fractions. The proposed research is directed toward   addressing the deficiencies in the above two important theorems.    It will attempt  to complete and unify asymptotic theory using a   unified approach via the theory  of dichotomy.    Difference equations are one of the basic mathematical tools of   computation. There is hardly a computational task which does not   rely on recursive techniques, at one time or another.  The widespread   use of difference equations can be ascribed to their intrinsic   constructive quality, and the great ease with which  they are   amenable to mechanization.  On the other hand, like most recursive   processes, difference equations are susceptible to error growth.    If conditions  are unfavorable, the resulting propagation of error   may or will be disastrous.  Hence the need to investigate the   asymptotic and qualitative behavior of solutions  of difference   equations.  This is of paramount importance since difference   equations occur prominently in many branches of applied mathematics,   Economics,  population dynamics, Chaos Theory, mathematical physics,   etc.  Asymptotics is even more important in Computer Science where   it is used to rate  algorithms and how fast and accurate they are."

Stolz of the University of Alabama at Birmingham will conduct a  research project on the appearance of ""localization"" in various classes   of random operators which arise in mathematical physics.

Dr. Stolz' research will  aim at a better understanding of mathematical models of multidimensional  disordered media. Specific goals include   (i) the extension of existing results on localization to models which  give a more realistic description of disordered media, such as alloys and  amorphous materials, than the models studied previously;   (ii) an intensified investigation of three-dimensional models based on  random point-interactions, which have potential of providing new insights  in high energy spectral characteristics and can also be used to study  physical properties of random surfaces and random polymers.    Disordered media are studied extensively in various physical disciplines  such as solid state physics, optics, and electrodynamics, as well as in  materials science. They comprise various types of materials, for example  alloys, crystals with impurities (e.g. semiconductors), and amorphous   solids. Random operators provide mathematical models of disordered media.  These operators can be studied by using methods from mathematical spectral  and scattering theory. They allow to describe and thus predict   conductivity properties and the characteristics of wave propagation in  disordered media. For example, the mathematical phenomenon of localization,  as studied by Dr. Stolz, characterizes insulators (electrical insulators,  respectively sound insulators, depending on the underlying physical model).  While a number of important results have been obtained for these models,  it will be the goal of future research to study more realistic models  and to get a b etter theoretical understanding of the underlying   phenomena from physics."

The main focus   of the project is the study of the maximal averaging operators   introduced by E. M. Stein, and the averaging convolution operators   originally studied by Littman and  Strichartz. Iosevich proposes a   set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the Lp boundedness of  maximal averaging operators, and a set of necessary and sufficient   conditions for the (Lp, Lq) boundedness of the averaging convolution   operators. Both sets of conditions are expressed in terms of   the integrability of the negative powers of the distance functions to   the tangent planes to the hypersurface. Iosevich will also work on  the problem of Lp boundedness of the maximal Bochner-Riesz means   associated with the smooth convex bodies in Rn. It has been   conjectured that these operators should have the same mapping   properties as the standard maximal Bochner-Riesz means associated   with the ball.      The study of the maximal averaging operators and other similar   operators in harmonic analysis is partially motivated by the   following interesting question: How close can we come to recovering   a set of data from the various kinds of averages of that data? The   question is of potential practical value since scientists are often   called upon to make predictions based on average information. For   example, meteorologists make predictions about the rainfall in the   particular location based on the average rainfall in the years past   in the nearby towns. Seismologists make earthquake predictions based   on the pattern of shocks in the surrounding area. The tradeoff   involved in the study of these phenomena is, roughly speaking, the   following. If the data is very precise, then it can, generally   speaking, be recovered from any kind of a reasonable average. If the   data is less pre cise, then we have to make sure that the averaging   process compensates the deficiencies  of the data. The main thrust   of this project is to study the averaging phenomenon  when the data   is given by a certain kind of a mathematical function, and the   average is taken over a curved surface."

Specific topics to be studied are:  structure of inductive limits of C*-algebras, structure of groupoids and their C*-algebras, nonstable K-theory and the fundamental comparability question, and existence and properties of cohomology theories on C*-algebras.    If one takes the point of view that a space may be studied via the commutative C*-algebra of complex-valued continuous functions on the space, then the study of noncommutative C*-algebras is a natural generalization.  Furthermore, there are numerous situations in ordinary geometry and topology where the natural object of study is a ""singular space"" which often cannot be studied directly in purely topological terms, but where there is a noncommutative C*-algebra which plays the exact role of the algebra of functions, and where C*-algebra theory has been a crucial tool in advancing the understanding of the topological situation.  There has been extensive work in recent years in generalizing notions of algebraic topology, and more recently related notions of differential geometry,  to C*-algebras.  This work has already paid off spectacularly with fundamental advances in the understanding of the structure of C*-algebras, as well as the beautiful and deep applications in geometry, topology, and mathematical physics.  Perhaps the most important result, though, is simply the bridge which has been constructed between operator algebras and topology, and the broad new level of understanding of the interconnections.  Virtually all of the research the proposers have done in recent years fits  into this general picture of noncommutative topology.  The specific projects proposed are continuations or natural outgrowths of previous work, taking into account the way the subject as a whole has developed."

The primary tool is a relatively easily understood operator  which resembles a Hankel operator on a Hilbert space. It has been recently  demonstrated by the investigator and by other authors that these  Hankel-type operators often possess a wealth of information on the Banach  space structure of the function spaces they operate on. It seems likely  that these methods could yield solutions of some open problems concerning  bounded analytic functions on the unit ball in several complex variables  and extend the solutions to strictly pseudoconvex domains. Spaces of  uniformly convergent Fourier series on the unit circle and polydisk will  also be studied.    The goal of this project is to further understand the relatively new  techniques being used to solve difficult problems in a variety of areas of  the branch of pure mathematics known as analysis. These new techniques  involve the replacement of complex computational tools with methods that  are more abstract and theoretical in nature and are currently becoming more  and more popular due to the powerful results that can be achieved with  relatively little effort. The type of results we seek to obtain are less of  an exact, numerical nature, but deal more those problems that in all  likelihood could not be solved by computation. At the center of the  research is a tool, called a Hankel-type operator, developed by the  investigator in his thesis which has found an increasing number of  applications since his doctoral work. One target of these ideas would be  problems in harmonic analysis, or Fourier series. Fourier series are the  building blocks for the theory of wavelets, a fast growing area having  applications to numerous types problems such as data compression, voice  recognition, and so on. Another important component of the project will be  problems of analytic func tions in one and several complex variables.  Otherwise known as complex analysis, this area of mathematics is intimately  connected to harmonic analysis, mentioned above. The key feature of the  results being sought after in this project is the generality in which they  work and also, once the tedious theoretical foundations have been laid, the  ease in which they can be applied."

Often the natural model spaces are complex manifolds (as opposed  to the real manifolds), the simplest being the complex Euclidean  spaces.

Such  coefficients may either vanish, be infinite, or both.  A primary goal is to study the validity of the Harnack  principle for nonnegative solutions and estimates of  the second derivatives of solutions. Though the theory for  divergence form equations with measurable coefficients  has been the focus of research during recent years,  the corresponding theory for non-divergence form  equations is much less developed. Non-divergence  equations are natural in Probability, Control Theory, and Finance.  The results known in this direction concern  either smooth coefficients or the strictly elliptic case,  but the methods developed for those cases do not  apply to the problems proposed.  In some cases the geometry needed to  study the linear equation is given by the Monge-Ampere equation,  a fully nonlinear partial differential equation.  This approach requires the study of the shape and invariance  properties of the level sets of solutions to the Monge-Ampere  equation, and further work will continue along these lines.  The basis and methodology that will be used to solve this  set of problems are via the maximum principle, localization,  and nonlinear variants of the Calderon-Zygmund decomposition.    This mathematical research is in the field of  partial differential equations, linear and nonlinear.

The approach is motivated by the analogy between the theories of rational maps and Kleinian groups developed by McMullen and Sullivan.  To an expanding, (equivalently, geometrically finite without cusps) torsion-free Kleinian group one may associate a topological object-the quotient compact three-manifold obtained by quotienting hyperbolic space together with the domain of discontinuity on the Riemann sphere at infinity by the action of the group.  To an expanding rational map one may also associate a topological object-the map viewed as a branched covering of the sphere to itself, up to a homotopy-theoretic form of equivalence.  A characterization of those branched coverings which are equivalent to an expanding rational map is known.  However, in contrast to the case of Kleinian groups, little is known in general about how combinatorial properties of these branched coverings are reflected in the geometry and dynamics of the corresponding rational maps and in their parameter spaces.  Motivated by the role played by the theory of incompressible surfaces in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the combinatorics of branched coverings will studied.  This analysis will be used to develop general combination and decomposition theories for ratimnal maps and general characterizations of adjacencies and compactness properties of hyperbolic components in parameter spaces of rational maps. A dynamical system is a mathematical model now widely used in many disciplines to describe biological, physical, and social phenomena.  The main theme in the subject is that even a very simple model can yield extremely complicated behavior.  Therefore one often simplifies the model first to make the problem tractable.  Next, one needs tools to attack these problems.  Finally, one looks for a reduction of the problem to a combinatorial one, i.e., one which, in principle, a computer can sol ve.  This project concerns reducing the dynamics of one-dimensional holomorphic functions (which are the simplest dynamical systems to which the powerful tools of complex analysis apply) to a combinatorial problem.  This problem, when formulated correctly, looks remarkably similar to one in a different field whose solution is already known.  The main goal of this project is to take these known results and, reasoning by analogy, formulate and prove new results in holomorphic dynamics."

The second project   is an analysis of dispersive linear equations, principally the   Schroedinger equation, addressing details of the local and   microlocal regularity of the fundamental solution and its   relationship to the global behavior of bicharacteristics of the   principal symbol. The third research project includes a special   focus on the mathematical analysis of free surface problems of   fluid dynamics.         The nonlinear differential equations studied in this project  occur in mathematical physics and engineering in a remarkable  variety of settings, from cosmology to fluid dynamics of the  ocean to nonlinear optics. Work in this field addresses some   of the basic characteristics of solutions of these equations,   which is a contribution to our knowledge of the physical world,   and which can contribute in nontrivial ways to developments   in advanced technology. This project also specifically pursues   the purely mathematical goal of developing the beautiful analogy   between the theory of classical mechanics of last century and   the modern theory of partial differential equations."

Issues such as existence of equilibria and their stability, pattern formation, spatial chaos, and traveling waves, will be examined for these equations.

A wide range of scientific areas is represented, including biology, chemistry, electrical circuit theory, image processing, and material science. While this is a very broad scope of inquiry, the specific problems to be studied exhibit features in common -- spontaneous formation of patterns, self-sustained oscillations, regulation by internal feedback (often with time delays) -- which can be analyzed with some of the basic tools of dynamical systems theory.  It is expected that the resulting the mathematical advances arising from these studies will increase the knowledge of, and will provide insight into, both the abstract theory of dynamical systems, and the scientific areas of inquiry."

Another goal is to  prove a unique continuation property which is the appropriate  substitute for uniqueness in the Cauchy problem for solutions to  elliptic boundary value problems.  The proposal is to use an optimal  hypothesis on the smoothness of the boundary, namely, Lipschitz  regularity.  The optimal hypothesis makes this a fundamental issue in  harmonic analysis.  A third goal is to solve two extremal problems for  eigenvalues, one related to regularity in the Neumann problem, the  other aimed at proving uniqueness in an inverse problem of finding a  domain given the density of the first variation of the eigenvalue as a  function of normal variation.  Another main goal concerns three  problems motivated by fluid mechanics.  The first problem is to show  that infinitesimal control on vorticity and compressibility implies  some global control.  The second problem relates the first to measures  of consistency of economic data.  The third is a free boundary problem  related to constructing equilibrium fluid flows with vortex lines.  The final goal is to study certain oscillatory integrals with singular  phases, with an application to pattern recognition in camera images.    The main project is to understand how the shape of a region affects  the distribution of heat in the region or how the shape of an  electrical conductor affects the distribution of electrical charge on  it.  These problems are closely related mathematically, even though  they describe very different physical systems.  The case of  temperature describes a refrigerator or building with insulated walls,  but the case of electrical charge describes electrical components like  wires and cables.  The main issue addressed in the part of the project  motivated by fluid mechanics is how stretching and twisting at small  scales  leads to changes in the shape, speed, and density of a fluid  (or air) at large scales.  This is a fundamental question in the  mechanics of solids, plastics, and elastic materials, as well as  fluids.  A similar mathematical model is encountered in economic  equilibrium theories.  The ultimate goal of the project in the  economics context is to give criteria for when a set of economic data  about purchases can be combined into a meaningful price index, despite  errors and inconsistency.  In other words, how small must  inconsistencies be in order that one can safely ignore them?  The  camera image project will use Fourier analysis to design a computer  program to recognize the angle a building makes with the camera's line  of sight based on a single photograph of the building.  The  determination from a single image would improve on existing techniques  using two images and make computer vision less subject to error."

A typical example of the former is the  Kakeya conjecture, that a set which contains a line segment in every   direction in R^n must have dimension n.  A typical example of the   latter is the generalized Strichartz estimate for various PDE (the   wave equation, the Schrodinger equation, etc.).  It has been known   since the 1970s that there is an intimate relationship between the   two types of statements, but no systematic approach exists, and the   few concrete connections that are known are not very satisfactory.    We hope to collect, simplify, unify, and extend previous results in   this direction. Tao will also attack some of these conjectures (notably   the Kakeya conjecture) directly, using some new and promising   techniques; for example, Tao will exploit the affine invariance of   the Kakeya conjecture.    One of the aims of this work is to deepen our understanding   of oscillatory integrals, which are a type of mathematical expression   which occur in many places in physics (optics, quantum mechanics,   acoustics, and any other field of physics dealing with waves), as well   as having theoretical importance in other fields of mathematics.    Understanding these integrals, and in particular knowing how large   they can get, may ultimately lead to new designs for physical   applications (e.g. tennis rackets that maximize the area of the   ""sweet spot"", or curved reflectors that have a large number of focus   points for a wide range of frequencies), or at least place theoretical   limits on such designs.  There are also numerical applications when   modeling certain physical systems (e.g. the seismic behavior of the   Earth); if one knows that a certain oscillatory integral will never   become very ""large"" in a certain technical sense, then this will   provide a theoretical guarantee to the accuracy of the computer   sim ulation of the physical system. Tao will study these   oscillatory integrals with the aid of geometry; a connection between   these two fields of mathematics is known (being somewhat similar to   the relationship between geometrical optics and the wave theory of   light), but is not understood completely.  If this connection is   developed thoroughly enough, we may be able to reduce difficult   questions in oscillatory integrals to simpler problems in geometry,   or at least use geometrical techniques to obtain partial progress on   the oscillatory integral problems."

In (1), he will  study some connections between the two fields: Banach space theory and   operator algebra theory. The primary goal of this direction of   research is to show that some classical results from  Banach space theory and harmonic analysis are still valid  for the non-commutative setting. One important direction is the   investigation of symmetric spaces of measurable operators  associated with semi finite von Neumann algebras. The basic   permanence question is whether or not a given property  can be preserved from a given function space to its non  commutative version. For instance, the classification  of (non commutative) spaces of finite  type (respectively  of finite cotype) is not known; there is the question of  which spaces have the Radon-Nikodym properties  associated with Riesz-subsets of a given  discrete group. Another direction is the study of  non commutative Hardy spaces associated with maximal finite  subdiagonal algebras of finite von Neumann algebras. For  example, it is unknown if Szego's theorem from classical   analysis is valid for the general non commutative setting.  It is still open if the predual of such maximal subalgebras  are of finite cotype. The same kind of investigation will  also be considered for non commutative Hardy spaces and the  non commutative disc algebras introduced by Popescu.  Our knowledge of Banach space structures of non commutative  C*-algebras (despite some recent intensive studies) is  still less than satisfactory; the proposer also will  tackle some of the questions that arise naturally from the   classical case. For instance, the behavior of different classes  of bounded operators on C*-algebras are far from being well  understood. Several intermediate results, such as   factorizations of absolutely summing operators and   compactness of  absolutely summing operators, were already   obtained, hinting that in general non commutative C*-algebras  should behave (in many ways) like their commutative counterparts.  The main motivation for this part is that certain  problems related to these algebras become more transparent  when formulated in Banach space language. Part (2) can  be viewed as close connections between measure theory  and Banach space theory. Many questions remain unresolved  on permanence properties preserved by Bochner spaces.  The proposer will concentrate on properties of spaces  containing classical function spaces, uniqueness of   preduals, and strong regularity.     The purpose of this project is to improve the understanding  of the connections between different field of analysis:  Banach space theory, harmonic analysis, and operator algebra  theory. C*-algebras turn out to be one of the most  important structures in mathematics. They have significant  applications to other parts of sciences (for examples,  mathematical physics, geometry, quantum mechanics), so it   is important to view them from many different angles."

A close connection between certain algebraic K-groups has been found for a wide class of two-sided ideals in B(H). Recent important advances have been made in characterizing those ideals which have zero homology (i.e., those commutator ideals which are the ideals themselves and hence have no trace) and in generalizing N. J. Kalton's characterization of the commutator ideal of the Hilbert-Schmidt class, and also the commutator ideal of the trace class (with B(H)), to arbitrary ideals. A natural generalization is a characterization of those ideals whose commutator ideal (with B(H)) contains T for a given compact operator T. A question arising in this context is: Which normed ideals admit a continuous or positive trace?  The answer to this question for symmetrically normed ideals with a dense finitely generated subideal is already settled. Techniques under development involve exploiting recently found obstructions preventing certain ideals from having a trace extension beyond certain smaller ideals, and are related to the associated commutator classes and commutator ideals.    The study of operator algebras and operator ideals (i.e., special classes of operators each operator of which may be viewed as an infinite matrix (a square, infinite array of numbers)) involves the investigation of operations between their operators, especially addition and multiplication. Operator algebras with these operations play an indispensable roll throughout mathematics, science, business, computer science and many of their applications to other f ields. The well-known commutative law of multiplication is that AB = BA for all numbers A and B, i.e., one always obtains the same result no matter which order one multiplies numbers. Algebras whose elements have this property are called commutative algebras. But most algebras are not commutative and studying the structure of their non-zero commutators, AB-BA, becomes central in understanding the algebras   and their relation to the more easily understood commutative algebras, inside which AB-BA is always zero. The famous Heisenberg Uncertainly Principle in physics provides an early example of the relevance of commutators. This proposal is to expand our knowledge of the commutator structure of a number of important operator algebras and to use the new information towards developing techniques to settle some old and new open problems in commutator theory and in operator algebras and ideals."

One powerful tool in dynamics is hyperbolicity.  In one complex dimension this property is easily characterized in terms of the behavior of the critical point.  The first part of this project involves characterizations of hyperbolicity and related properties for diffeomorphisms in two complex variables with the expectation that this work will shed light both on the hyperbolic and the non-hyperbolic cases. The proposed characterizations involve the regularity of unstable manifolds, the geometry of the intersection of unstable manifolds with the set of bounded orbits and growth conditions on Green functions in unstable manifolds.  A second set of questions involve symbolic dynamics.  There are situations in which external rays can be used to parametrize  ``Julia sets''.  This gives a new way of symbolically describing Julia sets in many cases. We raise questions about which symbolic descriptions can occur. A third set of questions involve the property of ``connectivity of the Julia set'' and the properties of the connectivity locus. Dynamical systems is an area of pure mathematics which deals with theoretical questions that arise in studying long term behavior of mathematical models of physical systems.  We restrict ourselves to models whose state at any time can be described by a finite number of variables. Even though these systems can display complicated chaotic behavior, there are some powerful theoretical tools that can be applied to study them in some cases. On the other hand there are many cases where these tools do not apply. Recently new techniques have been developed which use complex analysis but these techniques have so far been limited to one variable whereas typical dynamical systems involve many variables. The proposed research aims to establish a link between  dynamics of one complex v ariable and the more typical dynamical systems which  involve many variables."

Hamiltonian systems of infinite dimension:  The analysis of   the symplectic structure of the phase space of completely integrable   Hamiltonian systems of (in)finite dimension is very useful in the study of   Hamiltonian perturbations.   The investigator plans to apply prior work on action-angle variables for the  Korteweg-deVries equation (KdV) to contribute to the investigation of the  problem of the existence of analytic, quasiperiodic (in time) solutions  of Hamiltonian perturbations of KdV or of any of the equations in the   KdV hierarchy (KAM type theorem) and to study longtime stability of solutions   of perturbed KdV equations (Nekhoroshev-type estimates).     Further, the investigator plans to prove, in a generic situation, local    existence of (generalized) action-angle variables for a large class of   completely integrable Hamiltonian systems of infinite dimension.  2. Regularized determinants of elliptic operators:  They appear in modern   physics (functional integrals) as well as in geometry and topology (torsion,   eta-invariant). The investigator plans to continue his work on techniques for   analyzing regularized determinants and their applications to geometry and   topology: Torsions for bordism and relative torsion (in the usual and the   L2-setting); numerical computations of regularized determinants via a   deformation; manifolds of determinant class and representation of the   L2-torsion of a closed manifold M as a limit of a sequence of appropriately   normalized torsions associated to a sequence of finite covers of M.   3. Smoothing of dispersive waves:  Dispersive waves appear in many instances,   e.g. in the study of water waves.  The investigator plans to analyze   microlocal smoothing properties for a large class of linear and nonlinear   systems of dispersive evolution equations of Schroedinger type.      In many different applications, such as propagation of signals along   optical fibers (telecommunication), analysis of water waves  and currents, and  theoretical physics (celestial mechanics, quantum field theory), the basic   underlying ideal models turn out to be integrable systems of finite or   infinite dimension. To be useful for applications, perturbations of these   ideal models have to be studied. Whereas integrable systems of finite   dimension and their perturbations are relatively well understood, much  remains to be done in the infinite dimensional case."

Special emphasis will be made on associated problems of ridge approximation, which consist in selection of best fit linear combinations of planar wave type functions. These problems are of highly non-linear nature, especially with respect to optimal selection of wave vectors. Immediate ramifications of such research include neural network models that have found wide applications in industry, engineering, computer science, finance and medicine. The Radon transform is an acknowledged powerful tool in several applied areas ranging from classical quantum mechanics and optics to X-ray tomography. In computational X-ray tomography, ridge approximation can be interpreted as reconstruction of images of non-homogeneities such as tumors. Another extremely different field is recognition of main trends in evolution of large systems such as bacteria populations or the stock market, where an enormous number of variables must be modeled."

The first problem is the variational problem: to minimize the square integral of the Weyl tensor of a four dimensional manifold. The optimal conformal class which achieves the extremal will have a canonical metric which is often Einstein, conformally flat, or half conformally flat. The second problem is to find apriori estimates for solutions of the prescribed scalar curvature problem on spheres of dimension greater than three. It is expected that there will be a new phenomenon to be understood which does not arise in the case for spheres of lower dimensions. The general goal is to find general conditions for the solvability of the Nirenberg problem in these dimensions. The third problem is to investigate regularity property of critical maps of conformally invariant energy functionals. For biharmonic maps in four dimension, such regularity result will permit the construction of biharmonic maps of four dimension which represent an arbitrary homotopy class. Yang has already made good progress on this problem. The project represents an analytic approach to the study of four dimensional spacetime which may or may not model the actual physical spacetime in which we live. The idea is to study various global quantities attached to each spacetime that reflect the local geometric structure. We then look for the spacetime that optimizes these global properties. The ones that do often have nice properties and may allow one to eventually classify the set of all possible spcetimes. The three projects outlined above are technical aspects that need to be developed to carry out such a program."

Relaxing this regularity assumption to include all genuine unitary representations of the metaplectic group, the PI plans to use the Adams-Barbasch dual pair correspondence of these representations to realize them as Zuckerman modules that are induced from some other representations easy to describe. The PI also has a program already in progress in collaboration with David Vogan. The problem they want to solve is the following conjecture: There is a bijection between the set of unitary representations of G whose lowest K type is associated to a fixed parameter and the set of unitary representations of a certain subgroup associated to the same parameter and whose K types are in turn associated to that same parameter. A fourth problem she wants to study is those unitary representations of a Lie group G which are predicted by the orbit method. These representations, when restricted to the maximal compact subgroup K are multiplicity free and are related to multiplicity free representations on the ring of regular functions of a nilpotent orbit. Lie groups have connections in many areas of pure and applied Mathematics like Differential Equations, Harmonic Analysis, Topology, Geometry, Ergodic Theory; and in other areas of Science and Engineering as well, like Materials Science, Quantum Field Theory, Particle Physics, Control Theory and Robotics. For example, the PI has become interested in the applications of Lie Theory to the field of Geometric Control Theory. She is now exploring some mechanical systems that are interesting for applications in several very different areas, such as robotic assisted surgery, waste management and spacecraft control. These systems seem to have some common grounds that allow engineers to be able to control the systems and could possibly be explained with Lie Theory. She is also interested in exploring these questions a bit further to see if they lead to interesting mathematical questions and if the answers to those questions lead to practical applications in industry."
