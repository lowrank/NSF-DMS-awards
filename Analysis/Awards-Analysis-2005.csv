After Kohn's solution of the problem on strictly<br/>Pseudo-convex domains, important advances in the L^2-Sobolev theory<br/>included the work of Hormander on L^2-estimates, D'Angelo and Catlin<br/>on finite type and subellipticity, Boas and the PI on global<br/>regularity on domains of infinite type, and Kiselman, Barrett, and<br/>Christ on irregularity on worm domains. However, characterizing<br/>global regularity remains a fundamental open problem. Likewise, quite<br/>general sufficient conditions are known for compactness of the<br/>d-bar-Neumann operator, but a characterization on general<br/>pseudo-convex domains in terms of boundary data remains elusive. These<br/>long term goals represent two thrusts of this project. The PI<br/>recently observed intriguing links between sufficient conditions for<br/>regularity properties of the d-bar-Neumann operator and sufficient<br/>conditions for the existence of a Stein neighborhood basis for the<br/>closure of the domain. Investigating to what extent regularity<br/>properties of the d-bar-Neumann operator such as compactness imply<br/>the existence of a Stein neighborhood basis of the closure of the<br/>domain is a third thrust of this project. During this project, the PI<br/>will supervise several postdoctoral researchers and several graduate<br/>students. He will co-organize a special semester at the Erwin<br/>Schrodinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics<br/>dedicated to topics investigated in this project, and he will give a<br/>lecture course within the Institute's Senior Fellows program<br/>introducing these topics to graduate students and junior researchers.<br/><br/>The study of analysis in several complex variables can be motivated by<br/>the centrality of the subject within mathematics as well as through a<br/>direct appeal to its usefulness. For example, one of the basic laws<br/>of nature, causality, when transcribed via a mathematical device<br/>called Fourier transform, leads immediately to analytic functions of<br/>several (in this case, four) complex variables. The PI has shown that<br/>some of the problems to be studied in this project have intimate<br/>connections to issues emanating from quantum mechanics. The central<br/>object of study in this project, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, form a<br/>model problem for a subject central to physics and engineering<br/>(partial differential equations).

Equally central are newer questions that are being identified and studied, including the discrete analogues of classical operators, aspects of the Fuglede conjecture, Fourier integral operators with degenerate canonical relations and new classes of singular integrals in complex analysis. Past advances in these subjects have drawn influences from subjects such as Combinatorics, Additive Combinatorics, and Number Theory to name some prominent areas.

These problems involve systems where there are 2 distinct phases together with a ""mushy region"" where the phase is  ""degenerate"".  Examples of such problems include a mixed-type parabolic-conservation law equation, the ill-posed Hele-Shaw problem, the space-time regularity of the free boundary in the Hele-Shaw problem, and a forward backward heat equation. Previous methods of analyzing the free boundaries using monotonicity formulae are no longer applicable when a degenerate phase is present.  The PI has developed an approach to the regularity of free boundaries in the spirit of kinetic solutions that allows to study the free boundary measures directly. This is done by finding expressions of some auxiliary measures and approximating the free boundary with level sets from within the regular region. In these degenerate problems exceptional sets will be null for the free boundary measure, rather then the usual n-dimensional Hausdorff measure.  This approach is based on available regularity or integrabilities for solutions across the set of discontinuities. <br/><br/>There are many problems in science which feature a ""mushy region"" where two phases of a system coexist.

This annual conference has become important in the geographical area, due to the quality of the meeting and the lack of other conferences and meetings in analysis in this region, especially in the fall.  The Prairie Analysis Seminar is now quickly becoming a tradition with a national and even international reputation. The seminar is structured so as to keep costs for the host university and participants to a minimum, allowing a wide range of mathematicians to attend. The main speakers chosen are at the forefront of their field, giving all in attendance the opportunity to learn of their recent work. Equally important is that the conference will allow participants to give contributed talks. This is critically important for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and those early in their careers, to increase their visibility and awareness of their work in the mathematical community. The first four editions attracted a number of researchers from small universities and colleges throughout the region, in addition to those attending from major research institutions.  Many of thesefaculty maintain research careers in spite of geographical isolation and welcome the rare opportunity to meet with other mathematicians. Strong connections with these small universities and colleges are mutually beneficial, as these schools produce many excellent undergraduate students who can be attracted to graduate education in mathematics and sciences.  Social events planned will increase the scientific interaction and foster useful personal connections among the participants. <br/><br/>"

In the linear theory of Banach spaces, the structure of spaces of p-integrable functions, especially the complemented subspaces of these spaces, will be studied.  In the non linear theory of Banach spaces, a fundamental problem is to determine when a non linear (uniform, bi-Lipschitz, or coarse) equivalence induces a linear isomorphism.  In particular, what (isomorphic) classes of Banach spaces are closed under uniform equivalence?  Are the p-integrable functions such a class? When does a Lipschitz factorization of a linear operator induce a linear factorization? Questions in metric geometry that are closely related to the non linear geometry of Banach spaces also will be investigated.  In particular, the problem of dimension reduction for Lipschitz embeddings of finite metric spaces in the space of integrable functions will be attacked. Directions in the geometry of operator spaces that will be explored include similarity problems, Grothendieck's theorem, Ramanujan graphs and free groups, and operator valued spaces of analytic functions. It is expected that intuition gained from studying the geometry of Banach spaces will continue to provide guidance in this research in operator spaces and lead to the solutions of old problems about operator algebras.<br/><br/>Banach spaces are vector spaces in which there is a very natural notion of distance.  Most mathematical analysts and mathematically oriented engineers model problems in a suitable Banach space, so it is not surprising that the understanding of the geometry of Banach spaces has been useful in many areas of mathematics and engineering.  A ""pattern"" is a finite metric space; that is, a finite collection of points together with a notion of distance between the points that satisfies conditions that agree with our intuition about distance.  Recently a number of computer scientists have been investigating patterns and especially how the metric geometry of a Banach space which contains a given pattern can be used to understand better the pattern.  One problem that arises in analyzing a pattern that is contained in a (finite dimensional) Banach space is that computations that are polynomial in the number of points in the pattern tend to be exponential in the dimension of the ambient Banach space.  This ""curse of dimensionality"" can sometimes (e.g.,  through the Johnson-Lindenstrauss ""flattening lemma"" in the case where the Banach space is a Euclidean space) be corrected through dimension reduction procedure, but to what extent dimension reduction can be effected in other Banach spaces is a major problem in the area which will be investigated.  Operator spaces, or ""quantized Banach spaces"", are Banach spaces in which scalars are replaced by operators on a suitable Hilbert space.  Basically operator spaces are to Banach spaces as quantum mechanics is to classical mechanics, and in fact several research directions within operator spaces in this project are meaningful physically.  The synergy between operator algebras and the geometry of Banach spaces that lies at the basis of the concept of operator space has led to the solutions by Pisier of similarity problems as well as old problems about C* algebras.  Part of this project involves transferring concepts and results in Banach space theory (such as Grothendieck's inequality) into an operator space setting with a view to solving known problems about operators. <br/>"

A central part of modern harmonic analysis deals with ""singular<br/>integral operators"" of one type or another. Such operators are pervasive in<br/>the scientific landscape: they turn up in mathematical physics, probability,<br/>engineering, image processing, etc. While the theory of singular integral<br/>operators is now well developed (starting with works of Calderon and Zygmund<br/>and continued by  numerous researchers after them), it deals with  the<br/>operators defined on a nice ""smooth"" set, like the usual Euclidean space.<br/>However, in many problems one needs to investigate such operators on a ""bad""<br/>set, like surfaces with singularities and even on more pathological sets.<br/>The non-homogeneous harmonic analysis  was introduced  by the PI's to deal<br/>exactly with such situations: recent solution by X.

Complex analysis is a<br/>classical area of mathematics that continues to play an important role in<br/>both pure and applied studies. One of the canonical objects of complex analysis<br/>is the so-called Hilbert transform. Studies of the Hilbert transform allow one to <br/>understand the behavior of complex differentiable functions near the boundary of their domains.

A cornerstone in the analysis is to encode singularities in terms of functions and measures on suitable valuation spaces, that is, sets of valuations on an appropriate ring. In the case of singularities at the origin in the affine plane, the valuation space has the structure of a tree with infinite and dense branching. In more general cases, it is expected to be a building, or projective limit of simplicial complexes. Being fundamental objects in complex analysis, positive closed currents may be approximated by varieties. <br/>As an analogue of Hironaka's theorem, the investigator will study whether every positive closed current admits an approximate resolution of singularities. He will also investigate the corresponding question for dynamical systems defined by holomorphic fixed point germs. Other problems to be addressed are semicontinuity of multiplier ideals and degree growths of iterates of rational maps of projective space.  The investigator will design an undergraduate course and continue his development of a masters course to suit the needs at the University of Michigan (UM). Additionally he will engage middle and high school students in mathematical activities, in particular through a summer camp at the UM.<br/><br/>Singularities play a prominent role throughout mathematics, even when the primary objects of study are regular (smooth) objects. An example of a singularity is that of a curve in the plane that does not look like a line on a small scale, but rather as a cross or cusp, or even more complicated.<br/>It is known that plane singular curves can be viewed as ""shadows"" of nonsingular curves in space. This provides a way of understanding complicated object thorugh simpler ones. Other examples of singularities appear in dynamical systems, when studying the speed at which iterative algorithms converge. Working with students at the graduate and undergraduate levels, the investigator will undertake a unified study of singularities in different branches of mathematics. In addition he will develop a new undergraduate course and continue the redesigning of a graduate course. Finally he will work with K-12 students, in particular by continuing the development of a course in the framework of the Michigan Mathematics and Science Scholars summer program for high school students.<br/>"

He will also use methods from functional analysis to obtain new results in probability theory. For example, he will investigate the chaos decomposition for general Levy processes using the machinery of Fock spaces. Finally, he will use methods from non-commutative probability to obtain new results in combinatorics and special functions theory.  For example, he will investigate the linearization coefficients for the q-analogs of the Meixner orthogonal polynomials.  Matrices do not commute. The importance of this fact in our interpretation of nature was realized with the invention of quantum mechanics. That theory has also used probabilistic ideas and language since its inception. <br/><br/>Non-commutative probability is the probability theory of non-commuting objects, such as matrices and operators. In the 1980s Voiculescu introduced free probability theory, which is a particular type of such a non-commutative theory. Its origins lie in the, currently quite abstract, theory of von Neumann algebras of free groups, but also in the theory of random matrices, directly applicable in an number of areas of physics and signal processing.  Anshelevich's expertise lies primarily in functional analysis, thus one of the consequences of this research will be to gain a deeper understanding of a number of fields with potential connections to free probability. Also, some of the combinatorial problems considered are well-suited for undergraduate research, and will be used to encourage interest in mathematics among students."

The first <br/>goal is to establish Murnaghan-Kirillov theory for depth zero <br/>supercuspidal representations.  At its most basic level, <br/>Murnaghan-Kirillov theory asks for a connection between the <br/>supercuspidal representations of our group and the Fourier transforms <br/>of certain coadjoint orbital integrals.  Because of their intimate <br/>connection to finite groups of Lie type, the problem of establishing <br/>Murnaghan-Kirillov theory for these representations reduces to the <br/>problem of associating regular semisimple orbital integrals to <br/>generalized Green functions.  The second objective is to investigate <br/>questions about stability.   For example, it would be useful to <br/>explicitly understand, in a uniform way via Bruhat-Tits theory, the <br/>space of stable distributions supported on the nilpotent set.  Thanks <br/>to various homogeneity results, this problem can be addressed by <br/>associating (as above) regular semisimple orbital integrals to <br/>generalized Green functions.<br/><br/>Harmonic analysis on Lie groups traces its roots to the following <br/>problem from physics:  Describe the motion of a plucked guitar string.  <br/>Eventually, people realized that this problem --- and rather more pure <br/>problems like calculating Gauss sums or studying the density of primes <br/>in arithmetic progressions --- could be understood by studying certain <br/>well-behaved functions on the circle (or other groups).   These <br/>well-behaved functions are called characters, and the resulting theory <br/>is called harmonic analysis.  By the 1930s mathematicians had a firm <br/>understanding of harmonic analysis on many types of groups (for <br/>example, compact or abelian groups).   During the 1940s problems from <br/>relativistic physics led people to think about harmonic analysis on a <br/>more general class of groups, called Lie groups.  Initiated by the work <br/>of Bargmann, Gelfand--Naimark, and Harish-Chandra,  the goal was, as <br/>for the guitar problem, to understand functions on the group by <br/>studying characters.  Thanks mostly to Harish-Chandra this goal was <br/>largely realized. Based at least partially on his understanding of this <br/>work, in the late 1960s Langlands was led to formulate his program; <br/>this program is a vast, remarkable web of conjectures and ideas --- a <br/>kind of mathematical theory of everything. For example, the celebrated <br/>works of Harris--Taylor, Kim--Shahidi, and Lafforgue provide a small <br/>sampling of the deep results it anticipates.  As harmonic analysis on <br/>Lie groups plays a central role in our understanding of many of the <br/>problems in this area, the investigator hopes his research will <br/>contribute to future progress.<br/><br/><br/>"

Anderson localization, the occurrence of dense pure point spectrum almost surely, has been proved for many models at band-edges and at the bottom of the spectrum. Refined estimates give precise information about the decay of the eigenfucntions and the dynamical localization of the system. Conductivity properties of the system are described through the second-order current-current correlation function.<br/>Study of these correlation functions reveal information about Mott conductivity, the density of states, and eigenvalue statistics. There are many open questions about the regularity and bounds on these functions. A lower bound on the current-current correlation function implies delocalization, for example. Another new tool for the study of these systems is the use of random matrix theory. This promises to give insight into the density of states in the delocalized regime.<br/><br/>Random Schrodinger operators provide a model for the propagation of electrons in perfect crystalline structures that are corrupted by impurities randomly distributed in the medium. It is hoped that the study of these models reveals the mechanisms for finite conductivity at low temperatures and the integer quantum Hall effect.

The main open problem in random Schrodinger operators is delocalization; the existence of extended states. The study of delocalization in random Schrodinger  operators is the main goal of this proposal.   A major objective of this proposal is to prove dynamical delocalization in random Schrodinger operators, using the new approach to the metal-insulator transition based on transport instead of spectral properties introduced by the PI and Germinet.  In addition, questions related to localization and linear response theory will be investigated.<br/><br/>In quantum mechanics, random Schrodinger operators describe the motion of an electron in a crystal with impurities.  The impurities are modeled as a random media (or material).  While the pure materials may be conductors, impurities change the conduction properties of materials.  At energies in the region where impurities create localized states the material behaves as an insulator, while at energies with extended (delocalized) states the  material behaves as a conductor.  Examples of materials with impurities are given by doped semiconductors, which have many applications in electronics.  The proposed research will further the understanding of the changes in the conduction properties of such materials caused by the addition of impurities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>"

The problem of constructing spaces with given properties was first posed by Grothendieck, and later attracted attention of many accomplished mathematicians, such as Gowers and Maurey. However, many questions in this area remain open, chief among them the so-called ``square-cube problem'': the existence of a space which is not isomorphic to its square, but such that its square is isomorphic to its cube. We plan to approach this class of problems using operator space ``building blocks''. In investigating the Fermion algebra, we plan to discover what properties it shares with spaces of functions. In particular, we will investigate the complemented and completely complemented subspaces of this algebra.<br/><br/><br/>One of the key advances in physics over the past century was the creation and development of quantum mechanics. The main mathematical tool of quantum mechanics is replacing scalars (numbers) by operators on a Hilbert space (they can be thought of as infinite matrices). Initially, the mathematicians and physicists investigated only single operators, but later the need to consider whole sets of operators became apparent. Research by von Neumann, Gelfand, and others led to the development of the theory of C*-algebras. More recently, operator spaces (also called ``non-commutative'' or ``quantized Banach spaces'') arose from the study of maps on C*-algebras. It turns out that operator spaces provide an appropriate framework for studying algebras of operators. In fact, several long-standing problems in operator theory have been solved using operator space techniques. The current project deals with two topics: the existence of operator spaces with prescribed properties; and an investigation of the operator space structure of classical spaces, such as the Fermion algebra (related to the behavior of sub-atomic particles such as protons or neutrons). If successful, this research will advance our understanding of operator spaces, and potentially, enhance our knowledge of physical phenomena.<br/>"

As a by product of our proposal, we will also obtain interesting results regarding the unbounded Toeplitz operators.

One of the major inspirational source in investigating the unbounded Bergman operators comes from the existence of many interesting concrete examples of unbounded subnormal operators. In fact, it has been shown that one of the fundamental operators in physics and quantum mechanics, the ""creation operator"", is an example of an unbounded subnormal operator. Furthermore it is not hard to prove that the creation operator can be modeled as an unbounded multiplication operator on a certain space of square integrable entire functions with respect to the two dimensional Gaussian measure.

In recent work the principal investigator and co-authors have investigated connections between the one dimensional nonlinear stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrowski-Piscunov (FKPP) equation and certain particle systems. Their work introduced new techniques which, if more fully developed, should yield the proof of some conjectures of physicists concerning the wave speed of the stochastic FKPP equation. A major goal of the project is to obtain the proof of some of these conjectures. In another direction the PI plans to continue his research on linear stochastic elliptic and parabolic equations, in particular with the equations governing random walk in random environment. He has already established some unexpected connections between this problem and certain results in combinatorics related to graph connectivity. These arose in the study of the formal perturbation theory for the problem. The main goal in the current project is to prove an inequality for the effective diffusivity constant. He expects to uncover some new connections with other areas in the study of this problem also. The final part of the project is concerned with problems in partial differential equations which occur in finance. The principal investigator plans to continue working with his graduate student on a model for efficient management of an insurance company. Mathematically the problem is a problem of stochastic control theory.

The main subject of study is dynamical systems with sufficiently strong instability of trajectories -- the so-called hyperbolic dynamical systems. Hyperbolic theory provides a mathematical foundation for the paradigm that is widely known as ``deterministic chaos'' -- the appearance of irregular chaotic motions in purely deterministic dynamical systems. This paradigm asserts that conclusions about global properties of a nonlinear dynamical system with sufficiently strong hyperbolic behavior can be deduced from studying the linearized systems along its trajectories. The study of hyperbolic phenomena originated in seminal works of Artin, Morse, Hedlund, and Hopf on the instability and ergodic properties of geodesic flows on compact surfaces. Later, hyperbolic behavior was observed in other situations (for example, Smale horseshoes and hyperbolic toral automorphism). The systematic study of hyperbolic dynamical systems was initiated by Smale, Anosov and Sinai who studied dynamical systems with sufficiently strong hyperbolic behavior. Such systems possess high level of unpredictability and exhibit strong chaotic behavior. In the proposal the PI considers the weakest (hence, most general) form of hyperbolicity known as nonuniform hyperbolicity. The theory of nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems originated in the work of the PI (sometimes this theory is referred to as ``Pesin theory'') and the study of these systems is based upon the theory of Lyapunov exponents. <br/><br/>There are three main topics in the proposal. 1. Thermodynamics of nonuniformly hyperbolic systems -- this is to build statistical physics of phase transitions for systems with nonzero Lyapunov exponents based on recent works on Markov extensions and tower constructions. 2. Dynamical systems with mixed hyperbolicity and stable ergodicity -- this is to study how ""typical"" the systems with nonuniform hyperbolic behavior are. A recent result by Dolgopyat and the PI shows that such systems exist on any phase space. 3. Coexistence of hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic behavior -- this is to complement the famous Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory by constructing particular examples of systems with coexistence of nonzero Lyapunov exponents and areas with zero entropy. The PI also proposes to apply his work to the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation -- the famous model that describes the propagation of voltage impulse through a nerve axon. This provides interesting new and ""naturally"" appearing examples of nonuniformly hyperbolic ""strange"" attractors as well as demonstrates transition from relatively simple Morse-Smale systems to ""strange"" attractors to Smale horseshoes."

The gravitational n-body problem remains an active topic for research three centuries after Newton proposed it.  Over the years it has served as a stimulus for the development of new mathematics.  Three aspects of the problem will be pursued.  In brief, they are i) the development of computational algebra techniques for systems of polynomial equations and their application to the problem of relative equilibria of the n-body problem, ii) the study of continuation of families of periodic solutions by a combination of the topological method of isolating blocks and classical variational methods, and iii) the analysis of a simplified model problem which may lead to better understanding of the phenomenon of Arnold diffusion in Hamiltonian systems.<br/><br/>The first part of the project concerns the simplest periodic motions of the n-body problem, the so-called relative equilibria.  These are special arrangements of the masses such that the gravitational forces can be exactly balanced by centifugal forces when the configuration rotates.  For example, three masses arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle can be rigidly rotated about the center of mass to produce a solution of the three-body problem.  For four or more masses, it is a difficult algebraic problem to find or even count these special solutions.  New computational algebra methods have met with some success recently the plan is to continue to develop and apply these ideas.   Numerical studies show that nearby some of the relative equilibrium solutions there are other interesting families of periodic orbits.   The second part of the project is about developing methods to mathematically prove the existence of such solutions.   Two different types of proofs will be attempted, one based on qualitative geometrical arguments and another based on a venerable analytical technique.  Both of these have been used before in celestial mechanics but the problem to be studied here is essentially different and new ideas are needed.   <br/>Finally, the third part of the project moves from the study of orderly periodic motions to the realm of chaotic dynamics.  It has been known for many years that certain kinds of chaotic motions can lead to instability in mechanical systems.  Instability in celestial mechanics can give rise to such phenomena as the slow drifting of the orbital parameters of planets or asteroids.  A specific mechanism for such chaotic drifting, known as Arnold diffusion, is currently a very active area of dynamical systems research.  However, it is difficult to understand in a system as complex as the gravitational n-body problem.  <br/>The approach taken in this project will be to study a simplified model problem which is designed to capture the essential features of the real situation but is more amenable to mathematical analysis.  Broader impacts of the project include development of scientific software, mentoring of young mathematicians and possible applications to spacecraft mission design.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

These problems are not just important from the point of view of complex analysis, but also from the perspective of non-linear analysis, partial differential equations, complex singularity theory and mechanical engineering. More specifically, the PI wishes to further the present understanding of various rigidity phenomena in complex analysis and complex singularity theory. The PI would like to continue his previous investigation on the holomorphic invariant theory for real submanifolds embedded in the complex Euclidean spaces. The investigation of the intrinsic connections of the holomorphic theory of real submanifolds in a complex manifold with many well-known problems in classical mechanics, non-linear partial differential equations and classical dynamics will also be pursued. The PI intends to carry out the simultaneous embedding problem for a CR family of embeddable compact strongly pseudoconvex three-dimensional CR manifolds. Various geometric and analytic properties for Cauchy-Riemann mappings will be studied, too.<br/>Complex numbers and the theory for functions with complex variables have become, since the 19th century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and in its application to other areas of science and engineering. Indeed, the solutions of many problems in the applied<br/>sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in these complex analytic tools and a better understanding of their basic properties. For instance, in material science, the standard method for treating multi-directional stresses in a uniform way is to represent them as complex numbers or, in more complicated situations, as complex functions. It then turns out, for instance, that the direction of the propagation of cracks in materials is related to the properties of certain equations associated with these complex numbers or functions. Results of the research to be carried out in this project may lead to the discovery of new properties of solutions of these equations, which would then translate to a deeper understanding of the related mechanical properties of materials.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The project brings together ideas from harmonic analysis (Littlewood-Paley theory, multi-resolution analysis, wavelets) and theoretical physics (renormalization, thermodynamic formalism) to analyze the regularity and scaling properties of critical objects.  The importance of critical functions is due to the fact that they serve as models of critical phenomena like transition to turbulence and phase transitions, provide ""barriers"" between regular and chaotic behavior of physical systems, etc.   The critical objects that the investigator and his collaborators plan to study are conjugacies between (critical) circle maps, critical invariant circles of area-preserving maps, and boundaries of Siegel disks. The objectives of the project are the following:  (A) Mathematical techniques for computation of global regularity of functions developed by the PI and collaborators will be applied to a wide variety of problems of scientific interest.  (B) Recent results in theory of wavelets, as well as existing methods, will be implemented to investigate numerically the local regularity of critical functions, and the scaling properties of the associated invariant measures.  (C) Accurate Fourier and wavelet spectra will be computed, and their structure will be analyzed by utilizing techniques from harmonic analysis and renormalization methods.<br/><br/>The proposed research will supply accurate empirical data that will provide physicists with better understanding of critical phenomena and will pose challenging problems for pure mathematicians.  In the long term, developing, implementing, and testing new numerical methods will provide researchers with robust tools for numerical studies of regularity and scaling properties, which are important in many areas of science and engineering (in particular, in atmospheric science, geophysics, signal processing, data network traffic).  It will motivate new research in the theory of critical functions and self-similar measures -- a central problem of modern theory of dynamical systems.  This activity will provide research opportunities for students majoring in different branches of science and engineering.  Since the project is highly interdisciplinary, it will train students not only for academic, but also for other scientific applications, and will stimulate contacts between students and scientists in different areas."

The first results concerned the behavior of singular integrals <br/>on sets in terms of the geometry of the sets. The model operator, and <br/>impetus to the theory, was the Cauchy integral with the model geometric <br/>setting being a Lipschitz curve. This theory has witnessed an explosive <br/>growth in terms of understanding the relation between L2 estimates in <br/>terms of the multiscale geometry of the underlying set. One of the <br/>realizations of the 1990's was that there is an L2 theory of geometry <br/>in terms of so-called Beta numbers, and that there is a ""dictionary"" <br/>that translates theorems on geometry of sets into theorems on wavelets, <br/>and vice versa. While the theory of Beta numbers also gave a good <br/>understanding of the multiscale structure of e.g. a data set, it only <br/>provides a certain framework for the understanding of the geometry, and <br/>does not encompass a theory analogous to Fourier series or the study of <br/>heat flow. It is the development of such a theory, along with its <br/>relations to the already understood multiscale aspects, that is now <br/>required to provide a deeper understanding of harmonic analysis on sets. <br/>For example the problem of building local coordinates that capture most <br/>of the statistical behavior of (mostly) lower dimensional subsets has <br/>not been well developed mathematically, though many proposed methods <br/>have been studied. We propose to relate the top down methods (e.g. Beta <br/>Numbers and corresponding geometry) to bottom up methods of diffusion <br/>geometries.<br/><br/>  This new method of studying harmonic analysis on sets is based on the <br/>use of certain eigenfunctions related to the set. These eigenfunctions, <br/>coming from naturally defined matrices, allow the introduction of ""local <br/>coordinates"" on the set by picking the n largest eigenvalues, and <br/>using the corresponding n eigenfunctions as coordinates. The method <br/>proposed has a close relation to the theory of so-called prolate <br/>functions, as the resulting eigenfunctions have similar properties. This <br/>is in sharp contrast to the method of Coifman, Jones, and Semmes for <br/>defining Haar type L2 frames on sets resembling Lipschitz curves. <br/>The method of the proposal gives different functions with which one can <br/>naturally define local coordinates and study (approximate and correctly <br/>defined) heat flow on sets. Professors Jones and Coifman propose to <br/>study these methods and develop a theory that can be combined with <br/>previous results to relate top down behavior to bottom up behavior. This <br/>is done from the point of view of computational efficiency and the <br/>development of fast algorithms. They also propose to study the various <br/>geometrical descriptions to provide new methods of attacking older <br/>problems in harmonic analysis. In doing so, they aim to break new ground <br/>and broaden the applicability of other earlier methods.<br/>"

For many of these operators, the constant term is the most <br/>difficult piece of the asymptotic expansion to describe. For <br/>matrix-valued symbols there are only a few cases where the constants <br/>can be explicitly described. In particular, we will investigate the <br/>asymptotics in the case of a perturbation of a Toeplitz determinant by <br/>a Hankel operator with possibly different symbol.

The first goal is to<br/>study cohomological equations over hyperbolic dynamical systems.<br/>One is interested to generalize Livsic's cohomological<br/>results to cocycles for which periodic data is included in<br/>semigroups in Lie groups. Positive results in this direction will<br/>be natural generalizations of previous work, and will give<br/>obstructions to the topological transitivity of extensions over<br/>hyperbolic actions. The second goal is to use cohomological<br/>results as a tool in the rigidity theory of partially hyperbolic<br/>higher rank lattice actions. This goal is part of the rigidity<br/>program initiated by Zimmer, aiming to classify volume preserving<br/>higher rank lattice actions on compact manifolds. A reachable<br/>target is to classify small GL(n,R) extensions of SL(n,Z) totally <br/>non-symplectic actions (i.e. hyperbolic and with a special structure of the<br/>stable and unstable foliations). The third goal is to find generic<br/>classes of partially hyperbolic transformations with rich dynamic<br/>properties. Pugh and Shub recently conjectured that stably<br/>ergodicity and accessibility occur more frequently than expected <br/>among differentiable maps, and that some partial hyperbolicity is <br/>sufficient to prove stably ergodicity. From a result of Nitica and <br/>Torok it follows that, under technical conditions, stably ergodicity is<br/>open and dense in the class of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms<br/>with one-dimensional central foliation. The density holds even in the <br/>higher regularity classes. An interesting problem is to<br/>generalize this result to more general classes of partially <br/>hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. In other direction, a recent result <br/>of Nitica and Pollicott shows that for Euclidean extensions of <br/>Anosov diffeomorphisms on infranilmanifolds the only obstructions <br/>to stable transitivity are of cohomological nature. One would like <br/>to generalize this result to non-abelian fibers, and to classify <br/>the obstructions to topological transitivity. The Investigator (with <br/>I. Melbourne and A. Torok) has recent results in this direction proving <br/>the existence of stably transitive extensions with Sp(n) fiber.<br/><br/>A chaotic map has a dense set of periodic points, that <br/>is points that are fixed by a higher iterate of the map, as well as transitive <br/>points, that is points for which a higher iterate will get arbitrarily <br/>close to any other point. Chaotic behaviour is expected to <br/>be generic in large classes of maps and in nature. Part of this research <br/>will be focused on finding new mechanisms for producing chaos <br/>for large classes of dynamical systems that exhibit only partial hyperbolicity. <br/>It will also concentrate on finding obstructions to chaotic behaviour. These <br/>results will be of interest to the broader scientific community involved <br/>in applications of nonlinear dynamics in physical sciences. <br/>A spin-off of this work will be a careful study of the semigroups in the <br/>Special Euclidean groups with interesting applications to discrete control <br/>theory and robotics.

The work in  (1) uses an important result of Wolff in the theory of Fourier-analytic estimates associated to the light cone. Possible areas of application include (a) multipliers related to space curves, (b) generalizations of local smoothing to special classes of Fourier integral operators, (c) local smoothing of maximal averages associated with space curves, and (d) Hausdorff dimension of Kakeya-type sets. The projects in (2) deal with special cases of degenerate oscillatory integrals and integral operators in high dimensions (larger than two) that are known to exhibit features absent in their two-dimensional counterparts. The analytic machinery is that developed by Phong and Stein for the two-dimensional case, but the results obtained are of a very different nature. A long-term goal here is to devise an analytically accessible method of resolution of singularities. Another part of this work concentrates on the double Hilbert transform along polynomial surfaces, following Carbery, Wainger and Wright.  The projects in (3) are part of an effort to understand the spectral theory of Schroedinger operators with matrix-valued potentials. This draws on earlier work of Guillope and Zworski, Laptev and Weidl, and Korotyaev.  <br/><br/>The following is a more nontechnical description of the projects outlined above, with a brief note about applicability in scientific disciplines. The projects in (1) may be viewed as a study of wave propagation in non-uniform media (as used in seismic imaging). ``Local smoothing'' quantifies the gain in regularity of the propagating wave viewed as a function of space-time compared with the same wave considered as a function of space alone for a fixed time. Offshoots of this problem have combinatorial flavors in terms of arrangements of circles in the plane, as pointed out by Wolff. The projects in (2) deal with integrals and integral operators which come up in solutions to partial differential equations, including fundamental ones like the heat equation, wave equation and Korteweg-deVries equation. An important feature of these integrals is the presence of a complex-valued exponential factor in the integrand. In the case under study, the exponent is typically a polynomial that vanishes to high degree at a point. The ``order of vanishing'' of the polynomial contributes to the rate of decay of the integrals. A main ingredient in the analysis of these objects is a technique from algebraic geometry known as resolution of singularities -- a systematic method for factorizing polynomials and studying their roots.  The spectral theory of Schroedinger operators, which is the basis for the projects in (3), is intimately related to quantum mechanics, which finds vast applications in physics and many disciplines of the engineering sciences. The current project is to understand the spectral properties of the Schroedinger operator in dimensions larger than one, and more specifically to count the number of resonances of such operators. Resonances are generalizations of the concept of bound states or eigenvalues, and have a physical significance in terms of exit times in electron motion. The interdisciplinary nature of these projects has proved an extremely rewarding research experience for the applicant."

In the AP factorization problems, the PIs will study existence of factorizations and obtain a more complete and constructive (whenever possible) factorization picture, with emphasis on concrete AP matrix functions of one and several variables arising in applications in particular. Well-known (in some cases) connections with corona type theorems will be further explored, both in the abstract setting of factorization in abstract abelian groups, with respect to a total order on the dual group, and in the more concrete setting of classes of AP matrix functions. Related issues include invertibility and Fredholmness criteria for Toeplitz operators with matrix symbols and finite section methods for these operators on suitable Besikovitch spaces. The PIs will also focus their attention upon several application areas of Wiener-Hopf factorization. Difference equations on a finite interval that play a role in inverse wave scattering will be studied via factorization of a certain family of four-by-four matrix functions; in another aspect of inverse scattering, J-unitary AP matrix valued polynomials with finite Fourier spectrum and their factorizations are of importance. Riemann-Hilbert problems and closely connected topics (such as orthogonal functions) will be studied with respect to non-standard contours, including contours with self-intersections. This includes parameter dependence of solutions of the Riemann-Hilbert problems on non-standard contours. Wiener-Hopf factorization will also be used to design quadratically convergent algorithms for solving queuing models, in particular M/G/1 Markov chains. The convergence will be proved theoretically, and effectiveness of the algorithms will be tested in numerical experiments.<br/>                                                                                        <br/>The proposed research grew out of classical areas of analysis and operator theory. The choice of topics is both influenced by and aimed to applications.  Classical Wiener-Hopf factorization has been used as a powerful tool in integral equations, partial differential equations and diffraction theory. The PIs will continue their study of its natural generalization to almost periodic matrix valued functions (of one and several variables) which arises in consideration of integral equations on finite intervals and related problems in inverse scattering and other parts of mathematical physics. The expected results in the theory of Riemann-Hilbertmproblem and related orthogonal functions will be used in filter design, compression and analysis of images, and multivariate stochastic processes. Novel applications will be studied, in particular, financial mathematics, where the recent more adequate Levy processes models of derivatives pricing lead to convolution equations of the type that Wiener-Hopf factorization techniques are well-suited for. Interactions with scientists and engineers in diverse fields are anticipated. In addition, the PIs will also involve undergraduate students in their research.<br/><br/>"

The pluripotential theory is more important for complex analysis in several variables than the classical potential theory for the one-dimensional analysis because it becomes more difficult to use analytic tools as the number of dimensions grows. That is why this theory found applications in all areas of complex analysis, including complex dynamics, and far beyond it in algebraic and transcendental number theories. The geometric function theory, whose goal is to obtain qualitative characteristics of investigated objects when quantitative approach fails, is represented in the project by<br/>suggested studies of the pluripotential compactifications of domains, disk envelopes and groups of automorphisms. The project also intends to study algebraic properties of the ring of entire functions with applications to transcendental number theory.<br/><br/><br/>In this project research will be conducted on geometric complex analysis and number theory. Geometry, as a part of mathematics, aims to describe qualitative links between different objects. For example, parallel lines do not meet and the heights in a triangle meet at the same point. When Euclidean objects: points, lines and planes are replaced by more complicated structures like functions, surfaces and sets, the research is of a more delicate flavor. It happens because the mechanism providing links between objects is not transparent. In our proposal we will look for such a mechanism in the form of potentials similar to the energy levels of electrical charges.

A self-avoiding walk is a model that exhibits critical phenomena and universality, two of the most important ideas in statistical mechanics. Understanding such models in two and three dimensions is a major problem in mathematical physics. Droplet states will be studied in the quantum Heisenberg ferromagnet, a model of how the spins of the electrons in a crystal can line up to produce ferromagnetism. Droplets refer to domains where the spins are aligned in a different direction from the prevailing direction. Such droplets have been studied extensively using classical statistical mechanics.  However, electron spins are only properly described with quantum mechanics, and there are no mathematical results on quantum mechanical models in more than one dimension. We will study the quantum mechanical behavior of these droplets in two dimensions. The third area of research is in classical geometry, specifically covering and packing problems. An example of a packing problem is to ask how you should arrange discs of two different sizes in the plane so that they do not overlap, but cover as much of the plane as possible. Problems like this are simple to state, but notoriously difficult to solve.<br/><br/>In the research proposed, mathematical techniques will be used to study problems whose origins are in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics, and ideas developed in the study of physical problems will be used to attack questions in classical geometry. The work on self-avoiding walks will impact physics and physical chemistry since this is a good model for polymers in dilute solution. Simulations of self-avoiding walk models can lead to improvements in the algorithms, both for this model and for models in other fields. The code developed in these simulations will be made publicly available. The study of droplets in the quantum Heisenberg ferromagnet will impact our understanding of the physics, but it should also contribute to our understanding of more mathematical questions including degenerate perturbation theory and the existence of continuous spectrum. In the research on packing and covering problems, ideas developed in the study of frustrated spin systems will impact a completely different field. Frustration refers to spin systems which need to do one thing to minimize one part of their total energy but need to do something inconsistent to minimize another part. Mathematical physicists developed a technique for studying such systems which we will adapt to the packing and covering problems.<br/><br/>"

The main object of study are linear cocycles over general base dynamics, with special emphasis on Schroedinger cocycles. The core problem is to decide whether the Lyapunov exponents of such cocycles are positive. It is expected that positive Lyapunov exponents occur for the majority of models. Spectral theoretical consequences of positive Lyapunov exponents are absence of absolutely continuous spectrum, spectral localization, and dynamical localization. General questions guiding the research on the prevalence of positive Lyapunov exponents for<br/>Schroedinger cocycles are the following: How much randomness of the base dynamics is needed? How relevant are smoothness properties of the cocycle? Are Lyapunov exponents always positive in the large-coupling regime? These questions will be investigated with the help of a recent extension of Furstenberg's Theorem due to Bonatti, Gomez-Mont, and Viana, a parameter exclusion method in the spirit of Benedicks-Carleson and Young, and refinements and extensions of Kotani theory.<br/><br/>Positive Lyapunov exponents and their spectral and quantum dynamical<br/>implications are essential to a better understanding of the consequences of complexity and disorder in quantum mechanical systems. It is widely expected that the degree of randomness of the environment should be reflected in the transport properties of the associated quantum system.

The first two subjects have played an important role in the great triumphs of mathematics in the twentieth century. The latter subject is in preparation for computing in the second half of this century. The representation theory to be studied involves finding new ways of constructing the most elusive unitary representations which we call small in this proposal. The analysis of Fourier coefficients involves the search for the ""most general"" multiplicity one theorem for generalized Whittaker modules. The work on entanglement involves finding useful measures of entanglement that can be used by experimental physicists in their attempt to build quantum computers.<br/><br/>Representation theory has its roots in nineteenth century invariant theory, early twentieth century quantum mechanics and mid-twentieth century number theory.  In this first decade of the twenty first century the theory has returned to its roots.  The nineteenth century invariant theory emphasized concrete questions on binary forms with algorithmic solutions. These problems have reemerged and are now being generalized to apply to quantum computation.   Early quantum mechanics studied puzzling and weird measurements involving photons, electrons etc. These phenomena led to the Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics. The philosophical debates of the early quantum mechanics have reemerged as quantum information technology.  The Hilbert space approach also gave birth to representation theory, which has as one of its main applications in number theory. The Langlands program has established a goal for the twenty first century to establish a non-commutative class field theory (Wile's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is actually proof of a special case of the Tanayama-Shimura conjecture which is a special case of the Langlands program).

The connection between geometrical and analytical properties of minimum energy configurations on a surface and the geometrical properties of that surface will be investigated and algorithms for the rapid generation of well-distributed point sets on surfaces will be developed.

The goals of the first component of this project are to develop the theory of a class of ""nonuniform"" wavelets on surfaces and to develop multiscale high-performance applications to computer graphics and scientific computing.  The goal of the second component of this project is the investigation of geometrical and analytical properties of minimum energy (or ""ground state"") configurations of large numbers of points distributed on a surface and interacting via a pairwise repulsive interaction.  The research on minimum energy points and its usefulness in discretizing manifolds will be of significance to methods for data sampling, best-packing problems, and geometric design.  The development of fast algorithms for generating uniformly distributed points is of significance in computational complexity theory.

Even though divergence-measure fields can be interesting solely from the analytical point of view, the main motivation to study them is to advance our understanding of entropy solutions for nonlinear conservation laws.  It was proven by Glimm that the one-dimensional system of strictly hyperbolic conservation laws has a global entropy solution in the space of functions of bounded variation, assuming that the initial data has sufficiently small total variation. However, when the initial data is large or the system is not strictly hyperbolic (especially for the multidimensional case), then the solution u is generally a signed Radon measure or a L^p-function.  Understanding more properties of divergence-measure fields will advance our understanding of entropy solutions for nonlinear conservation laws.<br/><br/>Divergence-measure fields have been studied by authors including Ambrosio, Anzellotti,  Chen-Frid, Chen-Torres and Ziemer. However, there are still many open questions concerning  their analysis, especially for the case of unbounded vector fields. Thus, the principal investigator will study analytical properties of divergence-measure fields including normal  traces and Gauss-Green formulas for unbounded divergence-measure fields, over sets of  finite perimeter. The principal investigator will also apply the theory of divergence-measure fields to the development of a general framework for the Cauchy flux over oriented surfaces that  are boundaries of sets of finite perimeter. This very general framework will allow to capture measure-valued production density in the formulation of the balance law and entropy dissipation for entropy solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws.  The study of multidimensional conservation laws, both scalar equations and systems, is currently the subject of significant research effort. The investigation of hyperbolic systems in many dimensions (and even in the one-dimensional case) is motivating the search for new  analytical tools that could bring some insight to these difficult equations. The principal  investigator intends to use geometric measure theory techniques to study certain  hyperbolic conservation laws.<br/><br/><br/>"

The prototypical problem that we study is the Multivariable Truncated Moment Problem: Given a finite d-dimensional real sequence, we seek concrete necessary and sufficient conditions so that there exists a positive Borel measure on d-dimensional Euclidean space for which the given data represent successive power moments of the measure. To study the existence of such a representing measure, we associate to the data a finite moment matrix. It is known that a finitely atomic representing measure exists if and only if the moment matrix admits an extension to an infinite, finite-rank, positive moment matrix. Representing measures with the fewest atoms correspond to extensions of minimal rank. We seek to establish concrete necessary and sufficient conditions for such extensions, and also to develop algorithms for explicitly computing representing measures corresponding to extensions. In the case when the moment matrix is singular, we study the following conjecture: there exists a representing measure if and only if the moment matrix is positive, recursively generated, and the rank of the matrix is at most equal to the size of the algebraic variety natuarally associated to the data. This conjecture is true for moment problems on planar curves of degree one or two, so we study the conjecture for curves of higher degree. This research also concerns estimates of the minimal rank in the above-mentioned extensions; such estimates are related to the convergence of certain polynomial optimization algorithms and also to the size of minimal cubature rules in Numerical Analysis.<br/><br/>      The aim of this research is to develop new existence and uniqueness criteria for finitely atomic representing measures in multivariable truncated moment problems (with data corresponding to successive power moments up to a fixed finite degree). Truncated moment problems play essential roles in aspects of such fields as Operator Theory (subnormality of weighted shifts), Interpolation Theory (classical Nevanlinna-Pick theory), Numerical Analysis (multivariable cubature rules), Control Theory (signal processing), and Optimization Theory (polynomial optimization over a region). The principal focus of this research is an approach to multivariable truncated moment problems based on an extension theory for the moment matrix associated to the moment data. When this matrix admits an infinite, positive, finite rank moment matrix extension, this approach yields an explicit formula for a finitely atomic representing measure. The primary goal of this research is to determine concrete criteria on the moment data which permit the desired extension. This research also concerns the development of algorithms to implement these criteria. One principal application will be to develop new minimal cubature rules for measures on classical domains such as the disk and triangle; another application concerns the convergence of polynomial optimization algorithms. Broader impacts will include undergraduate training and research projects for science students from underrepresented minorities, and the use of computing, particularly simulations, as an experimental methodology in mathematics and computer science courses.<br/><br/>"

The problems in complex dynamics use tools from pluripotential theory and some are likely to require developing new such tools. The first direction of research deals with the study of the fundamental solutions of the complex Monge-Ampere operator, which are called pluricomplex Green functions. This will have applications in understanding the singularities of currents and to some questions in algebraic geometry. The second direction of research deals with the dynamics of polynomial automorphisms of complex Euclidean spaces, in the regular case, and for special classes of irregular mappings. The main interest lies in obtaining a detailed understanding of the dynamics, and in the study of the ergodic properties of the dynamical Green currents and measures. The third direction of research of this project is to analyze the behavior of polynomials along transcendental analytic varieties. This will be used to study arithmetic properties of entire functions, and the algebraic independence of sets of values of transcendental functions. <br/><br/><br/>Complex analysis and potential theory are central areas of Mathematics. Over the years, they have provided methods and powerful tools which helped to solve many important problems from other fields of pure and applied Mathematics, as well as from Physics, Biology, Economics, etc. This project deals with the developing and further application of new techniques from analysis and potential theory in several complex variables to problems in dynamical systems and number theory.

It also ties in with current work by algebraic and analytic geometers on multiplier ideal sheaves. The third collection of problems concerns the so-called Density Property for complex manifolds, introduced by the PI in his PhD thesis and developed significantly since then.  The three directions are intimately related, and cannot be completely separated.<br/><br/>The main goal of the work on sampling and interpolation is to use the geometry of the space under consideration to determine the density of points needed to sample functions sufficiently so that they are faithfully stored in some digital incarnation.  Conversely, the reconstruction of the functions from their digital realization requires the use of sufficiently few points.  The geometric information that comes into consideration is the curvature of the metrics on the space. This idea was already considered by Einstein in his work on the General Theory of Relativity. The need to understand metrics rather well brings us in contact with the second circle of problems; here we consider certain metrics that arise naturally in problems of complex and CR geometry.  Finally, the ideas considered have a completely different nature when discussed on spaces with the density property.  These spaces, which are highly symmetric, have incredible flexibility properties, and enable one model to rather diverse dynamical phenomena, while still being able to use the complex structure to impose certain constraints on the results of the dynamics.<br/><br/>"

Jets are generalized (local) point-wise derivatives that allow for the interpretation and calculation of non-linear functions of derivatives. In this proposal, the PI presents a project to<br/>use jets to develop some basic Analysis tools in general state spaces. Typically, in these spaces higher derivatives with respect different parameters do not commute, as in the Euclidean case, but rather satisfy more complicated algebraic relations. Jets adapted to the geometry of a state space endowed with a family of vector fields satisfying a non-degeneracy condition are called sub-elliptic jets. Basic analysis topics like Taylor developments and maximum principles have to be adapted to conform to the new sub-elliptic geometry. Topics studied include:  sub-elliptic extensions of the uniqueness theorem of R. Jensen for viscosity solutions, regularity for the sub-elliptic p-Laplacian, sub-elliptic convex functions, and Cordes sub-elliptic estimates.<br/><br/><br/> The derivative is a basic tool in mathematical analysis, used to measure the growth and decay of functions. Knowledge of the derivative of a function allows for its recovery by means of integration. When trying to model complex scientific phenomena it is often necessary to write down equations satisfied by derivatives, and derivatives of derivatives, of functions with respect to several parameters. These equations are called partial differential equations. In this proposal the PI proposes to develop tools to study partial differential equations written in terms of vector fields.  These equations have applications to problems in Robotics, Control Theory and Mathematical Finance.<br/><br/><br/> <br/>"

These are squares of inclusions of finite dimensional C*-algebras that arise naturally in the standard invariant of a subfactor. Commuting squares can also be used as construction data for subfactors, and the most explicit examples of subfactors have been obtained this way. By using a combination of algebraic-combinatorial and analytic methods, the PI proved several finiteness results for commuting squares and found a good notion of primeness (in the sense of isolation) for these objects. The isolation results obtained suggest methods of constructing one-parameter families of non-isomorphic subfactors. The PI will continue to investigate such constructions, especially those coming from commuting squares based on complex Hadamard matrices. Planar algebra techniques will be used to understand these models, as well as other subfactors constructed from commuting squares. The other direction of Nicoara's research is the study of von Neumann algebras from the point of view of non-commutative ergodic theory, especially applications of rigidity in the context of von Neumann algebras.<br/><br/> In 1930's John von Neumann discovered that certain algebras of operators on a Hilbert space are the natural framework for understanding symmetries of quantum physical systems. His ideas play an important role in quantum mechanics, and fundamental laws of nature such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle appear as a natural consequence of von Neumann's abstract theory. In the early 80's Vaughan Jones introduced the theory of subfactors, as a Galois theory for inclusions of von Neumann algebras. Subfactor theory quickly became one of the most flourishing branches of operator algebra theory, with a multitude of deep connections in knot theory, representation theory, 3-manifolds, quantum groups, integrable systems in statistical mechanics and conformal field theory.  A subfactor can be viewed as a group-like object that encodes what one might call the generalized symmetries of a quantum physical or mathematical situation. To decode this information, one computes the higher relative commutants, a system of inclusions of finite dimensional C*-algebras naturally associated to the subfactor. This object, called the standard invariant, has an extraordinarily rich algebraic-combinatorial structure, generalizing finitely generated groups, finite dimensional Hopf C*-algebras and other large classes of quantum groups. <br/>"

The author intends to pursue his work on Schroedinger equations with both deterministic and random potentials. Some questions remain on discrete Schroedinger operators on the line with quasi-periodic potentials, whereas the case of potentials given by non-independent but more strongly mixing dynamics than quasi-periodic presents many serious challenges and more needs to be done in this area. For time-dependent equations questions remain concerning dispersive estimates, both for time-dependent and time-independent potentials. For the latter, it is unknown whether or not the usual dispersive estimate holds for potentials that decay faster than an inverse square power, at least for dimensions two and larger. The author recently established this in one dimension, but in two dimensions dispersive estimates<br/>under the assumption of strong polynomial decay are unknown. He believes, however, that dispersive estimates in the  two-dimensional case under the assumption of sufficiently fast decaying potentials is an accessible problem. The main interest in linear estimates lies with nonlinear applications. One example is given by the proof of asymptotic stability of weakly interacting multi-soliton solutions, which was recently established by Rodnianski, Soffer, and the author. It relied heavily on dispersive estimates for charge transfer models. Much remains to be done in this area, both in terms of nonlinear Schroedinger equations in general (global solutions for the critical defocusing three-dimensional equation), as well as questions concerning the dynamics of nonlinear bound states (solitons). In addition, the author intends to work on problems in harmonic analysis or applications thereof to problems outside of mathematical physics.<br/><br/>Much of the success of science and engineering lies with its effective use of mathematical tools, both in terms of modeling and numerical studies on computers. Mathematicians play an important role in developing those methods and making them available to scientist and engineers. This proposal aims at addressing mathematical problems that for the most part originate in mathematical physics. The aforementioned nonlinear Schroedinger equations arise in various<br/>applications, e.g., optics. A bound state (soliton) for such a nonlinear equation represents a particle or beam that travels without disintegrating. An important issue is to understand the stability or instability of such an object. I.e., do they persist under small perturbations or not?<br/>Clearly, any commercial application of a soliton in optical media will require stability of the soliton. It turns out that the theoretical understanding of these issues is very difficult, often requiring new insights into mathematical problems. This proposal aims at addressing such problems.<br/>"

Whereas the cohomological invariants of a space (commutative C*-algebra) will determine the space at most up to homotopy equivalence, in the class of nuclear simple C*-algebras, the objects are often determined up to isomorphism by their K-theoretical invariants.  Elliott's conjecture states that, far from being an accident, this is always the case for the entire class of separable nuclear simple C*-algebras. (Tracial invariants are needed if the real rank is nonzero.)  The proposed research aims to uncover and explain rigidity properties of nuclear  C*-algebras.  The basic idea beyond the classification program is that that the simplicity and the stable or real rank conditions for a nuclear C*-algebra translate to certain internal dynamical properties of the algebra which forces a behavior typical to that of a combinatorial object. The C*-algebra becomes a rigid object built around its K-theory skeleton.  The ramifications of the classification theory into the structure theory of C*-algebras will be explored with emphasis on dynamical systems and group C*-algebras.  The investigator will analyze the impact of the recent advances around the Baum-Connes conjecture on the classification theory with the long term goal of formulating and exploring a Baum-Connes type conjecture for general nuclear C*-algebras.  This is closely tied with the universal coefficient theorem problem in KK-theory and deformation theory of C*-algebras.<br/>Geometry was developed in an attempt to describe the ambient physical space. Its history has seen a series of remarkable achievements from the Euclidian geometry to the non-Euclidian geometries which culminated with the Riemannian geometry  providing a successful model for large-scale spacetime in general relativity.  The noncommutative geometry of Alain Connes is a far reaching generalization of the Riemannian geometry, well adapted for the study of a variety of large and small scale structures. The theory can be viewed as a significant development in the quest of quantizing of mathematics following the successful quantization of physics.  As in quantum physics, the coordinates in this theory are no longer ordinary numbers but noncommuting operators acting on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.  The ordinary spaces are being replaced by algebras of operators. The proposed project aims to contribute to the extensive effort of a community of researchers to extend the mathematics of commutative spaces to operator algebras.<br/><br/>"

Even though divergence-measure fields can be interesting solely from the analytical point of view, the main motivation to study them is to advance our understanding of entropy solutions for nonlinear conservation laws.  It was proven by Glimm that the one-dimensional system of strictly hyperbolic conservation laws has a global entropy solution in the space of functions of bounded variation, assuming that the initial data has sufficiently small total variation. However, when the initial data is large or the system is not strictly hyperbolic (especially for the multidimensional case), then the solution u is generally a signed Radon measure or a L^p-function.  Understanding more properties of divergence-measure fields will advance our understanding of entropy solutions for nonlinear conservation laws.<br/><br/>Divergence-measure fields have been studied by authors including Ambrosio, Anzellotti,  Chen-Frid, Chen-Torres and Ziemer. However, there are still many open questions concerning  their analysis, especially for the case of unbounded vector fields. Thus, the principal investigator will study analytical properties of divergence-measure fields including normal  traces and Gauss-Green formulas for unbounded divergence-measure fields, over sets of  finite perimeter. The principal investigator will also apply the theory of divergence-measure fields to the development of a general framework for the Cauchy flux over oriented surfaces that  are boundaries of sets of finite perimeter. This very general framework will allow to capture measure-valued production density in the formulation of the balance law and entropy dissipation for entropy solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws.  The study of multidimensional conservation laws, both scalar equations and systems, is currently the subject of significant research effort. The investigation of hyperbolic systems in many dimensions (and even in the one-dimensional case) is motivating the search for new  analytical tools that could bring some insight to these difficult equations. The principal  investigator intends to use geometric measure theory techniques to study certain  hyperbolic conservation laws.<br/><br/><br/>"

This is a relatively new area which has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Primary examples of such equations are equations of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) type that are associated with optimal control of stochastic PDE. Linear, so called Kolmogorov equations, that give an analytic description of infinite dimensional diffusions, also fall into this category and have been studied intensively, primarily in connection with equations coming from mathematical physics, fluid dynamics, option pricing, and population biology. The research of the project will focus on several fundamental issues related to the general theory of viscosity solutions in Hilbert spaces, together with applications and the study of some particularly important equations. The general questions include the development of tools like Perron's method, the method of half-relaxed limits, finite dimensional approximations, and the development of a viscosity solution theory for Kolmogorov and HJB equations associated with three dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. Applications will include optimal control of stochastic PDE (including stochastic NS equations), large deviations, and mathematical economics and finance. The research on HJB equations associated with stochastic NS equations may help answer some open questions about three dimensional stochastic NS equations themselves. Moreover fully nonlinear integro-PDE in Hilbert spaces that are connected to the emerging field of infinite dimensional jump-diffusion processes will also be investigated. This research will include the study of infinite dimensional integro-Black-Scholes and integro-Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equations related to option pricing in the jump diffusion version of the Musiela model of forward rates. Finally questions related to viscosity solutions of finite dimensional fully nonlinear stochastic PDE will be studied.<br/><br/>Understanding the theory of second-order PDE in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces is the first step in the development of the dynamic programming approach to optimal control of systems governed by stochastic PDE. This project contains a program of research that focuses on the development of new basic tools for such equations. It spans areas as diverse as partial differential equations, functional analysis and operator theory, probability, stochastic processes, stochastic PDE, mathematical finance, and control theory. The research will have significant impact on several areas of mathematics outside the field of nonlinear PDE like optimal control of stochastic PDE, large deviations, stochastic NS equations, and mathematical finance. Moreover it has a potential to stimulate research in related fields like engineering, atmospheric sciences, finance, and<br/>economics, in particular in fluid dynamics, and the theory of bondmarkets. It should also help attract and train graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>"

Lacey and the PI had been able to use the time-frequency<br/>analysis to obtain an affirmative result for the Hilbert transform along $C^{1+\e}$ vector fields. And this casts a light on answering the Zygmund conjecture, which asks if the integrals of $L^2({\mathbb R}^2)$ functions could be differentiated in a Lipschitz choice of directions.<br/>Although the time frequency analysis works well for multiliner singular<br/>integrals associated with a standard Carderon-Zygmund kernel, it does <br/>not work for the nonsingular oscillatory integrals. M. Christ, T. Tao,<br/>C. Thiele, and the PI established $L^p$ estimates for the multilinear <br/>oscillatory integrals. The proof relies on Gowers ``quadratic uniformity'' technique, which is a crucial concept in Gowers' proof of Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progression of length 4. Some basic questions concerning nonsingular multilinear operators with oscillatory factors are still under the investigation.<br/>The differentiability of the integral of certain functions is a very<br/>important and interesting subject in analysis. The construction of <br/>Besicovitch set indicates that integrals of L^2 functions can not be differentiated. The recent results obtained by M. Lacey and the PI have a significant impact on understanding the differentiablity of <br/>$L^2({\mathbb R}^2)$ functions in a Lipschitz choice of directions, which was posed by A. Zygmund about seventy years ago. The study of Hilbert transform along vector fields is also relevant to the Kakeya problem. The study of multilinear operators is related to some problems in PDE such as the Schrodinger equation<br/>"

One of D'Angelo's primary contributions to complex analysis in recent years has been a systematic study of positivity conditions for Hermitian symmetric functions on complex manifolds. This work has merged diverse issues such as a complex variables analogue of Hilbert's 17th problem, <br/>proper holomorphic mappings between balls, isometric imbedding for holomorphic bundles, and globalizable metrics into a coherent subject. The work on proper mappings led to a surprising result about primality; invariant CR mappings provide large classes of polynomials with integer coefficients exhibiting the same remarkable congruence properties satisfied by the p-th power of x plus y. Proper mappings also led to results in the complexity theory of mappings between balls. The work on subelliptic multiplier theory is related to the complexity and effectiveness of Kohn's algorithm, and thus fits into the same general area.<br/><br/>Complex variable theory in one and several variables is a striking part of mathematics; it provides a beautiful example of pure mathematics, which has provided applications throughout engineering and the physical sciences. D'Angelo's work in CR geometry (a geometric part of complex analysis) has clarified one of the most basic issues, the roles of Hermitian symmetry and positivity conditions. His work on proper mappings between balls has led to new sorts of complexity questions, and even to a new primality test. D'Angelo has published two research level books in several complex variables, one undergraduate textbook (with D. West) with exciting problem sets, and has played an active role in mathematics education. He will be guiding a research experience for graduate students at MSRI in summer 2005 that will initiate students from many departments into CR geometry and the workdescribed in this proposal.

Since the spaces are Hilbert modules over the polynomial ring, invariant subspaces are submodules. A key ingredient in this study is the newly discovered core operator for a<br/>submodule, which is an integral operator with kernel as a quotient of two reproducing kernels relative to the submodule. The core operator is an essential associate of a submodule and,in some sense, can be considered as a partial replacement for the inner functions which play pivatal roles in the classical one-variable Hardy space theory. Many properties of the shift operators, for instance the spectra or joint commutators, are deeply related to the core operator. Boundary values of the involved reproducing kernels are also closely connected with the core operator. The study in this project will be a clean display of some multivariable concepts and techniques, and will, in return, create many new ideas for multivariable operator theory in general.<br/><br/>In many areas of science, interactions among a group of similar objects is an important subject of study. When these objects can be modeled by linear operators, multivariable operator theory provides very useful ideas and techniques for the study, especially in cases when noncommutativity is involved. However, multivariable operator theory has not yet sit in standard graduate curriculum. This reality seems to be a result of two drawbacks in current stage of the theory. One is the<br/>unfortunate complication caused by the generality the theory has to seek. This complication obscures the nature of the subject and makes it hard for beginners to see a broad picture. The other drawback is a lack of concrete setting where many of these ideas and techniques are organically integrated in answering natural questions. This drawback makes it hard for beginners to see the values of these ideas or techniques, let alone to appreciate them. A large part of this project, in hope to provide a remedy, aims to build a systematic two<br/>variable operator theory in possibly the most manageable setting, namely the Hardy space over the bidisk. When successfully developed, the theory will serve as a ground in multivariable operator theory where more effective education and research could take place. High educational value is a notable feature of this project. Apart from its mathematical and educational values, some aspects of this study see possible applications in Control theory and Signal Processing.<br/><br/>"

In the hyperbolic case they are the prototype examples of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems with singularities. Such systems have been playing an important role in the rigorous mathematical foundation of statistical physics, so that the study and establishing their strong mixing properties is getting more and more physical relevance. The first part of the proposal focuses on a fundamental conjecture regarding this family of dynamical systems, namely the so called `Boltzmann-Sinai Ergodic Hypothesis', which states that any finite system of (totally elastic) hard spheres moving on a flat torus is fully hyperbolic and ergodic, of course, on the level set of its trivial first integrals. The proof of this conjecture (in its full generality) has been so far notoriously withstanding any attack against it. The first major part of the present proposal directly targets this conjecture. The second part is a blueprint for further research in this direction by generalizing the original Boltzmann-Sinai Hypothesis to cylindric billiards, and billiards in physically more relevant containers, i.e. rectangular boxes, convex domains, etc. The third part addresses a question posed by M. Herman, which asks if the scattering (hyperbolic) effect of the hard ball dynamics eventually prevails over the focusing effect of the convex boundary, if the motion takes place in a compact, convex domain. In the fourth part the fundamental complexity problems are targeted for the $n$-step singularity sets of higher dimensional, strictly dispersive, non-uniformly hyperbolic billiards. The answers to those questions are pivotal in further studies of the fine statistical properties of such systems. Part five poses some basic questions and problems concerning the ergodic properties of high-dimensional billiards, in which the hard core interaction potential is replaced by a smooth, rotational symmetric one. Finally, the closing part aims at some open problems in the theory of planar billiards.<br/><br/>The theory of dynamical systems studies the time-evolution of complicated,multi-component systems, like particle systems in statistical physics, reaction kinetics from chemistry, the behavior of the atmosphere (hence the relevance in weather forecasting), population dynamics, developments on the stock market, etc. By nature, this theory is closely related to - and is partly arising from - the theory of differential equations and stochastic processes. An interesting feature of the theory of dynamical systems is that it helps us better understand such crucial phenomena in the time evolution of the above mentioned systems, as the high sensitivity of the solution to the initial conditions, sometimes referred to as chaos, or chaotic behavior. My present proposal targets the investigation and better understanding of a popular and important class of mostly chaotically behaving mathematical models, namely the so called mathematical billiards. They got their name after the fact that they model the physical motion of ball shaped particles interacting with each other via elastic collisions."

The objective  is to study existence, uniqueness and stability of multidimensional transonic shocks for Euler equations for steady and self-similar potential flows. Euler equations, consisting of the conservation law  of mass and Bernoulli law for the velocity, can be written as a second-order, nonlinear elliptic-hyperbolic equation for the velocity <br/>potential, if the flow is steady or self-similar. Transonic shocks are discontinuities in the gradient of a solution, such that the type of equation changes from hyperbolic to elliptic across the shock surface. Transonic shocks arise in many situations of physical importance. Boundary value problems for transonic shock solutions  can be formulated <br/>as a free boundary problem for the elliptic phase. This framework will be applied to study several important situations, including self-similar shock reflection, and steady transonic shocks  in supersonic flow past conical body and smooth convex obstacle. These problems will also be considered in the more general framework of full compressible Euler system.<br/>(2) Another area of research is Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem.  The questions to study include geometric and measure-theoretic properties of optimal maps, and applications to partial differential equations arising in physical models. This includes the system of semigeostrophic equations, a model of large-scale atmosphere/ocean flows. Another area is to study Monge problem on Heisenberg group.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems arise naturally in many models in physics, fluid dynamics, economics. Free boundaries correspond to sharp changes in the variables describing the problem. Significant progress has been made during last several decades in the study of free boundary problems. However in the case of nonlinear partial differential equations and especially equations of mixed type many important questions are yet to be studied. This is the first theme of the project. Better understanding of properties of free boundaries, such as stability, makes possible to understand complex phenomena in models and applications. We plan to study transonic shocks in a flow of compressible fluid or gas. Another area of the project is optimal transportation problem. Recently many fundamental  properties and important applications of this problem within and beyond <br/>mathematics were discovered, in particular its connections to nonlinear partial differential equations, and applications in models for front formation in the atmosphere, kinetic  theory, fluid flow, elastic crystals, granular materials, and microeconomic decision problems.

Both of them concern the effect<br/>of quantized low-energy (infrared) radiation on the dynamics of<br/>atoms and molecules. The first project studies the behavior of<br/>atoms and molecules that are initially in their ground state and<br/>subject to an external electromagnetic field. Then, in a time<br/>interval of length T this external field is slowly changed in a<br/>given and fixed manner; slowly meaning that T is very large on the<br/>time scale of the atom or molecule. The goal is to understand why,<br/>in an experiment, the system would stay close to its instantaneous<br/>ground state at all times.

Broadly speaking, functional equations have been proved either by the method of integral formulas or the Langlands-Shahidi method. These have complementary advantages and drawbacks, and seem to be approaching the limits of their applicability. In joint work with Steve Miller, I have begun to derive analytic properties of L-functions from an analysis of the corresponding automorphic distribution. In this approach, the Gamma factors arise from computations on arithmetic quotients of nilpotent groups, which are far more tractable than the analogous computations with Whittaker functions. We expect to complete the analysis of the exterior-square and symmetric square L-functions for GL(n,Z), possibly also for higher level. We shall then consider L-functions for other groups. Although there are many isolated results about irreducible unitary representations of reductive Lie groups, they do not yet suggest a general picture. Kari Vilonen and I shall apply Morihiko Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to the study of unitary representations. Saito's theory implies the existence of certain canonical filtrations on Harish-Chandra modules, which do not seem visible from any other point of view. We already have a concrete conjecture about the unitary dual of a reductive Lie group. We shall work on the proof of the conjecture and investigate its implications.<br/><br/>Riemann's Zeta function encodes deep properties of prime numbers. Conjecturally automorphic L-functions do the same for primes in number fields. The behavior of prime numbers has fascinated mathematicians for centuries, and will likely continue to do so in the future. However, prime numbers now have practical, highly significant applications in cryptography. For this reason, L-functions have become important not only to analytic and algebraic number theorists, but also to cryptographers. Irreducible unitary representations of reductive groups constitute the ""atoms"" of Fourier analysis on such groups and their quotient spaces. They play a significant role in number theory, specifically the Langlands program. The mathematical physics literature abounds with examples of irreducible unitary representations. This aspect of mathematical physics would be clarified and unified by a systematic understanding of such representations. <br/>"

There are essentially two different cases: one-dimensional systems and multidimensional systems. In the one-dimensional case, the orthogonal systems with discrete index (orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and on the real line) and continuous index (Krein systems) will be studied. The subtle problems of dependence of operator coefficients on the spectral measure (and vice versa) will be considered. The standard methods of approximation theory will be used together withextensive application of operator theory ideas.  For Krein systems, even the basic theory is not developed. Thus, the systematic study of this case is warranted. The orthogonal systems  are directly related to some important operators in mathematical physics - namely the Schroedinger and Dirac operators. Different questions in the spectral analysis of these operators will be studied. The deep analysis of orthogonal systems will be used to investigate possible new results for some completely integrable systems (Toda lattice, KdV, nonlinear Schroedinger equation).<br/><br/>Considerable effort will be made to better understand the multidimensional case In particular, the Schroedinger and Dirac operators with slowly decaying or random decaying potentials will be studied. Approximation theory suggests that the Green function and its spatial asymptotics is the right object to analyze. The spectral parameter can be taken in the resolvent set, which often makes the problem treatable. Having this asymptotics, many difficult  problems in scattering theory can be solved. This technique will also be tried to understand an  interesting phenomenon in mathematical physics: the delocalization in Anderson model.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Ivashkovich) on almost complex manifolds. Almost complex manifolds are not an un-motivated generalization of complex manifolds. After the work of Gromov, their relevance became unquestionable, with deep applications to geometry and in particular to symplectic geometry. On one hand they allow a remarkable flexibility that complex manifolds lack, on the other hand they sometimes provide a much clearer approach to problems in several complex variables.  Recent work in the area, in particular by Ivashkovich and the P.I., and by Nefton Pali, shows that  truly basic questions still need investigation. The P.I. intends to work on analytic questions, e.g. the Kobayashi-Royden metric or the construction of pluri-subharmonic functions by the method of Poletsky. The geometric role of pluri-subharmonic functions on almost complex manifolds has been well illustrated recently in the works of Gaussier-Sukhov and of Ivashkovich and the P.I.<br/>Related to the above there are several questions that the P.I. intends to work on, especially the Cartan Lemma for holomorphic matrices with uniform bounds. The problem was so far solved only recently and only in   complex dimension 1 by the P.I. and Prof B. Berndtsson, using a refined maximum principle.  This proposal is on the Complex Analysis side but at the confluence of several active areas of Mathematics. Some geometry is involved, differential inequalities play <br/>an important role.<br/> The field in which the P.I. works is mainly the theory of several complex variables. Many ``real problems'' receive their best explanation  by using complex methods, even if the initial problem does not seem to call for using complex numbers. It goes back to the origin, for solving algebraic equations, but it continued for example in the theory of Fourier integrals (that are taught in engineering classes), and it continues in the most recent developments. Complex analysis has deep and rich connections to the theory of ordinary or partial differential equations, which allows the study of physical phenomena (at the macroscopic level). It applies to the study of dynamical systems. Complex Analysis has also various links to Geometry which is more directed to a qualitative (rather than quantitative)  description of natural phenomena. It is in this meaningful context that the P.I.  proposes to work.<br/><br/>"

These problems have been investigated for decades by applied mathematician and engineers; so there are many numerical and formal asymptotic results. Some of the results appear to be contradictory and there are controversies in the literature so there is a need for mathematically rigorous results.  The Saffman-Taylor instability and Mullins-Sekerka instability have long been standard examples of pattern formation and instabilities in non equilibrium systems. In these problems, when surface tension is zero, solutions exist for a continuum set of values of some parameter (finger width in viscous fingering or crystalline anisotropy in dendritic growth). When the surface tension is nonzero and small, however, the Selection Principle states that solutions exist only for certain discrete values of the parameter. In this project we intend  to provide a theoretical underpinning for the selection principle in problems such as the Saffman-Taylor bubble in a Hele-Shaw cell and the rising inviscid bubble in a vertical tube. The stability analysis of these problems will also be investigated by developing new mathematical methods, including results from complex analysis, nonlinear integro-differential equations, nonlinear partial deferential equations  and exponential asymptotics. <br/><br/>The principal investigator is currently affiliated with Morgan State University, a state university with historically predominant percentage of African American students.

What is common to these spaces is that they are probability spaces; the points (or states) of such a space are linked into classes which one calls ""orbits"" and these orbits have a large-scale geometric or combinatorial structure. This structure could be the structure of the orbit of a countable or continuous group action or could be the structure of a binary tree of inverse images of some finite to one endomorphism. This structure could take the form of a topology or more strongly a metric on the orbits or could be a tree or graph structure with the states as nodes of the graph.  The PI has developed a range of methods to investigate large-scale statistical properties on such spaces of orbits and to study notions of equivalence of these structures that allow for distortion or rearrangement of the orbits.  The goal of this study is to extend these methods to as broad a perspective as possible and to apply them to answer interesting and significant questions.  These methods have a significant history. They have allowed one to extend the Ornstein Isomorphism theory for Bernoulli automorphisms to endomorphisms (joint work with C. Hoffman) and give a tool for lifting large parts of the theory of actions of Z to actions of general discrete amenable groups (joint work with B. Weiss) via an orbit transference method.   This proposal suggests an array of natural directions to proceed. The generalization to trees of inverse images of endomorphisms can be pushed to a  study of trees or graphs in general and various geometric notions of similarity of such trees. Recent work indicates ways to effectively generalize to non-singular and even singular dynamics. One can also generalize both the labeling space and the index space to be continua, leading to a study of Brownian motion as the continuous analogue of a uniform endomorphism.  Work to date, and the work proposed will continue to advance our understanding of measurable dynamics and of measurable orbit structures more generally. Such structures are common in mathematics and other hard sciences.<br/><br/>Ergodic theory and measurable dynamics have their roots in thermodynamics, celestial mechanics, probability theory, and functional analysis. They have applications within mathematics to algebra, combinatorics, and number theory geometry, probability and statistics. Outside of mathematics, there are applications in physics, chemistry, electrical engineering and genetics.  The training of graduate students is central to this proposal as well.

The specific areas of the proposed research include the following: (1) Hankel operators on certain reproducing-kernel Hilbert spaces. Here the main question is the membership of these operators in various norm ideals. The reproducing kernel will be involved in many quantitative estimates. (2) Factorization of unimodular functions on the unit sphere. The goal here is to determine whether or not certain well-known factorization for unimodular functions in the one-variable case can be generalized to the case of several variables. (3) Simultaneous diagonalization of commuting tuples of self-adjoint operators modulo various norm ideals. This problem has been solved (with NSF support) in the case where the norm ideal is the Schatten p-class when p is strictly greater than 1. The PI will next consider the case where p is 1, i.e., where the norm ideal is the trace class.   This is a difficult problem, but this is also an important problem because of its potential applications. The PI will also consider a class of ideals which are related to the Schatten class. (4) Certain norm estimates related to the Cauchy projection on the unit sphere. If they can be established, these estimates will provide new insight on the Cauchy projection.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research is that it pushes the limit of some of the existing techniques and it helps us better understand the structure of the spaces, operators and operator ideals mentioned above.  The proposed problems are fairly representative of the current research interests in operator theory and operator algebras, which is a study of, among other things, the spectral properties of various linear operators.  In part inspired and demanded by the development of the quantum theory in the early part of the twentieth century, this study was initiated by great mathematicians such as H. Weyl and J. von Neumann. Because additivity (i.e., linearity) appears in many fundamental aspects of nature, operator theory provides the right mathematical tools for scientific fields ranging from atomic physics to optimal control. Many abstract problems in operator theory and operator algebras owe their origin to these fields of applications.  In this sense the broader impact of research in operator theory and operator algebras is its contribution to our understanding of the physical world.  For example, both for theoretical reasons and for practical applications, quite often one must deal with, or introduce, perturbations which are ""small""  by  some measure or other.  Problem (3) is about such perturbations.  The root of this problem can be traced back to a paper of Weyl published in 1909, which asserts that a continuous spectrum can be turned into a discrete one by a compact (which is a measure of ""smallness"") perturbation.  The problems proposed here require both modern techniques and classical-style mathematical analysis.  A theme which underlies all these problems is the establishment of various estimates (i.e., bounds).  In general, the sharper the estimates, the better results one obtains.<br/><br/>"

I propose to continue to strengthen this theory, and to apply it in several directions suggested by the many situations in the physics and mathematics of quantization where one has a sequence of quantum spaces which appear to be converging to another space, either quantum or classical. As a major new direction I will try to develop an analogous theory for the quantum versions of the superstructure of vector bundles, connections, Yang-Mills actions, etc. I will also try to extend my theory beyond the quantum analog of locally compact spaces, so as to attempt to deal with the approximations of quantum field-theory models, especially those of integrable systems, say by quantum lattice models. <br/><br/>Our nation's technological and economic success has at its foundation the mathematical models of the world around us which scientists develop in order to understand how to use the flood of data which flows from the laboratories of the experimental scientists. But human beings and computers can only deal with finite collections of numbers at a time.  Thus in applying these mathematical models it is almost always necessary to approximate the infinite variability of our world by finite collections of numbers. It is then crucial to understand how valid any given approximation is. With respect to individual calculations this matter has received extensive study. But less study has been made of how complex models as a whole can be approximated well by simpler models as a whole. Relatively little is known about such ""global"" approximations in the case of the models of quantum physics, which is the part of physics which governs chemical and biochemical reactions, the functioning of semi-conductors, and many other key technologies. In the classical realm there is an important form of global approximation called Gromov-Hausdorff distance. I have developed a quantum analog of it, and successfully applied it to a few examples. I propose to strengthen this theory, and to apply it to a broader class of examples, so as to better understand how to effectively approximate various models of quantum phenomena of current interest.<br/>"

New PDE approaches will try to discover, for instance, the full implications of nonresonance conditions.<br/><br/>Another class of problems is the regularity of solutions of the infinity Laplacian equation and Aronsson's equation.

This is a singular limit of a certain nonlinear parabolic diffusion equation, which has a simple interpretation: the limiting solution either hugs a given landscape or else forms flat ``lakes'' connected by ``rivers''. The technical challenge will be to develop PDE and measure theory tools to understand and predict the location of the ""lakes and rivers"".<br/><br/>This research project will also explore the use of certain entropy type inequalities to study the asymptotic limit of a regularized nonlinear diffusion equation.

Within the subject, areas of very active research include Connes' non-commutative geometry, Voiculescu's free probability, quantum dynamics following the work of Arveson and Powers, the theory of subfactors following the work of Jones and Popa, and others. Operator algebras techniques have also led to discoveries in a priori unrelated fields of mathematics and physics, including for instance the discovery of Jones' knot invariant via techniques from the theory of subfactors, and the work of Connes and Kreimer on renormalization theory.

Indeed, dilation theorems, which  represents an operator (or algebra of operators) on Hilbert space from a specialized class as a coherent part of a nice operator (or algebra from the class are an integral part of operator theory and connect to a broad range of mathematics and have significant applications in physics, systems theory, and engineering. This project pursues three related lines of investigation. Namely, dilation theoretic aspects of multi-variable operator theory in both the commutative and non-commutative setting and single-variable operator theory on multiply connected domains. There are two  objectives  in the non-commutative case. First to  establish that convexity in this setting must take a very simple form; and second to begin the concomitant development of a theory of non-commutative real algebraic geometry. The study of the dilation theory and completely positive maps associated to multiply connected domains has a long tradition in operator theory and an aim of this project is study a problem known as rational dilations for domains of genus three or larger.(A disc with  g discs removed is a domain of genus g.) This work is expected to make connections with the theory of theta functions and Riemann surfaces. successfully used in the genus two case include the theory of theta functions, Riemann surfaces. The work on commutative multi-variable operator theory, more accurately described as the study of non-self-adjoint operator algebras (with some added structure), has as an objective the extension of familiar operator theoretic results for $H^\infty$ of the unit disc. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Operator theory has a history of rich interplay with engineering and physics as well as other vital areas of mathematics including complex function theory and algebraic geometry. Originally developed as a tool to study integral and differential equations arising in physics,  operator theory, operator algebras, and operator systems play an important role in modern quantum physics and fundamentals of operator theory are now basic technology in systems theory which in turn has important applications in image processing and control theory - the mathematics behind automatic controllers such as autopilots. The proposed work builds on operatortheoretic ideas with a view toward applications to systems theory, control theory, operator algebras, and function theory. The investigation also connects with non-commutative algebraic geometry and  Linear Matrix Inequalities or LMIs. Many engineering problems can be formulated as matrix inequalities in which the variables are noncommutative (xy is not the same as yx).  Moreover, often convexity is either present, as is the case with LMIs,  or desirable. This project will pursue the theme that convex<br/>MIs can be converted to LMIs.<br/>"

Gursky<br/>University of Notre Dame<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>The interaction of geometry and analysis dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and yet continues to be an important and highly active field of mathematical research. The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to understand certain properties of the physical world, and differential geometry was developed to understand the geometry of curved spaces--for example, the curvature of the surface of the earth, or the curvature of space by matter predicted by general relativity. In the same way that Descartes realized that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential equations. The research in this proposal involves several such problems from Riemmanian and conformal geometry, whose analysis requires techniques from various fields within mathematical analysis.<br/><br/>The specific problems we pose are at the intersection of three fields: higher order elliptic partial differential equations, fully nonlinear equations, and differential geometry. The equations we study are geometric in origin, and given by symmetric functions of the eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor, specifically under conformal deformations of the metric. There is a strong structural analogy between this problem and the more classical problem of prescribing the curvature(s) of a surface in three-dimensional space. To analyze our equations we use techniques from both the theory of elliptic equations and from comparison geometry.   For example, to understand on a microscopic level the blow-up behavior of a sequence of solutions, we are confronted with the problem of  understanding the tangent cone at infinity of certain asymptotically flat spaces. <br/><br/>The geometric consequences of these results are most interesting in low dimensions: for example, we have developed a technique for constructing large families of conformal manifolds which admit metrics with positive Ricci curvature.  <br/>"

Of special interest are the short and long time behavior of nonlinear waves arising in geometry, ferro-magnetism and gauge field theories; and the development of the time frequency analysis techniques so successfully used to study multi-linear singular operators in one dimension to both develop the $x$-dependent and non-tensorial higher dimensional situations. These two areas come together by way of wave-packet decompositions and frequency interactions estimates needed in the study of nonlinear partial differential equations. The geometric Hamiltonian PDEs to be investigated  include the Schroedinger map equation and the Ishimori system - both of which may be characterized variationally and model specific wave-like phenomena. Nahmod will attempt to prove existence results for the Cauchy problem for these systems and also to study stability and blow-up questions of special solutions exploiting the geometric features of the systems. The second topic is to study multi-linear pseudo-differential operators. Their treatment departs from the classical multi-linear theory for in the present situation, the symbols' behavior may be governed by a variety that's allowed to change at each spatial point.<br/><br/>The dynamics of many real world physical systems can be described by geometric evolution equations, in particular geometric Hamiltonian partial differential equations. The dynamics of the magnetization field in a ferromagnetic material for example, is described by the Landau-Lifshitz equation. The theory of Schroedinger maps is to model the long wave length limit of an isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnetic lattice. PDEs are the mathematical models of the laws governing much of the phenomena in the physical world. Wave equations model the propagation of different kind of waves - such as light waves- in homogeneous media. Nonlinear models of conservative type arise in quantum mechanics while other variants appear for example, in the study of vibrating systems and semiconductors. The nonlinear Schroedinger equations are fundamental physical equations for they govern the motion of quantum particles, such as electrons.  All of these equations have applications to diverse physical problems, e.g. the dynamics of nonlinear waves through  optical fibers in which the index of refraction is sensitive to the wave amplitude,  and waves at the free surface of an ideal fluid  or plasma. Nonlinear Fourier analysis and in particular adapted phase analysis - ""wave-packet or time-frequency analysis""- consists in decomposing complex structures into basic building blocks - which are localized and easier to understand - via modulated waveforms. And then piecing them back together in a straightforward manner. It works very similarly to a musical score. These modulated waveforms possess capture amplitude (loudness), scale (duration), frequency (pitch) and position (instant it is played). The objects could be speech, radar signals, as well as oscillatory expressions arising in optics, wave propagation and other phenomena of nonlocal nature.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>"

If p is equal to 1, the non-commutative space of integrable operators is the predual of von Neumann algebra and reflects many important properties of the underlying algebras. The basic permanence question in this direction of research is whether or not a given property can be lifted from a given function space to its non-commutative counterpart. An important direction to be considered is the study of different structural properties of reflexive subspaces of preduals of von Neumann algebras. For instance, it is still unknown if such spaces have the fixed point property for non expansive maps.  For the case of Hardy spaces, the primary goal is to develop and extend tools from harmonic analysis to the non-commutative settings. In a somewhat different direction the ongoing research on non-commutative martingales will be considered.

These spaces includes C*-algebras, preduals of von Neumann algebras among many others. C*-algebras turn out to be one of the most important structures in mathematics.

The aim now is to study these equations rigorously as mathematical objects, independently of any a priori assumptions, and to try to recover the expected behaviour as mathematical theorems. On one hand, this line of thought has in the past led to some of the great mathematical theories of modern days (integrability, turbulence, etc.).
