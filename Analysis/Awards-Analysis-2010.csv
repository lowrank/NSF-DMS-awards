The problems to be considered fall into several subcategories; namely, commutators of operators on a Banach space, non linear factorization of linear operators, non linear classification of Banach spaces, discrete metric geometry, approximation properties, and miscellaneous problems. Sample problems are: 1. If a Banach space has a Pelczynski decomposition and the space of bounded linear operators on the space has a unique maximal ideal, must every bounded linear operator that is not a commutator be the sum of a non zero scalar plus an operator in the maximal ideal? 2. Must a Lipschitz complemented subspace of a separable Banach space be linearly complemented? 3. Estimate the smallest dimension k such that every n point subset of the space of integrable functions embeds, with distortion at most D, into the k dimensional space normed by the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates.  (Here k will depend on both n, the number of points in the subset, and D, the allowable distortion).<br/><br/>The topics treated in this project make contact with many areas of analysis and areas outside of analysis, including operator theory, group theory, geometric analysis, and theoretical computer science. One of the graduate students is involved in developing the conceptual framework for understandings mappings of large scale, high dimensional data sets into the normed vector spaces that are widely used in science and engineering. This work and other aspects of the discrete metric geometry part of the project can be used in the design of algorithms. Moreover, positive results on dimension reduction will have applications in compressed sensing. The questions on the factorization of non linear operators are connected to recurring problems in geometric analysis, while the linear finite dimensional investigation belong as much to convex geometry as to analysis.  Aspects of the non linear classification problems may be as important for geometric group theory as for geometric functional analysis."

Since Kolmogorov's initial breakthrough (1958), dynamical entropy has played a major role in the ergodic theory of amenable actions. The principal recently discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all linear groups, thereby providing the first extension of entropy theory to certain nonamenable groups. This new development opens the door to an abundance of problems that could have a great impact in ergodic theory and other fields (e.g., statistical physics, probabilistic combinatorics, operator algebras). In the last decade, there has been an explosion of interest in rigidity theory for nonamenable group actions (see, for example, works of A.Furman, D. Gaboriau, and S. Popa). New results indicate that, under special conditions, measure-conjugacy is equivalent to a priori weaker forms of equivalence of actions, such as orbit equivalence and von Neumann equivalence. It is expected that the principal investigator's new entropy theory can make an important contribution to rigidity theory by determining more precisely when it is an orbit equivalence or von Neumann equivalence invariant. The principal investigator has recently proven the first orbit equivalence flexibility results in the nonamenable setting. It is expected that the techniques developed for the proof will be more broadly applicable and could result in a general orbit equivalence flexibility theory for certain groups and actions. Pointwise ergodic theorems have a long history, beginning with Birkhoff. In collaboration with A. Nevo, the principal investigator is developing general methods for proving pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of discrete, nonamenable groups. Successes so far include new pointwise ergodic averaging sequences for actions of free groups and the first pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of general word-hyperbolic groups with respect to ball and spherical averages. The new techniques remove a fundamental obstacle in that they reduce the problem to the amenable case, which can then be solved by the classical Wiener-Calderon-Folner theory. <br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes yearly workshops at Texas A&M for the purposes of introducing graduate students to the latest research developments and bringing together the diverse groups of researchers working in areas important to the project. The principal investigator plans to mentor undergraduates through his department's honors program and to give popular talks at math club meetings and during his department's summer programs for undergraduates and high school students. The principal investigator also plans to invite an expert expositor as a distinguished lecturer to give a series of inspiring talks on topics of current interest. This project directly provides for the training of a graduate student. It should be easy to attract one because the principal investigator's recent results are accessible and lead to an open field of problems whose solutions could have significant impact in ergodic theory and other areas."

The focus topics are the following. For SLS 2010: ""Minimal Surfaces and Mean Curvature Flow.""  The conference will take place April 15-17, 2010. The principal speaker will be Professor William Minicozzi from Johns Hopkins University. There will be additional one-hour talks by ten invited speakers to be chosen by Professor Minicozzi, and several twenty-minute contributed talks by graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s. Professor Minicozzi will address recent progress on the study of minimal surfaces and mean curvature flow. In particular, he will speak about sharp partial regularity theorems for weak solutions of the mean curvature flow and other instances of  the increased understanding of geometric flows that have accompanied recent dramatic progress on Ricci flow. Many of the tools of regularity theory that were originally invented for minimal surfaces have been widely applied to other geometric problems. In the case of mean curvature flow, this includes the monotonicity formula of Huisken, Brian White's parabolic version of Federer's dimension reducing, and Brakke's regularity theorem (which is a parabolic version of Allard's theorem for stationary varifolds). For SLS 2011: ""Conformal Differential Geometry and Its Interaction with Representation Theory."" The conference will take place April 7-9, 2011, and feature principal speaker Professor Michael Eastwood of the University of Adelaide. There will be additional one-hour talks by ten invited speakers to be chosen by Professor Eastwood, and several twenty-minute contributed talks by graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s. Professor Eastwood's talks will address the interplay between conformal differential geometry and Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) machinery. The conformal case, important in itself, also acts as an excellent testbed for the more general theory of parabolic geometry. In particular, these talks will set the scene for a conjectured vast extension of the BGG machinery and a properly geometric theory of prolongation. Branson's Q-curvature and its prescription problem will be discussed in this context. Recent work of Oshima finds the symmetry algebras of all conformally invariant differential operators on the flat model. These lectures will discuss the curved cases, which are completely open at present. Finally, the BGG machinery can be used with complex analysis to solve reconstruction problems for integral geometry on suitable homogeneous spaces. The talks will present the current research and outlook in this direction.<br/><br/>Mathematics conferences are vital to the development of the field. They provide unique opportunity for scientists from different subfields to meet so as to (a) summarize the most recent progress in these fields, and their interactions, (b) present new directions of research with sufficient detail to formulate and develop a list of open problems, and (c) provide an opportunity to foster new collaborations and exchange ideas toward the solution of important open questions. In the tradition of the Arkansas Spring Lectures Series, these meetings will provide unique opportunities for young researchers and graduate students to interact with prominent experts in their research areas. Public talks by Professor Daniel Rockmore (Dartmouth College) in 2010 and by Professor Eastwood (Adelaide) in 2011 will address audiences of high school students and the public at large."

These groups are used as algebraic encoding of combinatorial information about the dynamical system. If the covering is expanding, then all the essential information (for instance the Julia set) can be recovered from the iterated monodromy groups. The project is devoted to the study of iterated monodromy groups and their application to topology, dynamics and group theory. Iterated monodromy groups are naturally defined for more general structures than partial self-covering. This generalized definition can be used to construct simplicial approximations of Julia sets of multi-dimensional dynamical systems. There are very few examples of rational functions of several variables for which there is a satisfactory understanding of the topology of their Julia set. The project will provide a general method of constructing approximations of such Julia sets and will lead to new homological invariants of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The aim of the project is to study new connections between algebra and geometric group theory on one side and dynamical systems and the associated fractal Julia sets on the other. The iterated monodromy groups provide a bridge between these two branches of mathematics. Geometric group theory studies large-scale properties of groups of symmetries. Dynamical systems study chaotic dynamics of iterations of maps, which are models of chaotic systems in Science. Iterated monodromy groups encode in a computationally effective way combinatorial information about the dynamical systems. In particular, they give a method to construct approximations by polyhedra of complicated fractals associated with the dynamical systems. This approach can be used in the study of multi-dimensional dynamical systems, where usual computer visualization can not be applied. Iterated monodromy groups are also very interesting and exotic examples of groups. This way dynamical systems can be used to reach better understanding of group theory.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Analysis Program."

The classical random matrix theory traditionally focuses on the asymptotic regime, when the dimensions of the matrices increase to infinity. However, many of today's applications operate in the non-asymptotic regime, with fixed but large dimensions, and they require explicit probability bounds. A systematic development of the non-asymptotic random matrix theory will be carried out. Special attention will be paid to advancing the invertibility theory of random operators. Building on the recent progress on estimating the condition numbers and the smallest singular values of random matrices with independent entries, the program will now be expanded to include some more difficult classes or random operators: random Hermitian matrices, randomly perturbed deterministic matrices, random submatrices of deterministic matrices, operators that factor through random matrices, sums of independent random matrices and random matrices with independent columns. These advances will be based on on parallel development of probabilistic, analytical and geometric tools, including the Littlewood-Offord theory of small ball probabilities and its connections with additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>In high dimensional spaces, random operators/matrices are widely used to model transformations that are too complicated or too general to be understood deterministically or explicitely. The more classical applications of this randomized approach, including those in mathematical physics, operate in the asymptotic regime. This means that the random operators act on spaces whose dimension increases indefinitely, and one seeks to capture the limiting picture as the dimension approaches infinity. In contrast, many of today's applications operate in the non-asymptotic regime, acting on spaces of large but fixed dimensions. This happens in particular in functional analysis where random operators model typical operators; numerical analysis of algorithms where random matrices model typical inputs; the new area of compressed sensing where random operators are the best known measurement systems; statistics where random matrices capture the dependencies among the various parameters of a sample of a population. This proposal will systematically advance and unite the random matrix theory in the non-asymptotic regime, with a view toward applications in the areas mentioned above. The program is based on collaboration with researchers in geometric functional analysis, statistics, electrical engineering, and computer science. A graduate student is expected to join the PI's efforts starting the second year of the program."

Coordinate systems are widely used in both application and theory, strongly connecting these problems to other areas of mathematics such as approximation theory, descriptive set theory, and differential topology.  For example, new Banach spaces are often constructed by explicitly building a basis for the space. In this spirit, this project will address the construction of new Banach spaces with the property that every bounded operator on the space is a multiple of the identity plus a compact operator. Moreover, the project will also study the greedy approximation properties of coordinate systems in Banach spaces. Greedy approximation is based on the idea of always taking the ""biggest piece"" in each step of an iterative algorithm. This project will consider the existence of greedy bases and the convergence of greedy algorithms in particular Banach spaces.  Beyond greedy approximation, this project intends to extend the descriptive set theory approach to bases, which has given remarkable insight into the structural theory of Banach spaces, to that of frames. Furthermore, this project will work on adapting the techniques and structure of Hilbert and Banach frames to the continuously varying setting of vector bundles.<br/><br/><br/>The structural attributes of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces make them ideal settings for analyzing many problems in mathematics and engineering. A common example is encoding and transmitting signals. Bases in a Hilbert space or Banach space give a unique representation  for the vectors in the space while the representation given by a frame is redundant.  Signal encoding and transmission is often accomplished by sending coefficients with respect to some basis. This strategy, however, is not robust in the face of error, as any loss or corruption of basis coefficients results in the loss of entire dimensions of the signal. This is where frames come in as their redundancy distributes error loss over the whole space instead of concentrating it in isolated dimensions. Frames now play an important role in signal processing, and the study of their geometry in both Hilbert and Banach spaces is a growing area of research. Additionally, sometimes it is important to consider not just a single vector space, but some related collection of spaces. For example, the tangent bundle of a surface is the collection of tangent planes to the surface.  In this case we want a basis for the tangent space at each point which moves smoothly over the surface. It is impossible to find such a basis for many surfaces. On the contrary, it is always possible to find a redundant<br/>frame for the tangent space which moves smoothly.  Given this, it is naturally of interest to study such frames."

The study of geometric properties of convex bodies based on information about sections and projections of these bodies has important applications to many areas  of mathematics and science. A new approach to sections of convex bodies, based on methods of Fourier analysis, has recently been developed by the investigator. The idea of this approach is to express different cross-sectional characteristics of a body in terms of the Fourier transform and then use methods of harmonic analysis to solve geometric problems. The investigator plans to apply this approach to characterizations of different classes of bodies, determination of convex bodies from data about their sections and projections, geometric inequalities of the Busemann-Petty type. A connection between intersection bodies, one of the main objects in convex geometry,  and functional spaces has recently been found by the investigator. The investigator plans to use this connection to establish new  results about intersection bodies using methods of functional analysis. An old problem in probability is to characterize all random vectors having the property that all linear combinations of coordinates have the same distribution, up to a constant. The classical examples are stable random vectors. The investigator plans to characterize all random vectors with this property.<br/><br/>The problems considered in this proposal belong to three areas of mathematics: convex geometry, functional analysis and probability. However, the strategy of solution is common for most of the results - the question is translated into the language of the Fourier transform and then treated as a problem from harmonic analysis. In convex geometry, the principal investigator studies properties of convex bodies based on data related to sections and projections of these bodies. This direction, often named geometric tomography, has numerous applications to engineering and medicine. The problems in functional analysis are related to the theory of embedding of metric spaces that has many applications to computer science. In probability, the investigator plans to study generalizations of stable processes that play important role in several areas of mathematics and statistics. The Fourier transform of distributions will serve as the main technical tool, and a significant part of the work will depend on new techniques for calculating the Fourier transform. These techniques have independent value and have already been applied to other areas of mathematics, signal processing and statistics. An important part of the project is the involvement and training of graduate students."

In particular, he is going to work on similar problems in the case of perturbations by unbounded operators, on perturbations of dissipative operators. He is also going to attack the problem of estimating functions of perturbed normal operators. Such problems of perturbation theory are closely related to problems arising in studying Schur multipliers. In particular, the principal investigator is going to work on the famous problem to determine whether a Schur multiplier of a Schatten ? von Neumann class must be completely bounded. The principal investigator is going to use Hankel and Toeplitz operators with matrix-valued symbols to work on various problems in noncommutative analysis. In particular, he is going to work on problems of analytic and meromorphic approximation of matrix-valued functions. In his recent results with F. Nazarov and L.

He is going to develop this approach and extend the results to the case of meromorphic approximation.<br/><br/>  The research in perturbation theory will have an impact on several areas of mathematics and applications such as mathematical physics, quantum mechanics, and physics. In particular, the results will be applied in studying random Schrödinger operators and nonlinear equations of mathematical physics. The factorization and approximation problems in noncommutative analysis are very important in applications in control theory and systems theory. In particular, such problems are extremely important in designing feedback controllers and modeling linear systems with state spaces whose dimension is controlled by given restrains. It is especially important in applications to consider problems that involve matrix-valued functions, because this corresponds to the case of multiple input ? multiple output linear systems."

The subject has undergone tremendous exploration recently due to its close connection to a number of areas of mathematics and mathematical physics, including foliation theory, index theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, quantum field theory, quantization theory, and string theory. <br/><br/>The project consists in a pair of summer schools (GAP VIII and GAP XI) aimed at gathering different streams and instances of noncommutative geometry, as well as identifying new emerging directions. The main purposes of the proposed activities are to bring together leading experts and young researchers working in rapidly developing subjects, and to promote interaction between mathematicians and physicists, and groups working on different aspects of related areas so as to foster interaction, encourage cross-fertilization between different fields, and promote the dissemination of the most recent results of current research. There are many talented young people working in this area. GAP VIII and GAP XI will provide them with excellent opportunities to disseminate their ideas and to broaden their perspective. The PIs anticipate inviting a substantial number of mathematicians at the postdoctoral and graduate student level (from Europe, the United States, and developing countries), and holding poster or short-talk sessions through which young researchers will be given the chance to present their work. The schools will provide an excellent opportunity for young American scientists to exchange ideas with their European peers and initiate collaborations. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis Program, the Algebra and Number Theory Program, and the Analysis Program."

L-infinity variational problems study the minimization problem of appropriate cost functionals that are suprema of integrand functions. The area has become very active recently. Particular foci of the first part of the project are the following: to identify the most general conditions guaranteeing that the equivalence relationship between absolute minimizers of quasi-convex Hamiltonian functionals and viscosity solutions to the highly degenerate Aronsson equation holds; to explore uniqueness issues for general Aronsson equations with spatial dependence; to study the homogenization problem for L-infinity variational problems in the framework of gamma convergence; and to investigate L-infinity variational problems under Dirichlet energy constraints.The second part of this project deals with the Ericksen-Leslie system modeling hydrodynamic flows of nematic liquid crystals. This is a strongly coupled system relating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation of the underlying fluid velocity field and the transported heat flow of harmonic maps for the director field of the nematic liquid crystal materials. The objective is to establish both existence and partial regularity for Leray-Hopf-type weak solutions in dimension three.<br/><br/>The proposed problems not only are mathematically important but also have potential applications to other fields of mathematics, applied science, and materials engineering. The nonlinear partial differential equations or systems involved in the project either are highly degenerate elliptic problems or  equations with super-critical nonlinearities whose resolutions will definitely contribute new ideas and techniques that will be useful in a variety of contexts. So-called L-infinity variational problems arise in a number of different areas such as the determination of optimal radiation treatments in chemotherapy, image analysis and recovery engineering, and the design of winning strategies in certain types of random games. In mechanical engineering, the Ericksen-Leslie system is among the most fundamental equations used to describe the dynamics of viscoelastic fluids, including nematic liquid crystals. Rigorous analysis of both the existence and the regularity of various solutions to such a system can predict the formation of singularities, allow researchers to gain insight into turbulent phenomena, and justify both computational and experimental studies made by applied scientists and engineers. This project will result in the publication of monographs and lecture notes, involve active training of advanced graduate students, and include the organization of specific conferences or workshops."

This is explored by studying the Euclidean analogs of two problems which were recently investigated in the context of vector spaces over finite fields. The first problem is a natural generalization of the Falconer distance problem to the study of point configurations.  The second problem is drawn from a large class of problems known as the sum-product problems.  The continuous nature of the first problem and the discrete nature of the second allows the researcher to incorporate a variety of methods from various fields in order to better illustrate the general principles involved.  These include methods drawn from arithmetic and geometric combinatorics, number theory, and classical harmonic analysis.  The juxtaposition of the methods from the Euclidean cases with the methods in the context of the finite field geometry could provide a more complete picture of the set expansion phenomenon.<br/><br/>This project involves studying the interaction between several areas of mathematics using a problem-solving approach, in which two problems are considered whose analogs have known solutions in one subfield of mathematics known as finite field geometry.  The problems are examined in two additional related subfields known as discrete and continuous Euclidean geometry.  The goal of the project is to not only find solutions to the two problems in these alternate contexts, but to explore the interplay between a variety of known methods and techniques in order to obtain a more complete understanding of the scope of the general principles involved.  The major areas of mathematics these problems are taken from include additive and geometric combinatorics, number theory, and classical harmonic analysis.

The first is to solve the problem of the unitary dual: to describe the irreducible unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups. The primary tool is an algorithm to compute the unitary dual of any given group, which we are implementing inside the ""atlas"" software. We plan to use this information to prove results about the unitary dual, beginning with the unitarity of Arthur's unipotent representations. The second primary goal is to make information about representation theory of real groups accessible to non-specialists, via the software, a web site, public workshops, and other means. The atlas software is freely available on the atlas web site, and will continue to be maintained there indefinitely.<br/><br/>The idea of using symmetry to study problems in mathematics and science dates back to Fourier's work on heat nearly two hundred years ago. In the hands of Hermann Weyl, Eugene Wigner, and Andre Weil, symmetry has come to play a central role in quantum mechanics and in number theory. Lie groups, named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, are the mathematical objects underlying symmetry.  Representation theory studies all of the ways a given symmetry, or Lie group, can manifest itself. The problem of understanding all ""unitary"" representations (in which the symmetry operations preserve lengths) is one of the most important unsolved problems in the subject, and has potential applications in many areas; for example, it is an abstract version of the question, ""what quantum mechanical systems can admit a certain kind of symmetry?"""

Specific goals include extending the orbit equivalence theory and spectral theory to nonminimal Bratteli-Vershik and substitution systems, characterizing invariant measures for nonprimitive substitution tilings, and developing multifractal analysis of Bernoulli convolutions and related self-affine measures. It is expected that new links and connections between diverse areas will emerge in the course of this investigation. In particular, flows along stable and unstable foliations of pseudo-Anosov maps are linked to substitution systems, nonprimitive tilings give rise to fractals, such as the Sierpinski gasket self-similar tiling and the familiar fractal Sierpinski gasket set, complex rational (e.g., quadratic) and piecewise linear dynamics are sometimes related by a conjugacy. The methods and techniques used will not be limited to those from ergodic theory and dynamics but will also come from other fields, including operator algebras, combinatorics, number theory, probability, and complex analysis.<br/><br/>The fields of ergodic theory, dynamical systems, and fractal geometry have their origins, motivation, and applications in many fields outside of mathematics, including statistical and celestial mechanics, population biology, aero- and fluid-dynamics, and materials science. A dynamical system is given by a so-called phase space and some transformation rules that prescribe how states change in time. Here ""time"" may be discrete or continuous, multidimensional, or more generally, given by a group. Dynamics may be regular or chaotic, or it could exhibit a ""mixed"" behavior. Many dynamically defined objects turn out to be ""fractals."" Mathematicians often study simplified models that capture the important features of the physical system in the simplest possible form. This project aims to analyze in depth several existing models, as well as develop new ones. Although it is primarily theoretical in its focus, it will advance basic knowledge in areas with diverse connections and applications. Specifically, Bernoulli convolutions and related fractal constructions have been used in signal and image processing, control theory, and econometrics; substitutions and tilings have many links to computer science and solid-state physics. The PI interacts with scientists and participates in professional meetings of an interdisciplinary nature. In addition, this project will contribute to the development of human resources through training undergraduate and graduate students."

In the widely accepted picture, in three or more dimensions there exists a transition from an insulator region, characterized by localized states, to a very different metallic region, characterized by extended states, while in one or two dimensions there are only localized states and no metal-insulator transition. This project aims to further the mathematical understanding of this picture.  The continuum Anderson Hamiltonian with arbitrary single-site probability distribution will be studied, with the objective of   proving localization at the bottom of the spectrum, and to characterize the region of dynamical localization by proving a converse to the multiscale analysis, showing existence of a nonzero minimal rate of transport in the complementary region.  If single-site probability distribution has a bounded density, a local Wegner estimate and will be proved to obtain Minami's estimate  (and hence Poisson statistics for eigenvalues) in the region of localization.  The PI will investigate localization in the two-dimensional (discrete) Anderson model by studying the Anderson model on the strip; a transfer matrix approach based on the supersymmetric replica trick will be used.  The PI will study a multi-particle Anderson model describing   interacting electrons moving in  a medium with random impurities, and investigate localization in Fock space. The PI will search for a proof of localization for the Anderson model where the single-site potential is a Bernoulli random variable in two or more dimensions, a known result for the continuum Anderson Hamiltonian. The correct exponent for the logarithmic correction in Mott's formula for the Anderson model will be investigated.  The PI will also study Minami's estimate and Poisson statistics for eigenvalues of random classical wave operators (e.g., random acoustic and Maxwell operators), which describe classical waves in random media.<br/><br/>Random Schrödinger operators describe an electron moving in a medium with random impurities.   In the presence of impurities, a material that normally acts like a metal, i.e., it conducts electric current, will exhibit localization and behave like an insulator for electric currents. The impurities create a metal-insulator transition with important consequences for electric currents. This research will contribute to the understanding of electronic phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as Anderson localization and the quantum Hall effect.  Some of the topics of research are suitable for PhD theses, and will be used for the training of future researchers."

It was followed by work of Chern, Hormander, and Kohn, and more recently, for instance, by work of Catlin, D'Angelo, and Webster.  The proposed work will follow in this tradition by drawing together elements of analysis and geometry in order to draw new connections in complex analysis between one and several variables.

This project aims to investigate the spectral phenomena which arise with high probability, and obtain explicit probability bounds. One of the central questions here is evaluation of the probability that a large random matrix is non-singular, and obtaining quantitative characteristics of non-singularity. To this end, the project brings into play a wide array of tools, ranging from classical probability, to asymptotic geometric analysis, and additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>The theory of random matrices is currently undergoing a period of rapid development.

In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract. Special attention will be paid to recruiting members of groups under-represented in the field of mathematics."

The long term goal is to understand the Cauchy-Riemann equation and related topics. Problems either are directly concerned with proving estimates, improving understanding of key concepts basic for these equations or applying estimates. (i) We will work jointly with Gautam Bharali and Berit Stensønes on finite type pseudoconvex domains. Our objectives for the next three years is to improve our understanding of the boundary geometry. This is a necessary prerequisite to develop results on the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Bharali, Stensones and the PI have recently made progress by developing a better understanding of complex curves tangent to high order. (ii) We will work jointly with T. Dinh, F. Rong, Nessim Sibony and Erlend F. Wold on laminations by Riemann surfaces in complex projective space. Our objective for the next three years is to improve our understanding of laminations in higher dimension. The authors have recently found some examples of Riemann surface laminations.(iii) The study of foliations by Riemann surfaces leads to basic questions about currents. In two dimensions, positive closed currents can be approximated by currents of integration of Riemann surfaces. In higher dimension, it would be useful to have a similar geometric interpretation of currents. We propose to work on this topic with Coman. The first case is that of currents in three dimensions. (iv) The PI also proposes joint collaborations with Lina Lee and Yuan Zhang. We are working on various problems involving invariant metrics and infinite type pseudoconvex domains. (v) The PI also plans to continue the project with Loredana Lanzani on a complex div-curl theorem and with Klas Diederich on Holder estimates for the Cauchy Riemann equation of D'Angelo domains and other questions.<br/><br/>We plan to work with mathematicians at different stages of their carreers. Some senior mathematicians are Diederich, Løw, Sibony and Stensønes. We believe that together the four of us have a good overview of the  fields of several complex variables and complex dynamics. This benefits our joint projects but also our work with younger mathematicians. We plan to work with four midcareer mathematicians, Bharali, Coman, Dinh and Lanzani and also with 4 postdocs, Lee, Rong, Zhang and Wold. Also we work with graduate students, Crystal Zeager and Taeyong Ahn. Of these, 5 are females."

The key object in the study is a space of valuations on analytic functions in several variables. It has an intricate geometric structure already in the case of two variables, being a tree built up by infinitely many curve segments glued together. In more variables, the objects glued together are higher-dimensional simplices. The PI will do analysis and dynamics on this space, and deduce results on several problems. Among many specific proposed projects, one involves establishing an algebraic version of the Oseledec theorem in nonlinear dynamics. Another project concerns the openness conjecture by Demailly and Koll\'ar on singularities in analytic geometry. In both projects, the general plan is to translate the problem to more tractable questions on valuation space. The two-dimensional cases were studied earlier by Favre and the PI.<br/><br/>Singularities appear throughout mathematics, even when the primary objects of study are regular objects. An example from geometry is given by a cone: the points outside the apex are regular, since when magnifying the cone looks like a straight plane there, but the apex is a singularity. Another type of singularity occurs in dynamical systems, when applying iterative algorithms with fast convergence rates. Dynamical systems and complex analysis are established areas of mathematics, with connections to economics, biology and engineering. Working with students at the graduate and undergraduate levels, the PI will undertake a unified study of singularities in several different mathematics fields, including dynamical systems and complex analysis."

It will put particular emphasis on various kinds of rigidity phenomena and on applicability of several powerful methods across those areas. New methods and insights have been introduced by the principal investigator and his collaborators over the past years that have led to significant advances in the understanding of rigidity of invariant  measures and  the differentiable rigidity of orbit structure for actions of higher rank Abelian groups. The progress achieved based on these methods has engendered fruitful applications to Diophantine approximation problems in number theory and provided the first examples of the existence of invariant geometric structure for large classes of actions. Avenues of pursuit in the project include the following: tame and wild behavior in the classification of Anosov systems up to a differentiable conjugacy, global rigidity of hyperbolic measures for  actions of higher rank Abelian groups and applications to the Zimmer program, completing the program of differentiable rigidity of  partially hyperbolic algebraic actions of higher rank Abelian groups, applications of the theory of unitary group representations and the KAM  method to rigidity of unipotent homogeneous actions, commencement of a comprehensive program of investigation of nonhomogeneous parabolic systems, nonstandard KAM-type invariant curve theorems, and low-dimensional systems with zero topological entropy.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems serve as mathematical models for the time-evolution of  processes that range across the spectrum of the natural and social sciences. They also have a surprisingly broad range of applications in core mathematical disciplines, most particularly in various areas of geometry and number theory. Within many of these contexts the term ""time"" does not necessarily connote the usual one-dimensional time but can be multidimensional or of an even more general nature that is captured by the key mathematical concept of a ""group."" The crucial difficulty that impedes efforts in obtain a comprehensive understanding  of important models can be described as follows: while it is  often relatively easy to establish existence of some initial conditions that produce chaotic behavior, proving that chaotic behavior exists in most or many dynamical systems (in the sense of so-called volume in the phase-space) is beyond the reach of present or even anticipated  mathematical methods. The principal investigator and his collaborators have discovered that, for systems with multidimensional time and under certain very general conditions, this difficulty can be overcome: global conditions of a topological or dynamical nature that at first glance would seem to guarantee only the existence of some chaotic orbits actually imply the existence of a set of such orbits that fill a positive volume in phase-space or, in certain cases, even provide a complete description of the orbit structure. This seemingly technical fact could have important implications for physics and engineering."

The latter equation is representative of a large class of dispersive models, of which it provides the simplest example. The NLS exhibits various types of solutions: some exist in finite time (nonlinear effects dominate over linear); other soliton-like solutions exist globally but may not decay with time (nonlinear and linear effects balance each other), and global-in-time solutions completely disperse with time (nonlinear effects are negligible compared with linear ones). The project will study the dynamics of all types of solutions for the class of dispersive equations with focusing nonlinearities. In particular, a new phenomenon of the contracting-ring blow-up solutions will be explored both analytically and numerically. The concentration phenomenon will be analyzed to obtain a better understanding of the blow-up behavior of such solutions. <br/><br/>Results of this project will advance our understanding of various physical phenomena that arise in nonlinear optics, quantum and plasma physics, and fluid dynamics. Talks and mini-lecture series on methods of harmonic analysis and differential equations developed from the proposed research will be delivered at several scientific organizations.

The SL(2,C)-character variety, X(F), of a group F parametrizes conjugacy classes of representations of F into SL(2,C), the isometry group of hyperbolic 3-space. Discrete faithful elements of X(F) correspond to hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the PI will work to understand better the interaction between topological and geometric features of these manifolds, as well as the structure of the discrete-faithful locus itself. In addition, he will pursue a study of X(F) as a whole, considered as a dynamical system under the action of the outer automorphism group of F (particularly when F is a free group). A new dynamical decomposition of X(F) was recently discovered, whose structure seems to be rich and relatively unexplored. In addition the PI will study geometric aspects of Teichmuller spaces, which parametrize hyperbolic structures in two dimensions, and of Mapping Class Groups, their natural automorphism groups.<br/><br/>The interactions between geometry, topology and dynamics play a entral role in mathematics as well as its applications. A geometric space, such as our own universe or the configuration space of some system, may admit dynamical phenomena such as flows, iterations or group actions. The behavior of these phenomena, as well as the geometry of the space, can be strongly influenced by its topological structure, namely the underlying connective tissue on which the geometry is overlaid. Furthermore, we often find that geometry and dynamics persist at higher levels of abstraction: the collection of all geometric structures on a given space can itself be organized into a new ""higher"" space, with its own geometry and its own inherent symmetries which give rise to dynamical structure. The interaction between these phenomena at different levels can enrich our insight about the original systems. The PI's own research focuses on particular instances of this general template, namely the geometry and topology of 2- and 3- dimensional spaces, and the corresponding dynamics for their higher parameter spaces. This low-dimensional setting is particularly amenable to our intuition and is partly motivated by direct visual analogies with our physical world, but it also happens, for a variety of reasons, to be a meeting place for a number of different areas of mathematics as well as physics, so that a fuller understanding in this domain can enrich, by analogy as well as direct mathematical connection, our approaches to other parts of mathematics.

Representation theory studies all of the ways a given symmetry, or Lie group, can manifest itself. The problem of understanding all ""unitary"" representations (in which the symmetry operations preserve lengths) is one of the most important unsolved problems in the subject, and has potential applications in many areas; for example, it is an abstract version of the question, ""what quantum mechanical systems can admit a certain kind of symmetry?"""

Herein, these questions are viewed through the lens of random matrix theory, a relatively new field at the confluence of probability theory, complex analysis, and combinatorics.  Random matrix theory provides powerful new tools in the arena of functional analysis.  Moreover, as connections have grown, interplay between the two fields has allowed functional analysis to feedback and give insights into structures associated to random matrices.  The proposed research includes three projects, investigating the interconnected themes of Segal-Bargmann analysis, stochastic analysis, and random subspaces of a Hilbert space.  Also proposed is a project in random matrix theory, concerning random eigenvectors.  In the former three cases, tools from random matrix theory have, in the view of the principal investigator, great potential to give fruitful insights into problems both old and new.  For the latter project, the flow of information moves in the opposite direction: the complex analytic techniques from free probability theory in operator algebras are used to give quantitative information about the geometry of the eigenspaces of a pair of random matrices.  In all of the proposed research, there is the potential for interaction between very different fields ? probability theory, geometric functional analysis, and operator algebras to name a few.  Moreover, the latter project is motivated by, and promises real-world application to problems in signal processing and other parts of electrical engineering.<br/><br/>Arrays of numbers (also known as matrices) are a common efficient way to record data, in all branches of science.  Finding meaning in those arrays is an enterprise that runs from the mundane to the highly sophisticated. A relevant example is common in signal processing, where a time-varying signal is digitized to produce a rectangular array of amplitudes.  Filtering noise out (or decoding signals) means finding ways to recognize ordered versus random patterns within the matrix. Using ingredients developed in physics starting in the 1950s, statistics in the 1980s, and more recently complex and functional analysis in the last two decades, there is now a rich, robust collection of tools for such signal-to-random-noise separation.  This proposal includes several projects motivated by those tools and their foundations within functional analysis. The principal investigator is an expert in a number of fields related to random matrix theory, and expects fruitful results to follow from exploring old and new connections between pure mathematics and applied science.  In at least one proposed project, there is significant promise of actual practical applications to signal processing problems (for large arrays of antennas).  This proposal involves research problems at varying levels of sophistication, and so undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral and faculty researchers may participate."

Anosov systems constitute the paradigm of chaotic dynamics and have been intensively studied since the late sixties. Still, some questions are wide open, most importantly, the question of classification of Anosov diffeomorphisms. There are three major directions in the proposed program. 1. Smooth classification of Anosov systems. This will continue the research program started in the PI's recent work and aims at gaining fundamental understanding of the structure of the space of higher dimensional Anosov systems. 2. Study of the global topology of the space of Anosov diffeomorphisms and the Teichmuller space of smooth conjugacy classes. 3. Anosov diffeomorphisms on simply connected four dimensional manifolds. Dimension four is the least dimension where the classification problem is open. It is expected that simply connected 4-manifolds do not support Anosov diffeomorphisms.<br/><br/>The project lies in the area of hyperbolic dynamics and aims at a fine understanding of hyperbolic dynamical systems. A dynamical system is called hyperbolic if the ambient space exhibits a lot of stretching in one direction and contraction in another direction. The behavior one observes in hyperbolic systems is usually referred to as deterministic chaos. One of the first appearances of such systems was in the work of Cartwright and Littlewood who studied certain differential equations of second order with periodic forcing. This work arose from war-related studies involving radio waves. Since then hyperbolic dynamics has been an important tool in natural sciences. The results of the proposed research will be disseminated through seminar and conference talks, online preprint servers as well as journal publications. Also, the PI plans to deliver expository talks in his area with the purpose of introducing undergraduate and graduate students to the exciting area of hyperbolic dynamics."

Partial hyperbolicity has seen great progress in the last decade after the breakthrough work of Pugh and Shub, who established ergodicity for volume-preserving perturbations of the time-one map of the geodesic flow of a surface of constant negative curvature. A series of papers, culminating in work of the principal investigator with Wilkinson, has established ergodicity for a very general class of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic systems. These results appear to have pushed current techniques to their limit, but still fall short of providing a complete understanding of when volume-preserving partially hyperbolic systems are ergodic: new ideas are needed. This project will pursue such fresh lines of attack on this question.  It will also consider various dynamical systems of a geometrical nature that exhibit hyperbolic behavior.<br/><br/>Partially hyperbolic dynamical systems are important because they model significant phenomena that occur in nature and because the mathematical tools for understanding such systems are by now well developed. For example, there is now a good understanding of how partial hyperbolicity gives rise to highly chaotic behavior. Researchers also possess a rich set of concrete examples in which it is possible to understand completely the mechanisms that create the partially hyperbolic behavior. In the long run, improving this knowledge, as this project hopes to do, could have important implications for science and engineering."

The space of all complex projective structures on a surface is a contractible manifold which has two natural but very different coordinate systems; one involves a classical complex-analytic construction (the Schwarzian derivative), while the other comes from the operation of grafting, which assembles a projective surface from Euclidean and hyperbolic pieces.  The major research goals of this project are to understand the relationship between the two coordinate systems for the moduli space of projective structures and to use this understanding to solve problems in related areas.  The project will also include a significant educational component focusing on undergraduate mathematics at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) through two targeted programs: First, the PI will organize a yearly undergraduate research symposium, which will include lectures by senior mathematicians and by undergraduates reporting on their own research projects.  Second, the PI will create a new course at UIC for undergraduate mathematics and mathematical computer science majors on ""experimental mathematics"", discussing the way computer software (both custom and off-the-shelf) is used as an exploratory tool in mathematical research.  The PI will teach the course for the first time in the 2010-2011 academic year, emphasizing computer exploration of the geometry of curves and surfaces.<br/><br/>The study of the shapes and configurations of geometric objects has applications to diverse areas of science and engineering, from understanding the folding of proteins or the formation of galaxies to programming autonomous vehicles that must navigate complex terrain.

This project focuses on the moduli space of complex projective Riemann surfaces, a class of geometric objects that encode information about $3$-dimensional spaces (hyperbolic manifolds) in $2$-dimensional form.  Through both theoretical study and computational experiments, the PI will develop new tools for analyzing these structures, enhance the connections between $2$- and $3$-dimensional geometry, and expand applications of these structures in related fields of mathematics.

These include the Bessel models that have played an important role in the study of automorphic forms and L-functions stemming from attempts at extending the theory of the local Langlands correspondence to groups beyond inner twists of GL(n).  The importance of these Whittaker models is that they give a representation theoretic interpretation of the Fourier coefficients of multivariate automorphic forms. The mathematical literature, to date, on Bessel models studies only models for subrepresentations of degenerate principal series. The most general work of this type is the PI?s on previous grants.

He expects to have solved the problem for the case of compact stabilizer before the end of the first summer. The general case will be much harder and will be emphasized in the next two years of the grant (after Gomez graduates).

Important information about proper mappings between open sets can be gleaned from their restrictions to the boundary. Basic questions that will be investigated include the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of CR-mappings between given CR-manifolds, as well as geometric questions that arise in connection with this study.

Coordinate systems are widely used in both application and theory, strongly connecting these problems to other areas of mathematics such as approximation theory, descriptive set theory, and differential topology.  For example, new Banach spaces are often constructed by explicitly building a basis for the space. In this spirit, this project will address the construction of new Banach spaces with the property that every bounded operator on the space is a multiple of the identity plus a compact operator. Moreover, the project will also study the greedy approximation properties of coordinate systems in Banach spaces. Greedy approximation is based on the idea of always taking the ""biggest piece"" in each step of an iterative algorithm. This project will consider the existence of greedy bases and the convergence of greedy algorithms in particular Banach spaces.  Beyond greedy approximation, this project intends to extend the descriptive set theory approach to bases, which has given remarkable insight into the structural theory of Banach spaces, to that of frames. Furthermore, this project will work on adapting the techniques and structure of Hilbert and Banach frames to the continuously varying setting of vector bundles.<br/><br/><br/>The structural attributes of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces make them ideal settings for analyzing many problems in mathematics and engineering. A common example is encoding and transmitting signals. Bases in a Hilbert space or Banach space give a unique representation  for the vectors in the space while the representation given by a frame is redundant.  Signal encoding and transmission is often accomplished by sending coefficients with respect to some basis. This strategy, however, is not robust in the face of error, as any loss or corruption of basis coefficients results in the loss of entire dimensions of the signal. This is where frames come in as their redundancy distributes error loss over the whole space instead of concentrating it in isolated dimensions. Frames now play an important role in signal processing, and the study of their geometry in both Hilbert and Banach spaces is a growing area of research. Additionally, sometimes it is important to consider not just a single vector space, but some related collection of spaces. For example, the tangent bundle of a surface is the collection of tangent planes to the surface.  In this case we want a basis for the tangent space at each point which moves smoothly over the surface. It is impossible to find such a basis for many surfaces. On the contrary, it is always possible to find a redundant<br/>frame for the tangent space which moves smoothly.  Given this, it is naturally of interest to study such frames."

The investigator has already worked on this subject for several years. He also intends to study Euler equations for incompressible fluids and to work on problems of semiclassical limit coming from quantum physics. Finally, he wishes to apply some of his recent results on some ""improved"" version of the classical isoperimetric inequalities to study the stability of the shapes of crystals under the action of an external potential.<br/><br/>The research described above has applications in many different areas: the optimal transport problem has obvious application to economics, but it has also shown to be very interdisciplinary, with links with other areas of mathematics like geometry, probability and partial differential equations, and also with physics and biology. Euler equations and semiclassical limits are classical problem in physics and quantum physics, and their mathematical study may increase deeper understanding of the physical phenomena themselves. Finally, the study of the rigidity of crystals under exterior potential should help to explain many phenomena which are currently observed in experiments but not yet completely understood."

This proposal involves problems that, in particular, interact with set theory, combinatorics, approximation theory and operator theory. The interaction with set theory comes about from embedding theorems in Banach spaces that could not hold without Martin's theorem that Borel games are determined. In turn their existence has had implications for set theory. Recent surprising embedding theorems of the investigator and co-authors are ripe for further development and application and this proposal contains such problems. In particular these results have implications on possible operator structures and how certain ""outliers"" exist much more widely than previously supposed. The geometry of Banach spaces has played a big role in the development by approximation theorists of various notions of greedy approximations. Problems extending the boundary of what is known in this region are also included in the proposal. The interaction with combinatorics is through Ramsey theory and its relation to the geometric notion of ""partial unconditionality."" This has remained a tough frontier for nearly 30 years, but as the interactions between researchers in both areas increase so is the likelihood that this can be successfully attacked.<br/><br/>This proposal could ultimately have impact in mathematical physics through the yet unproven (but now much more likely) existence of a space very close to Hilbert space where all the operators are simply written down. Physicists, rather than using Hilbert (i. e. Euclidean) space as a model for natural phenomena might be able to use a weak form of the space studied by Banach space geometers, if they can identify the operators on the space. Such a space may exist with very few operators, ones easily handled by theorists. Part of this proposal is to prove the widespread existence of such very few operator spaces. This is a first step towards the goal above. Another part of this proposal deals with problems in greedy approximation. This is, in turn, connected with problems in signal processing. The central problem there is to transmit information accurately and efficiently. The mathematical connections of this proposed research are substantial and widespread, touching, in particular upon set theory, analysis, approximation theory, operator theory and combinatorics. Increased communication between researchers in these areas will be fostered and should likely lead to further connections."

One of the main goals is to understand the technique of composing subfactors in terms of their associated planar algebras. This will lead to new methods of constructing subfactors and planar algebras, in particular new examples with infinite  principal graphs which are essential for progress in the structure theory. Moreover, every such subfactor will provide a potentially very interesting fusion category of bimodules, which can be computed explicitly. As a first step, those compositions will be studied that arise as planar subalgebras of the tensor product of two Temperley-Lieb planar algebras. For more general compositions, a cohomology theory for subfactors and planar algebras has to be developed which will replace group cohomology. A very rich theory is likely to emerge from these investigations. In particular, it is expected that new classification results for subfactors with Jones index two times the golden ratio squared will be obtained.<br/><br/>A subfactor can be viewed as a mathematical object which captures quantum symmetries of a mathematical or quantum physical system. These symmetries play a key role in understanding the behavior of these complex systems, and the theory of subfactors provides effective tools to manipulate and study them. This theory has had many profound and surprising applications to numerous areas of mathematics and physics, such as conformal field theory, statistical mechanics, low dimensional  topology and combinatorics. Subfactors have contributed in an important way to the understanding of naturally occurring structures in these a priori quite distinct areas of mathematics and physics. It is expected that the project will make important contributions to some of these areas of basic science. Exciting applications of planar algebras and their associated fusion categories to solid state physics and to topological quantum computing are possible. Furthermore, the project will involve graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and contribute to their training as researchers in mathematics."

Resonances are poles of certain meromorphic functions and are, in some sense, analogous to eigenvalues. Another problem involves further understanding the distribution of resonances in Euclidean scattering. Other projects involve manifolds with infinite cylindrical ends. In particular, a goal is to improve our understanding of how the geometric structure of such manifolds is reflected in analytic objects such as the scattering matrix or the set of resonances.<br/><br/>Radar, sonar, and medical imaging provide examples of inverse scattering theory in practical use. Resonances are of interest to physicists and chemists, for whom a resonance corresponds to a metastable state, containing information about both the frequency and the rate of decay. The class of manifolds with infinite cylindrical ends include waveguides, which are variously used in modeling  semiconductors and the ocean. Thus advances in the mathematical understanding of these problems may lead to advances in other disciplines."

These research goals will be carried out through a variety of modalities, including published papers in peer-reviewed journals, a collaborative book project, supervising Ph.D. students, and speaking at conferences, including the upcoming International Congress of Mathematicians in Hyderabad, India.<br/><br/>The principal investigator is a leading expert in the field of partially hyperbolic dynamics. A dynamical system is a system (for example, a state space for a physical process) that evolves over time according to a deterministic set of rules. Well-studied classes of dynamical systems include the so-called hyperbolic systems, which display chaotic, unpredictable features at every point, and KAM systems, which have stable regions of regular motion. The partially hyperbolic systems are a more general class of dynamical systems than the hyperbolic class, and include systems that combine hyperbolicity in some directions with KAM behavior in other directions.  Partially hyperbolic systems occur widely in dynamical systems that arise in physics. For example, planetary motion usually contains partially hyperbolic subdynamics. The principal investigator has had a well-developed research plan for over fifteen years to study partially hyperbolic systems and is poised to raise the theory of these systems to a new level of generality and applicability."

The propagation of waves on smoothly varying spaces is well understood in many respects, but the interaction with singularities--which might range from boundaries, to corners, to structures ""at infinity""--presents many open problems. One of the project's components is related to the understanding of wave propagation on Kerr spacetimes (i.e., near rotating black holes). The principal investigator will study the distribution of quasi-normal modes, the ways that the black hole may ""ring"" with damped oscillations. The initial goal of this project is to obtain a rigorous description of the exponential decay rate of high frequency modes. The project also includes work on problems of local energy decay on Riemannian manifolds, for which the geometry of the infinite ends turns out to have a profound effect on the low frequency phenomena that may dominate energy decay. Another aspect of wave propagation of interest to the principal investigator is the infinite-speed propagation occurring in solutions to the Schrodinger equation. In settings in which geometric rays are trapped in a bounded region, little is known about the regularity of solutions. The principal investigator is intent on studying the effects of these trapped rays, as well as the effects of geometric singularities such as cone points on the propagation.<br/><br/>Geometry influences the behavior of solutions to wave equations in many interesting and subtle ways. Following Newton, we know that light behaves in many regimes as if made of tiny particles. On the other hand, we also know that light can turn corners (""diffract"") and that it tends to disperse. The effect of changes in geometry to changes in propagation of waves (be they light or sound or water or gravity waves, or the wave-functions describing quantum particles) is the central focus of this project's research. In particular, the principal investigator's work on quasi-normal modes for Kerr spacetimes is closely related to problems of intense interest in the physics community, as these modes are part of the signature of gravitational waves. The principal investigator's study of the linear Schrodinger equation is related to applications not just to the physics of nonrelativistic quantum particles, but also to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, which models such disparate phenomena as laser pulses and superconductivity."

The relevance of these problems comes out of a confirmation that quasiconformal theory and nonlinear elasticity share compelling mathematical challenges. The theory of mappings of finite distortion arose from the need to extend the ideas and applications of the classical theory of quasiconformal mappings to the degenerate elliptic setting. There are many natural reasons for studying extremal problems in such a general degenerated setting. We eventually hope to lay down the analytical foundations for compactifying the moduli spaces. In such an extremal problem our mappings are not constrained on the boundary; the boundary does not even exist for compact Riemann surfaces. Annuli are where one first observes nontrivial conformal invariants. There is a close relationship between the existence of mappings with smallest mean distortion and the well known conjecture of Nitsche (1962) on harmonic homeomorphisms between circular annuli. The Nitsche conjecture was originally motivated by the study of the non-existence of doubly connected minimal graphs. Very recently, the PI in collaboration with T. Iwaniec and L. V. Kovalev gave an affirmative answer to this question. Our approach opens several future directions. There are many new and unexpected phenomena concerning existence (hammering phenomenon), uniqueness, regularity and failure of radial symmetry of the extremal mappings; some already prepared for answers, while others remain long term goals.<br/> <br/>Mathematical analysis relies on physical and geometric intuition for its future development. In recent years, this trend has become more pronounced, leading to concerted  efforts of pure and applied mathematicians to work together. Problems in the intersection of  Geometric Function Theory and Non-linear Elasticity that the PI proposes here contribute to  these efforts. The proposed existence theorems of hyperelastic deformations might interest not only mathematicians but also engineers and physicists. The project also involves working with small colleges located near to Syracuse University with the aim of attracting young researchers from underrepresented groups to mathematics and also involves  mentoring graduate students."

A strong gravitational field regime will be studied in the context of extensions and developments of the short pulse method recently introduced by Christodoulou in the problem of formation of trapped surfaces.

The latter fact is, to a large extent, due to the highly nonlinear nature of the Einstein equations and a lack of the mathematical tools to deal with it. The development of a satisfactory mathematical approach lies on the interface between analysis, geometry and partial differential equations."

This class includes, but is not limited to, quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings. A differential inclusion restricts the essential range of the derivative to a certain set of matrices. Main sources of differential inclusions are differential geometry and the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations. Typically, various notions of convexity and connectedness in the matrix space drive the analysis of existence and regularity of solutions. One of basic questions is which differential inclusions imply local invertibility. Invertibility is often established in two steps: first it is shown that the mapping is discrete and open (that is, a branched cover); the second step is to prove that the branch set is empty. Implementation of each step encounters problems that continue to challenge the available methods of analysis and topology. The proposal also brings the tools of geometric function theory into the field of ordinary differential equations. In the presence of canonical coordinates on the Euclidean space the driving vector field in an autonomous system of differential equations can be identified with a mapping, and the geometry of this mapping turns out to be related to the uniqueness of solution. Thirdly, the techniques introduced in quasiconformal analysis are also effective in the studies of smooth (e.g., harmonic) mappings, which in turn find applications in the theory of minimal surfaces<br/><br/>Minimal surfaces are mathematical models of thin films, for instance soap bubbles. Our understanding of their shapes develops through the solution of extremal problems. For example, how far apart can one move two boundary curves of a minimal surface before the surface breaks down? The principal investigator will apply the techniques of geometric function theory to such extremal problems. This approach is not limited to models of thin films and is also relevant in the studies of elastic deformation of solid materials. Another part of the proposal addresses uniqueness and stability of solutions of ordinary differential equations, which are commonplace in physics and engineering. They appear as equations of motion for one or several particles, with the number of particles affecting the dimensionality of the problem and the geometry of vector fields involved. Geometric function theory allows one to establish the uniqueness of a solution in situations where the standard results of the theory of ordinary differential equations do not apply.

These include Davis' method and the CRDT algorithm of Driscoll and Vavasis as special cases, and other methods involving the medial axis and quasiconformal mappings.  One of the basic themes is to start with certain quasiconformal maps that approximate the desired conformal map, but are easier to compute and have better properties. These maps have natural connections to several well known problems such as Brennan's conjecture, and the PI will investigate these connections.

For 2-dimensional surfaces, a standard method is to use a conformal mapping (i.e., angle preserving on small scales) to replace the region with a simpler one, such as a disk or rectangle. This approach has been studied for over 150 years, but not until the 1980's did computers made conformal mapping practical for highly complex regions.  The PI will investigate how to improve existing methods and develop new ones that are faster and more reliable. He will also investigate the theoretical behavior of conformal maps on extremely complex domains such as fractals and the connections between conformal maps and probability theory. The PI has already applied the insights gained from these problems to meshing. This is the process of dividing a complex region into simple pieces such as triangles.  Meshing is a basic part of most numerical methods and the usefulness of a mesh in applications depends on the number of pieces (fewer is better) and their shapes (better to avoid small and large angles).  It is difficult to construct a mesh which is good in both respects, but PI has used non-Euclidean geometry to construct 2-dimensional quadrilateral meshes with optimal size and shapes for simple polygons and is working to extend this to more general domains.  Greater generality is needed in various problems involving crack formation, interfaces between materials and computer learning.  Efficient meshing also has numerous applications in high-performance computing such as modeling surfaces for engineering and computer graphics.

The resulting equations are linear and model very well small variations from equilibrium. But more substantial variations are better modeled by considering non-quadratic energies.  In this proposal we study some aspects of the mathematical theory of the equations that result from the minimization of energies (or other quantities in physics and engineering) that are given by power laws of the type ""Energy is approximatley the sum of the absolute values of velocity raised to the pth power"", for p different from 2. The minimizers of these non-quadratic energies are p-harmonic functions. When the energy is quadratic (p=2) the resulting equations are linear, but for non-quadratic energies we are necessarily led to non-linear equations. Recently Peres and Sheffield found an unexpected connection between random Tug-of-War games and p-harmonic functions. Motivated by these considerations we introduce the class of p-harmonious functions and explore its relationship to the classical p-harmonic functions. In particular, p-harmonious functions serve as very good discrete approximations to p-harmonic functions and suggest novel approaches to some long-standing open problems.<br/><br/>The possible impact on other sciences comes from the connection between p-harmonic and p-harmonious functions and stochastic games. It may shine new light into some optimization problems that can be formulated in spaces quite more general than Euclidean space (graphs, trees, length spaces). The more immediate impact will be on human resources. The PI will use the formulation of Tug-of-War games in simple graphs to mentor several freshman students who used computer simulation to run these games, and are exposed to mathematical thinking early in their undergraduate career. The PI current graduate student will graduate in December 2010. The PI will mentor a postdoc in Analysis funded by the University of Pittsburgh for the duration of this project."

The main objectives of the present project are applications of operator K-theory to a number of well known problems in geometry, topology, representation theory and index theory of elliptic operators. These problems are the Baum-Connes conjecture in K-theory of group C*-algebras, the positive Ricci curvature conjecture in relation to the Dirac operator on a loop space and the problem of constructing a useful index theory of elliptic operators on infinite-dimensional manifolds. The Baum-Connes conjecture part of the project consists of two different problems: the Baum-Connes conjecture for discrete groups which act properly and affine-isometrically on Lp spaces and the Baum-Connes conjecture for discrete arithmetic groups. Concerning index theory on infinite-dimensional manifolds, some non-rigorous rudiments of it already exist in theoretical physics, but providing a solid basis for this theory will be another problem of the present project. The positive Ricci curvature conjecture is a well-known topological conjecture on the vanishing of the so called Witten genus. The main approach to it is by the use of index theory on infinite-dimensional manifolds. <br/><br/><br/>The development of quantum mechanics in the 20th century has led to the creation  of the theory of operators in Hilbert space and later to the creation of the theory of C*-algebras. The theory of C*-algebras is closely related with the contemporary field theory in physics, as well as with geometry, topology, group representation theory. Operator K-theory came to the C*-algebra theory from topology and grew out into a highly powerful tool. Nowadays, operator K-theory is part of the non-commutative geometry which is a synthesis of analysis and geometry with wide applications in many areas of mathematics and theoretical physics. The emphasis of the present project is on the applications of operator K-theory to several well known problems in topology, geometry, and infinite-dimensional analysis. For instance, constructing index theory in infinite dimensions, which is part of our project, will provide the basis for numerous applications in mathematics and theoretical physics. Operator K-theory methods will be the main tool for this research."

To mention just a few instances, they turn up in the following situations: as limits of smooth objects (spaces such as Riemannian manifolds, or smooth functions); as asymptotic ""spheres at infinity"" of finitely generated groups, objects that reflect the behavior of the groups at large scales; or in the fine-scale structure of sets, even in concrete and practical circumstances (irregular crystals, for instance, or other materials). The principal investigator studies questions that relate to singular objects and their geometry, and he does analysis on such objects. Specifically, he seeks to understand the extent to which the concepts of classical differential (first-order) analysis can be introduced into such spaces. For example, one would like to have a well-defined Sobolev space of weakly differentiable functions on certain singular spaces. It is also important to understand which potentially very singular spaces can be parametrized by ""nice"" spaces (say, by Euclidean spaces) via transformations that distort the basic metric structure only within fixed bounds. The principal investigator and his students are developing new tools for approaching this type of problem. Finally, the question of parametrization by a Euclidean space can be replaced with the requirement of embedability in some finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The methods that emerge from the project should clarify this problem as well.<br/><br/>The proposed research relates to applications in two ways. First, singularities (or impurities) occur everywhere in nature, from the local microstructure of materials to the large-scale features of the universe. Understanding and dealing with such singularities is one of the central objectives of modern mathematics and science. The principal investigator has made contributions to the solution of this problem in cases where the singularities can be analyzed and then transformed, with minimal cost, to better behaved models. Second, although not directly related to the project, there are potential applications of the research to theoretical computer science, where large and complex data sets need to be transformed and stored in simpler form. <br/>"

The Kakeya problem asks, loosely speaking, how small a set in Euclidean space can be if it contains a unit line segment in every direction. More precisely, one would like lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension, and it is conjectured that the lower bound should be the dimension of the Euclidean space. The conjecture has long been known true in the plane, but is much more difficult in higher dimensions and has inspired a great deal of work using techniques from fields ranging from harmonic analysis to commutative algebra to logic. In a paper with Laba and Tao, the author helped develop the connection of the Kakeya problem to sum-product theory. This is the theory of lower bounds on the sumset and product set of some finite subset of a field (or ring.) Sum product theory has been developing quickly over the past decade, and we now hope we know enough to come close to resolution in dimension 3, using some recent techniques of Bourgain, Konyagin, and others. In particular, we hope to show that the Assouad dimension of a Kakeya set in three dimensions is 3.<br/><br/>From the earliest part of our mathematical educations, we learn that addition and multiplication are two of the most important mathematical processes, and that they are widely applicable to a number of real world problems. Surprisingly, not everything about the way in which addition and multiplication are connected is completely understood. We have recently learned that in a certain sense, addition and multiplication do not go well together - if a set does not expand much under addition, it must expand under multiplication, and vice versa. This principle is expressed in a number of ""sum product"" theorems. Sum Product theory has led to a lot of excitement in the last few years. It has applications in the combinatorics and geometric measure theory, the parts of mathematics for which it was developed, as well as in theoretical computer science, where expanding sets are used to generate pseudo-randomness.  This project deals both with the basic theory of sums and products as well as with their deep mathematical applications. Continued work in this area is certain to lead to further applications."

The problems to be investigated include the analyticity of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations and the properties of the solutions of Vequa-type equations when the Cauchy-Riemann operator is replaced by more general complex vector fields.

Despite more than two centuries of mathematical analysis of these complicated nonlinear equations, the existence theory for these systems of hyperbolic moving free-boundary PDE, which model ideal compressible and incompressible fluid flow,  remains a significant challenge. This includes a single mass of fluid, gas, or liquid,  moving inside of a vacuum that creates degeneracy in the flow, as well as multiphase immiscible fluids separated by surfaces of discontinuity, across which velocity components experience jumps. Recently, the Principal Investigator of this project has been developing a novel set of analytical tools designed to establish  existence theories and well-posedness theorems for multidimensional moving free-boundary hyperbolic problems, wherein the geometry of the free-surface interacts with the motion of the fluid at leading order. These analytical tools apply to the 3-dimensional incompressible and compressible free-surface Euler equations with or without surface tension on the boundary, and coupled fluid-structure interaction problems.  The fundamental ideas rely on new anisotropic smoothing operators that permit approximations of the Euler equations that retain the geometric structures of transport and boundary regularity, and for which existence of smooth solutions is provable, and a new class of degenerate parabolic approximations to characteristic and degenerate hyperbolic systems of conservation laws.  The proposal addresses the well-posedness of the motion of a multidimensional compressible gas in the so-called physical vacuum singularity, modeled by the free-boundary compressible Euler equations with sound speed vanishing at the boundary at the rate of the square-root of the distance to vacuum; well-posedness of supersonic 2-D vortex sheets and surfaces of discontinuity; and well-posedness for the motion of a relativistic fluid in vacuum, modeled by the Euler-Einstein equations.<br/><br/>Multiphase fluid flows with moving interfaces, modeled by the Euler equations, play a central role in a multitude of physical and engineering applications, ranging from the creation of hurricanes due to wind blowing on top of the ocean surface to the atomization of liquid fuel jets in combustion chambers to the motion of astrophysical bodies such as gaseous stars. The analytical understanding gained in this work may  have important ramifications in the understanding of basic physical phenomena, which has hitherto been  poorly understood. In addition to basic wave motion and mixing that occurs in the motion of interfaces between water and air, other conventional examples include the interface between air and helium under shock wave interaction, the so-called Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities between two gases, the behavior of a gas bubble in a liquid in a shock wave, and liquid fuels that are usually burned by first atomizing a fuel jet to increase the surface area and hence the evaporation rate. We can also add the prediction of spray behavior, for which the initial atomization is both the most critical and the least understood aspect of the spray.  Understanding the short-time nonlinear balance that occurs in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability should be quite important for the understanding of jets, which become unstable when capillary effects are large due to waves longer than the diameter, thus breaking up into a stream of relatively large drops."

It would be perhaps impossible to have a single conference taking a look back at everything that has been done, to review current developments, and to peek into the future of the entire field. However, a look at complex analysis with a particular view towards the mathematics of David Drasin and Linda Sons covers many of the core areas and offers a reasonable foundation for taking stock of a substantial number of developments. The topics of the proposed Conference on Complex Analysis, to be held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May, 2010, will be value distribution, classical and p-harmonic potential theory, normal families, complex differential equations, and symmetrization methods.<br/><br/><br/>Broader impact. The Conference will bring together many of the significant contributors to the development of complex analysis in the last forty years.  It will thus provide perspective, both for the senior and junior participants, on the advances in recent times in the areas of focus of the Conference. With many younger mathematicians attending, both as speakers in the parallel sessions and as participants in informal discussions, the Conference should add to the vitality of the subject in the coming years. In fact, three of the main speakers received doctoral degrees less than five years ago. The organizers have been mindful that one effective way to contribute to the health of complex analysis in the future is to encourage greater participation among groups who in the past have not had representation in large numbers in the field. Accordingly, one of the two mathematicians whose work constitutes a theme of the Conference is a woman and women participants will deliver plenary talks as well as parallel session talks."

Their theory may now lead to solutions of previously inaccessible problems in other fields such as geometric group theory. The purpose of this project is to explore current trends in the area. Specific topics of research include quasi-symmetric uniformization, dynamics on fractal spheres, the quasi-conformal Jacobian problem, quasi-regular maps and elliptic manifolds.<br/><br/>The roots of this subject can be traced back to Gauss's work on cartography and surface geometry in the first half of the 19th century. He coined the phrase ``conformal map"" and derived equations that govern the theory of planar quasi-conformal mappings. The full importance of this theory was only realized about a century later.

The PI will study complex symmetric operators, a broad class of Hilbert space operators which, while encompassing many of the well-known and useful classes, has not been adequately studied in generality until recently. Loosely put, a Hilbert space operator is called complex symmetric if it has a symmetric matrix representation (over the complex field) with respect to some orthonormal basis. This surprisingly large class includes all normal operators, truncated Toeplitz operators (including Jordan model operators and finite Toeplitz matrices), Hankel operators, and many non-normal integral and differential operators (including the classical Volterra operator and certain auxiliary operators produced by the complex scaling method for Schrodinger operators).  The PI will examine these operators at the abstract level while also considering a number of specific questions that interface with function theory, matrix analysis, and other areas.  For instance, connections to complex analysis have already engaged a number of researchers from both large institutions and small colleges.  The PI will collaborate with colleagues old and new, as well as sponsor undergraduate research.<br/><br/>The emerging theory of complex symmetric operators has already proven fertile ground for undergraduate research.  Many questions stemming from the proposed project are suitable for undergraduate research and the PI will recruit students from diverse backgrounds to work on them. The PI also plans to take his undergraduate researchers to conferences related to this proposal.  The bene&#64257;ts for the students are many. For instance, they get to see mathematicians in their natural element, learn about cutting-edge research that is relevant to their own, interact with researchers in a social context, and speak candidly with graduate students ? something not available at an undergraduate institution.  As part of their sustained research experience, student researchers will present posters and/or give talks in venues appropriate for undergraduate research."

One is to help young researchers in the area of operator algebras broaden their acquaintance with the field. Another is to help acquaint them with senior researchers in operator algebra theory (among them possible future colleagues, mentors and collaborators). With these goals in mind, the ECOAS series places a heavy emphasis on attracting young researchers to the meetings and giving them opportunities to present their work and otherwise interact with established figures. In the conferences in the series so far, over half <br/>of the participants and a substantial number of the speakers have been students or postdoctoral fellows. The ECOAS meetings give all participants, senior and junior, the opportunity to learn first-hand the work of others. Because of the breadth of operator algebra theory, this is an important function. To ensure participants can acquaint themselves with work outside their immediate areas of specialization, the meetings are organized with no parallel sessions. To fit the meetings into a weekend format, to keep the quality of talks high, and to allow time for discussions, at most a dozen talks are scheduled per meeting. <br/><br/><br/>The meetings give young researchers the chance to meet senior researchers. The relatively modest scale of the meetings (compared to national or international meetings, for example) allows them to network with senior researchers and with one another, thereby helping foster future collaborations and providing the sort of exposure that is often crucial to a successful job search. Thus the conference plays an important role in helping young researchers establish themselves in the field.<br/> <br/>"

The metric spaces under consideration usually are not smooth, i.e., they look rugged on all scales and locations like the famous von Koch snowflake. In this case we say that such metric spaces are fractal. Another use of the term fractal in the literature is to refer to a space that has a certain self-similarity property, i.e., parts of it appear as the whole space. Often in the literature and in this project spaces that are fractal in both of these senses are considered. Quasisymmetries form an important class of metric deformations that is broad enough to ""straighten out"" some of the fractals and yet amenable to methods of analysis. The primary examples of spaces studied in the project are Ahlfors regular surfaces and Sierpinski carpets with metrics that do not necessarily come from the Euclidean or the spherical geometries. Such spaces arise in relation to the general parametrization problem and in particular to two major conjectures in geometric group theory, namely Cannon's and the Kapovich-Kleiner conjectures. While originally motivated by Thurston's geometrization program, Cannon's and the Kapovich-Kleiner conjectures do not follow from Perelman's solution of the Poincare and Geometrization conjectures and remain important open problems both in geometric group theory and in 3-manifold topology. <br/><br/>The tools used to attack the questions in the project originate in complex analysis. From the onset, complex analysis has provided means for solving problems that come from the natural sciences, engineering and other fields of mathematics. Recent examples include the investigations of the conformal invariance of continuum limits of two-dimensional lattice models in statistical physics and applications to quantum gravity. Many aspects of complex analysis have evolved to lead to various discrete counterparts and analysis on general metric spaces. Fractal spaces considered in the project arise in analysis as sets of fractional dimension, in dynamics as Julia sets, in the theory of Kleinian groups as limit sets, and in geometry as boundaries at infinity of Gromov hyperbolic groups, to mention a few examples. It is the hope of the investigator that the project would add new tools and ideas to the field of geometric analysis on metric spaces, in particular to the quasisymmetric parametrization problem, and would shed light on Cannon's and the Kapovich-Kleiner conjectures. He also hopes to generate interest to the ideas and results discussed in the project in the broader mathematical community and attract students to the field."

The water-wave problem with surface tension concerns the time evolution of the interface between two different fluids, which is naturally posed as an initial value PDE.  By formulating the problem in the right fashion, the evolution of the interface is governed by a quasi-linear dispersive equation weakly coupled to a nonlinear transport equation.  The water-wave projects outlined in this proposal focus on properties of solutions to this system that follow from the dispersion relation.  Specifically, solutions to the nonlinear water-wave problem with surface tension are, on average in time, smoother than the initial data. In addition, it will be interesting to study mixed space-time dispersive properties (Strichartz estimates), higher-order smoothing properties, and the long-time well-posedness of the initial value problem.  In addition to the water-wave problem, this project is concerned with spectral properties of the Laplacian on smooth manifolds: eigenfunction scarring in the compact case, and local smoothing for solutions to the Schroedinger equation in the noncompact case.  The common thread running through all of these projects is the extensive use of microlocal analysis, the rough idea of which is to localize solutions of equations in space and in frequency (to the extent allowed by the uncertainty principle), after which these solutions are simpler to understand.<br/><br/>Dispersive equations and equations on curved spaces (manifolds) provide a rich area of interaction between various branches of mathematics as well as between different sciences.  The work on the water-wave problem, a problem coming from mathematical hydrodynamics, represents a cross-disciplinary collaboration between pure math, applied math, and physics.  The major goal of the project is to provide mathematical statements of physically intuitive ideas, such as ""surface tension is a regularizing effect.""  The study of equations on curved spaces is of interest to geometers, analysts, and number theorists in mathematics, as well as to theoretical physicists working in quantum chaos and general relativity."

All the equations considered in the project have a physical origins: the Schrodinger maps equation is known as the Heisenberg model in ferro-magnetism, the spin-models have a similar origin, while the Zakharov system comes from plasma physics. From a mathematical point of view, most of the problems the principal investigator intends to address lie at the cutting-edge of research in partial differential equations. The dynamics of various equations with large data is a very important problem in the field. Some major breakthroughs have been achieved during the past few years, and the analysis involved is highly nontrivial. Understating the impact of the geometry of the target manifold on the evolution of the equation (in the case of Schrodinger maps and spin-models) is of great interest. Research into systems that lack scaling (like the Zakharov system) is extremely challenging, especially in the absence of usable conservation laws. While, strictly speaking, the problems to be explored in this project belong to the field of partial differential equations, the research requires the use of fine tools from other areas of mathematics, notably harmonic analysis and Riemannian geometry.<br/><br/><br/>One of the main reasons that mathematics is useful to the broad scientific community, and in turn to society as a whole, is that it provides one of the most rigorous frameworks for constructing theories that explain the world around us and predict future events. The field of partial differential equations is, to a great extent, the study of models arising from physics. Everyone is aware of the existence of light, heat, fluid flow, magnetism, etc. These are all natural phenomena that, once they are well understood, can lead to major discoveries whose impact on human lives is tremendous. A scientific approach to the study of a natural phenomenon follows a standard pattern. One investigates the complexity of the phenomenon, determines its essential features, and writes down a differential equation that describes the evolution in time of the object under study. Next, one studies the long-time behavior of the mathematical model and describes its evolution in qualitative terms. (In the event that this process identifies potential singularities, a prime interest of the principal investigator, then the phenomenon becomes directly relevant to the current project.) Finally, if the mathematical analysis agrees with the empirical observation of the phenomenon, then the mathematical model is validated, which often opens a wide range of possible applications. On the other hand, if discrepancies arise between the mathematics and the empirical observations, then one seeks to refine the mathematical model, usually by allowing for greater complexity. The new model undergoes a similar mathematical analysis and so on, until a good mathematical model matching the physical reality is found."

The focus is on the regularity of solutions of equations whose diffusion is nonlocal, such as equations involving the fractional Laplacian. These equations arise, in particular, from models involving discontinuous stochastic processes. One important problem is to understand the equations arising from stochastic control problems and stochastic games involving discontinuous Levy processes. These equations are the fractional-order version of fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations. The analysis of the regularity of integro-differential equations is not only interesting because it extends the theory of regularity of second-order partial differential equations, but also because it gives us a extra insight into what causes the regularization in elliptic and parabolic problems. Another mathematically interesting feature is that, since fractional diffusion has scaling properties different from those for second-order diffusion, the interplay between the first-order terms of the equation and the diffusion can become nontrivial at small scales. The principal investigator will study equations with advection and fractional diffusion, with an emphasis on the critical and supercritical regimes. Examples of this type of equations are the critical and supercritical quasi-geostrophic equation and the Burgers equation with fractional diffusion.<br/><br/>The nonlocal equations presented in this project arise from models in engineering, finance and physics that involve long-range interactions. The most common situation in which this happens occurs in models involving discontinuous stochastic processes. For example, the price of a stock can suddenly jump from a value to a very different one. It has been suggested that it may be better to model stock prices with so-called discontinuous Levy processes than with diffusions. In that case, the equation involved in computing the value of an American option would be an obstacle problem for an integro-differential equation. Other nonlinear integro-differential equations arise from stochastic games, or from the physical phenomena known as anomalous diffusion. Nonlocal equations are also obtained from deterministic models. For example if one assumes that temperature is diffused quickly through the atmosphere, then this phenomenon creates a nonlocal diffusion effect on the surface of the earth."

In order to determine such frequencies, a detailed analysis of the wave packets and their interaction will be carried out.  This will include a study of multilinear operators a la Coifman-Meyer, as well as operators with flag singularities.  The project also incorporates the study of singular limits of modulated waves into the research.  We anticipate that the limiting behavior will be determined by space-time resonant waves.

The development of the space-time resonance method is a cornerstone of such an endeavor.  It will bring together different areas of mathematics and applied mathematics (harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, dynamical systems, fluid dynamics, vortex dynamics), where new tools will be developed.

All the problems under consideration are asymptotic in nature in the sense that the problems depend on a large parameter, such as time or space, or a small parameter, such as perturbation strength. The main issue is to determine the behavior of the systems when the parameter(s) go to infinity, or to zero, respectively. It turns out that<br/>the problems under consideration have a Riemann-Hilbert representation which provides a non-commutative analog, for these problems, of the integral representations of the classical special functions, such as the Bessel functions or the Airy function, etc. And just as the classical special functions can be analyzed asymptotically by the steepest-descent/stationary phase method, so too the Riemann-Hilbert problems can be analyzed <br/>by the non-linear steepest-descent method introduced by the PI and X.Zhou in 1993. Amongst the problems to be considered by the PI and his collaborators are: spiral asymptotics for the modes of lasers with rectangular plane-parallel reflecting surfaces, as the Fresnel number goes to infinity; asymptotics for the Emptiness Formation Probability of the XY spin-1/2 chain, as the anisotropy and field strength vary; perturbation theory of infinite dimensional integrable systems such as the perturbed Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation, in the focusing case when solitons are present. In addition the PI will consider problems in random matrix theory and in the asymptotics of Toeplitz and Hankel determinants. <br/><br/>It is a remarkable, and unanticipated, fact that a great variety of problems in mathematics, <br/>applied mathematics and physics can be rephrased as Riemann-Hilbert problems. This makes it possible to analyze their behavior with the same efficiency and accuracy as the classical problems, such as electricity and magnetism, of the 19th century. In particular, various random matrix ensembles can be analyzed by Riemann-Hilbert methods. Random matrices in themselves provide models for an extraordinary range of problems, from the scattering of neutrons off heavy nuclei, to the zeros of the Riemann-zeta function on the critical line.  In transportation theory, for example, the PI and his collaborators recently <br/>showed how the bus system in Cuernevaca, Mexico,  could be described by random matrix theory: this bus system has special features and is used in many parts of Latin America. The list of problems that can be modeled by random matrix theory includes combinatorics, multivariate statistics, condition numbers in numerical analysis, tiling problems, interacting particle systems , quantum transport problems and wireless communication, amongst many others.  The PI and his collaborators are also involved in writing various texts on Riemann-Hilbert methods and also on random matrix theory that should be accessible to researchers across the scientific spectrum."

One then studies the correlation of spacing of m-tuples of eigenvalues, especially when m is fixed, and the size n of the matrix approaches infinity. The conjectured limit, which in the bulk of the spectrum involves the sinc kernel, is called a universality limit, because it is independent of the point and the underlying measure. One main goal is to prove this universality in the bulk under minimal conditions on the underlying distribution, using new techniques developed by the investigator. Another more challenging goal involves analogous questions at the endpoints of the spectrum, or at points inside the spectrum, where the underlying distribution exhibits irregularities.<br/><br/>Universality limits first rose to prominence in the work of the physicist Eugene Wigner. He was trying to model scattering of neutrons off heavy nuclei. Because of the large number of interactions, it seemed natural to try a probabilistic model. Remarkably, eigenvalues of random Hermitian matrices turned out to be an appropriate setting, and orthogonal polynomials were a key tool in the analysis. Subsequently random matrices have been connected with number theory, and the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, and also with other topics. The project's outcomes should also be of interest in other disciplines where random matrices arise. It is also hoped that graduate and undergraduate students will become involved in the research."

Quasiconformal maps have played a pivotal role in the development of classical function theory. Quasisymmetric maps have recently found important applications in geometric group theory, structure of manifolds and analysis on fractals. However a large number of fundamental questions remain: quasisymmetric parametrization of metric spaces by Euclidean spaces; extension of quasisymmetric maps to an ambient space; factorization of quasiconformal maps into maps of small dilatation. Extension and smoothing are simpler when the dilatation is small; a manifold carrying a quasiconformal structure of small dilatation is smoothable; if a quasiconformal map can be factored into maps of small dilatation, then the factors can be extended,then smoothed. The PI proposes to study this circle of problems. Classical geometric topology is rich with examples of spaces which were proved homeomorphic to Euclidean spaces only with great ingenuity, e.g., the double suspension of homology 3-spheres and certain decomposition spaces. This project deals with quasisymmetric parametrization of such spaces, which resemble the Euclidean spaces not only topologically, but also geometrically and measure-theoretically. The findings will lead to a better understanding of the general theory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Quasiconformal and quasisymmetric maps have been studied for their mathematical beauty as well as potential scientific applications to objects lacking a smooth structure that occur naturally in physics and biology. Recently, there have been exciting discoveries in applying quasiconformal mappings to study images of brain cortical surfaces, to determine the conductivity of a body, and to study percolation and crystal growth.  This proposal deals with intrinsic properties of these mappings at the interface of geometric function theory and classical geometric topology.

The Corona Problem can be phrased as a question about left invertibility of matrices in particular algebras of analytic functions.  Additionally, it has formulations in the areas of operator theory, complex differential geometry, functional analysis, and commutative algebra.  The Corona Problem has served as an impetus for research in four main areas of analysis: complex analysis, function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory. Additionally, it arises in real-world applications through the use of control theory to engineering questions. This research program utilizes knowledge and techniques from these broad areas of analysis to provide an array of tools with which to approach the challenging questions raised in this project.  The proposed research is based on recent, significant contributions made by the principal investigatorr and focuses on key questions connected to the Corona Problem.  In particular, the principal investigator will address questions that relate the Corona Problem to complex differential geometry via the curvature of canonical vector bundles associated with the problem.  The Corona Problem will additionally be studied for more general multiplier algebras of analytic functions.  Finally, the connection with the Corona Problem and control theory will be explored via the computation of the stable rank of rings of analytic functions.  <br/><br/>The project's educational component creates a novel ""Internet Analysis Seminar"" that provides a forum for researchers in these areas to interact and learn from one another, both academically and professionally.

The first is a continuation of the applicant's collaboration with Arcozzi (Bologna), Sawyer (Hamilton), and Wick (Atlanta). This group is working on specific problems in the operator theoretic function theory of spaces of holomorphic functions which are subspaces of potential spaces. The classical Dirichlet space is a fundamental example; the Drury-Arveson-Hardy space is perhaps the most important example. The questions are similar to the questions classically considered for subspaces of Lebesgue spaces; questions about interpolation, zero sets, multiplier algebras, coronas, etc. However the techniques required are quite different, involving capacity theory and involving use of discrete models for both the space of holomorphic functions and the containing potential space. The work on a second set of problems is work in collaboration with Xiang Tang (St. Louis) trying to understand the various roles of the Rankin-Cohen brackets. The brackets are constant coefficient bidifferential operators whose coefficients are combinatorial numbers. These operators arise naturally in a wide range of settings. Some of the structural reasons for their ubiquity are now understood, but the occurrence of the brackets in certain contexts of particular interest to the applicant is poorly understood. A goal of the proposed research is to improve that situation.<br/><br/>In the 1970s and 1980s there were profound mathematical advances at the interface of commutative harmonic analysis and function theory. The research was driven by a desire to see how several very productive, but seemingly very different, viewpoints could be used together to get a deeper understanding of transformation rules for waveforms.  The successful unification of the viewpoints allowed resolution of long standing mathematical questions. The improved insight also led to fundamental innovations in data analysis and signal processing; using wavelets for image compression was an early success and by now the descendents of these ideas are a standard part of the toolkit of many computer scientist and electrical engineers. The theoretical tools and insights developed during that time also brought the questions in this proposal within reach. The specific questions being considered are of direct mathematical interest. The analytical tools being developed to work on the questions will, again, broaden and deepen the understanding of how waveforms can be analyzed and manipulated. The questions about the Rankin-Cohen brackets are of a different sort. When very complicated and very elegant expressions arise in several seemingly unrelated contexts there is, for many mathematicians, a compelling aesthetic imperative to find the underlying reason. There is a great tradition of working on such questions and although the answers are often mundane, sometimes they are quite profound."

The existence of exact solutions to the equations governing such growth dynamics, their complete integrability, at least in the case of a flat metric, and the impressive amount of converging recent research on these topics make the project timely and unavoidable. As mathematical tools, the proposal will rely on and develop new facets of complex orthogonal polynomials, moment matrices and potential theoretic operators arising in the study of planar or spatial shapes. Particular emphasis will be put on the maximum entropy method for recovery of shade functions from indirect measurements, such as partial geometric tomographic data and the asymptotics of the spectra of random non-hermitian matrices.<br/><br/><br/>Following a decade of intense and vibrant discoveries in fluid mechanics and quantum physics, the present proposal addresses a series of mathematical questions of high interest for these specific areas of modern science. The tradition of encoding planar shapes and the geometry of volumes into numbers or algebraic symbols goes back to the XVII-century landmark contributions of Rene Descartes and his followers in what is today called ?analytic geometry?. Much later development and applications of electricity, magnetism and atomic science we all benefit today was possible by a second major step into the same direction, that is the representation of complex physical entities as large arrays of numbers or symbols called matrices. The proposed project focuses on the study of matrix models arising in the current research of moving interfaces of fluids or more sophisticated but similar media. Such moving boundaries phenomena are illustrated by cancer growth, crystal formation, ice melting, oil reserves, carbon monoxide sequestration and plasma dynamics.

The central theme in our investigations of the Coulomb gas is to develop the theory for arbitrary values of the inverse temperature, as opposed to the three special values, namely, 1, 2, and 4.  In particular, we wish to show that there is no phase transition.  A second goal is to better understand the empirically observed occurrence of random matrix statistics in manifestly deterministic scenarios, by first considering models with very little randomness. The second part of the project concerns well-posedness questions for the nonlinear Schrodinger equations at critical regularity.  Our primary goal is to complete the picture in those cases where the critical regularity corresponds to a coercive conservation law, specifically, the energy- and mass-critical equations. We will further attempt to make some initial inroads into the case of non-conserved critical regularity in a particular case where this seems most feasible. <br/><br/>The theory of random matrices is driven by empirical data as surely as any physical science:  Its roots lie in statistical analysis (specifically, ANOVA) and the analysis of experimental energy-level data.  More recently, random matrix statistics have been observed in the vibrations of drums and the behaviour of the prime numbers. The researches of this project are aimed at helping to elucidate and explain the results of these truly mathematical experiments. Although the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is used as a simple effective model for several physical phenomena, the goal of this project is to further our understanding of the long-time behaviour of solutions to this equation principally as a model for general dispersive evolution equations.  By choosing to work with (scaling-)critical initial data, we place ourselves precisely at the border between the well-studied subcritical regime and the terra incognita of supercritical equations.  As an example of how developments of such simplified equations has fed into more physical models, we note one past off-shoot of the theory of dispersive equations at critical regularity: we now know that the well-posedness of the equations of fluid flow (as opposed to the spontaneous generation of extremely turbulent behaviour) is something that can be rigorously verified by computer for any prescribed size of initial data."

The unifying theme is the systematic search of some basic monotonicity properties of the solutions of the problem at hand. Such properties play a special role in analysis and geometry and often lead to a remarkable insight in the nature of the relevant equations. One of the main directions in this proposal is a new notion of curvature in sub-Riemannian geometry. It represents a generalization of the Ricci curvature tensor from Riemannian geometry. Combining new Bochner identities with the monotonicity of some entropy-like functionals, for manifolds for which such generalized Ricci tensor is nonnegative one is led to a priori gradient bounds of Li-Yau type, Harnack inequalities, Gaussian upper bounds, isoperimetric inequalities, and a sub-Riemannian Bonnet-Myers compactness theorem in the strictly positive case. In another direction the proposal aims at furthering   the present knowledge of minimal surfaces in sub-Riemannian geometry with particular emphasis on the sub-Riemannian Bernstein problem. The PI and his co-authors have recently solved this problem in the first (three-dimensional) Heisenberg group. The proposed research revolves around the analysis of the higher dimensional problem as well as the study of new monotonicity properties of the relevant area functionals. In yet another direction the proposal is concerned with the study of some new monotonicity properties of solutions of variational inequalities of elliptic and parabolic type with an obstacle confined to lie in alower dimensional manifold. Such monotonicity formulas are then applied to the study of the regularity of the relevant free boundary problems.<br/><br/>This proposal can be placed at the confluence of two major areas of research in mathematics known as partial differential equations and Riemannian geometry. Partial differential equations are relations between an unknown function and a certain number of its derivatives. They govern the observable phenomena of the physical world. Riemannian geometry provides with a framework which is necessary to understand what happens when we are confronted with phenomena which fall outside the classical mechanics of Newton and Galilei. For instance, in Einstein?s theory of relativity the description of the curved space-time requires the use of Riemannian manifolds, with their intrinsic geometry. The past decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in a far reaching generalization of Riemannian geometry, as well as in the relevant partial differential equations which are needed to describe the new phenomena which arise in this area. Since this proposal is at the forefront of some of these developments it has the potential to impact those areas of mathematics and of the applied sciences (robotics, mechanical engineering, neuroscience) which are at the origin of these advances. In view of the extensive involvement and training of doctoral students and post-doctoral advisee, and the systematic dissemination of the relevant research through seminars, lectures, conferences, publications and websites, this proposal presents a strong component of human resources development."

The unit disc is the quintessential example of a double quadrature domain,i.e., a quadrature domain both with respect to area measure and boundary arc length.  Professor Bell and his collaborators have been working on an improvement to the Riemann mapping theorem which replaces the unit disc by a double quadrature domain which, rather than being far away like the unit disc, is close to the original domain.  Bell has proved that many of the classical objects of potential theory associated to a double quadrature domain are elementary functions which are simple combination of the coordinate variable and the algebraic Schwarz function, and consequently may be easily computed.  Thus, it becomes possible to make minor, but subtle, alterations in a region to make it have many of the desirable properties of the unit disc.  This approach has the virtue of being potentially applicable even in the multiply connected and Riemann surface setting, where the Riemann mapping theorem is unavailable.<br/><br/>The objects of potential theory and conformal mapping are pervasive in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. Although these objects are well studied, they continue to be a source of exciting and potentially applicable new mathematics.  Professor Bell will express the classical objects of potential theory associated to a two dimensional surface with holes in terms of simple and computable analytic objects.  These results may give rise to new and practical methods for expressing and zipping the solutions to classical problems in differential equations, conformal mapping, and potential theory. Because humans best perceive higher dimensional objects by taking a series of two dimensional slices, the tools developed could find important applications.  Some of the key ideas behind this program grew out of a summer undergraduate research project that Bell directed in 2008, and a noteworthy component of the project is a significant commitment to mentoring and training undergraduates and graduate students involved for a career in mathematics."

The development of noncommutative Choquet boundary has application in operator theory.  The study of metric geometry will provide a concrete mathematical foundation for certain statements in the theoretical high-energy physics literature."

In several such instances it is necessary to describe limiting distributions of sequences of translates of smooth measures on submanifolds of homogeneous spaces. Building up further from his earlier work on some typical cases, the principal investigator seeks in this project to develop new techniques in homogeneous dynamics to provide very general natural conditions on the manifolds and translating elements that lead to equidistribution of the limit measures. The work should lead to resolutions of some questions on metric properties of Diophantine approximation, counting integral and rational points on group varieties, and counting points on orbits of geometrically finite groups associated with certain geometric configurations.<br/>  <br/>From a broader perspective, the research will apply the concepts and methods of ergodic theory and dynamical systems about the long-time behavior of a generic particle in a flow, which is originally a physical problem, to answer questions about deep properties of whole numbers. This conceptual bridge between two very different disciplines uses and influences other areas like representation theory, analysis, and differential geometry, not to mention physics."

Lack of dynamical diversity (local rigidity) among small perturbations of a group action is a rare phenomenon and is typically connected to other rigidity phenomena that have been discovered in the past two decades. It happens that some form of infinitesimal (or cohomological) rigidity may lead to local rigidity. In the realm of classical dynamical systems this was proved for Diophantine circle rotations in the 1960s and led to the KAM Theorem. This project is concerned with a general approach to describe local structure based on the cohomological data, even in the absence of cohomological rigidity. The project includes applications to several situations of interest where cohomology is not trivial but is well understood, and to situations where cohomology is simple but there is not enough analytical precision in its description.<br/><br/>Understanding small perturbations of dynamical systems has always been one of the imperatives of science, given the fact that complete prediction of system behavior over time can typically be carried out only for mathematically simple systems. The solar system is one example of a natural system that is a small perturbation of a simple system. In this case, a celebrated mathematical theorem (the KAM Theorem, from which the current project draws its inspiration) sheds light on the stability of the system. Group actions, the focal subject of this project, can be viewed as dynamical systems with ""multidimensional time,"" and many systems in biology (neural networks), computer science (multidimensional data storage media), and physics (quasi-crystals) can be modeled more efficiently by mathematical systems that allow for multidimensional time than by classical systems in which time is one-dimensional. This brings about the need to understand small perturbations of such systems. On the other hand, rigidity of local structure is often just one manifestation of a system that is rigid in the large. Others, including rigidity of so-called invariant measures for certain systems with multidimensional time, are closely connected to important problems in number theory."

A parallel, but closely related development is building a unified weighted theory of important dyadic operators: maximal functions, square functions, and martingale transforms. What unites all parts of the project is how each problem gives rise to a series of correctly scaling integral estimates. The techniques proposed to obtain those estimates mix the classical arsenal with the Bellman function method. The latter technique, given an especially prominent role in the project, combines optimal control, calculus of variations, non-linear partial differential equations, and differential geometry to establish sharp inequalities.<br/><br/>Two aspects of the project are equally important: solving major open problems and method development. Since the open questions being addressed have proved resistant to attack by traditional theoretical tools, the emphasis is on novel methods that connect several areas of modern mathematics and also borrow from related fields, such as control theory. Each question considered thus has several dimensions: analytical, partial-differential, and geometrical. The structure of the project is incremental and each new partial result should enhance our understanding of the deep connections among these areas. It is expected that the methodology employed will yield a large body of teachable cutting-edge material, some of which may soon be entering graduate curricula and helping bring new researchers into the field."

In the context of the Fourier transform on Euclidean space or the flat torus, topics such as restriction theorems, Strichartz estimates (space-time integrability estimates for wave and Schroedinger equations), and local smoothing inequalities have been subjects of great interest for quite some time. However, many questions remain on how these theories should play out on a bounded or exterior domain. Here it may be appropriate to think of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, and replace restriction theorems for the torus with integrability estimates on clusters of eigenfunctions. In this regard, the PI intends to explore estimates on the restriction of these clusters to curves in the domain. In the case of Strichartz estimates, the PI and his collaborators are using a parametrix-based approach to obtain results for general domains.  Further improvement is expected in certain contexts by making use of a relatively new family of local smoothing estimates.<br/><br/>Fourier analysis continues to be a significant factor in the development of both mathematical and physical theories. In particular, it strengthens our understanding of the partial differential equations that arise in mathematical physics. The research pursued here expects  to have several applications to the study of wave phenomena and the equations which model it. These investigations should yield insight on how the presence of a hard boundary surface influences the development of waves, a subject of great scientific interest."

In collaboration with Kari Vilonen, Schmid shall apply M. Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to the study of irreducible unitary representations; the objective is to derive criteria for unitarity. Schmid will continue his collaboration with Steve Miller. They will prove the regularity of L-functions, and derive functional equations, from the point of view of automorphic distributions, in cases that are inaccessible by other methods. Classical Fourier analysis is an absolutely fundamental tool for the study of functions of one or several real variables. In the 20th century, Fourier analysis was extended to abelian groups, compact groups, and finally to non-compact, non-abelian groups. Irreducible unitary representations constitute the basic building blocks of Fourier analysis. Although Harish-Chandra constructed enough irreducible unitary representations carry out Fourier analysis on reductive Lie groups, all irreducible unitary representations are necessary for Fourier analysis on quotient spaces of reductive Lie groups. Many partial results exist, but they do not fit into a coherent, general picture. Schmid and Vilonen recently formulated a far-reaching conjecture on the unitarity problem. Their aim is to verify the conjecture and to explore its various implications. Riemann's zeta function encodes deep properties of prime numbers, and Dirichlet L-functions do the same for primes in abelian extensions of the rational numbers. These functions are regular, except for certain well understood poles, have Euler products, and satisfy functional equations. Conjecturally Langlands L-functions play an analogous role for general number fields. They are defined in terms of Euler products, but their analytic properties are not obvious from the de¯nition. Functional equations and regularity have been established in important special cases. Miller and Schmid expect their method to apply in several new cases, and also to simplify some existing arguments significantly. <br/><br/>Irreducible unitary representations of reductive groups play an important role in the Langlands program and other areas of number theory. The mathematical physics literature abounds with examples of irreducible unitary representation having various special properties. A more systematic approach to the classification of unitary representations would help to unify this aspect of mathematical physics. Vogan and his collaborators are working on a computer algorithm which would determine whether any specified representation is unitarizable. For some groups, for example E8, such an algorithm will severely strain existing computing facilities. The conjecture of Schmid and Vilonen has a direct bearing on this massive computational problem, by allowing to cut down signi¯cantly on the number of cases that need to be checked. L-functions occupy a central place in algebraic and analytic number theory, and are now <br/>of interest also to cryptographers. This makes significant new results about L-functions useful to a large group of mathematicians, well beyond the community of experts on L-functions."

The other part applies the Bellman function method to computing the operator norms of the maximal function on Lebesgue spaces in non-martingale settings, the Riesz transforms on the space BMO, and the generalized Beurling-Ahlfors transform on differential forms; in addition, an extension of earlier sharp results for the John-Nirenberg inequality is studied.<br/><br/>Among the practical areas that may be directly affected by the project are the fields of image and signal processing, including applications to medical tomography. The successful completion of this research should lead to improved methods for accumulation, transmission, and representation of various types of data. Studying the regularity properties of solutions of partial differential equations (PDE) is a fundamental step on the way to using those PDE to describe physical phenomena; such use is widespread and necessary in physics, chemistry, biology, material science, etc. In turn, the computation of norms of important operators, such as the Riesz transforms, allows one to estimate the size of solutions of various PDE.  The Bellman function method itself links such computation to the existence of positive solutions to certain differential equations. On the other hand, the theoretical synergy, which is at the heart of the project, will result in the development of novel powerful techniques, affecting applied as well as pure aspects of Fourier analysis. Another important impact of this research is on education: the results, diverse and far-reaching, will be presented in courses and seminars on different levels, from advanced undergraduate to the doctoral."

Work on this analytic machinery will aim at preparing it for use in operator-valued free probability and its applications to operator algebras, random multimatrix systems and some of the problems arising in connection with the analogue of entropy. Another theme will be the continuing phenomenon of new extensions of free probability parallling classical situations, like free extreme values and connections to free quantum groups.<br/><br/>Free probability theory is a noncommutative probability framework, where independence is modelled on free products instead of tensor products, which makes it suitable for dealing with variables with the highest degree of noncommutativity.  The free analogue of the Riemann sphere in the proposal aims at giving to  a basic complex analysis object the same highest degree of noncommutativity to be adapted to uses in free probability. In free probability theory the role of the Gauss law is held by the Wigner semicircle law and the framework is particularly well suited for dealing with the asymptotics of systems of random matrices as their size increases. Via random matrices free probability has applications to multi-user telecommunication systems in engineering and to certain mathematical models in physics."

These models involve nonlinear partial differential equations such as reaction-diffusion equations, which may be coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics.  The proposed research aims at improving our understanding of the effects of fluid motion on combustion and has two main goals.  The first is a continuation of current work on passive combustion in periodic media as well as development of new techniques applicable to general disordered media.  The questions to be addressed include the effect of geometric properties of periodic flows on speed-up of propagation of reaction as well as the phenomenon of quenching.  We will also investigate propagation of reaction in disordered media, in particular, the existence of traveling front solutions and asymptotic approach of arbitrary solutions to these special ones.  The second main goal is the study of active combustion with direct feedback of reaction on the fluid motion via the buoyancy force.  Models incorporating such feedback, particularly relevant in highly turbulent combustion regimes, involve reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid dynamics equations and are inherently very complex.  We will focus our efforts on the existence and stability of traveling fronts, bounds on the speed of propagation of reaction, and gravity-induced mixing.  In addition, we intend to apply the developed techniques to the study of phase transitions in a related model of liquid suspensions. <br/><br/>The problems addressed by the project involve rich and subtle mathematics but also have an interdisciplinary character.  Reaction processes such as burning in internal combustion engines, nuclear reactions in stars, forest fires, and production of ozone in the atmosphere are ubiquitous in nature, science, and engineering.  Motion of the underlying liquid or gaseous medium often plays a crucial role by either speeding up reaction or quenching it.  The proposed research aims at a better mathematical understanding of the effects of various properties of the resulting turbulent flows on reactive processes.  It is relevant to branches of science such as astrophysics, biology, environmental science, and chemical engineering, and may provide useful qualitative insights in real life phenomena.

The various topics cited above have widely differing structures but are unified by reason of being accessible to either variational, maximum principle and/or energy methods, although usually in certain singular limits. <br/><br/>Vast research experience has shown that simple-looking nonlinear partial differential equations, with mathematically natural structures, appear and reappear in the  pure and applied sciences. In particular, most of the fundamental equations of the physical and engineering sciences are partial differential equations, of which the most difficult, and arguably most important, are nonlinear. So-called perturbation techniques can handle various ""close-to-linear"" equations, but there remains the real necessity of discovering general principles and methods for various important nonlinear equations in the large. Understanding the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions, and ascertaining as well their behavior, are fundamental mathematical tasks that should have  practical implications in view of the various interpretations of these equations. The particular equations singled out for study in the project are all natural in their structures, and consequently can be expected to arise in various applications. For instance, the nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi equation is the basic equation for two-person, zero-sum differential games, so understanding the singular structure of its solutions helps directly in the design of optimal strategies.  The proposed extension of partial differential equations methods to the nonstandard stochastic optimal control problems should likewise be fundamental in framing optimality conditions."

The PI, in work with W. Kirwin, has developed a new method of understanding certain so-called adapted complex structures on a Riemannian manifold, using the imaginary-time geodesic flow and expects to construct a new class of complex structures by introducing a magnetic term into the geodesic flow. Another part of this project includes a return to an earlier part of the PI's research, namely the study of holomorphic function spaces over infinite-dimensional groups.  The current goal is to develop a better understanding of various basic constructs in the subject where even finding the proper definitions is extremely difficult. The techniques the PI is developing are expected to contribute to quantum physics, especially to the fundamental subject of quantum field theory. Field theories are systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, and quantization of such theories is notoriously difficult.  The holomorphic approach to quantization has proved fruitful already in the finite-dimensional setting, and it has certain advantages with respect to the infinite-dimensional limit. In particular, infinite-dimensional groups show up often in quantum field theory, so the PIs work on such groups is not far from applications.<br/><br/>The PI's work in quantum theory has led him to start writing a book on quantum <br/> mechanics. The goal of this book is to make quantum mechanics accessible<br/>to an audience of mathematicians. This book will fill in the necessary background from classical mechanics and then explain quantum mechanics using notation that is familiar to mathematicians, and showing respect for the significant technical mathematical issues that are glossed over in the physics literature. The goal, however, is not to emphasize the mathematical technicalities, but rather to explain the main ideas of quantum theory in language that mathematicians feel comfortable with. The PI hopes that this book will contribute to the long and mutually beneficial interaction between quantum physics and mathematics. The PI will continue to write additional expository articles as well as research articles and will teach a graduate course using the materials being developed for the book."

About fifteen years ago, Carleson's techniques were used to establish estimates for the bilinear Hilbert transform which initiated a rapid development of time-frequency analysis. The research of this project elaborates on important aspects of this theory in small dimensions greater than one with relevance to other areas of analysis. The bilinear Hilbert transform in two dimensions relates to a long standing open problem in ergodic theory about almost everywhere convergence of ergodic averages for two commuting transformations. Time-frequency analysis in two dimensions is also relevant to twin conjectures by Stein and Zygmund on Hilbert transform and differentiation along vector fields in two dimensions. Finally, a non-linear variant of Fourier analysis on low dimensional Lie groups, which relates to many branches of mathematics such as scattering theory, gives rise to interesting fundmental questions. Some of them are nonlinear variants of time frequency analysis in small dimensions. <br/><br/><br/>The research of this project has several connections to mathematical physics, which may lead to applications. It studies the mathematical foundations of scattering of particles along long range potentials. It also studies the foundations of analysis along vector fields, which present the mathematical framework of fluid dynamics. Some of the analysis of this project in two dimensions may be interpreted as a particular interplay of two random processes, such as can be found in financial mathematics. This project will help continue an active research and training group in harmonic analysis at UCLA, that has attracted a number of excellent young mathematicians and has helped maintain the workforce in mathematics. A further educational component of this project is to continue a series of very successful summer schools for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in analysis from different universities."

Some of the motivating problems for his work will be the abundance conjecture in complex algebraic geometry, the construction of rational curves in Fano manifolds by singularity-magnifying complex Monge-Ampere equations, the Green-Griffiths conjecture concerning entire holomorphic curves in manifolds of general type, the second main theorem of value distribution theory for moduli spaces of canonically polarized manifolds, the deformational invariance of plurigenera for compact Kaehler manifolds, the global nondeformability of irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric manifolds, and general regularity questions of the complex Neumann problem.  The recent transcendental methods involve techniques of multiplier ideal sheaves which, in one direction, has already led to the solution of a number of longstanding open problems in complex algebraic geometry such as the deformational invariance of plurigenera for algebraic manifolds and the finite generation of canonical rings, and in the other direction, opened up a new way of applying algebraic-geometry methods to partial differential equations and settled some regularity questions of the complex Neumann problem.<br/><br/>The proposed research is in the interface of algebraic geometry and analysis.  Such an interface has been bringing about a high level of cross-fertilization of both fields.    Experts in one field have been investigating and applying the methods of the other.  This has led to the solution of some longstanding open problems which have been inaccessible to the techniques of only one field.  On the one side of the interface, algebraic geometry studies algebraic structures, their classifications and relations.  Analytic methods make it possible to construct and work with algebraic objects in algebraic-geometry problems by using limits, estimates, and optimization techniques of analysis.   On the other side of the interface, analysis deals with partial differential equations and estimates.   Some of the recent techniques in the interface involve multiplier ideal sheaves.   Multiplier ideal sheaves identify the location and the order of failure of estimates in analysis and make it possible to formulate global conditions for the solvability and regularity of partial differential equations by using algebraic techniques.   Besides opening up a new algebraic approach to problems in analysis, they provide powerful new tools useful for the investigation of partial differential equations from global problems posed by any scientific field. The PI will continue work with graduate students and junior researchers."

The first part of the project involves the development of combinatorial models for semisimple flows that generalize the symbolic description of the geodesic flow on the modular surface given by continued fractions. These models will provide important tools for addressing several open problems in Diophantine approximation, including the famous Littlewood Conjecture, Schmidt's Conjecture (on successive minima of a lattice), and determining the Hausdorff dimension of the set of singular vectors. This part of the project may also involve some numerical studies. The second part of the project focuses on problems related to the ergodic theory of rational billiards. One objective will be to test the validity of the conjectural picture that every nonergodic Teichmuller geodesic arises from a Masur-Smillie-type construction.  Another objective is to understand how the Hausdorff dimension of the set of nonergodic directions depends on the Diophantine properties of the underlying translation surface or rational billiard. The theme unifying the two components of the project is the technique of extracting useful information from the evolution of a discrete subset of Euclidean space under the action of a linear group.  <br/><br/>The approach followed by the principal investigator is inspired by a dynamical systems viewpoint and has already led to breakthroughs in number theory. Further open problems are expected to be solved via this approach. The improved understanding of so-called semisimple flows that will result from the first part of the project can likely be used to develop efficient algorithms for generating rational approximations to irrational vectors and finding short vectors in lattices. These problems are of immense interest to computer scientists for their numerous applications, especially to cryptography. The investigation of nonergodic directions in the second part of the project is motivated in part by the recent discovery (by the principle investigator and his collaborators) of a striking phenomenon known as the ""dichotomy of Hausdorff dimension"" that has never before been observed in the dynamics of billiards (the term ""billiards"" here refers to a mathematical model for a certain type of collision, not to the activity one observes in pool halls). A better understanding of the mechanism that produces this phenomenon may potentially provide the basis for a new model to explain critical phenomena and may be of interest to physicists. On the human resource development side, the project involves the training of graduate students to become research mathematicians."

The goal of the current project is to gain a better understanding of general properties of free boundary problems using various notions of weak solutions, with the help of maximum-principle-type arguments, harmonic analysis, measure theory, and interacting particle systems. Specific questions under investigation are  (i) global-time existence and uniqueness; (ii) uniting notions of weak solutions;  (iii) regularity properties;  (iv) long-time behavior of solutions and (v) geometric properties of free boundaries. Another project is to study homogenization of the free boundaries in periodic and random media, moving with oscillating normal velocity caused by inhomogeneities in the media. An example is the dynamics of water droplets spreading on an irregular surface. The lower dimensional nature of free boundaries bring major challenges to the homogenization, especially in nonvariational settings. The goal is to prove existence, uniqueness, and stability of the effective free boundary problem in periodic and random media.<br/><br/>Nonlinear interface motions arise naturally in physical applications, and they have been extensively studied in the physics and applied mathematics literature. A classical example is the melting of ice pieces or snow crystals, where the central issue of interest is the evolution of the ice/water/air interface. The highly nonlinear structure and the development, in general, of finite-time singularities on the interface -- such as a stream of water pinching into droplets -- give rise to rather challenging difficulties in the rigorous analysis. It is important, both in theory and in practice, to understand what type of singularities occur and under what circumstances the behavior of the interfaces exhibits stability."

Semiclassical analysis studies the transition between quantum and classical mechanics. A unifying idea in this area is to study the behavior of quantum mechanical objects such as eigenvalues (energy levels) and eigenfunctions (quantum states) in terms of classical objects like the geodesic flow. The Principal Investigator studies Kac's well-known inverse spectral problem for analytic domains by introducing new tools. In particular, the project will investigate explicit formulas for the complicated wave invariants in order to improve existing results on this subject. The Principal Investigator will also pursue applications of semiclassical analysis to another celebrated problem, Calderon's inverse problem with partial data.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator works in the field of partial differential equations. His project focuses on two very important inverse problems in mathematics and physics, namely, Kac's inverse problem and Calderon's inverse problem. Kac's inverse problem asks roughly whether one can determine the shapes of objects (such as stars) from the wave frequencies that they emit. The Principal Investigator approaches this problem by developing new computational tools that lead to an improved understanding of the relationship between the waves and the shapes of the objects. Such inverse spectral problems, as some engineers have recently suggested, may also have interesting applications in shape-matching, copyright, and medical imaging analysis. The Calderon inverse problem (or, in its technical formulation, the problem of electric impedance tomography) asks whether one can determine the conductivity of a body on the basis of current and voltage measurements taken at its surface. This inverse method has been proposed as a valuable diagnostic tool in medicine for the early detection of breast cancer. The past ten years have seen considerable developments in this area, but the problem with partial data (meaning for measurements taken only on pieces of the surface) remains an open problem. The project investigates the partial data problem with the aid of new analytical techniques."
