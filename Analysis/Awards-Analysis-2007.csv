The main goal of the project is to study smooth actions of (discrete and continuous) higher rank Abelian groups, actions that exhibit some degree of hyperbolicity. They represent natural generalizations of diffeomorphisms and flows on smooth manifolds. Such higher rank dynamical systems appear in various geometric and algebraic situations. The main examples include actions by commuting hyperbolic and partially hyperbolic automorphisms of tori and by commuting translations on cosets of Lie groups. In contrast to the properties of a single hyperbolic diffeomorphism or flow, many remarkable rigidity phenomena have been discovered for certain classes of higher rank Abelian actions. These phenomena include smooth rigidity, cocycle rigidity, and rigidity of invariant measures. Using dynamical, analytic, and group theoretic methods the principal investigator will further the study of such rigidity properties. In particular, he will consider broader classes of these actions than have been investigated hitherto, including nonalgebraic and nonuniformly hyperbolic actions. Another goal of the project is to study certain questions in smooth dynamics of a single Anosov or partially hyperbolic system.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively new fields of mathematics that study the evolution of physical and mathematical systems over time (e.g., planetary motion,   flow of air or other fluids). With origins in differential equations and celestial mechanics, these modern branches of mathematics provide numerous applications not only to other areas of mathematics but also to such natural sciences as physics, biology, meteorology, sociology, and computer science. Dynamical systems and ergodic theory have introduced new mathematical ideas into these sciences, including the study of long-term qualitative behavior, along with various analytic and probabilistic methods. One of the main goals of the proposed research is to investigate complex dynamical systems consisting of several different systems that ?commute? with each other, meaning that the evolution of any of the systems is not affected by the changes brought about by the others. Complex systems of this kind appear naturally in algebra, geometry, and physics. The recent study of such systems has produced exciting applications to number theory and quantum mechanics.<br/>"

Christopher Phillips, proposes to follow up on his recent joint work with Qing Lin on crossed products by minimal diffeomorphisms, and on his recent results on crossed products by free minimal actions of finitely generated free abelian groups on the Cantor set. These results, and particularly the methods of proof, suggest that much stronger theorems should hold. Specifically, consider a minimal and essentially free action of a countable amenable group on a compact metric space with finite covering dimension. The ultimate goal is to prove that the transformation group C*-algebra of such an action is a direct limit, with no dimension growth, of recursive subhomogeneous C*-algebras. In particular, it should have stable rank one, real rank zero or one, and cancellation of projections. While the conjecture as stated is still far from being proved, the Principal Investigator hopes to make substantial progress by analyzing various aspects of it in isolation from each other; the idea is to put the pieces together afterwards. The Principal Investigator also proposes to investigate, where appropriate, the smooth counterparts of such algebras, to investigate the isomorphism classification of the resulting C*-algebras, and to investigate connections with orbit equivalence problems in topological dynamics.<br/><br/>A dynamical system consists of a space and a collection of transformations of this space satisfying suitable mathematical conditions.  As an example, consider the set of possible states of a physical system and its time evolution: the transformations specify for a given time and initial state what state the system will be in after that much time has passed. Another example would be a physical space and its underlying symmetries, such as the Lorentz group acting on space-time in special relativity. If the relation between the space and the transformations is simple, the dynamical system can be studied directly. When this relation is complicated, it is often useful to introduce additional objects; one natural such object is the transformation group C*-algebra. An additional reason for studying this algebra is that sometimes objects of physical interest are more closely related to it than to the original dynamical system; an example is the Schroedinger operator for an electron moving in a quasicrystal. The purpose of this project is to understand the transformation group C*-algebras in cases in which the dynamical system is complicated, but in which the C*-algebra seems likely to be amenable to analysis. (This incluse the quasicrystal case.) It also seeks to better understand the relation between the dynamical system and the C*-algebra, and to begin the analysis, in appropriate cases, of objects that are related to the C*-algebra but preserve more information about the original dynamics.<br/>"

The concept that connects the three areas is the notion of an accretive map, which can be thought of as a far-reaching generalization of an increasing function of one real variable. Some of the problems to be addressed within the project are the following: (1) bi-Lipschitz equivalence of Euclidean spaces with nonsmooth conformal metrics, in particular with metrics defined by  Riesz potentials; (2) construction of quasisymmetric maps as vector-valued potentials of possibly non-doubling measures; (3) geometric properties of measures that satisfy a stronger, isotropic form of the doubling condition; (4) uniform continuity and Lipschitz continuity of approximate duality maps in Banach spaces; (5) variants of the Beurling-Ahlfors extension theorem for accretive maps and for complex gradients of real-valued functions. <br/><br/> A fundamental problem in geometry and analysis is to find a parametrization of a given metric space (i.e., a set with a notion of distance) that makes it possible to visualize the space and to understand its structure. (One practical situation in which this issue arises is the construction of flat maps of the mammalian cerebral cortex.) The Riemann mapping theorem provides a parametrization of a surface that preserves all angles but that can significantly distort distances between points. This distortion of distances can sometimes be reduced by a carefully chosen additional deformation of the flat region onto which the surface is mapped. Our current understanding of such deformations of Euclidean spaces is far from complete even in two dimensions. The principal investigator is interested in using accretive maps to shed new light on this subject. Under an accretive map a space can be significantly stretched or shrunk at multiple locations, but it is never rotated by more than a predetermined amount. <br/>"

Relevant questions deal with the existence of strange attractors (sometimes called ""ergodic attractors""), the abundance of homoclinic tangencies, and the existence of symbolic extensions.  By definition, an ergodic attractor is the support of a nonatomic ergodic SRB measure.  Due to the work of Benedicks, Carleson, Wang, Young, Mora, and Viana it is known that there are smooth parametrized families of area-decreasing diffeomorphisms for which ergodic attractors exist for positive measure sets of parameters.  A natural question is whether ""positive measure"" can be replaced with ""open.""  Previous work of the principal investigator has shown that, in the presence of homoclinic tangencies, there are NO open sets of area-decreasing planar diffeomorphisms with ergodic attractors. Part of the present research investigates whether this lack of ergodic attractors is a ""generic"" property. In addition, attempts will be made to prove the existence of ergodic attractors in systems that are area-preserving in some parts of the phase space--thus removing the current dependence on sharp contraction of area in all known techniques.  Other problems in the current project focus on the existence of symbolic extensions for maps with varying levels of smoothness.  <br/><br/>This research involves the dynamics of low-dimensional mappings. It is intimately related to understanding the solutions (or orbits) of nonlinear differential equations. Such equations arise in many scientific disciplines. To cite particular examples, they provide models for systems in biology such as circadian rhythms, blood flow, and the electrodynamics of nerve impulses; in astronomy in connection with the design of orbiting satellites; and even in weather prediction. In some specific models related to the foregoing general systems, it is known that the relevant equations cannot be solved explicitly. Instead, in the study of these systems one must rely on certain geometric information that is made available through numerical exploration with computers. This project attempts to provide a mathematically rigorous treatment of important properties related to equations that arise in such situations. The knowledge of these properties helps to provide tools that the scientist or engineer can use to describe, test, and refine models for a variety of things that occur in nature. As such, the present research has the potential to provide foundations for substantial scientific advancement. <br/>"

This research project involves a number of areas of mathematics, including operator algebras, finite fields, number theory, and combinatorics.  In contrast to semigroups of automorphisms, a semigroup of endomorphisms may be viewed as a dynamical system that may proceed forward but not backward in time.  It is remarkable how challenging this subject has proven to be in light of the relatively simpler theory of one-parameter semigroups of automorphisms on a type I factor.  A principal goal of this proposal is to make additional progress in the classification of one-parameter semigroups of unital endomorphisms, analogous to Wigner's characterization of groups of automorphisms acting on factors of type I.     <br/><br/>The study of operator algebras traces its origins back to the work of von Neumann and others.  Their goal was to construct mathematical models that capture the behavior of quantum mechanical systems, and to use these models to make predictions about the time evolution of such systems.

This proposal involves connections among the fields of operator algebras, commutative algebra, number theory, and combinatorics.  The principal objects of study in this project are known as binary shifts on a certain type of operator algebra and are defined using bitstreams of 0's and 1's such as one studies in the theory of linear recurring sequences.  A major goal of this project is to complete  the classification of the binary shifts and to relate this classification to the analysis of linear recurring sequences.

In particular, Hankel operators will be used to study the very important problem on the degree of superoptimal approximation of rational matrix functions. This degree coincides with the dimension of the space of minimal realization and is very important in applications in control theory. The principal investigator is going to continue his work in perturbation theory and use his approach to multiple operator integrals based on integral projective tensor products and Schur multipliers.  He is also going to work on Wiener-Hopf factorizations of unitary-valued matrix functions of class VMO (functions of vanishing mean oscillation) and on estimates of the resolvents of Toeplitz operators with matrix-valued symbols.

The project targets a series of problems concerning periodic orbits of billiards in polygons and polyhedra, which constitute a borderline class of billiards. The problems are centered on a conjecture about the existence of a periodic billiard orbit in an arbitrary polygon or polyhedron. The study of billiards in polygons naturally leads to the study of certain flat surfaces by exploiting techniques from Teichmuller theory. Another part of the project addresses a long-standing conjecture on the measure-theoretic aperiodicity of general billiard flows.<br/><br/>Billiard flow is a dynamical system introduced almost a century ago by G. D. Birkhoff.  It is a rich source of interesting phenomena whose study is not obstructed by daunting technical difficulties. Different kinds of billiards determined by varying types of billiard tables have required a host of methods of study and, as a result, have had a strong impact on developments in dynamics, geometry, mathematical physics, and spectral theory.  According to Poincare's approach, the primary task in the study of any dynamical system is to understand the periodic motions within the system. This project addresses a number of problems concerning periodic billiard orbits in polygons and polyhedra. It requires the study of closely related dynamical systems, namely, geodesic flows on flat surfaces.  In the last twenty years, billiards in polygons has evolved into a field that successfully weds two traditional areas of mathematics, dynamical systems and complex analysis. On the one hand, significant progress in understanding billiards in polygons has been made because of the linkage of the subject to flat surfaces, and thus to the methods of Teichmuller theory. On the other hand, it was billiards that created a renewed interest in the study of flat surfaces, which then led to the solution certain problems in Teichmuller theory. This project aims to expand this interaction even further.<br/>"

There are two main parts to the project. The first focuses on several complex variables, the second on complex dynamics. However, the line between these two areas is not clear-cut. Within the several complex variables portion, the central concept is the Cauchy-Riemann equation. The problems are concerned with either deriving estimates for this equation, or improving understanding of key concepts basic to it, or applying estimates for this equation to function theory. The second part of the project deals with complex dynamics. Its objective is to obtain an understanding of foliations by Riemann surfaces. These arise naturally from flows of holomorphic vector fields and lead to basic questions about currents. (The latter could just as well be thought of as belonging to several complex variables.) The principal investigator has a long-standing collaboration with Sibony in which the two develop the theory of complex dynamics. Most recently they have carried out some investigations of Riemann surface laminations. These occur in the iteration of a holomorphic map, in that its associated Julia set might have a lamination along which the map is more regular than it is in other directions. (Of course, laminations are also an interesting topic in their own right.) Until now it has been necessary for the study to impose extra conditions, such as hyperbolicity, on the singular points. The plan is to continue the study while allowing for more general singularities and to search for ergodic properties of the laminations. In two dimensions, positive closed currents can be approximated by currents of integration of Riemann surfaces. It would be useful for the study of dynamics in higher dimensions to have a similar geometric interpretation of currents. The PI and Sibony propose to work on this topic with Coman. The case of immediate interest is that of currents in three dimensions of bidimension (1,1).<br/><br/>Mathematical analysis is an important tool for studying the world from a quantitative perspective. But already when one tries to find roots of polynomial equations, it becomes clear that complex numbers and complex analysis are needed. Hence it is important to develop complex analysis, which can then be used to build up other areas of mathematics (e.g., algebraic geometry, number theory). This project explores various aspects of complex analysis. The plan is for the principal investigator to work with two senior mathematicians, Diederich and Sibony. Together the three have a good overview of the fields of several complex variables and complex dynamics, which benefits not only their joint projects but also their work with younger mathematicians. They will work with two midcareer mathematicians (Coman and Lanzani) and with a group of postdocs (Heier, Herbig, Lee, Sahutoglu, Siano, and Wold). The project will also involve a number of graduate students, including five women, from both the University of Michigan and other institutions.<br/>"

To mention just a few instances, they turn up in the following situations: as limits of smooth objects (spaces such as Riemannian manifolds, or smooth functions); as asymptotic ""spheres at infinity"" of finitely generated groups, objects that reflect the behavior of the groups at large scales; or in the fine-scale structure of sets, even in concrete and practical circumstances (irregular crystals, for instance, or other materials). The principal investigator studies questions that relate to singular objects and their geometry, and he does analysis on such objects. Specifically, he seeks to understand the extent to which the concepts of classical differential (first-order) analysis can be introduced into such spaces. For example, one would like to have a well-defined Sobolev space of weakly differentiable functions on certain singular spaces. It is also important to understand which potentially very singular spaces can be parametrized by ""nice"" spaces (say, by Euclidean spaces) via transformations that distort the basic metric structure only within fixed bounds. The principal investigator and his students are developing new tools for approaching this type of problem. Finally, the question of parametrization by a Euclidean space can be replaced with the requirement of embedability in some finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The methods that emerge from the project should clarify this problem as well.<br/><br/>The proposed research relates to applications in two ways. First, singularities (or impurities) occur everywhere in nature, from the local microstructure of materials to the large-scale features of the universe. Understanding and dealing with such singularities is one of the central objectives of modern mathematics and science. The principal investigator has made contributions to the solution of this problem in cases where the singularities can be analyzed and then transformed, with minimal cost, to better behaved models. Second, although not directly related to the project, there are potential applications of the research to theoretical computer science, where large and complex data sets need to be transformed and stored in simpler form. <br/>"

In operator algebras no geometrical structure of subfactors has been previously found.  The proponent has found the natural link between  subfactors, the subgroups of quantum SU(2) and the classical and quantum Lie groups, showing that the information for building a simple Lie group comes naturally from the fusion structure on representations of a quantum subgroup of SU(2). The bridge between these two areas of research is a new crystallographic property of homology theory, wherein for instance six term exact sequences correspond to regular hexagons.  These methods yield a natural elementary construction of a canonical basis of the quantum enveloping algebra of the  semisimple Lie groups.  The link  found between quantum subgroups and root lattices extends beyond SU(2) and the classical Lie groups. The proponent found new unimodular root systems  in weight lattices associated to general quantum subgroups, which are  not connected to any known structures. The proponent considers the development  of the higher analogs of simple Lie groups corresponding to the new root systems a priority.  These are likely to be essentially new mathematical objects with natural many-to-one laws, which have potential applications in  constructive QFT in a physical (3 or 4) number of dimensions, while the usual binary laws produce naturally 2-dimensional field theories.<br/>The project is centered around the construction, classification and study of the properties and manifestations of the quantum subgroups of Lie groups. The quantum deformations of the semisimple Lie groups have, when the quantization parameter is a root of unity, subgroups which are the analogs of the finite subgroups of the classical Lie groups. The proponent has introduced this structure over the years, starting with the classification of the algebraic structure of small index subfactors in the noncommutative Galois theory for operator algebras. Other manifestations of these structures appear in topological quantum field theory, where they provide boundary extensions of numerical invariants for 3-manifolds , conformal field theory, and modular invariants. The quantum subgroups of SU(2), SU(3) and SU(4) are now classified by the proponent, and show that the quantum world is very different and apparently nearly unrelated to the classical world, with a markedly simpler situation for the exceptional quantum subgroups than for the corresponding classical subgroups. The project introduces geometrical structures associated to quantum subgroups, with the quantum subgroups of SU(2) producing the roots weights and canonical bases for the simple Lie groups, while the other quantum subgroups give raise to essentially new generalized root systems in weight lattices.  It is hoped that the new structures produced by the project could play a role in constructing models of quantum field theory in a physical number of dimensions.<br/>"

Using this approach, Packer and her collaborators hope to shed light on both frame theory and filter functions and the related operators and operator algebras.  She will attempt to construct more general families of wavelets, including wavelets based on fractal spaces, first introduced by D. Dutkay and P. Jorgensen, and on generalized solenoids.  Operator theory and operator algebras were previously used by Packer with collaborators L. Baggett, K. Merrill, and Jorgensen, in their recent papers on the construction of Parseval frames from generalized filter systems.  Packer intends to build on these results, and in addition hopes to use an approach due to N. Larsen and I. Raeburn, who have recently described a method to constructing multiresolution analyses by using directed systems of Hilbert spaces and partial isometries.  The key linking ingredient in these projects is the family of filter functions, and these functions can also be used to construct operators giving representations of identifiable C*-algebras such as the Cuntz algebra and the Toeplitz algebra. Larsen, Raeburn, Merrill, Baggett and Packer intend to use this new approach to (1) build generalized frame wavelets from the abstract multiplicity function of Baggett and Merrill, and (2) give another approach towards constructing the fractal wavelets of Dutkay and Jorgensen.  Packer also hopes to extend the concept of projective multiresolution analyses developed with M. Rieffel to more general non-commutative tori.  This could have intriguing applications to Gabor frames. <br/><br/>Packer, her student J. D'Andrea, and her colleague K. Merrill have recently used some of these methods on the space built from the Sierpinski gasket fractal. In so doing they were able to obtain some interesting analysis of digital photographs.  Wavelet and frame theory are extremely useful in data storage and retrieval, both for signal processing and digital imaging.  On the other hand, operator algebras play an important role in abstract mathematics and provide a bridge between analysis and geometry. The connection between the abstract theory of operator algebras and wavelets and their applications is an intriguing one, and it is well-known that Cuntz algebras and their generalizations have shown up in a variety of real-life situations over the years.  Packer intends to build on her previous work with collaborators in the directions outlined above to obtain new results of interest to other workers in the field, thereby stimulating other research in this area.  She hopes both to visit her domestic and overseas collaborators and have them visit Colorado, thereby benefiting a variety of institutions.   Packer has had one student complete a Ph.D. thesis on this topic, and another of her students is interested in the use of fractal wavelets in image compression  and data storage.  A third student is interested in more theoretical problems in operator algebras. The mixture of the theoretical and the applied in this area of research generates many problems for graduate students to pursue, and Packer hopes to attract new Ph.D. students to work in these areas and related areas of analysis.  <br/><br/>"

The common thread is to find an appropriate conformal density in each context. One such is the Teichmuller density, which is equivalent to the hyperbolic density.  It is obtained by taking the infinitesimal cross-ratio norm in the complement of a closed set. The Teichmuller density provides a tool for studying holomorphic motions and for estimating the hyperbolic density. The next two densities are obtained by generalizing the Poincare and Caratheodory densities by changing the fixed domain in their definitions from the unit disk to other hyperbolic plane domains. The newly defined densities find their way into the study of continued fractions and iterated function systems. These densities define two new classes of plane domains, Kobayashi-Lipschitz and Caratheodory-Lipschitz domains, both of which include the class of Bloch domains. Domains of these types are degenerate domains, meaning that every iterated function system in such a domain has only constant accumulation points. Comparing the Poincare and Caratheodory densities on appropriate pairs of domains yields a new and bigger set of degenerate domains. The remaining part of the project concentrates on finding the appropriate densities for the study of invariant metrics on Teichmuller spaces, finite earthquakes, and Smale's constant for approximating roots of polynomials.<br/><br/>For many years the geometrical and analytical techniques developed in dynamical systems and complex analysis have been applied in a number of important nonlinear contexts, resulting in a broad impact on biology, ecology, probability, and economics. One can expect these trends to continue. This project will feature the application of the newly defined densities (and other invariants) in various directions. One direction involves the use of a density to estimate Smale's constant, which measures the cost of approximating roots of polynomials. This constant is thus directly linked to complexity theory and economics. Another direction is the study of so-called finite earthquakes. The finite earthquake theorem provides a way to encode each finite or countable string of data into a weighted tree, and vice versa. This could turn out to be an efficient way of coding that could find its way into genetics, economics, and ecology. There is a computer program that graphs the finite earthquakes approximating a given homeomorphism and lists weights associated to each leaf. The structure of this program may yield an efficient way to store, in approximate form, the essential features of an earthquake map. Another component of the project is based on integrating research and education by developing similar computer programs for possible implementation in hybrid internet courses.<br/>"

The P.I. and his collaborators have studied the spike-layer steady states for an activator-inhibitor system in morphogenesis proposed by Gierer and Meinhardt based on the celebrated idea - diffusion-driven instability - of Turing in 1952. Their analysis exploits the gap between the diffusion rates for the two chemical substances, and stability results in various cases have also been obtained. Progress has been made for concentration phenomena on multi-dimensional subsets. Moreover, the complete dynamics of the corresponding kinetic systems has recently been described. However, the dynamics of the original diffusion system is still far from being fully understood. For the spatially inhomogeneous case, stability properties of these diffusion systems can be very different from their autonomous counterparts and this will be investigated. In a slightly different direction it has been noted that the gap between the diffusion rates alone is insufficient to create patterns. Thus, the notion of ""cross-diffusion,"" introduced by theoretical biologists in 1979 in modeling segregation phenomena in population dynamics, will be systematically studied. Cross-diffusion systems have also been used in recent years to model singular phenomena including dendritic growth of bacteria colonies. They are both nonlinear and strongly-coupled in highest order terms, so they are very challenging mathematically. These diffusion and cross-diffusion systems as well as their shadow systems will be studied in both autonomous and non-autonomous cases. Their qualitative behavior as well as their stability properties will also be investigated..<br/><br/>This award is to continue a research project that tries to understand, in a mathematically rigorous manner, the phenomena and effects of various diffusion-related mechanisms.

Particular examples include Turing patterns, as in Gierer-Meinhardt's activator-inhibitor systems, models of  the regeneration phenomena of hydra in morphogenesis, a nonlinear diffusion system modeling dendritic growth of bacteria colonies, and  Lotka-Volterra competition systems with inter-specific population pressures taken into consideration.<br/>"

Smith<br/><br/>This project will study solutions of hyperbolic equations in the setting of metrics of low regularity, and the behavior of eigenfunctions for such metrics. Our primary efforts will be to obtain Lp norm bounds on solutions and eigenfunctions, and quantifying the dependence of these bounds on the Holder smoothness of the media. An important issue is controlling the propagation of energy for solutions of rough hyperbolic equations. For rough media the geodesic flow is ill-posed, and geometric optics methods break down. Prior research has shown that some localization of energy is possible in rough settings. In this project we shall attempt to obtain optimal results on the possible degree of energy concentration and the rate of dispersion. The key tool to be used is a wave packet decomposition that provides approximate representations of the solution.  Frequency dependent scaling arguments will be invoked to establish the short time scales on which waves in rough media exhibit classical dispersion. The investigator will also adapt the above methods to the study of waves and eigenfunctions on manifolds with boundary. This is done by reflecting the metric across the boundary to obtain a Lipschitz metric on an open set. The geometry of the resulting geodesic flow combines with the short scale bounds to establish optimal Lp bounds for eigenfunctions on manifolds with boundary.<br/><br/>This research project will investigate stationary vibrational modes and travelling waves in rough media; a rough medium being one where the physics which governs the speed of waves changes abruptly from point to point. This will be done using a representation of travelling waves as a sum of coherent pulses, each of which moves in a very simple fashion. The investigator is able to quantify the degree to which vibrational modes and waves can concentrate, depending on the roughness of the underlying media. Such results are important for the study of nonlinear wave interactions and questions of the outside observability of vibrations and waves. They also provide information on the reflection of waves off obstacles. We will study how multiple reflections increase the  concentration of travelling waves, and also show that waves reflecting off convex obstacles  disperse at  similar rates to waves travelling without reflection.<br/>"

Many dynamical systems, while completely determinate, appear to have elements of random behavior. This phenomenon can be described explicitly when there is a time-invariant probability measure on the system.  Such a description could state that the system is measure theoretically isomorphic to a particular known process, such as a Bernoulli process. From this point of view it is natural to try to attempt to classify dynamical systems measure-theoretically. The hope would be to have a ""library"" of possible measure preserving systems and be able to describe an arbitrary system measure theoretically as one in the library.<br/>This project, while very successful in its early stages, runs into insuperable obstacles for deep logical reasons. Foreman's previous work with his co-authors showed that the isomorphism problem for ergodic measure preserving systems is inherently too complex from a logical point of view to admit a classification. Foreman's proposed work involves extending these anti-classification results to differentiable systems on compact manifolds and to identify those  systems for which the isomorphism problem is tractable.<br/><br/>Many natural systems evolve over time according to definite rules. Much of science involves discovering these rules and describing them, perhaps by a system of equations. These rules discuss how individual points in a system behave, and are often completely deterministic. However, what can be actually observed (for example due to round-off error) in these systems are sets  of points. At this level the qualitative behavior of a dynamical system can be apparently random. This led to the project of classifying<br/>the possible behavior statistically so that the   qualitative behavior of<br/>natural systems could be catalogued. There were many successes in the program in its early stages. Recently however, it turns out that there are reasons related to mathematical logic that the program cannot, in principle, work. Foreman's proposed research explores extending the impossibility results to concrete settings and finding large collections of systems for which there are good classifications of their statistical behavior.<br/><br/><br/>"

The description of instabilities in this system is one of the classical problems of mechanics. This project investigates instabilities for the model of the Sun-Jupiter-Asteroid system, assuming that the third body (the asteroid) has zero mass, that the second (Jupiter) is tiny in comparison with the first (the Sun), and that all three bodies move in a plane. Using the well-known Mather theory, the principal investigator seeks a mathematical proof of instability for this system.<br/> <br/>The stability of the Solar System is a fundamental issue in astronomy and mathematics. The general belief is that the system is not stable. As a first step toward understanding the physical situation it is extremely important to look for instabilities within mathematical models of the Solar System. The main thrust of this project represents an attempt to shed light on the complicated behavior of a mathematical model for the Sun-Jupiter-Asteroid system. The fundamental question for this model is whether a trajectory of the asteroid can be unstable (in oversimplified terms, whether its positions relative to the Sun and Jupiter can change a great deal over time). The principal investigator will try to find such instabilities and give a detailed mathematical description of them. This could eventually lead to a deeper understanding of instabilities in the entire Solar System, since the Sun and Jupiter are the bodies in it that have the largest impact on the motion of most of the planets. <br/>"

In this context, approximately twenty years ago, P.Baum and A.Connes conjectured a formula for the K-theory of the (reduced) C* algebra of any locally compact topological group. At the present time no counter-example is known to the conjecture and due to the work of many mathematicians the conjecture has been proved for several very interesting classes of groups (e.g. real Lie groups, p-adic algebraic groups, adelic algebraic groups, discrete hyperbolic groups, amenable groups). Also established is that the conjecture, when valid, has many corollaries (e.g. Mackey analogy, Atiyah-Schmid construction of the discrete series, Novikov higher signature conjecture, stable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture, Kadison-Kaplansky conjecture). This project aims to discover and develop further corollaries of the conjecture in representation theory and in geometry-topology.<br/><br/>Analysis is the branch of mathematics based on calculus. The fundamental ideas of calculus (differentiation and integration) were introduced by Newton and Leibniz and played a central role in the scientific revolution of their era. Topology is the most basic form of geometry and was founded by such eminent nineteenth and twentieth century mathematicians as Riemann, Poincare and Lefschetz. A major theme in modern mathematics has been the interplay between analysis and topology. For example, Maxwell's equations for electricity-magnetism are formulated via analysis, but many of the implications are topological. This project continues the interaction of topology and analysis by using and applying a new synthesis of analysis and topology known as ""non-commutative geometry<br/>"

The research will concentrate on three fundamental problems associated with various aspects of noncompactness in dynamical systems. The first problem considers measure rigidity phenomena for horocycle flows on infinite volume hyperbolic surfaces. The existing theory treats finite invariant measures, whereas the project involves a program to study the infinite, but locally finite, case. The second and third problems are concerned with the thermodynamic formalism for maps with infinite Markov partitions and for nonuniformly hyperbolic surface diffeomorphisms. Building on previous work of the principal investigator and others, the project will investigate an analogy between certain phenomena associated with such systems and critical phenomena in statistical physics (namely, phase transitions). The principal investigator will pursue a detailed program for utilizing this analogy to explore in a systematic way the ergodic theoretic effects of noncompactness or nonuniform hyperbolicity. <br/><br/>A dynamical system is a model that describes a system (think of a physical system) that can be in one of many possible states, together with a law that prescribes how the state of the system evolves in time. Such models are used frequently in mathematics, physics, biology, and engineering. Most of the mathematical research in dynamical systems hitherto has focused on systems whose collections of possible states are ""small"" in an appropriate sense (the precise mathematical term is ""compact""). In contrast, this project studies dynamical systems with noncompact collections of states. It focuses on various dynamical phenomena that can appear only in the noncompact setting, most notably a new type of rigidity on the level of infinite invariant measures, as well as a certain collection of phenomena similar to critical phenomena that one encounters in physics. There are numerous potential applications of these ideas to other areas of mathematics, including geometry and mathematical physics. In particular, it is hoped that the results of the research will shed light on the theory of phase transitions in statistical physics.<br/>"

The main problem is how smoothness of harmonic measures around boundary points is related to the geometry of the underlying domain. The answer to this problem is directly linked to problems in approximation theory, polynomial inequalities and estimates on orthogonal polynomials. The other direction of research is non-classical orthogonal  polynomials, for which many questions are motivated by applications, and for which classical tools are not available.  In particular, Dr. Totik will study orthogonal polynomials with respect to doubling measures which will open a new direction of research that seems to be the right one when the classical theory (as well as the related interpolation theory) is extended to more general classes.

The principal investigator has developed a range of tools to explore such spaces of orbits and to study notions of equivalence of these structures that allow for measuring and controlling distortions or rearrangments of them. The goal of this program is to extend these orbit methods to as broad a perspective as possible and to apply them to answer interesting questions. These methods have a significant history in the study of systems that preserve probability measures. Two active new directions of work are extension of this theory to the almost continuous case, and the Cantor minimal theory.  Both involve improving the regularity of any allowed isomorphisms beyond measurability, in the first case to be continuous with probability one and in the second actually to be continuous.  Another broad attempt at extending these methods is to study probability measures diffused on the leaves of a foliation. The diffused measure gives a mass distribution on the leaves. One removes all conditions, though linking the dynamics and the measure.  For one-dimensional leaves an ergodic theorem can be proved in this general context, and extending it to higher dimensions appears possible.  This is a potentially very fruitful domain for extending orbit methods to quite general large-scale structures.  A variety of other directions are pursued, including the beginnings of a collaboration in applied fluid dynamics that uses the metrics developed for measuring large-scale distortion of orbits to create a bag of tools for assessing the accuracy of numerical models.<br/><br/>Large arrays of data arise in many contexts, from genomics to digital imaging to geology.  Similar arrays arise in a mathematical context as trajectories or orbits in the space of states of a dynamical system. Orbit methods involve notions of the size of distortion of such arrays or different ways of measuring how similar two such arrays are.  One tunes the notion of distortion or distance to the context of the problem. There is the possibility of deep cross-fertilization between areas of engineering and applied science and abstract dynamics in this context.  For example, the evolutionary distance between species can be measured in terms of how similar their genomes are, where one must tune what one means by similar to make biological sense.  As another example, in compressing the data in a visual image one is perhaps willing to lose some precision so long as the picture is not significantly distorted.  What does one mean by a significant distortion?  As a third example, in modeling the meanderings of rivers one must establish what it would mean for a model to capture the real behavior of this complex phenomenon. Again, this can take the form of a thoughtfully tuned notion of closeness of patterns. One thrust of this project is to seek collaborations that look for such cross-fertilization of ideas.  This has already begun in the areas of genomics and of fluid flow.<br/>"

More recently, conformal maps have been used to provide accurate two-dimensional representations of the brain that can serve as guides for researchers in their quest to understand that complex organ. There are different ways for computing conformal maps that are appropriate for different applications. The proposed research in conformal mapping is fundamental, and its immediate applications are not apparent. It is expected that some aspects of the project will lead to new connections between different areas of mathematics, in particular, between differential geometry and several complex variables.

A very wide range of problems in engineering can be formulated and studied in terms of matrix inequalities. Furthermore, many linear system control problems have matrices as their natural variables and thus require an understanding of polynomials and rational functions in noncommutative variables. Of special practical importance is ""convexity,"" for in its presence local minima (which can be found computationally) are in fact global minima (the ones that you really want to find). Yet more tractable are linear matrix inequalities. A surprising finding of the principal investigator and a collaborator that resulted from a previous grant is that any matrix inequality based on a convex noncommutative rational function is equivalent to a linear matrix inequality determined by the same function. In the current project the principal investigator will work on extending the classical (commuting) theory of polynomial inequalities (commonly called semialgebraic geometry) to noncommutative polynomials. He will explore aspects of this subject that pertain to convexity and curvature, develop computer algorithms based on this theory, analyze such algorithms, and look for connections with other branches of mathematics.<br/><br/>The first line of mathematical models in engineering for nearly all things that move is a  ""system"" ; namely, a box with inputs and outputs. Even if these are not linear, the first step in a design is often linearization, so the mathematics of linear systems plays a major role in areas such as control for planes, cars, satellites, structures in earthquakes,<br/>oil refineries, machine tools, flowing fluids, and much else. The biggest advance in linear systems engineering during the 1990s was the realization that most linear control problems convert directly to matrix inequalities. Many different types of matrix inequalities surfaced in twentieth-century mathematics, but the ones that dominate today in engineering systems usually require that a polynomial or rational function of matrices be ""positive semidefinite,"" a technical property. Many engineering matrix inequalities are<br/>""ill-behaved,"" but there is a classical core of problems in which such inequalities convert to ""well-behaved"" linear matrix inequalities.  The latter are computationally tractable and provably free from false optima (which can lead to unsafe designs). It is algebraic formulas like these that are programmed into modern computer packages in systems engineering. The goals of this project are the following: to test mathematically and computationally whether a given set of matrix inequalities is well behaved, to understand how to convert bad matrix inequalities into nice ones, and to develop corresponding computer algorithms. The principal investigator also devotes significant effort to promoting interactions between mathematicians and engineers.  In addition to working with his own graduate students, he runs a modest computational lab in the summer that is staffed by students. Although many of these students go on to obtain Ph.D.'s in pure mathematics, the lab experience and exposure to engineering broadens them considerably.<br/>"

The Principal Investigator (PI) aims to study complex dynamical systems in holomorphic families.  The questions are centered on the notions of stability within families, bifurcations, and degenerations. More specifically, the PI will pursue (1) questions about the compactification of the moduli space of rational maps, where it remains open to construct a natural boundary which captures the information of dynamical degeneration, and to describe precisely which stable families are bounded in the moduli space; (2) characterizations of stability for families of higher-dimensional dynamical systems, where the techniques from one-dimensional dynamics do not generalize, but there has been recent progress using pluripotential theory; (3) an investigation of families of polynomials in one variable and the associated space of trees with dynamics, which provides a continuous combinatorial model for polynomials in all degrees, and should model the structure of the escape locus in the moduli space of polynomials; and (4) properties of the transfinite diameter in connection with families of polynomials in all dimensions, where the discussion involves a combination of analytic and arithmetic methods.<br/><br/>A more general overview:<br/><br/>There are many open questions around the long-term effects of perturbations of a dynamical system.  The PI studies the iteration of rational functions of one variable, one of the simplest examples of a non-invertible system with non-trivial dynamics.  In this project, she aims to answer questions of a global nature:  what is the structure of the stable regime in a complex-analytic family of rational functions? Or, what type of degenerations can take place and what do they tell us about the bifurcation locus?  The motivation for studying these particular families comes from interesting connections with hyperbolic geometry, algebraic and arithmetic geometry, and potential theory.<br/><br/><br/>"

Specific sample directions of planned research are related to the slicing problem, the Mahler conjecture, the Gaussian correlation conjecture, combinatorial dimensions of classes of functions, singular numbers of random matrices, signal reconstruction (notably, compressed sensing), and links to quantum information theory. A combined, focused effort is expected to bring new insights toward a better understanding of the participants' respective fields of research, which - while related and occasionally overlapping - are not identical and often employ different perspectives.<br/><br/>The area of mathematics encompassing the methods and the problems described above has recently entered a period of rapid growth. In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract. Special attention will be paid to recruiting members of groups under-represented in the field of mathematics."

Basic questions that will be investigated include the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of CR-mappings between given CR-manifolds, as well as geometric questions that arise in connection with this study. The objective is to obtain a deeper understanding of mappings in CR-geometry, and their role in complex analysis and PDE. One part of the project will focus on these problems in the context of nontrivial CR-mappings of a Levi-nondegenerate hypersurface into another of higher dimension. The principal investigator expects that this research will lead to a better grasp of how the local CR-geometry of such hypersurfaces (which, in principle, is completely encoded in the Chern-Moser CR-curvature tensor) affects geometric properties of CR-mappings (e.g., various notions of nondegeneracy and rigidity). The principal investigator will also study geometric properties of CR-mappings between more general CR-manifolds. A particular geometric property of interest is transversality. The principal investigator will try to extend some of his recent transversality results (joint work with Rothschild) for mappings between CR-manifolds of the same dimension to the situation where the target manifold has higher dimension than that of the source manifold. This case appears significantly different from the equidimensional case. The principal investigator anticipates that this study will involve the development of substantially new methods, which in turn will enhance our understanding of mappings into higher dimensional spaces.<br/><br/>The study of real submanifolds in complex manifolds is central to complex analysis and to other areas of mathematics and physics. In this research, tools from a wide range of areas such as real and complex analysis, partial differential equations, and algebraic geometry are used and further developed. The principal investigator is hopeful that the investigations carried out in this project will enhance our understanding of the geometry of real submanifolds and partial differential equations in complex space, which will benefit research in adjacent areas of mathematics as well as in areas of theoretical physics. He expects the project to provide interesting research topics for graduate students.

The interplay between real and complex geometry and analysis is a fundamental ingredient in studying these objects.  Techniques from differential and algebraic geometry, as well as real and complex analysis and partial differential equations, will be used in the proposed work. The principal investigators plan to determine when two such manifolds are equivalent under invertible holomorphic transformations. They will look for new constructive criteria to build such mappings and to determine their convergence. They also plan to classify mappings from one surface in a multidimensional complex space into another embedded in a complex space of higher dimension. Of particular interest are those hypersurfaces defined by quadratic equations and admitting large symmetry groups.  The latter will serve as models to discover more general phenomena and formulate basic properties of the manifolds under consideration. In particular, they will focus on determining when it is possible to reduce the biholomorphic equivalence problem to solving systems of polynomial equations with complex coefficients.  They also plan to determine when a formal mapping sending a real submanifold into another is necessarily convergent. In addition, they will attempt to categorize those submanifolds for which such mappings are determined by finitely many derivatives at a given point.  They expect that this study will lead to the discovery of new geometric, analytic, and algebraic invariants of these submanifolds. The principal investigators will initiate new studies of overdetermined systems of nonlinear partial differential equations of first and higher order.

One project is to study the wave equation on singular spaces. Melrose, Vasy, and the PI will investigate the diffraction of solutions of the wave equation by complex singular geometries, perhaps eventually a large class of stratified spaces. This builds on previous work with Melrose, which showed that a singularity of a solution of the wave equation interacts with a cone point to produce a ""diffracted"" spherical wavefront emanating from the cone point. The singularity of the diffracted front may be weaker than that of the incident front if the latter is not too precisely focused on the cone point. Another direction of research involves the Schroedinger equation on manifolds, where the infinite speed of propagation has some intriguing consequences. The PI will investigate aspects of the dispersive smoothing effect for Schroedinger evolution in trapping geometries, focusing initially on the propagation of regularity associated to Lagrangian submanifolds.<br/><br/>A central question in the mathematical theory of quantum mechanics is: what is the relationship between the classical dynamics of a particle and its corresponding quantum states? Insights into this problem have come not only from the direct study of the quantum mechanical energy operator or ""Hamiltonian"" itself, but also from other fundamental equations involving it, such as the heat equation, the wave equation, and, naturally, the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The focus of this research consequently includes the geometric analysis of several kinds of partial differential equations. One project investigates what happens to waves when they interact with (a certain generalization of) sharp corners---the geometry of how wavefronts move can be quite subtle in these cases owing to the effects of diffraction.  Possible physical applications include ""inverse problems"" in which one attempts to deduce the structure of an object (e.g. the interior of the earth) from observation of waves that have passed through it.  Another project is to study the behavior of solutions of the Schroedinger equation on curved spaces; such solutions describe the time-evolution of a quantum particle.

In other recent work, the principal investigator and her collaborators have shown that typical conservative diffeomorphisms with minimal differentiability have trivial centralizers; that is, they have no smooth symmetries. The project has two main components: (1) extending the previous work of the principal investigator and her collaborators on the ergodicity of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms to a broader context, including dissipative systems and nonuniformly partially hyperbolic systems; (2) a study of the dynamical properties of smooth group actions on manifolds from the perspectives of genericity and rigidity. For one example, the principal investigator proposes to extend previous work with her collaborators in the conservative setting to show that the typical diffeomorphisms with minimal differentiability have trivial centralizers.<br/><br/>In the past few decades, the topic of partially hyperbolic dynamical systems has emerged as one main direction in which the theory of complicated (""chaotic"") dynamical systems has extended beyond the classical setting of hyperbolic dynamics. This research has been driven in part by the realization that many practical applications of dynamical systems to experimental phenomena require a much broader theory. In a parallel development, the typical (or generic) properties of smooth systems have begun to emerge, as increasingly sophisticated perturbation techniques have been developed. The principal investigator's research over the last decade has focused on the fundamental qualitative features -- e.g., ergodicity (statistical ""chaos""), lack of symmetries, and other hallmarks of orbit complexity -- that might be displayed by a typical smooth dynamical system. The proposed research will make foundational advances in understanding when to expect chaos in a given family of systems, such as those that arise in practice in predicting global weather patterns or the trajectories of extraterrestrial bodies.

They grew out of recent studies of the variational integrals that arise in nonlinear elasticity and as a synthesis of ideas from multidimensional geometric function theory, in particular, from quasiconformal geometry. There has been considerable interest recently in extending the classical theory of complex harmonic functions to higher dimensions. Analysis and connections with geometric function theory underpin a growing confidence that n-harmonic deformations of domains in Euclidean n-space represent a better generalization of holomorphic functions than classical harmonic mappings. There are several natural ways that n-harmonic deformations arise in analysis. One of those is the mathematical model of nonlinear elasticity pioneered by Antman, Ball, and Ciarlet. To describe it in simplistic terms, the theory of elasticity studies deformations of a material body onto a given domain, the deformed configuration that minimizes the so-called stored energy functional. Classical Teichmuller theory, with its extremal mappings between Riemann surfaces, offers a similar perspective. Broadly speaking, this theory is concerned with a distortion function with the smallest possible supremum norm. The principal investigator's approach is to minimize the integral-norms of the inner distortion, which in turn reduces to the study of n-harmonic mappings. The first natural questions, both from the theoretical and practical points of view, are whether the n-harmonic energy is finite and, if so, whether it assumes a minimum value among all homeomorphisms. Both of these questions are quite difficult, because no boundary conditions are imposed on the mappings, and only fragmentary answers exist thus far. One might expect that the energy minimizers would be noninjective. The principal investigator has discovered, however, that under natural additional assumptions the minimizers are homeomorphisms. The key here is the technique that Iwaniec and he developed when studying n-harmonic minimizers. In these studies the interplay between analysis and geometric topology is crucial.<br/><br/>Modern mathematics in general and mathematical analysis in particular rely more and more for their development on physical and geometric intuition. In recent years this trend has become more pronounced and has led to increased efforts by pure and applied mathematicians to abandon extreme generalizations and abstract concepts. This project, which lies at the interface of geometric function theory and nonlinear elasticity, is aligned with those efforts. It will certainly establish connections with many other areas of mathematics and with physics, some of which are already in place. It will entail serious collaborative research. Finally, it will broaden the participation of undergraduates in research activities.<br/>"

In recent work the PI has shown that ideas from hyperbolic and computational geometry could help resolve a question of classical analysis: how to efficiently compute conformal maps onto planar domains.  This work will be extended to new settings, and will be used to study problems arising in computational geometry, e.g., efficient generation of meshes with desirable properties. The PI will investigate the possible application of the carpenter's rule problem from computational geometry to an analysis problem about deforming chord-arc curves. He will also continue his work on the distortion properties of quasiconformal mappings and on the conformal welding problem.<br/><br/><br/>The PI, Christopher Bishop, will continue his investigations into the theory and computation of conformal and quasiconformal maps. Conformal maps send one region to another so that angles (but not necessarily distances) are preserved. Quasiconformal maps may distort angles, but only by a limited amount. One of the oldest and most famous examples is the Mercator projection which maps the spherical Earth to flat piece of paper. This can't be done without some sort of distortion, and for navigation it is more convenient to have angles preserved than distances (so looking at a chart you know the correct direction to head, if not the exact distance to be covered). Conformal maps also appear in many applications where one wants to transfer a problem from a domain with complicated geometry to a simpler one (such as a disk) where it is easier to solve. Examples come from aerodynamics, fluid flow, vibrating membranes, heat flow, electrostatics and many other problems. Conformal maps also play a fundamental role within pure mathematics in areas such as dynamics, complex analysis, probability and geometry. Because of their importance, there are numerous techniques for computing conformal maps numerically, but different methods work best in different situations and often a method fails for sufficiently complicated regions. The PI has developed an algorithm that is guaranteed to work for a large class of regions, and is able to estimate the time needed to achieve a given accuracy.  The algorithm is based on new connections between geometric concepts from computer science and non-Euclidean geometry arising in pure mathematics. Under the current proposal the PI will seek to turn this theoretical algorithm into a practical method, investigate generalizations more complicated regions and to higher dimensions, and apply the method to problems arising from computer science.<br/>"

The underlying theme behind many of the problems under investigation is the issue of interpolating functions, or more generally cross sections, on subspaces.  In this way, one can study functions on the spaces by applying the principle of mathematical induction with respect to the dimension of the space.  One of the main problems encountered in regard to the theory of interpolation and sampling (the same theory that gives us digital music and movie technology) is how to interpolate or sample data when the missing information has more than one degree of freedom.  This same problem represents a fundamental gap in many problems in algebraic geometry.  While some partial results are known, this project aims to uncover the key idea underlying the possibility of such interpolation and sampling.<br/><br/>Many of the problems to be addressed by this project, though fundamental to the fields of complex analysis and geometry in higher dimensions, require the creation and development of new ideas and techniques.  These new techniques will help to forge links between different areas of mathematics and will establish pathways to other areas of science, advancing knowledge not only in complex analysis and geometry, but also in algebraic and differential geometry, partial differential equations, topology, mathematical physics, and engineering systems and signal analysis. The collection of ideas that will be pursued lie close to the foundations of complex analysis and geometry. Consequently, there are many problems related to those met in the project that can serve as good thesis problems and problems for young Ph.D.'s. The principal investigator has three graduate students at the moment, and the research undertaken in the project will directly affect them. Because certain components of the research are especially amenable to elementary considerations, one finds in them problems that can teach basic research ideas to undergraduates and even to talented high-school students. The principal investigator has previously supervised REU students and enjoys the process.  Stony Brook also has a high-school outreach program with which he will be involved.  The principal investigator will continue to disseminate his work through publication, teaching of graduate courses, lecturing at conferences and seminars, and visiting colleagues in departments across the globe. He is also working on a book that presents a lot of background material in complex analytic geometry in a way suited to graduate students and complex analysts less familiar with geometric methods.  Finally, he is certain that some of the results of this project will eventually find their way into the toolboxes of engineers.<br/>"

This project aims to extend in a significant way known results concerning the tangential CR-operator and the associated system of partial differential equations. In general, this system does not have a unique solution, so the best that one can do is to find the unique square-integrable solution orthogonal to the null-space of the operator.  For this reason a fundamental object of study is the Szego projection operator, which is the orthogonal projection of the space of square-integrable functions onto the null space of the tangential CR-operator. This operator is well understood in the case of hypersurfaces in two-dimensional complex space that are of finite type (which means that they are not ""too flat""). Part of this project examines the Szego projection operator for infinite-type surfaces in two-space. The approach is to think of the operator in terms of integration against a kernel and then to estimate the kernel function. The methods used in the finite-type case do not extend to this setting, so new ideas are needed. The principal investigator also intends to study the kernel for the Szego projection operator for convex surfaces in higher dimensions. The operator is reasonably well understood in this situation, though previous approaches have used knowledge of the Bergman kernel rather than direct analysis of the integral kernel. An examination of the latter should give additional insight into the nonisotropic metric that arises in this case. Finally, the CR- operator itself will be studied for a model non-(pseudo)convex surface in complex two-space for which estimates on the Szego kernel exist, but for which little is known about the CR-operator itself.<br/><br/>Partial differential equations provide a powerful language for describing relationships between changing quantities. Some model heat flow, others are concerned with wave propagation, and yet others are just objects of study in their own right.  For any partial differential one is interested in solving for unknown functions in terms of given initial data. The objective is to determine conditions under which a solution exists, conditions under which a solution is unique, and relationships between the properties of the given data and properties of the solution. Although this project studies partial differential equations that are of fundamental interest in pure rather than applied mathematics, the new techniques developed will be much more broadly applicable.   <br/>"

There are several questions connected to the Corona problem that will be addressed.  First, questions about the Stable Rank of certain Banach algebras will be addressed.  This will have implications in Control Theory as well as Complex Analysis.  Second, questions related to the Operator Corona Theorem will be considered.  Results here will be both important in the one and several complex variable setting.  Additionally, there are hopes to extend some of the techniques to the several complex variable setting, which could shed light on the Corona problem there.  In terms of multi-parameter harmonic analysis, the questions that will be addressed are connected to important issues arising from higher commutators.  In a broad sense, the questions considered are an attempt to extend results from classical harmonic analysis to the multi-parameter setting.  This area of research has only recently opened.<br/><br/>The proposed research project fits into the general framework of understanding problems through the application of harmonic analysis.  In recent years, the full power of modern tools from harmonic analysis has been applied to problems in function theory and operator theory, with excellent results.  The Corona Problem is an abstract mathematical question about the algebraic structure of a function space.  Its answer and the techniques used in the solution have implications in other areas of analysis and applications in the real world.  It has proved to be a fundamental question in operator theory and has played an important role in questions from Control Theory.  Multi-parameter harmonic analysis is a very natural generalization of standard harmonic analysis.  However, this generalization provides a complex structure to many of the spaces and ideas that one finds in harmonic analysis.  Many of the tools of harmonic analysis are unavailable in the multi-parameter setting.  Only recently, questions in these areas have become more accessible due to new technical tools developed.  The full usefulness of these tools has yet to be explored and fully utilized.  These are both very important areas of analysis, with many important questions remaining.  Answers to the questions proposed would be extremely beneficial.  A deeper study of these areas is certainly warranted.  The above research will have broad impact on other areas of mathematics as well as to problems in the real world.  Harmonic analysis is an area inspired by applications.  Commutator estimates arise naturally in physics through the use of Div-Curl Lemmas in the study of electromagnetism via Maxwell's Equations.  Also, tools used in this proposal, in particular smooth wavelet systems, also have applications outside mathematics.  Recently, they have been utilized in National Security to compress biometric data such as fingerprints and have also found applications in medical imaging.<br/><br/>"

The main common feature of all these problems resides in their multi-linear nature. Of particular<br/>Interest, when dealing with a multi-linear operator acting on some product of Lebesgue spaces, is to understand the range of indices for which it is well behaved. In this proposal the focus is mainly on almost everywhere convergence, and thus inherently on the boundedness of the associated<br/>maximal operators. An important instance of multi-linearity is represented by the combinatorial averages such as Furstenberg's nonstandard averages and the averages on cubes. The convergence of such averages has deep implications for various Ramsey-type problems on integers and even on general abstract groups. A second type of multi-linear operators we plan to investigate is represented by the weighted averages and series, such as the ones appearing in the so-called ``return times theorems''. The analysis of these objects reveals striking connections between dynamics and time-frequency analysis, in particular between Birghoff's point-wise ergodic theorem and Carleson's result on the point-wise convergence of Fourier series.  <br/><br/>This proposed research is at the cutting edge of what is now being done in dynamical systems, harmonic analysis and arithmetic combinatorics. It is expected that the resolution of the questions advanced in this proposal will further the mathematical community's understanding of the connections between these areas, in particular between processes in harmonic analysis and their analogue in ergodic theory.

One project is to study the solutions of the full nonlinear system of Einstein equations in a weak gravitational wave regime. We will continue our work on the L2 curvature conjecture, asserting that a solution, metric g, of the Einstein vacuum equations Ric(g) = 0 can be locally extended whenever its curvature tensor is bounded in L2 . We will also study problem of stability of Minkowski space for models where gravity is coupled to matter fields. Another direction of investigation is to continue rigorous mathematical study of linear and nonlinear waves in the regime of strong gravitational fields. The project will also investigate problems of stability of topological solitons in classical field theories connected with models of Quantum Field Theory and Gauge Theory. We will concentrate on development of robust analysis methods for these models without requiring any complete integrability assumptions. We will investigate connections between infinite dimensional dynamics, generated by the above models, and geodesic motion induced on finite dimensional moduli spaces of static solutions associated with these equations. <br/><br/>The Einstein equations of General Relativity provide the main classical description of evolution of the physical space-time continuum. The study of mathematical and physical phenomena arising in General Relativity is of fundamental importance for cosmology. While the physical understanding of the subject has made rapid advancement and generated a number of outstanding conjectures; so far there have been relatively few rigorous mathematical results. To a large extent, this is due to the highly nonlinear nature of the Einstein equations and a lack of mathematical tools for analyzing them. This project will pursue the development of such mathematical tools and results and involves many mathematical issues at the interface of Analysis, Geometry and Partial Differential Equations. <br/><br/><br/>"

The latter topic especially represents largely uncharted territory. The principal investigator will explore it by considering fundamental results of the finite-dimensional theory and asking how they generalize to the infinite-dimensional setting. In some cases one already has a sense of what the generalization should be, and the challenge is actually to prove it; in other cases even the terms in which to formulate a generalization must be discovered. Two notions are central to the project. One is the concept of a complex loop space. Such a space is obtained by starting with a (finite-dimensional) complex manifold. The collection of all loops in this manifold is an infinite-dimensional complex manifold known as a complex loop space.  The other central idea is that of a cohesive sheaf, an infinite-dimensional generalization of the all-important coherent sheaves of the finite-dimensional theory that the principal investigator and a collaborator have recently introduced. A large part of the project is the study of these two notions, especially their confluence: namely, cohesive sheaves over loop spaces, and their cohomology groups. The project will also seek applications in other areas of mathematics for the results that the project expects to obtain.<br/><br/>The location of a point or point-mass in three-dimensional space can be described by its coordinates, that is, by three numbers. Accordingly, since Descartes we have known that curves and surfaces in space can be described by functions of three variables. Now to specify the position of a more complicated object, say a Frisbee, the three coordinates of its center of mass do not suffice. The orientation of its axis also has to be given, which will involve two more numbers. In the end, one needs five numbers to specify the position of the Frisbee, and one says that all possible positions of the Frisbee constitute a five-dimensional space (or manifold). The flight of the Frisbee through the air then corresponds to a curve in this manifold. Studying the positions of even more complicated (for example, hinged) objects, one is led to even higher dimensional manifolds, and, if the object lacks any rigidity -- think of a rubber band -- to infinite-dimensional ones. The project is concerned with fundamental properties of such infinite-dimensional manifolds and of the attendant functions of infinitely many variables. A main goal is to understand how local information on these manifolds and functions can be assembled into global information. The mathematical construct that tells us to what extent this is possible is called a sheaf cohomology group, and such groups will be the main objects of the research. Various components of this work have first arisen in other parts of mathematics and in theoretical physics (quantum field theory and string theory), so the project, if successful, should have some relevance to those disciplines. However, this is going to be fundamental research, and the principal investigator does not expect immediate applications outside mathematics. On the other hand, graduate students will be involved in the research. The project will thus contribute to the training of future researchers and educators.<br/>"

The classification of irreducible unitary representations of higher rank symplectic groups is an important open problem in mathematics and it has a wide range of applications in number theory, geometric quantization and harmonic analysis. In this project, the P.I. intends to construct and study irreducible unitary representations using invariant tensor product. The motivation comes from the theta correspondence. Due to the work of R. Howe and J-S Li, a large class of small unitary representations of the symplectic groups can be realized as invariant tensor products of the oscillator representation with unitary representations of the orthogonal groups. The proposed research deals with the invariant tensor products associated with elementary representations---unitarizable subquotients of representations on the Shilov boundary.  Due to the work of Sahi and many others, elementary representations fall into four classes: unitary principal series, complementary series, small constituents and large constituents. The principal investigator will study the behavior of the four types of invariant tensor functors associated to four classes of elementary representations and relate these invariant tensor functors to the unitary parabolic induction, complementary induction, Howe's correspondence and cohomological induction, respectively.  This unified approach should shed lights on the structure of the unitary dual of the universal covering of the symplectic group. Other classical groups will be treated as time allows.<br/><br/>A Lie group is a fundamental object used in mathematics to describe continuous symmetries. The theory of Lie group representations provides a mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics.

Despite more than two centuries of mathematical analysis of these complicated nonlinear equations, the local well-posedness of these systems of moving boundary PDE for inviscid compressible and incompressible fluids remains a significant challenge.  This includes a single mass of fluid moving in vacuum as well as multi-phase immiscible fluids separated by surfaces of discontinuity. Recently, the PI of this proposed research effort has developed a novel approach to well-posedness theories for moving interface problems in fluids such as the 3D incompressible free-surface Euler equations with or without surface tension on the boundary, and coupled fluid-structure interaction problems.  The fundamental idea relies on new anisotropic smoothing operators which permit approximations of the Euler equations that retain the geometric structures of transport and boundary regularity, and for which existence of smooth solutions is provable.  The proposal addresses the well-posedness of the motion of a compressible gas in vacuum, modeled by the free-boundary compressible Euler equations with density vanishing at the boundary; well-posedness of vortex sheets and surfaces of discontinuity; and well-posedness for the motion of a relativistic fluid in vacuum, modeled by the Euler-Einstein equations.  No irrotationality simplifications will be made in the analysis so that the full range of fluid motion can be considered.<br/><br/><br/>Multiphase fluid flows with moving interfaces, modeled by the Euler equations, play a central role in a multitude of physical and engineering applications, ranging from the creation of hurricanes due to wind blowing on top of the ocean surface to the atomization of liquid fuel jets in combustion chambers to the motion of astrophysical bodies such as gaseous stars. The analytical understanding gained from this work may have important ramifications in the understanding of basic physical phenomena, which is heretofore, poorly understood.  In addition to basic wave motion and mixing that occurs in the motion of interfaces between water and air, other conventional examples include the interface between air and helium under shock wave interaction, the Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities between two gases, the behavior of a gas bubble in a liquid in a shock wave, and liquid fuels which are usually burned by first atomizing a fuel jet to increase the surface area and hence the evaporation rate. We can also add the prediction of spray behavior, for which the initial atomization is both the most critical and the least understood aspect of the spray.  Understanding the short-time nonlinear balance that occurs in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability should be quite important for the understanding of jets, which become unstable when capillary effects are large due to waves longer than the diameter, thus breaking up into a stream of relatively large drops.<br/>"

It is also proposed to push beyond ergodic theory for some families of rational maps with extra geometric structure and give more detailed, pointwise descriptions of dynamics.<br/><br/>Mathematical laws for an evolving system typically prescribe the way the system changes.  If the present state of the system is known, then such laws tell one what happens in the following instant. However, the distant future of the system, while in principle predictable from the same laws, is in practice often impossible to know: computations involved in making predictions can be overwhelming, or the computations can amplify small uncertainties in data about the present, so that predictions become hopelessly vague. Miraculously in such situations, one can often employ less direct means to obtain a rough probabilistic picture of the future. For instance, detailed knowledge of today's weather and the laws of physics will allow one to know the particulars of tomorrow's weather with some confidence, but they will avail one little in predicting the weather a year from tomorrow.  Nevertheless, knowing only that today's date is Jan 1st, one can reasonably bet that it will be chill!<br/> y a year from today in Minneapolis.  Understanding trends of this sort from a mathematical standpoint is called ergodic theory, and that is the subject of the research described in this proposal.

Elements of a given Banach space can be approximated by linear  combinations of elements  drawn from  a Schauder basis or  from a redundant system such as a frame or a dictionary. The approximants are typically selected by a greedy algorithm such as the Dual Greedy, X-Greedy , or Thresholding Greedy Algorithms. The project will study  the convergence of such algorithms  in the norm or the weak topology of the Banach space.  An important open problem in this area  is  to show that the X-Greedy Algorithm converges in Lebesgue spaces. Convergence results for greedy algorithms  are connected to geometrical properties of  the underlying Banach space such as uniform smoothness or the Kadets-Klee property. They are also connected to  ``partial  unconditionality'' properties of the underlying system such as  quasi-greediness. An important related  problem in Banach space theory which will be studied  is to show that certain absolute constants  (the Elton constants) which arise naturally in the study of partial unconditionality are uniformly bounded. A second set of problems in this project concerns coefficient quantization in Banach spaces. The goal is to replace arbitrary real  coefficients (with respect to  some underlying system)  by  coefficients that are selected  from a  finite ``alphabet''  using  some algorithmic procedure.  Building on recent results in the case of a Schauder basis,   existence of systems  with  desirable quantization properties will be connected to the  geometry of the underlying Banach space.<br/> <br/>A Banach space is a collection of ``vectors'' which can be added together or multiplied by numbers to form other vectors. There is  a concept of ``distance'' between vectors which is analogous to the everyday notion of distance  between points in the three-dimensional Banach space which we inhabit. There is a wide range of  Banach spaces of importance in both pure and applied mathematics which can be distinguished from   each other by ``geometrical'' properties such as ``smoothness''  or  ``convexity''. Mathematicians have found that Banach spaces  provide the appropriate framework in which to formulate major areas of mathematics such as Harmonic Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, and Functional Analysis. Banach spaces are also  used by scientists and engineers  to model problems in applied areas such as fluid mechanics, signals processing,  image compression, and the pricing of financial derivatives. An individual vector belonging to a given Banach space is usually identified by an  infinite  string of numbers called  ``coefficients'' . The problem of data compression  is to select the most significant coefficients and to discard the rest. The problem of analog to digital conversion is to  ``quantize'' the selected coefficients by binary numbers in such a way that the quantized vector is a good approximation to the ``target'' vector.  The geometry of the underlying Banach space will play an important part in the development of effective algorithms for  implementing such procedures.

The proposed strategy in this case draws on new degenerate Kreiss symmetrizers for the vortex sheet problem and a calculus of singular paradifferential operators that has already proved useful in studying highly oscillatory multidimensional shocks.   We would also study long-time stability of multidimensional curved shocks, and investigate the effects of curvature on stability. Another goal is to study the existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions (like strong detonations) to the Chapman-Jouget and ZND models of combustion, and to clarify when and how well solutions to these simplified models approximate true exact solutions of the full  Navier-Stokes combustion system. <br/><br/>There is a vast applied literature on these topics in which the arguments are often merely formal and not rigorous.  Until relatively recently these topics have resisted careful mathematical analysis, particularly in the more complex multidimensional case.    It is important to complement the formal work with rigorous analysis not only to insure the correctness of the formal work, but also because the rigorous analysis provides new insight, new analytical tools, and sometimes uncovers unexpected phenomena.  In recent work by the proposer, his collaborators, and others new tools have become available that permit a rigorous study of the highly singular perturbation problems that arise in investigating the stability of shocks, detonations, and vortex sheets. <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>"

The equations under consideration typically admit nonlinear bound states (solitons or instantons) and much research has recently been devoted to the perturbative analysis of such solutions. It is well known that solutions of nonlinear Schroedinger and wave equations of the focusing type may blow up in finite time (if the energy of the data is negative, for example). It turns out, however, that global solutions exist if the data belong to a submanifold of finite co-dimension (a ""center-stable"" manifold in the language of dynamical systems). We shall investigate whether there is a manifold that divides a region of blow-up from one of scattering. Our goal is to obtain a deeper understanding of blow-up phenomena. Recently, progress was made for the critical wave-map equation into the two-dimensional sphere with regard to blow-up. It can be shown in a very precise and quantitative way that blow-up for this equation occurs through the bubbling off of energy via a non-constant harmonic map. Moreover, it turns out that the blow-up rate can be prescribed a priori. Similar phenomena occur for the semi-linear energy critical focusing equation in three plus one dimensions. Currently we do not understand which classes of equations admit this kind of phenomenon.<br/><br/>Much of the success of science and engineering lies with its effective use of mathematical tools, both in terms of modeling and for computational simulation. The nonlinear Schroedinger equation arises in various applications in optics where a bound state (soliton) for represents a particle, or beam, that travels for a long time without disintegrating. An important issue is to understand the stability or instability of these solitons. That is, whether they persist under small perturbations or not?  The theoretical understanding of these issues is very difficult, and is requiring new insights into mathematical problems. This project will investigate these problems and develop methods that may be used by practicing scientists and engineers.<br/>"

It dates back to the 19th century, when it was developed by such mathematicians as Gauss, Lobachevsky, Klein, and Poincare.  These fields remain vital, as attested by the recent epochal results of G. Perelman on the Poincare and Geometrization  Conjectures. As mathematics is inherently interconnected, surprising and beautiful applications are often found at the interfaces of mathematical fields.

These asymptotic problems arise when a dimensionless parameter (such as the Reynolds number or the ratio between the electron thermal speed and the speed of light) goes to zero or to infinity.  In studying these problems, many mathematical difficulties arise.  These difficulties are mainly   due to the change of the type of the equations, the presence of many temporal and spatial scales, the presence of resonances, the presence of boundary layers, ... .  Many tools have been developed to circumvent these difficulties such as the introduction of different types of measures to describe the defect of strong convergence, the use of compensated compactness type arguments, the use of averaging lemma, the use of energy methods and relative entropy methods, ... .  New tools will be developed in this work. Hopefully, they can be applied to other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>The study of these problems is very important to get a better understanding about the behavior of complicated systems in different limiting cases. This also allows an improved understanding of the real physical phenomena taking place.  It also gives a better knowledge about the domain of validity of each simplifying model. This is very important for engineers and physicists who are looking for the simplest model that captures the phenomena to implement numerically or to apply in real life.  One of these problems is the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann equation when the Knudsen number goes to 0 especially in bounded domains.  Formally, the limit equation (Euler system, Navier-Stokes, ...) depends on additional  parameters such as the Mach number, the Reynolds number and the  time scaling.  In particular, one of the goals of the project is to understand fluid boundary conditions from kinetic ones. This is a step towards understanding the coupling at the boundary between fluid equations and kinetic equations.  Of course this is a very important question for numerical simulations when we have to go from a domain where a kinetic model is being used to a domain where a fluid model is being used.  Besides, another goal of this project is the study of some non-Newtonian fluids and especially polymeric liquids (egg white, blood or dough for example).  These systems require a coupling between fluids and polymers and are of great interest in many branches of applied physics, chemistry and biology.<br/>"

First, the PI will continue her study of the Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) equation, and address questions related to generalized orbits and multi-Hamiltonian structures for the finite system, as well as their connection to the analogous Toda lattice problems. She is also interested in finding the solution of AL with periodic boundary conditions, and in the study of critical phenomena for the NLS equation, viewed as a continuum limit of the AL equation. Second, building on her work on matrix models for general beta-ensembles, the PI plans to investigate the asymptotic properties of these models via the approach of Adler and van Moerbeke. This describes various eigenvalue statistics of the model as solutions of completely integrable systems; so far, only the cases with beta equal to 1, 2 or 4 have been studied, and general beta-ensembles have never been used in this context. Finally, the PI plans to investigate, jointly with P. Deift, the question of long-time asymptotics for solutions of the water-wave problem with rough data, in the small amplitude/long wavelength regime. In their investigation, they will treat the problem as a perturbation of a completely integrable PDE, the KdV equation, and use the associated scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert techniques to control the perturbation. In particular, a first step in this project is the rigorous treatment of the long-time asymptotics for the KdV equation with Sobolev initial data. <br/><br/>The research described in this proposal concerns classical problems in two of the most active fields in mathematics, random matrix theory and integrable systems. One of the most fascinating scientific developments over the last fifty years has been the discovery that a wide variety of mathematical and physical phenomena are modeled by the eigenvalues of a random matrix. In particular, random matrix theory describes the scattering of neutrons off large nuclei, the statistics of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line in the complex plane, as well as problems in the ""real world"", such as the bus scheduling in the city of Cavalierness in Mexico, or distances between cars on the freeway. The goal of the PI's proposed research is to describe the asymptotic properties of certain matrix ensembles which model some of the phenomena described above. Another part of the proposal is concerned with studying the properties of two remarkable evolution equations: The first is the Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) equation, which is a discrete version of the well-known nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS). Beyond their theoretical interest, both of the aforementioned equations have numerous scientific applications, one of the most important of which is in optics. The PI approaches the study of the AL equation using the methods from the theories of orthogonal polynomials and completely integrable systems. Finally, the PI proposes to study the water wave equation in a regime which can be used to model tsunamis, by further developing the method of nonlinear stationary phase used in the treatment of Riemann-Hilbert problems. <br/>"

The first project will study symbolic coding procedures for flows on homogeneous spaces. Based on previous joint work with S. Katok, the PI intends to continue the study of symbolic coding for noncompact surfaces of constant negative curvature with finite volume and their connections with continued fractions algorithms. Another objective is the existence of a feasible symbolic coding (multidimensional shift space of finite type) for dynamical systems obtained from higher rank abelian actions of Lie groups with the goal of obtaining a better understanding of the possible invariant measures for such actions. The novelty of this approach is the fact that the invariant measures will be obtained from the symbolic representation of the corresponding action. In recent years, questions from number theory, statistical mechanics and computer science have been solved using the above mathematical tools and results. A second direction of research is in the area of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems (or systems with nonzero Lyapunov exponents). The PI plans to study the existence of invariant measures of maximal entropy and to establish precise asymptotic estimates for the number of periodic orbits for such systems with additional dynamical properties (like invariant cone families). A third direction of research is on applications of the theory of chaotic dynamical systems to population models. In previous joint work with H. Weiss, complicated (chaotic) behaviors and several bifurcation routes have been documented for a class of density dependent population models with fertility rates depending exponentially or polynomially on the total population. The goal of the current project is to prove rigorously the existence of chaotic attractors and physical measures for such systems.<br/><br/>A successful outcome of the first project will find important applications to number theory and statistical mechanics, while the second project will deepen the theoretical understanding of systems with nonzero Lyapunov exponents, and will be beneficial to those scientists that try to explain the existence of complicated behavior in physical models. The outcome of the third project will have an impact on population biologists and demographers, since it will rigorously demonstrate that chaotic behavior is a certainty in several classes of population models. The results will help developing better suitable mathematical models for population projections. The proposed research topics will also contribute to the mathematical education of undergraduate and Master's students at DePaul University, in part by lectures by the investigator, and in part by students working on some of these topics and related subjects.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Interface problems in magneto-hydro-dynamics are central to the theoretical and practical study of producing energy by fusion.  The free boundary problems to be studied in this project may shed light on the instabilities present in the magnetic fields used  for confining plasmas.

We will focus on the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian, the thin obstacle problem, nonlinear integro-differential operators, and optimal design of composites. The obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian is closely linked to lower dimensional obstacle problems, as the PI has recently shown in collaborative work. Thus these two problems will be investigated together. The PI also intends to generalize the concepts of viscosity solutions, well-posedness, and regularity results from the theory of fully nonlinear elliptic equations to nonlinear integro-differential equations. The PI intends to apply ideas from free boundary problems to some questions about composite design in materials science. The microstructures that maximize a certain effective quantity, or a combination of such, may sometimes be found by solving a free boundary problem. Analysis of this problem will provide a better understanding of these optimal structures.<br/><br/>The free boundary problems studied in this project arise in elasticity, financial mathematics, and composite material design. The obstacle problem is originally a model for the shape of an elastic membrane resting on a solid body. The same equation is used in financial mathematics for pricing American options. When stock prices have large jumps they may be modeled using discontinuous processes; this results in an obstacle problem for an integro-differential operator. The research proposed here studies the qualitative properties of the solutions of this problem as well as general nonlinear problems arising from stochastic games driven by random processes with jumps. Related ideas are also applied to the design of composite materials.  Suitable free boundary problems enable the analysis of the microscopic structures that are optimal for certain purposes, such as to maximize  the sum of the thermal and electric conductivity in a material.<br/><br/><br/>"

Specific topics include the branching of quasiregular maps, quasiconformal Jacobians, and the boundary behavior of p-harmonic functions.  Quasiregular maps are geometrical generalizations of analytic functions from the complex plane to Euclidean spaces. Problems on branching properties of smooth quasiregular mappings lie at the intersection of geometric function theory and topology, and, they have close connections to the existence of snowflake embeddings, quasiconformal decomposition and extension, and refinement of quasiconformal structures on compact manifolds. The quasiconformal Jacobian problem studies the possibility of, and the method for, reconstructing quasiconformal maps from assigned volume ratios. Both quasiconformal and quasiregular maps have the characteristic of bounded distortion and are solutions to equations related to the n-Laplacian. When p is different from 2, because of the nonlinearity and the degeneracy of the p-Laplace equation the nature of its solutions is still largely a mystery. A recent example of the principal investigator and her collaborators suggests that solutions to the p-Laplacian may exhibit even worse behavior than previously shown by Wolff and Lewis. In this project, the principal investigator will continue to investigate the dimension of the support of the p-harmonic measure, the size of the associated Fatou sets, and the growth of solutions to the p-harmonic equation when the boundary functions exhibit rapidly increasing frequencies. Methods from probability will be used to handle some of the analytical difficulties.

The p-Laplacian occurs both in the porous medium equation from fluid dynamics and in nonlinear elasticity. For this reason it has applications to many physical problems. The project in this proposal deals with intrinsic properties of functions of bounded distortion and solutions of nonlinear equations. The findings will likely play an important role in the aforementioned applications.<br/>"

In the mid-eighties Margulis, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak used deep results from the theory of automorphic forms (Selberg's 3/16 theorem, proved Ramanujan<br/>conjectures) to give explicit constructions of expanders as Cayley graphs of finite groups with respect to very special choices of generators.  A basic problem, formulated by Lubotzky and Weiss, is to what extent being an expander family is a property of the groups alone, independent of the choice of generators. The first project of the principal investigator will be devoted to addressing this problem and  constructing new robust families of expanders using recently developed tools from additive combinatorics. The second project of the principal investigator builds on the recent joint work with Bourgain and Sarnak, in which expanders were used to obtain novel sieving results towards non-abelian generalizations of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. The general problem addressed in the second project involves sieving for primes (or almost-primes) on an orbit of a group generated by finitely many polynomial maps; application of combinatorial Brun sieve depends crucially on the expansion property of the ""congruence graphs"" associated with the orbit. The third project of the principal investigator is devoted to studying from a unified point of view one of the basic conjectures pertaining to expander graphs and one of the basic conjectures in the theory of Quantum Chaos. A basic conjecture in the theory of expander graphs asserts that many families of groups are expanding with respect to random choices of generators (Independence Conjecture for random generators). A basic conjecture in Quantum Chaos, formulated by Bohigas, Giannoni, and Shmit, asserts that the eigenvalues of a quantized chaotic Hamiltonian behave like the spectrum of a typical member of the appropriate ensemble of random matrices. Both conjectures can be viewed as asserting that a deterministically constructed spectrum ""generically""  behaves like the spectrum of a large random matrix: ""in the bulk"" (Quantum Chaos<br/>Conjecture) and at the  ""edge of the spectrum"" <br/>(Independence Conjecture).  The principal investigator will work on proving these conjectures in the context of the spectra of elements in  group rings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanders are highly-connected sparse graphs widely used in Computer Science, in areas ranging from parallel computation to complexity theory and cryptography.  In the early seventies, following Pinsker's observation that <br/>random sparse   graphs are expanders, Margulis gave  the <br/>first explicit group-theoretic construction of expanders;  in the late eighties  Margulis, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak constructed celebrated Ramanujan graphs (optimal expanders from spectral point of view)  using deep number-theoretic results. In the ensuing years the scope and depth of applications of expanders has dramatically increased; over the past decade several completely new and unexpected lines of  development have emerged and the field has undergone explosive growth.  The principal investigator plans to pursue three projects centered on expanders and involving mutually beneficial interactions between arithmetic, group theory and combinatorics. The first project is devoted to constructing new robust families of expanders using recently developed tools from additive combinatorics.  In the second project expanders will be used to obtain novel sieving results, thus partially repaying the debt of computer science to number theory. <br/>The third  project is devoted to studying connections between expander graphs and random matrices. The  principal investigator will  direct research by graduate students on the problems related to the three projects described above and will design and teach graduate courses in additive combinatorics and random matrix theory, as well as an undergraduate course devoted to applications and constructions of expander graphs. He will also direct undergraduate research projects, involving a mix of numerical experimentation, analyzing data, background reading, and theoretical work. In addition, the principal investigator will organize meetings bringing together Bay Area researchers and graduate students for a day of talks and informal discussions, leading to long-term collaborations in research and education.<br/><br/>"

They are a system of hyperbolic conservation laws that model the dynamics of compressible fluids. Part 1 of the project will investigate the global existence of spherically symmetric solutions of the multi-dimensional isentropic Euler equations, assuming only the natural bounds of finite mass and total energy. A compactness framework will be developed that can also be applied to other situations where the geometry of the problem plays an important role, such as nozzle flows and shallow water flows over complex topographies. It is well-known that the main difficulty in the analysis of hyperbolic conservation laws comes from the occurrence of jump discontinuities, ie  shocks. The second and third part of this project will therefore focus on issues related to shock formation. After a shock appears, the important issue is how does the solution continue? Since weak solutions are typically non-unique, a selection criterion is required to single out the relevant behavior among all possible continuations. Part 2 of this project will propose a new variational selection principle for the multi-dimensional isentropic Euler equations and study its implications. The selection principle is inspired by the interpretation of certain parabolic equations as abstract gradient flows on spaces of probability measures. Part 3 of this project will probe the regularity of weak solutions of conservation laws, both in terms of the function spaces to which they belong, and in terms of the fine structure of singularities. One goal is to show that shocks are located in a codimension-one rectifiable set, and that the conserved quantities admit strong traces along the shock set.<br/><br/>Important processes in both the natural sciences and engineering can be modeled by multi-dimensional systems of hyperbolic conservation laws. They are first order partial differential equations in divergence form. Typically these processes exhibit some sort of propagation and interaction of waves and conservation of certain quantities such as mass or momentum. Since these phenomena are ubiquitous in nature, systems of hyperbolic conservation laws can be found in fields as diverse as physics, geophysics, environmental sciences, meteorology, epidemiology, and biology. In this project, we will  study the particular equations which model the dynamics of inviscid, compressible fluids, and which are a system of hyperbolic conservation laws. These equations have a long and rich history starting with the work of Daniel Bernoulli and Leonard Euler in the eighteenth century. Despite their enormous importance for both theory and applications, and the fact that their numerical treatment has reached a high level of sophistication, the mathematical theory of the Euler equations is still incomplete. It is the goal of this project to better understand this fundamental system of conservation laws.<br/>"

Standard Sierpinski carpets are obtained from a square in the plane using simple iterative procedures. The first step involves a subdivision of the square into smaller squares and the removal of the interior of one or more of these smaller squares that do not touch each other or the original outer square. The procedure is repeated on each of the smaller squares that remain, and the steps are repeated infinitely. The topological properties of Sierpinski carpets have been well understood since the 1950s, especially after Whyburn gave a topological characterization of such sets. For example, all standard Sierpinski carpets as just described are homeomorphic to each other. However, under quasisymmetric maps, which are maps between metric spaces closely related to quasiconformal maps, Sierpinski carpets exhibit much more rigidity. For example, there are pairs of standard Sierpinski carpets that are not quasisymmetrically equivalent. The two most important questions for Sierpinski carpets addressed in the project are the questions of uniformization and rigidity. Regarding uniformization, the project studies whether a given space is quasisymmetrically equivalent to a model space, and as to rigidity, it investigates whether two given spaces are quasisymmetrically equivalent.<br/><br/>The project addresses questions in the area of analysis on metric spaces (sets in which there is a notion of distance). The techniques used to attack these questions originate in complex analysis. Complex analysis, in turn, has roots in physics and engineering, in particular in fluid mechanics and electrical engineering, and historically has provided tools and methods for attacking problems that arise in those areas. Within mathematics  the Sierpinski carpets under investigation in the project arise in analysis as sets of fractal dimension, in dynamics as Julia sets, in the theory of Kleinian groups as limit sets, and in geometry as boundaries at infinity of Gromov hyperbolic groups, to mention a few examples. If carried out successfully, the project would have implications for the theory of Gromov hyperbolic groups that are studied in the area of mathematics known as geometric group theory. In particular, the principal investigator hopes that the project would provide clues to the Kapovich-Kleiner conjecture, which is a classification statement for Gromov hyperbolic groups whose boundaries are continuous deformations of standard Sierpinski carpets. Applications of fractal sets, such as Sierpinski carpets, have been found in physics, engineering, and more recently in atmospheric science and geoscience. For example, fractal shapes have recently been used to create fractal antennas that not only have unprecedented frequency coverage and versatility but also are very compact. The principal investigator hopes that understanding geometric properties of fractal spaces will lead to a better understanding of fractal physical objects or objects modeled on fractal spaces, such as fractal antennas, and that this in turn will lead to other applications.<br/>"

A special emphasis is given to gases of particles (disks) of different masses and/or sizes, where the number and/or the masses of some particles grow to infinity. The approach involves rescaling time and space in order to apply the scheme known in statistical physics as the ""hydrodynamical limit.""

In particular, he will investigate problems in the following general categories: distribution theory, differential equations, quantum mechanics, the energy Laplacian, spectra of Laplacians, energy and Laplacians on the Hilbert gasket, and the method of outer approximation (a new method of constructing fractal<br/>Laplacians recently introduced by the P.I.).  Some of the research will involve ""experimental mathematics"" to be carried out in collaboration with undergraduate students (mainly REU students).<br/><br/> Mathematical analysis provides scientists with the tools to model real world phenomena.  However, classical analysis makes the tacit assumption that the underlying space is smooth.  The real world is filled with rough objects.  In recent years, mathematical analysts have attempted to construct theories of differential equations on rough spaces.  Fractals give examples of spaces that are both extremely rough and yet have a great deal of structure that allows the development of an analytic theory.  One approach was pioneered by Jun Kigami in Japan and intensely developed by the P.I. and his colleagues.  This theory has produced a deep understanding of certain idealized examples, such as the Sierpinski gasket and related spaces. Although these spaces are far too symmetric to occur in objects in the natural word, they have already appeared in manmade objects (antennas, and nanomolecules).  This project will continue the mathematical development of the theory of these key examples, and also broaden the theory to encompass wider classes of fractals, with the hope of developing tools that can be used in modeling naturally occurring objects.  Part of the project will involve the emerging methodology of ""experimental mathematics"", in which computer simulations are used to explore mathematical questions in the hope of formulating conjectures that may eventually lead to conventional mathematical proofs.

They include the two-dimensional wave maps equation into hyperbolic space, the mass-critical defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the mass-critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation.  The very recent breakthroughs on this area, including Bourgain's induction-on-energy argument and the successes of concentration-compactness methods, as well as the recently completely resolution of the global regularity problem for the energy-critical nonlinear Schrodinger equation suggest that the resolution of these problems are now within reach.<br/><br/>Many wave phenomena in physics (e.g. light, water, sound, gravity, etc.) are described using nonlinear partial differential equations. These equations often encode a struggle between dispersion, which acts to spread out the wave and make it decay over time, and nonlinearity, which can instead cause the wave to concentrate and even to develop singularities (or ""blow up"") in relatively short periods of time. An important class of equations are the ""critical"" equations, in which the dispersion and the nonlinearity are in some sense exactly balanced against each other.  It is generally believed that if the nonlinearity has a ""defocusing"" nature then the dispersion should eventually ""win"", and no singularities will form, whereas the converse should be true in the ""focusing"" case.  Until very recently, this intuition was only confirmed for a handful of critical equations but, in the last few years, some powerful new technical tools have been developed which should now allow us to prove results about a much larger range of critical equations.  This project will pursue such issues for some specific and well-known equations arising in physics.<br/>"

Other problems resemble traditional variational inequalities, but lack an inequality constraint. For those problems, the main approach is based on application of rather deep monotonicity formulas (sometimes more than one) that allow the proof of results similar to those for variational inequalities associated with obstacle problems. Moreover the free boundaries often have remarkable properties, sometimes akin to those of minimal surfaces.<br/>  <br/>Free boundary problems involve equations (or systems of equations) that are satisfied in a region that is unknown apriori. The boundary of the region where the equation holds is called the free boundary and is generally characterized by extra side conditions.  The solution of the problem involves identifying both the solution of the equation and the region with the free boundary. Free boundary problems arise in applications ranging from potential theory and geometry to optimal control, robotics, and superconductivity. <br/><br/>"

Typical examples are crystalline structures, or the movements of the arm of a robot. Models of sub-Riemannian spaces appear in diverse areas of both pure and applied sciences. These include harmonic analysis, several complex variables, group representation, calculus of variations and control theory, geometry (collapsing of Riemannian spaces, CR geometry), geometric measure theory, (Alexandrov spaces,  Lie group theory, complex manifolds), quantum mechanics, robotics, mathematical finance, material sciences (crystalline structures), medicine (neurophysiology of the cerebral cortex). The development of analysis and geometry during the past century has been greatly influenced by questions arising from the analysis of systems of partial differential equations; often nonlinear  systems. While most of these problems have by now been settled in the classical Euclidean or Riemannian settings, their sub-Riemannian counterparts presently form a body of fundamental and challenging new directions in mathematics. The appropriate mathematical formulation of the problems at hand involves the framework of sub-Riemannian spaces, whose basic prototype is the Heisenberg group (also known to physicists as Weyl group). The class of Carnot groups, <br/>is the geometric framework for most problems to be studied under this award. Specific topics include (i) To continue the study of minimal surfaces with particular emphasis on <br/>the Bernstein problem and on the question of their regularity including Poincare-Sobolev inequalities and Liouville type theorems on minimal surfaces; (ii) The development of a regularity theory for new variational inequalities with non-holonomic constraints arising in various branches of the applied sciences and the investigation of monotonicity formulas for the relevant constrained energies associated with these problems; (iii) Isoperimetric inequalities for the Gaussian measures associated with the heat semigroup; (iv) To continue the development of the theory of convexity in connection with a maximum principle of Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci type; (v) To investigate a CR positive mass theorem using the theory of minimal surfaces; (vi) To study the sharp interior regularity of solutions of nonlinear subelliptic equations.<br/><br/><br/> The basic laws that describe most natural phenomena are usually stated as partial differential equations or systems of equations. An understanding of the physical world also requires use of the underlying geometric structure. The present proposal belongs to the mainstream of research which sits at the confluence of the theory of partial differential equations with an emerging type of geometry, called sub-Riemannian geometry. Both theories have witnessed an explosion of interest in the last decade and now attract the interest of various schools of mathematicians both in the US and abroad. Under this award we will investigate problems from mathematical physics and geometry  where symmetry plays an important role. Symmetry is present everywhere in nature, including in the fundamental laws of gravitation and electrostatic attraction. The study of conditions under which a natural phenomenon develops symmetries has both  practical consequences and intrinsic interest.<br/><br/>"

These are rich subjects, developed over the past 30 years, which have an enormous body of important applications: in heat kernel analysis, probability theory, analysis on manifolds and Lie groups, geometric group theory, and operator algebras (free probability in particular). Both functional inequalities have made significant impact both in classical and non-commutative analytic settings; each debuted in one realm and eventually found application in the other (the log Sobolev inequality moving from global analysis to non-commutative geometry, the Haagerup inequality in the other direction). Dr. Kemp's research focuses on some new and unexpected combinatorial aspects of both inequalities, particularly in the setting of analysis on holomorphic space (both classical and non-commutative). He intends to significantly extend his ideas in this subject through several projects both in global analysis (in Segal-Bargmann spaces, spaces of subharmonic functions, and spaces of sections of vector bundles) and on the non-commutative side, primarily in free probability theory.  In particular, through the deep connections between free probability and random matrix theory, Dr. Kemp hopes to exploit computational matrix techniques to address some of the harder questions relating to the extremals of these functional inequalities, and extend some of his results beyond their current combinatorial limitations.<br/><br/>The principal intent of this NSF Proposal is to study some important aspects of the mathematical theory of heat flow and entropy. One of the most interesting ideas in recent mathematical analysis is the realization that the way in which heat flows in an object is intimately related to the global geometry of the object. For example, think of a white-hot pin being placed on a large, cool plane. The heat will diffuse quickly at first, then more slowly, over the plane, bringing the whole system eventually to the same temperature. This is not the way heat flows, for example, from a large meteorite impact on the surface of the Earth. The global geometry of the planet comes into effect; the energy from the impact travels around the world and back again, interacting with itself in a complicated fashion. Shortly after the impact the heat diffusion is similar to the pin's, but after a while, studying the heat flow gives clues to the global shape of the planet. (It's round!) One way to study heat flow, and therefore give geometric information, is through entropy the tendency of systems to disorder. One important theorem in Dr. Kemp's research, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, asserts that, in a wide range of geometric settings, the rate of entropy is controlled by the total energy of the system, in a precise manner which is tied to global geometry. <br/><br/>"

The purpose of the conference is to bring together mathematicians whose interests in this field arise in many very different ways, to learn about recent work and about open problems that remain. The fundamental questions are analytic in nature: understanding the spectra of group-invariant differential operators, for example, or inversion formulas for Radon transforms. Yet progress on these questions has often involved sophisticated tools from other parts of mathematics: the relationship created by Harish-Chandra between asymptotic expansions of spherical functions on semisimple groups and Verma modules for the Lie algebra; the relationship between annihilators of generalized Verma modules and the image of the Radon transform; or Helgason's conjecture relating eigenfunctions on symmetric spaces to principal series representations. In each of these cases, and in many more like them, there are deep and unexpected connections between questions of harmonic analysis, of group theory, and of algebra. As a result, none of these subjects makes sense without an understanding of the others.  Unfortunately, mathematical specialization can make these connections harder to see. Representation theory was created for harmonic analysis; yet students and young mathematicians often learn it as a purely algebraic subject, and miss both the meaning and the power that the roots in analysis can provide. In the same way, individuals studying function spaces and differential equations may be unaware of algebraic tools that are available.  The conference at the University of Iceland provides a unique opportunity for young people to get a broad picture of harmonic analysis on homogeneous spaces.<br/>This award will provide funding for travel and lodging for up to twelve invited participants from the US, and for about twelve more participants from the US.<br/>The invited participants were chosen by the organizing committee.

Non-isotropic wavelet theory in higher dimensions has a potential for wide applications both in pure analysis and more applied areas of signal and image processing comparable to that of already well established isotropic wavelet theory. The main goal of the project is to integrate research and education activities in the multidimensional wavelet theory which could make further applications of non-isotropic wavelets possible.<br/>"

These are squares of inclusions of finite dimensional C*-algebras that arise naturally in the standard invariant of a subfactor. Commuting squares can also be used as construction data for subfactors, and the most explicit examples of subfactors have been obtained this way. By using a combination of algebraic-combinatorial and analytic methods, the PI proved several finiteness results for commuting squares and found a good notion of primeness (in the sense of isolation) for these objects. The isolation results obtained suggest methods of constructing one-parameter families of non-isomorphic subfactors. The PI will continue to investigate such constructions, especially those coming from commuting squares based on complex Hadamard matrices. Planar algebra techniques will be used to understand these models, as well as other subfactors constructed from commuting squares. The other direction of Nicoara's research is the study of von Neumann algebras from the point of view of non-commutative ergodic theory, especially applications of rigidity in the context of von Neumann algebras.<br/><br/> In 1930's John von Neumann discovered that certain algebras of operators on a Hilbert space are the natural framework for understanding symmetries of quantum physical systems. His ideas play an important role in quantum mechanics, and fundamental laws of nature such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle appear as a natural consequence of von Neumann's abstract theory. In the early 80's Vaughan Jones introduced the theory of subfactors, as a Galois theory for inclusions of von Neumann algebras. Subfactor theory quickly became one of the most flourishing branches of operator algebra theory, with a multitude of deep connections in knot theory, representation theory, 3-manifolds, quantum groups, integrable systems in statistical mechanics and conformal field theory.  A subfactor can be viewed as a group-like object that encodes what one might call the generalized symmetries of a quantum physical or mathematical situation. To decode this information, one computes the higher relative commutants, a system of inclusions of finite dimensional C*-algebras naturally associated to the subfactor. This object, called the standard invariant, has an extraordinarily rich algebraic-combinatorial structure, generalizing finitely generated groups, finite dimensional Hopf C*-algebras and other large classes of quantum groups. <br/>"

The first is a study of the operator theory and function theory of the symmetric Fock space. The principal investigator and his collaborators have recently developed a geometric characterization of the Carleson measures for that space.  They believe that this result, together with the discretization techniques developed in obtaining it, will provide effective tools for the major immediate goal, which is to describe the interpolating sequences for this Fock space. The second component is the study of the relation between the Rankin-Cohen bracket operation and the direct sum decomposition of tensor products of Hardy and Bergman spaces. Both the bracket and the decomposition are implemented using the same bilinear differential operator, the transvectant. Hence it is natural to speculate that the algebraic structure induced on the graded space of automorphic forms by the bracket (an associative, noncommutative product structure) is mirrored by a new algebraic structure in the tensor product decomposition. The principal investigator proposes to identify that structure and develop its algebraic and analytic properties.<br/><br/>The first component of this project, studying the symmetric Fock space, is part of a mathematical program that has evolved in function theory and harmonic analysis for thirty years -- the use of discretization techniques to study continuous phenomena. Beyond its contribution to theoretical mathematics, this program has led to major advances in signal processing techniques and other areas of data analysis. Wavelet analysis is the best known product of this program, but there are many others.  The work on the Fock space is squarely in that tradition. It will be an exploration of how a particular discretization technique that is known to be very effective in theoretical mathematics and in numerical applications can be adapted to a much more sophisticated geometric setting. The second component of the project, the study of the relation between the Rankin-Cohen bracket and the decomposition of certain tensor products, is a response to the observation that the same complicated computational constructs (""transvectants"") show up in these two, so far, unrelated contexts. A basic principle in mathematics is that such ""accidents"" are almost always the first indication of unexpected, and sometimes deep, connections between what had been seen as unrelated areas.

For the most part these <br/>proposals are geometrically motivated approaches to specific problems in <br/>modern harmonic analysis connected to the representation theory of semi-<br/>simple Lie groups.  The first is an approach to construction and analysis <br/>of singular unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups, in two <br/>steps: (i) geometric construction of those representations, as Frechet <br/>space representations on cohomology of homogeneous vector bundles over <br/>flag domains, and (ii) transforming the representation space to a space of<br/>functions on a Stein manifold defined by a system of differential equations,<br/>by means of a double fibration transform (the complex Penrose transform <br/>is a particular case) from the flag domain to its linear cycle space.  The <br/>second project is an approach to construction and analysis of unitary and <br/>other representations for a class of infinite dimensional Lie groups, the <br/>direct limits of finite dimensional Lie groups, especially strict direct <br/>limits of finite dimensional real and complex reductive Lie groups, both <br/>in the analytic category and in the algebraic category.  The third project <br/>is to complete the investigator's work on the Harish-Chandra Schwartz space <br/>of a general semisimple Lie group, by synthesizing structural analyses of <br/>the relative Schwartz spaces.  The investigator's fourth project is to <br/>extend the notion of Dirac cohomology to a notion of partial Dirac<br/>cohomology so that it applies to all the representations of a semisimple<br/>Lie group that appear in the Plancherel formula.  The fifth project is to<br/>extend the investigator's isospectral group method from the setting of <br/>spherical space forms to the setting of locally symmetric Riemannian spaces.<br/>The sixth project is to investigate certain restrictions of discrete series<br/>representations to a class of subgroups of great geometric interest.  And,<br/>seventh, the investigator will continue his development of a method for <br/>direct reading of the character and growth properties (asymptotics) of <br/>admissible representations of finite dimensional real reductive Lie groups <br/>from the basic data that specify their construction on cohomology spaces of <br/>homogeneous vector bundles over flag domains.  One goal here is to do this <br/>in such a way that is directly applicable to the first and second projects.  <br/><br/>These seven research projects all depend on the use of symmetry to clarify<br/>analytic (and in one case geometric) problems.  Traditionally symmetry<br/>considerations are used to simplify matters by decreasing the number of<br/>variables, but here they are used to enable the use of insight, tools and<br/>results from geometry and analysis.  The symmetries are embodied in group <br/>theory, which is the algebraic abstraction of the notion of symmetry.  But <br/>modern Lie group theory incorporates classical analysis (calculus, <br/>differential equations...) and is closely tied to the geometry (Riemannian, <br/>symplectic, Kaehler, ...)  of the configurations on which the groups act as <br/>symmetries.  An important aspect of this synthesis of geometry and analysis <br/>is a geometric form of quantization that is particularly well suited to the <br/>sorts of finite dimensional groups considered in several of the projects.  <br/>This geometric quantization, originally inspired by physics and developed <br/>in some detail by mathematicians, has in turn been very useful in a variety <br/>of settings in mathematics and physics.  This is very much the case in six <br/>of the seven projects, where the geometric quantization is combined with <br/>modern differential geometry to understand various analytic problems.  This <br/>is especially evident in the first and fourth projects, whose objectives <br/>can be viewed as a sort of dequantization.<br/>"

In particular he will investigate the role of the nodal sets of solutions of differential equations, or more general level sets of functions. Also the singular sets and the branch sets of solutions. An important part of the study is the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of solutions near these sets or the asymptotic behavior of these sets themselves. The differential equations may be of elliptic, hyperbolic or mixed type. Some problems have close connections with other fields in mathematics, including several complex variables and algebraic geometry. Another class of problems that the PI would continue to work on involves the effect of level sets of known functions in the equations on the existence and properties of solutions. A particular problem is the isometric embedding of 2-dim Riemannian manifolds in 3-space when the zero set of Gauss curvature is well behaved.<br/><br/>The problems involving singular sets occur in materials science and control theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those sets where singularities occur. Precise definitions vary depending on the problems where they arise. It often is impossible to eliminate the singular sets, the so-called ""bad sets"". One of the central tasks is to identify the conditions under which the singular sets can be controlled and the conditions under which the singular sets are small. The proposed problems concerning singular sets in the project are in their simplest forms. They are related to the Erickson's model for liquid crystals and the Ginzburg-Landau equation in the superconductivity. The PI believes that the discussion of these mathematical problems will help scientists work with singular sets in various applications.<br/><br/>"

Noncommutative conditional expectations and martingales arise in the setting of von Neumann algebras, which are the natural framework for noncommutative measure theory and integration. The proposed research will follow two main directions. First, the PI will continue her ongoing study of martingale transforms in noncommutative spaces of p-integrable functions/operators and related martingale inequalities. One of the goals of this research is the attempt of developing a satisfactory theory of vector-valued martingales in the noncommutative setting. The motivation lies in the fact that martingale theory in the classical setting provides a bridge between probability theory and harmonic analysis. In another direction, the PI is pursuing the investigation of problems concerning the relationship between the structure of von Neumann algebras (their type) and embedding properties of their preduals, considered as operator spaces. In this direction, new surprising results related to a classification of injective factors up to completely bounded isomorphism classes of their preduals have very recently been obtained in collaboration with U. Haagerup. In particular, we showed that there exist uncountably many mutually non-isomorphic injective factors of type III_0 whose preduals are not isomorphic as operator spaces. This is an interesting result, since by a theorem of E. Christensen and A. Sinclair the factors in question are all isomorphic as operator spaces. Techniques and tools provided by noncommutative probability have also proven to be of crucial importance in this direction of research. One such example is the (completely isomorphic) realization of the operator space OH inside the predual of the injective type III_1 factor, proved by M. Junge. Our work with U. Haagerup on the best constant in M. Junge's Khintchine-type inequality implies that new ideas are to be discovered in order to settle the fascinating-still open- question concerning the completely isometric embedding of OH.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>The study of von Neumann algebras (suitable algebras of bounded linear operators on Hilbert spaces)  has been motivated by the development of quantum physics, where the idea of replacing numbers (scalars) by not necessarily commuting operators (such as matrices) first appeared. The interplay and deep connections between noncommutative probability, operator spaces and von Neumann algebra theory have already proven to be very fruitful. The proposed research holds the promise of bringing new insights into these areas of mathematics, as well as a renewed interest in fundamental topics which are at the heart of von Neumann algebra theory, such as Tomita-Takesaki theory and the theory of ergodic flows. This project will enhance the exchange of ideas between these different fields of mathematics, and as such, it has the potential of increasing further<br/>collaboration between mathematicians working in these areas.<br/>"

These equations, whose mathematical study is still in its infancy, have recently found a significant application as effective descriptions for the dynamical evolution of self-gravitating, relativistic matter. Based on this physical motivation, the PI's proposed research aims at understanding the qualitative behavior of solutions to these model equations. In particular, great emphasis is put on the pseudo-relativistic Hartree equation whose focusing nonlinearity is of critical strength in the sense that large initial data can lead to finite-time blow-up of the solution. Here it is of paramount interest to gain analytical insight into blow-up rates and dynamics, as well as to prove existence of non-radial blow-up solutions, thereby extending the PI's previous results on radial blow-up for the pseudo-relativistic Hartree equation (in collaboration with J. Froehlich). Apart from the issue of finite-time blow-up, the PI proposes a detailed study of global-in-time solutions and their asymptotic behavior as time tends to infinity. <br/><br/>Dispersive partial differential equations provide meeting grounds for theoretical and empirical branches of the natural sciences. The mathematical study of pseudo-relativistic Schroedinger equations substantiates intuitive and numerical insights into physical models of theoretical astrophysics. One of the most outstanding problems that astrophysics is facing today is the so-called dark matter problem. Various theoretical models set forth the existence of boson stars as possible candidates for explaining this empirical puzzle. The pseudo-relativistic Hartree equation considered in this proposal serves as an effective description for the dynamical evolution of boson stars. Therefore, this nonlinear dispersive PDE provides analytical testing grounds for these theoretical objects<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The workshop will focus on a key aspect of the structure and classification of complex algebraic varieties: the conjectures of Lang and others on the existence and properties of algebraic and holomorphic curves in complex varieties.  Both analytic and algebraic techniques have recently played a role in making inroads into these conjectures, which are related to Mori's program on the algebraic side and which refine Nevanlinna's Second Main Theorem on the analytic side.  The workshop will bring the experts in algebraic geometry and complex analysis together to foster further interaction and collaboration. <br/><br/>Complex algebraic varieties, which are the solution sets of polynomial equations, provide models for describing physical problems in science and engineering.  The understanding of the structure and classification of these varieties is a central theme in both algebraic geometry and complex analysis.  The workshop will introduce recent developments in this area to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty members, as well as to senior mathematicians.  Approximately 50 mathematicians, at all stages in their research careers, are expected to participate; eight of the invited speakers are postdoctoral researchers or junior faculty members.  In addition to the scheduled talks, we shall provide ample time for open discussions during the afternoons in order to encourage active participation by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  Most of the funding will go towards paying travel expenses of graduate students, young mathematicians and members of under-represented groups."

On the first topic, the main goal is to demonstrate the appearance of random matrix statistics in models with comparatively little randomness.  Investigations of the (linear) Schrodinger equation will center around the forward/inverse spectral/scattering problems for perturbations of periodic potentials.  Global well-posedness of the non-linear Schrodinger equation at critical regularity will be attacked, on the torus and in the focusing case.<br/><br/>Consider a drum, not necessarily circluar in shape.  When struck, the sound produced is built up of infinitely many components at different frequencies; the exact frequencies are determined by the shape of the drum.  (The same is true of other instruments; with differing combinations of frequencies responsible for the characteristic sound of each instrument.)  From the list of frequencies, one may determine the area and perimeter of the drum, for example, but not the shape (at least in general).  On the basis of numerical investigations, two exciting new conjectures have been made about these characteristic frequencies: when the drum has symmetries, they behave very erratically; while in the absence of symmetries the spacing becomes much more regular.  Both statements have precise formulations due to Berry and Tabor in the first instance and Bohigas, Giannoni, and Schmit in the second.  A large part of this project is devoted toward making progress on the second conjecture.  In particular, in the case of a drum chosen 'at random'."

Specifically, the proposer plans to undertake a detailed study of spectra for non-self-adjoint perturbations of self-adjoint semiclassical operators, in the case when the classical Hamilton flow of the unperturbed part is completely integrable or is a small perturbation thereof. The main tool for understanding spectral contributions coming from flow invariant Lagrangian tori is the construction of quantum analogues of the classical Birkhoff normal form near the tori, analyzed using the techniques of FBI--Bargmann transformations. In a related project, the proposer seeks to understand the precise location of scattering poles for strictly convex analytic obstacles in dimensions 2 and 3, with the aim of describing asymptotics of the individual poles by means of Bohr-Sommerfeld type quantization conditions. Another direction of research is concerned with the tunnel effect and return to thermodynamical equilibrium of Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators. Random perturbations of non-self-adjoint operators as well as the distribution of resonances for semiclassical Schrodinger operators will also be studied in this project.<br/><br/><br/>For a broad range of physical phenomena, where dissipation or propagation to infinity are possible, a state is described by its rate of oscillation as well as its rate of decay. This information is encoded in sequences of complex numbers identified as eigenvalues of a non-self-adjoint operator corresponding to the physical problem in question. For instance, resonances associated to quantum mechanical systems, such as unstable molecules, and appearing naturally also in electromagnetic and acoustic scattering, may be viewed this way. Asymptotic analysis of these quantities in the high energy or semiclassical regime is very rich and challenging mathematically, revealing fundamental and subtle links between quantum objects (complex eigenvalues or resonances) and corresponding classical objects, such as periodic/trapped trajectories or invariant tori. The proposed research thus seeks to shed some new light on universal relations between the classical and quantum views of the world. Closer to applications, a better understanding of the distribution of resonances for convex bodies may help advance the inverse problem of determining characteristics of a scatterer from its resonant frequencies in nondestructive testing technologies.<br/><br/><br/>"

This project focuses on Hilbert's sixteenth problem for quadratic vector fields, the infinitesimal version of Hilbert's sixteenth problem, and several related topics. The latter include the following: algebraic solutions of polynomial differential equations in higher dimensions; rigidity of complex polynomial foliations; relations between moduli of elliptic curves and rotation numbers; new problems about analytic families of germs of conformal maps, related to so-called mixed families. The first part of the project is based on two major results obtained under the principal investigator's previous award. The first of those results is an almost complete solution to the restricted Hilbert problem for quadratic vector fields. This solution is to be completed in the current project. In its final form, this solution would provide a ""covering function"" on the space of quadratic vector fields, a covering function with the following properties: (1) it is finite and lower semicontinuous on the set of vector fields that have no polycycles (separatrix polygons); (2) its restriction to this set has an infinite limit on the exclusive set of vector fields with polycycles; (3) it majorizes the number of limit cycles outside the exclusive set. The principal investigator proposes to find an upper bound on the number of limit cycles by establishing a local persistence property for limit cycles and then replacing the covering function with a cut-off function that still majorizes the number of limit cycles. The maximum of the cut-off function will be the desired upper bound. The second major objective of the current project is the complete solution of the restricted infinitesimal Hilbert sixteenth problem. This solution involves another covering function, this time on the set of all ultra-Morse polynomials of given degree, with the following property: it majorizes the number of real zeros of an Abelian integral of any polynomial one-form of degree smaller than the given one over the real ovals of a real ultra-Morse polynomial. The covering function has poles on the set of non-ultra-Morse polynomials. Once more, the goal is to prove a local persistence theorem for zeros of Abelian integrals and to derive an upper bound for the number of these zeros by replacing the covering function with a cut-off function. This will solve the infinitesimal Hilbert problem. The problems described in the latter part of the proposal (algebraic solutions, rigidity, moduli of elliptic curves, mixed families) lie at the interface of differential equations, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry. While they are of independent interest, at least half of them are related to Hilbert's problem.<br/><br/>The theory of dynamical systems is divided into two parts: multidimensional systems (the realm of chaos) and two-dimensional systems (the realm of order). Hilbert's sixteenth problem is a central one in the theory of two-dimensional systems. It is well known that two-dimensional dynamical systems provide models for various problems in physics, engineering, and biology (e.g., predator-prey models in biology). The understanding of real two-dimensional dynamics is therefore a subject of general scientific interest. On the other hand, the study of complex extensions of real dynamical systems provides important new information about real systems and is interesting in its own right. Indeed, some experts even say that the ""Book of Nature"" is written in the language of complex analysis."

Our analysis will exploit the detailed structure of the models, and in particular, the effect of nonlinear interactions. We shall study the motion of nonlinear visco-elastic materials, the relationship between compressible and incompressible materials, the formation of shock waves in compressible materials, and the confinement of vortical motion in planar incompressible ideal fluids.<br/><br/> Classical ideas of deterministic behavior usually are regarded as saying that the evolutionary laws of a physical system together with the initial configuration determine the state of the system at all future times. Mathematically speaking, the laws of physics are encoded in a system of partial differential equations and their solutions should exist and depend uniquely, and continuously, on the initial data. Creating the mathematical framework for a given system and verifying its well-posedness (in the sense above) is thus a problem of fundamental importance. Mathematical analysis offers important guidance in the specification of strain energy relationships beyond purely phenomenological assumptions.
