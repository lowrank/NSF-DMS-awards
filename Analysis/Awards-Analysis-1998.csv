DMS-9732894    The PI will study several problems which arise in the fields of quantum   mechanics and fluid dynamics. For Schr\""odinger operators with   electro-magnetic potentials, work will be done on the estimates of   negative eigenvalues and the non-classical asymptotics of the counting   function. The objective is to establish useful estimates in the cases   when the classical Cwikel-Lieb-Rosenblum bound fails.  Work will also be done on the semi-classical analysis of the ground state   energy. The emphasis will be on the degenerate potentials.  The second line of research concerns the Pauli operator, which describes   the motion of charged particles with spin. The PI will study   the Lieb-Thirring type inequalities for the Pauli operator   with a non-homogeneous magnetic field. Such inequalities play an   important role in the study of stability of matter and semi-classical   analysis in a magnetic field. Finally work will be continued on   boundary value problems in domains with rough boundaries,  which arise naturally in many engineering applications.  In particular, the resolvent estimates and fractional powers of the Stokes   operator in Lipschitz domains will be studied. The objective is to obtain   a better description of the behavior of the solutions to the nonlinear   Navier-Stokes equations in nonsmooth domains.    This project lies at the interface of mathematical physics, harmonic   analysis and partial differential equations. Its goal  is to gain better understanding of the spectral properties of   quantum systems, and to improve the mathematical theory,  upon which the numerical approximations and applications are based,   for the Navier-Stokes equations which model the fluid flow."

(1) For many Shroedinger operators, the corresponding classical problem, even though not integrable, is almost integrable in a measure-theoretic sense at high energy.  It is then possible, via KAM theory, to develop asymptotic expansions for Schroedinger operator eigenfunctions and eigenvalues with large quantum numbers. These results will be extended to Schroedinger operators on spheres and to perturbations of the hydrogen problem, where the corresponding classical integrability is more problematic. (2) For the polaron model, rigorous bounds for the effective mass will be sought by methods including those used in joint work with E. Lieb to obtain a sharp lower bound for the ground state energy with large coupling constant. (3) The ground state of the classical Heisenberg spin model satisfies a finite difference equation analogous to a partial differential equation for a harmonic map. The solutions to the difference equation exhibit regularity and partial regularity properties analogous to those for harmonic maps uniform in the lattice spacing.  The Dirichlet problem for the difference equation, convergence of the solutions as the lattice spacing goes to zero, and the scattering theory for a related time-dependent problem will be studied.    Mathematical physics is a discipline in which new mathematics is developed to provide decisive resolution to important questions in modern theoretical physics and for which physics generates and provides insight into important problems in mathematics.  Much of the work here concerns the following general problem: Beginning with a microscopic picture of matter -- p articles, atoms or molecules interacting with each other, systems with either a few or many degrees of freedom -- determine mathematically measurable macroscopic (observable) quantities -- energy levels, effective masses, net magnetism, etc. (1) The goal of the work on the semi-classical limit is to elucidate the transition from the arena of microscopic quantum physics to macroscopic classical physics. This work bears on foundational questions in the interpretation of quantum mechanics and provides useful schemes for computing certain energy levels using methods of classical mechanics. (2) The polaron is a simple model from condensed matter physics for a particle moving through a quantized field of lattice vibrations.  As the particle moves, it carries along a ""cloud"" of excitations in the field immediately surrounding it. This composite is what one observes in the laboratory. What is the effective mass of this composite?  The problem of computing such masses is ubiquitous throughout condensed matter, particle, and nuclear physics, and insight into how to perform these calculations would be of considerable general value. (3) The Heisenberg spin model provides a model to explain magnetism. It consists of a regular (infinite) array of  ""magnetic spins,"" each of which can point in any direction but tends to align with its immediate neighbors. If the spins align just right collectively, one ""sees"" a net large-scale magnetism. It is the questions of alignment and smoothness of the alignment which will be examined both in static and time-development settings."

Daskalopoulos    The abstact follows :   The major  objectives of this proposal are concerned with the study of certain quasilinear or  fully-nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations in connection   with  more complexproblems of  differential geometry, including the Ricci flow   and the Gauss curvature flow. These problems find physical applications in   such areas as  population dynamics, diffusion in porous media, and thin liquid film dynamics.  One specific area which will be investigated is the regularity question in free-boundary problems arising from the degeneracy of certain  non-linear parabolic equations, including the porous medium equation, the evolution p-laplacian equation and Gauss Curvature flow with flat sides.  Another specific area of the main objectives  concerns the study of  ultra-fast diffusion parabolic equations, which have received large  attention because of   their relationship to differential geometry topics, such as the Ricci flow and the Yamabe flow.  The  solvability of the Cauchy problem for these equations, the   study of the blow up profile of solutions, the nonradial structure  solutions, and   the  uniqueness of solutions, are among the problems which will be investigated   in this specific area.  The still  open question  of the uniqueness of sign-solutions   of the porous medium equation,   in connection with the continuity question for  a class of linear singular  parabolic equations falls under the proposed major goals to be studied.    The non-linear equations to be studied under this proposal form the basic concepts of many applications which deem to be important to technology and the society at large.  The purification of materials, from chemicals to petroleum and even water, is often achieved by diffusion through filters.  The purification filters are the porous media described in the proposal.  Thin film dynamics and the Van der Waals forces operating between thin layers are described  by singular quasilinear  equations of ultra-fast d iffusion.  The dynamics of population growth, polymer chain growth, including cross linking and high rate growth of biomolecules, are also non-linear phenomena amiable to our basic studies.  The interesting problem  of the expanding universe and other cosmological phenomena seem to be goverened by nonlinear dynamics, which in certain cases are  applications of the more complex problems described here."

Classical waves can exhibit phenomena normally associated with quantum mechanical electron waves. The quantum mechanical wave nature of electrons is based on an analogy with the scattering and interference of classical waves. But only recently has the analogy been reversed and the possibility of the localization of classical waves started to be investigated. Localization is a generic wave phenomena, not specific to electron waves.  The primary objective of this proposal is to establish a solid mathematical basis for the investigation of the phenomena of localization of classical waves. The following subtopics will be studied: localization effects in complex media, nonlinear effects in photonic crystals, exactly solvable models, a general framework for the localization of classical waves, dynamical localization of classical waves, internal Lifshitz tails, absolute continuity of the spectrum of periodic Maxwell operators.  Other topics to be investigated are random Schroedinger operators (a model for the motion of an electron in a crystal with impurities) and long range spin glasses.    New optical materials and devices will lead to ""lightronics"" (electronics for light), presently a subject of intensive research. Optical transistors are examples of such new optical devices, and their fabrication will require new optical materials. The development of lightronics will have tremendous technological implications. Electronic devices (e.g., transistors) are based on quantum mechanical phenomena. Electronic bound states, the simplest example of a localized electron wave, are ubiquitous in nature. But the analogous phenomena for light are not commonly observed in nature, even if theoretically possible. Nature provides a variety of readily available materials for electronic locali zation. But the corresponding materials for the localization of light and other classical waves have to be fabricated. This requires a fundamental understanding of how classical waves (e.g., light) can exhibit phenomena normally associated with quantum mechanical electron waves. One of these is localization, a subject that the present proposal addresses. This is a new area of research in both basic and applied sciences, with a potentially huge payoff to society."

The former includes the study of the classical Birkhoff billiards, dual (or outer) billiards, and projective billiards.  The techniques include symplectic topology, KAM theory, Aubry-Mather theory, integral geometry, and symbolic dynamics. The latter includes applications of ""quantum"" topology to Legendrian and transverse knots and links, study of the recently introduced contact homology rings and their applications, and applications of Sturm theory and the theory of generating functions to the global geometry of Legendrian curves.      The motivation for the study of billiards is two-fold.  First of all, mathematical billiards are intimately related to geometrical optics, and progress in the study of billiards may have practical applications in optics.  Secondly, billiards provide a very good model in the theory of dynamical systems, and many developments in various areas of dynamical systems have been stimulated by problems from the theory of mathematical billiards.  The theory of Legendrian curves belongs to the intersection of two very active research areas: symplectic topology and knot theory. Both have deep connections with theoretical physics: the former, with classical mechanics; the latter, with quantum physics. The Legendrian knot theory provides a good testing ground for symplectic topology and knot theory, and progress in the former will stimulate new developments in these fundamental theories."

Namely, if G/H is a non-compact, simply connected homogeneous space <br/>of a connected Lie group G, the question is whether there is a properly <br/>discontinuous subgroup D of G such that the orbit space D\G/H is compact. <br/>Some special cases have been studied by L.

If there is a compact subset C of G with CHC = G, then we say that H is a Cartan-decomposition subgroup, and it is easy to see that G/H does not have a tessellation.  The project will use Cartan-decomposition subgroups as a starting point in a study of tessellations of homogeneous spaces of semisimple groups of real rank two.  The other main focus of this project is generalizing the PI's theorem that arithmetic groups of Q-rank at least two have no interesting continuous actions on connected one-manifolds.  (In algebraic terms, the theorem asserts that no central extension of any such arithmetic group is right orderable.)  The PI conjectured that the <br/>assumption on Q-rank can be replaced by the same assumption on the real <br/>rank, and this leads to interesting questions about the algebraic structure <br/>of arithmetic groups.<br/>     <br/>Many important materials are crystals.  The atomic structure of such a <br/>material is very symmetric, and a first step toward understanding the <br/>physical properties of the material is to study the group formed by all the <br/>symmetries of the structure.  This project investigates the symmetry groups <br/>that arise from crystals in mathematical spaces other than the <br/>3-dimensional universe we live in.  A basic problem addressed by this <br/>project is to understand which spaces do contain crystals.  Also, this <br/>project will study the structure of the symmetry group of the crystals that <br/>do exist.  For example, the PI and others have shown, in many cases, that <br/>crystals in two different spaces cannot have the same group of symmetries. <br/>However, it is often still not known whether the group of symmetries can be <br/>the same as the symmetries of a one-dimensional non-rigid (and, hence, <br/>non-crystalline) structure.<br/>"

Boas, Emil Straube    Abstract: The L-2 Sobolev theory of the d-bar Neumann problem on pseudoconvex domains has seen dramatic progress in the 1980s and 1990s, notably through the work of Catlin and D'Angelo on subellipticity and finite type, of the principal investigators on global regularity on large classes of (weakly) pseudoconvex domains, and of Barrett, Christ, and Siu on failure of regularity on the so called ""worm"" domains. However, there is currently not even a conjecture about what combination of geometric and potential theoretic conditions might be used to characterize global regularity in the d-bar Neumann problem. The study of such conditions is one of the directions of this project. A related (and quite possibly more tractable) question is that of characterizing domains with compact d-bar Neumann operators. (This question also has repercussions in operator theory.) In addition, the principal investigators will study L-p estimates with gain for the d-bar Neumann problem on domains of finite type. Here, they will build on new insight gained from recent work concerning nonsmooth domains of finite type. These investigations are also of interest from the point of view of the Kaehler geometry associated with the Bergman kernel of a domain. (In addition to their intrinsic significance, Bergman-like kernels play a prominent role in a quantization scheme --Berezin quantization -- that has recently attracted much attention from both mathematicians and physicists). During this project, the principal investigators will train three graduate students, and they will supervise a young mathematician at the post-doctoral level (supported through a Group Infrastructure Grant at Texas A&M University) in his study of problems concerning polynomial hulls. (While intrinsically motivated, these questions have intimate connections to control engineering).    The study of analysis in several complex variables can be motivated by the centrality of the  subject within mathematics (thus making it essential, in the long term, for the well-being of the scientific and technological enterprise) or through a more direct appeal to its usefulness. For example, one of the basic laws of nature, causality, when transcribed via a mathematical device called the Fourier transform, immediately gives rise to analytic functions of several (in this case four) complex variables. Likewise, as indicated above, the work in this project will impact not only the core areas of several complex variables and partial differential equations, but also other areas of science through connections to operator theory, to mathematical physics, and to control engineering. Finally, the project will contribute significantly to human resources development in mathematics."

The second objective is the investigation of spectral and dynamical properties of concrete quantum mechanical systems. The goal is the development of a new spectral analysis technique for studying fine structure in the essential spectra of Schroedinger operators (that is, the decomposition of the essential spectrum into absolutely continuous, singular continuous and pure point components). In addition to spectral information, the new methods may yield valuable results about quantum dynamics of various systems via new relations between the behavior of solutions of generalized eigenfunction equation, spectral measures, and quantum dynamics. This technique may have potential applications to and will provide further insight into many important problems, in particular such as models of quasicrystals, the Anderson model and other models involving random or ergodic potentials, and Schroedinger operators with slowly decaying potentials.       The spectral and dynamical theory of Schroedinger operators is the cornerstone of Quantum Mechanics. This theory describes the laws which govern the behavior of quantum particles, such as electrons, atoms and molecules. Much of the fundamental scientific knowledge about many important physical processes (such as, for example, chemical reactions or conduction properties of various materials) comes from the theory of Schroedinger operators. This proposal focuses on the development of the new methods in spectral and dynamical theory of Schroedinger operators which may allow a new approach to some long-standing problems in Quantum Mechanics. These problems concern, in particular, the cond uctance properties of materials with impurities and of quasicrystals, and have direct applications to modern engineering devices, wave guides and transistors to name two."

In joint work the proposers will consider various   approximation properties of operator algebras and operator spaces and these   will be connected to both the Haagerup invariant and operator compactness of   matrix sets.    Operator theory and operator algebras are the infinite dimensional analogues of   finite matrix theory. They were first studied by von Neumann as a framework for   quantum mechanics. Subsequently they have had, and continue to have, important   applications to control theory, quantum groups, non-commutative geometry,   non-commutative probability and knot theory. The work in this proposal is most   closely related to mathematical physics and quantum mechanics. We will consider   algebras of unbounded operators which arise from the Heisenberg Uncertainty   Principle, as well as crossed product C*-algebras which model the time evolution  of quantum mechanical systems in physics. The techniques we use rely heavily on   the theory of operator spaces , a topic which has undergone considerable   development in the last ten years. These spaces provide a unifying framework for  the self-adjoint algebras of physics and the non-self-adjoint algebras of   control theory."

The study of ergodic properties of these measures and of geometric structure of the respective attractors is also proposed.  The project is based on joint research with M. Jakobson.  One of the main tools is the new technique of distortion estimates for two-dimensional maps with unbounded derivatives.  The basic example is a family of piecewise smooth transformations defined on a finite number of rectangles which are all mapped hyperbolically except for one, which is mapped parabolically. This project differs from earlier work in that there is no assumption that perturbations of one-dimensional maps are used.  The technique is based on a system of initial conditions which can be numerically checked, such as expansion, contraction, initial distortions, and dependence of these quantities on the parameters and can be applied to a variety of models. <br/><br/><br/>This project involves the phenomenon of random oscillations in deterministic systems.  It has been recently discovered that this type of oscillation arises in a variety of mathematical models in  physics, chemistry, and biology.  For many applications to science, it is important to understand the mechanisms leading to such oscillations and to be able to describe them in simple mathematical terms.  Usually a given system will depend on external parameters such as temperature, pressure, or various electromagnetic quantities. Typical examples are airflow in the atmosphere, the motion of fluids under changes in external temperature, or the motion of the blood in one's heart under various physiological stresses. For some parameters, systems may exhibit stationary or periodic solutions, but, as the parameters change, the motion can start to behave randomly with increasing probability.  This is seen in the boiling of water which initially shows simple motion and becomes turbulent with increasing temperature.  It also occurs in arrhythmia of the heart, where a system which is normally periodic starts to oscillate wildly under certain forces.  In some cases, one wants to have systems show random motion.  In others, one wants to avoid such motion.  In any case, it is important to understand the nature of such motion.  The goal of this work is to give strict mathematical conditions which imply random behavior.  These conditions can be checked numerically, which provides straightforward applications to many real systems of interest.<br/>"

Such functionals have a special interest both in geometry and partial   differential equations, and include  the energy functional  and the area functional.

The study of the regularity for minimizers of variational problems   has been  one of the main concerns in mathematics for centuries.  It is deeply related to the study of natural phenomenon, since in nature   the energy minimizing configurations are the most likely to appear.  If a minimizer is very regular then it is easy to study its structure.   Translated out of the mathematical formalism, this means  that  the  physical system  corresponding to a very regular minimizer   can be predicted very accurately. This observation is at the basis  of a wide range of applications, from meteorological forecasts  to the planning of a space shuttle launch (depending on the specific functional   and minimizer studied).  The variational problems involved in  this project are associated to a  special structure of the space that arises naturally in the study of many physical systems, among them thermodynamical systems  and crystalline materials. A main feature of this special structure is that not all   directions in space  are equivalent. It costs more to travel along some   directions than to move along others.

One of these topics   is polynomial approximation with varying weights. Recently   several problems have lead to this type of approximation,   and the PI continues its study with the help of logarithmic  potentials in the presence of an external field. This  approximation problem is fundamental in proving different  types of asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials and  Christoffel functions with respect to varying weights.  These in turn are related to some mechanical models of  quantum physics, in particular to the  universality  hypothesis (saying that the distribution of energy levels in  small intervals is independent of the original (random)  distribution of the particles). Another related problem is  on orthogonal polynomials with respect to a measure with  compact support on the complex plane (bounds for  polynomials, regularity criteria, Szego's problem on  curves or disjoint intervals). Finally, the PI plans to  investigate polynomial inequalities with as general weights  as possible. Recently it has turned out that classical  polynomial inequalities are also true in weighted form, and  for a surprisingly wide class of weights, namely for so  called doubling weights, or for weights satisfying the  weakest of the Muckenhoupt A conditions. The PI further  investigates  weighted polynomial inequalities, as well as  their consequences in other areas.      This research project deals with some theoretical  questions of mathematical analysis with the aim of  using in more applied areas of mathematics and  theoretical physics. Some basic problems in approximation  theory are investigated with tools that have been  traditionally associated with classical physics (potential  theory). This novel application of potential theory  makes it possible to attack problems that resisted  classically applied tools, e.g. it makes possible to  find the behav ior of some nonclassical orthogonal  polynomials (Freud polynomials). A new impulse to the  research came in recent years when it has been found that  these orthogonal polynomials are related to some questions  of theoretical physics that are modelling the uncertain  nature of quantum systems by random mechanical models.  Another major area of research is on weighted inequalities  on polynomials. Polynomials are basic tools in replacing   complicated structures by simpler ones that can be  mathematically handled; and in this approximation process  one needs various inequalities that relate various  quantities of polynomials to one another."

Rovnyak    Topics in operator theory and function theory will be pursued in several directions that involve Krein spaces and indefinite inner products (as opposed to Hilbert spaces). The project will continue previous work on the theory of generalized Schur and Nevanlinna functions. Following Krein and Langer, these are defined as meromorphic functions whose associated Pick-Nevanlinna kernels have a finite number of negative squares. One topic is interpolation theory. In the definite case, a theory of boundary interpolation including problems of Loewner type was given by Rosenblum and Rovnyak, and analogous problems will now be studied for generalized Schur functions.  A unifying tool is the theory of canonical coisometric, isometric, and unitary realizations for generalized Schur functions. Related problems on the structure of state spaces and the difference-quotient transformation will also be studied. The theory takes its most concrete form for scalar-valued functions, and work of Sarason and his colleagues in the definite case suggest other directions for development. Related problems for Krein space operators will also be investigated.    The project will study several topics that extend classical problems in operator theory and function theory. The work is mathematical, but the topics are in areas that support mathematical engineering and the theory of linear systems. One topic is interpolation theory, where it is required to reconstruct a function with prescribed properties when only some of its values, the data of the problem, are known.  In linear system theory, a similar problem is to reconstruct a system with prescribed input-output characteristics; some state is input into the system, the system (itself described by an unknown state) acts upon it, and a new state is output. In the classical theory, distances between states are ""definite,"" that is, positive in the usual sense of Euclidean space.  Mathem atical models in which distances are ""indefinite,"" that is, sometimes positive and sometimes negative, have been known for a long time and occur, for example, in relativity theory.  In fact, the mathematics of linear system theory is a powerful tool for interpolation theory and will be used in the project.  The project uses ""indefinite"" as opposed to ""definite"" notions of distance, and it seeks to explore new phenomena that arise when the classical theories do not apply. Questions to be investigated include existence of solutions, uniqueness, explicit construction, and properties of the state space. The budget includes support for one undergraduate student in an REU summer research project each year."

Most physical and geometric phenomena are described by partial   differential equations, typically by equations of second order.   Examples include the equations that describe the behavior of   sound, light, radiation, diffusion, nuclear processes, and so on.   Exact solutions for the model equations of classical physics have   played a central role in the development both of mathematical  physics and of the general theory of partial differential equations.   Much of the advance in the latter theory in this century has been due   to refinements in the technique for approximating the solutions of   more complex equations, both theoretically and numerically.    Nevertheless among these more complex equations are models for which   it is possible to find exact solutions, and it is hoped that the   exact solutions will again play a role in our understanding at a more   detailed level.  This proposal describes certain linear equations of   interest for which it may be possible, building on recent wor k, to   obtain fairly explicit exact solutions.  It also proposes further   work on a widely studied technique that provides explicit solutions   of certain types of nonlinear partial differential equations.  Among   these equations are those that describe water waves, in certain   circumstances, and the propagation of pulses in optical fibers."

This theory has developed in parallel with the renormalization theory of unimodal maps, which has enjoyed spectacular progress since Sullivan's ground-breaking work in the late 1980's.  The work of Sullivan, McMullen, and Lyubich culminated in establishing the global hyperbolicity of the renormalization operator, thus providing the mathematical basis for the universality phenomena in unimodal dynamics.  Yampolsky will attempt to settle the corresponding Hyperbolicity Conjecture in the theory of circle maps, as well as investigate matings of quadratic polynomials with Siegel disks.   One of the reasons why fractal shapes are so eye catching is their self-similarity: when appropriately magnified, the fragments of the fractal resemble the whole. It often happens that iterations of this procedure, i.e. consecutive enlargements, converge to a certain  limiting ``universal'' shape. Such convergence of rescalings or ``renormalizations'' of  a complicated object is a fundamental principle of various physical theories, for example, with the dynamics of gases and fluids and in quantum mechanics. Particularly simple models for renormalization convergence exist in the framework of one-dimensional dynamics. For one such model, the Feigenbaum renormalization, the phenomenon of convergence has been established recently by rigorous mathematical methods. This convergence manifests itself through universal properties of the fractal Mandelbrot set and is also experimentally observed in hydrodynamics. Yampolsky will investigate this convergence in the other one-dimensional model, the renormalization of circle maps. This  problem, which was formulated in the late 1970's, has been the object of attention of various authors, and several beautiful mathematical theories were built to explain the empirically observed convergence of renormalization. Proving the convergence of renormalization in this context may contribute to a solid mathematica l foundation for the phenomenon of the convergence of renormalization in other problems of modern physical science."

Marshall    Abstract: Under this grant Marshall will investigate problems in four areas of analytic function theory. Estimates of harmonic measure and the growth of hyperbolic distance will be used to study the angular distribution of mass induced by analytic, area-integrable functions. This problem has applications to the characterization of extremal dilatations for quasi-conformal homeomorphisms of the unit disk. Secondly he will investigate the integrability properties of derivatives of one-to-one analytic functions. Thirdly, he will investigate finite interpolation problems for the bidisk. Marshall will seek continued fraction decompositions for a certain class of rational functions in several variables to solve this problem. In the fourth area, Marshall will investigate the accuracy of a promising technique for the numerical computation of conformal maps.     Conformal maps (one-to-one analytic functions) have been used as a tool in science and engineering for many years. One way conformal maps are used is to transform a problem on a complicated region in the complex plane to a related problem on a ""standard"" region, such as a disk or half-plane, where known techniques can be used. The solution on the standard region is then transformed by the inverse of the conformal map to a solution of the original problem on the original region. Classically, this method was used for problems related to Laplace's equation. For example, temperature at equilibrium on a thin metallic plate satisfies Laplace's equation. More recently, conformal maps have found application to a wide range of numerical solutions of other partial differential equations arising in engineering problems. There are applications in electro-magnetics, vibrating membranes and acoustics, transverse vibrations and buckling of plates, elasticity, heat transfer, and fluid flow, for example. While early applications used explicit analytic representations for conformal maps, modern us es require conformal maps of more complicated regions which cannot be represented easily in terms of elementary functions. The only resort is to compute numerical approximations to the desired conformal maps.  We will investigate the accuracy of a new technique which rapidly computes conformal maps and their inverses. It is fast enough that it can be used for experimentation on a typical workstation. The integrability questions we will work on deal with the difficult problem of estimating the growth rate of conformal maps. One of the applications of complex analysis to electrical engineering problems is the construction of electric circuits associated with a given transfer function. One method is to decompose the transfer function into simpler pieces, called a continued fraction expansion. In order to understand related problems in several complex variables, Marshall will seek similar decompositions for transfer functions depending on two variables."

The typical example is the Glauber dynamics of the model of statistical mechanics, which model is taken with parameters close to (but different from) those of the phase transition region. For a long time the system behaves as if it were in the ""wrong"" equilibrium, until it finally undergoes the transition to the ""true"" (and unique) one. The (non-equilibrium!) states of the model before transition are what should be considered the metastable states of the system. Shlosman shows that such family of states is a smooth continuation of the curve of equilibrium phases through the critical point. The transition happens because of the creation and growth of ""droplets"" of the equilibrium phase inside the non-equilibrium phase. The PI will study the lifetime of these metastable states. It is possible to write an explicit expression describing it. The formula is quite interesting and contains, in particular, a term corresponding to the surface energy of the Wulff droplet. The explanation is that the shape of the critical droplet is given by the Wulff construction. This settles a controversy on the subject that has existed in the literature.    The subject of this research project is the rigorous study of the phenomenon of metastability. A good example of the metastable state of matter is supercooled water (i.e., water cooled below its freezing temperature, yet remaining liquid). This state of water can indeed be observed in nature. The characteristic feature of supercooled water is that it cannot stay liquid for a very long time: after a while, it suddenly freezes. The concept of metastable state is well known in physics, where it plays an important role. What has hitherto been lacking is the rigorous understanding of this phenomenon on the level of microscopic statistical mechan ics. As one famous scientist put it, ""The concepts of the metastable state and of fractional dimension are useful, provided they are not taken too seriously."" Shlosman's research is aimed precisely at providing the tools to understand metastability one hundred percent ""seriously."" To this end, the concept of a ""critical droplet"" (which is a microscopic piece of ice in the case of water) is developed. Shlosman will study the process through which such a droplet is created and examine the process of growth of this droplet, until it eventually absorbs the whole sample (by coalescing with other growing droplets). The overall theory looks quite complete and satisfactory."

With Professor Sibony, the principal investigator will work on a systematic development of the theory of iterations of holomorphic maps. This depends on the use of pluripotential theory to construct invariant measures as well as a broad range of function theoretic tools from the theory of several complex variables. One of the main problems in the theory of dynamical systems is that the equations are too difficult for rigorous study.  Holomorphic maps have enough structure so that many results can be proved rigorously thereby giving an idea of phenomena that can occur also in more complicated systems. The principal investigator also plans to work on several problems in the theory of several complex variables.  This includes generalizations of the Bochner-Hartogs extension Theorem to more general manifolds and to solutions of the Cauchy-Riemann equations in singular spaces. The principal investigator plans to continue work with Professor Gavosto on investigation of iterations of holomorphic maps near homoclinic tangencies and other bifurcations relying heavily on use of the computer for graphics and rigorous proofs. The Principal Investigator plans also to continue joint works with Brendan Weickert, Greg Buzzard and Araceli Bonifant on various questions in the theory of complex dynamics. <br/><br/>The goals of this proposal are to study problems in complex analysis and in dynamical systems using techniques of complex analysis. Complex numbers were introduced to solve algebraic expressions that could not be solved with real numbers. With time, complex numbers have proved to be necessary to explain fundamental physical phenomena like electromagnetisms, vibrations in mechanical systems, etc. Complex analysis studies the changes of quantities that depend on complex numbers. Dynamical systems is the study of systems that change over time. Examples of dynamical systems range from the weather to the study of populations. Dynamical systems are in general very hard to model and to understand. The simplest models involve using real algebraic expressions to represent the system.  Considering the algebraic expressions over the complex numbers allows one to see and study the problems in a higher dimensional setting using more powerful tools. In this setting, a very intricate and fascinating scenario appears. Computer generated pictures show the geometry of this phenomenon: a very complicated fractal structure.  Proper understanding of this geometry will lead to a better understanding of real dynamical systems.<br/><br/>"

SUSLOV, PROPOSAL ID# DMS-9803443   PROPOSAL TITLE: Basic Fourier Series and Their Extensions    ABSTRACT OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT    The area of special functions, and q-series in particular, has seen   significant advances in the last twenty years. One major event is   the discovery of the Askey-Wilson polynomials. There are also a   variety of recent problems in analysis, algebra, and combinatorics   related to q-series. In the current project we plan to investigate   basic Fourier series and their extensions. This is quite a new area   of research in analysis. The Fourier and Fourier-Bessel series have   a rich and deep theory. But only recently Ismail, Masson and Suslov   have established a continuous orthogonality property for the basic   Bessel functions and considered basic extension of the Fourier-Bessel   series. Bustoz and Suslov have introduced basic Fourier series and   established several facts about convergence of these series.   Askey suggested that the ""Bessel-type orthogonality"" found by Ismail,   Masson, and Suslov has a general character and can be extended to a   larger class of basic hypergeometric series. Askey's conjecture has   recently been proven by Suslov. In this project we propose to develop   a theory of basic Fourier series and their higher extensions which   is similar to the classical theory of Fourier and Fourier-Bessel   series. This theory will include detailed study of properties of   the new q-orthogonal functions, investigation of convergence of the   corresponding series and related topics. This naturally includes   certain computational problems: eigenvalues of  the corresponding  Sturm-Liouville problem can be found only numerically, investigation   of convergence of these new series should be done. Explicit examples   of basic Fourier series naturally lead to a new class of formulas   never investigated before from the analytical and numerical   viewpoint. The method of basic Fourier series can be applied to study   solu tions of a q-heat equation and for some other basic versions of   the equations of mathematical physics.      The study of Fourier series has a long and distiguished history in   mathematics. Historically, Fourier series were introduced in order to   solve the heat equation, and since then these series have been   frequently used in various applied problems. Much of modern real   analysis including Lebesgue's fundamental theory of integration had   its origin in some deep convergence questions in Fourier series.   There is a great deal of interest these days in basic or q-extensions   of Fourier series and their theory. In this project we intend to lay   a sound foundation for this study. We introduce basic Fourier series,   investigate their main properties, and consider some applications   in mathematical physics."

Let me know if you find them unsatisfactory.    Yours,     Nigel       ------------------------------------------------------------------    The large scale geometry of groups and spaces plays a determining role in   the calculation of invariants in C*-algebra theory and topology. The   investigators aim to explore the effect of the geometry and topology of   group boundaries (defined using large scale geometry) on the harmonic   analysis of groups and the determination of their C*-algebra K-theory. The   Baum-Connes conjecture proposes a means of calculating the K-theory of   reduced group C*-algebras which blends group homology with the   representation theory of finite subgroups.  The conjecture, if true, would   have a number of implications in geometry and topology, and a fascinating   circle of ideas is coming into view which links the Baum-Connes conjecture   to aspects of the harmonic analysis of groups and the geometry of group   actions on boundary spaces.  The investigators will attempt to clarify   these relations.  A long term goal is to prove the Baum-Connes conjecture,   and more importantly to understand better its meaning, for classes such as   the hyperbolic groups of Gromov.  More immediate objectives include   clarifying the relationships between existing proofs of partial forms of   the conjecture for these groups, and developing further the connections   between C*-algebra K-theory, manifold theory, and controlled topology.    Although the tools used to investigate it are rather elaborate, the idea   behind large scale geometry is very simple:  ignore the local, small scale   fluctuations in a quantity and concentrate on its large scale, or long   term, behaviour.  By doing so, trends or qualities may become apparent   which are obscured by inconsequential, small scale fluctations.  The   investigators have developed tools to distinguish between different sorts   of multi-dimensi onal, large scale behaviour in geometry.  Somewhat   surprisingly, aside from their intrinsic interest, their tools have found   application in ordinary, small scale geometry."

One of the main themes of the proposal is to understand  possible generalizations of strong rigidity and superrigidity to the   framework of representations taking values in general locally compact   (rather than linear, or Lie) groups.  Another (but as it turns out to be a closely related) line of research is the study of the orbit structure of finite measure-preserving group actions. It turns out that ergodic finite measure-preserving actions of higher rank lattices have such a rigid orbit structure, that the group (i.e. the lattice) and the action can be reconstructed just from the produced orbit relation. Further questions and problems arise in the   analysis of these orbitally rigid actions. Some progress has already been  obtained in several of the proposed problems.       The proposed research addresses various questions which join two disciplines:   ergodic theory and Lie groups, or more generally: probability and algebra.   This joining, namely the use of ergodic-theoretic methods in Lie groups   and Lie groups examples in ergodic theory, has already proved itself as   extremely fruitful in both fields, by solving problems and establishing   new phenomena, which appeared naturally within the scope of one filed, but   solutions of which required techniques and ideas from another one. The   proposed research focuses on, so called, rigidity aspects of certain   structures (both in ergodic theory and in Lie groups). Here rigidity   means that the object, carrying certain structure, cannot be changed   without a substantial change in this structure. This in particular means   that the object itself can be reconstructed (or the object is determined)   by this structure. Many rem arkable rigidity results are known and widely   used for lattices in Lie groups, and the proposal addresses several natural   generalizations of these results."

Saff   Co-Principal Investigator: E. A. Rakhmanov      The project involves the use of potential theory and operator theory  to investigate three main problem areas: (1) discretization of the surface   of the unit sphere in N-dimensions, including asymptotics for minimal   energy arrangements and algorithms for constructing near optimal points;   (2) weak and strong asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials with respect  to continuous and discrete weights; and (3) best rational and meromorphic   approximation in function spaces, including generalizations of the   theory of Adamyan, Arov, and Krein.      The main problem to be investigated concerns finding nearly optimal   arrangements of large numbers of points (typically in the hundreds or   thousands) on the surface of a sphere so that these points are uniformly   dispersed with respect to area on the sphere (i.e., the proportion of   points lying in an arbitrary cap is close to the ratio obtained by   dividing the area of the cap by the total area of the sphere). For this   purpose the investigators will use minimum energy criteria which were   introduced in a previous NSF grant. By analyzing the asymptotic behavior   (as the number of points grows large), the investigators aim to devise   simple schemes that generate configurations with near minimal energy. The   importance of this problem is underscored in a recent article by S.Smale,   who lists the study of such spherical point schemes as one of the eighteen   main mathematical problem areas for the next century. Indeed this study   has a wide variety of practical applications, among which are the   following: (1) the structural analysis of large, stable, carbon molecules   (known as fullerenes); (2) the determination of optimal sampling points on    the Earth's surface for data gathered by orbiting satellites; and (3) the   testing of radar sensors for aircraft  when spherical  coverage around the aircraft is essential."

Treves plans to carry out his research in the coming years, in the   following three distinct areas: 1. Global parametrices for the time-dependent   Schroedinger equation on Euclidean space equipped with a non-Euclidean   Riemannian metric. This is joint work with S. Chanillo (Rutgers Univ.). The   first step is to construct a parametrix when there is no potential. The next   step is to do the same with a potential, whose derivatives are decaying at   infinity at a suitable rate (with similar contions on the metric). They   propose to use the parametrix to describe the critical set and the propagation   of singularities (in Lbesgue and Sobolev spaces), with special attention to   the presence of trapped geodesics. 2. Boundary values of Dolbeault cohomology   classes. Treves is completing a research program begun with P. D. Cordaro   (Univ. of Sao Paulo, Brazil) and S. Gindikin (Rutgers Univ.). The objectives   are several: to obtain integral formulas for the solutions of second-order   hyperbolic and ultra-hyperbolic partial differential equations; to define   spaces of generalized functions (actually hyperfunctions) well suited for the   representations of the classical groups which preserve those equations; to lay   the ground for the study of ``analytic extension"" to domains more complicated   than wedges. 3. Analyticity of the solutions of second-order linear partial   differential equations of the form ``sums of squares of (analytic, real)   vector fields"". Recently Treves has formulated a necessary and sufficient   condition for such a property to be valid; he plans to use microlocal analysis   to initiate a proof of the conjecture.    The solutions of the Schroedinger equation are the fundamental elements in the   ``wave description"" of the states of particles in Quantum Physics. The   construction attempted by Chanillo and Treves is aimed at providing explicit   formulas for solving the Schroedinger equation  - formulas that make it possible   to describe very precisely the behaviour of the particles in the large (so as   to take into account distant ``radiation"") and in ``curved"" space (so as to   take into account special constraints on the trajectories of the particles).   The work of Treves on boundary values aims at forging new mathematicatools, and   again explicit formulas, that could be used in the theory of the Radon and   X-ray transforms (which lie at the theoretical foundations of tomography).   Finally, the differential equations of the kind ``sums of squares of vector   fields"" describe, through their solutions, various kinds  of Brownian motion and of random processes (they have been extensively studied   by probability theorists). The analyticity of their solutions is a precise   mathematical  formulation of their great smoothness, as well as indicating the possibility   of computing some of their properties in finitely many steps."

This type of oscillation arises in a variety of mathematical models in  physics, chemistry, and biology.  The behavior of such systems depends on exterior parameters.  For some parameters, systems exhibit stationary or periodic solutions. However for other parameters, the same systems behave randomly.

This work represents a natural extension of recent progress on the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems on Lipschitz domains to boundary value problems that are not coercive. Harmonic analysis and a priori estimates will be used in order to obtain the optimal regularity property of the solution. Related problems on the boundary behaviour of holomorphic functions on Lipschitz domains, zeros of holomorphic functions, and Bergman projection on non-smooth domains will also be studied. In addition, Shaw intends to continue her research on the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations, including such topics as the regularity of the solutions and embedding problems for abstract CR structures. Boundary regularity problems for sum- of-squares operators and other subelliptic operators constitute a third focal point of the project.     Motivated by such fundamental physical problems as the conduction of heat through a solid medium, the classical Dirichlet and Neumann problems have for almost two centuries been central to the study of analysis. Through the use of technical tools like potential theory, Schauder estimates, and singular integral theory, these problems have now become quite well understood in the case of a domain with smooth boundary. The extension of this understanding to the setting where the boundary is not necessarily smooth, a situation encountered more and more frequently in applications of several complex variables to problems in physics and engineering, has been an active area of recent research. In fact, novel approaches employing geometric measure theory, Schauder estimates with non-smooth coefficients, and harmonic measure have been em ployed to tackle these problems, a process that has led to the development of many new fields and methods. Within the last thirty years very precise results have been obtained concerning elliptic boundary value problems for domains that are not smooth, but have so-called ""Lipschitz boundaries."" The Neumann problem for the Cauchy-Riemann complex presents the next great challenge in this area. Not only will it be interesting from the point of view of partial differential equations, but it will also have many applications in the function theory of several complex variables - and beyond.

For periodic matrix functions of several variables, the positive   extension and contractive extension problems will be studied.The positive extension problem arises in signal processing when spectral estimation of stochastic processes are required. The contractive counterpart arises in   such fields as the worst-case control, e.g., in the model-matching problem.   New support sets with the positive extension property will be identified,   and a description of all solutions (including a maximum entropy solution)   of the respective extension problems will be given. For this purpose, new   versions of the band method, suited for the multivariable setting and   including dual norm results, will be formulated. For finite sets which do   not have positive extension property, numerical algorithms based on the reduction to matrix completion problems will be developed. The results obtained will be related back to their applications.The principal investigators will continue a systematic study of almost periodic factorization. This factorization arises naturally in diffraction theory, distributed parameters control systems, and the spectral estimation problem for a class of stochastic processes. New existence results will be obtained and then used in applications to almost periodic versions of the Corona problem and stable rank one property, Krein's theorem on orthogonal matrix polynomials, the Beurling-Lax theorem and   the geometry of shift-invariant subspaces of the Besicovitch space.   Almost periodic factorization will also be used in the spectral   theory of various operators (including Toeplitz, Wiener-Hopf and other   convolution type operators) with matrix almost periodic and semi  almost periodic symbols on weighted Lebesgue spaces, and in almost periodic   extensions and interpolation problems. Connections with the   respective problems for periodic functions of several variables   will be exploited. New procedures for explicit  almost periodic factorization will be developed and applied to a constructive solution of convolution type (in particular, difference) equations on finite intervals. These results will be further applied in the scattering theory for the generalized Schrodinger equation.    The proposed research aims to develop new mathematical tools and   techniques, motivated by potential uses in diverse areas of   science and technology. A typical application in   medical sciences, seismology, signal processing, or physics involves    reconstruction (as much as available data allows) of the intrinsic   structure of an object of study, given only a few surface measurements.   Statistical applications involve prediction, or prognosis, of a process   in probabilistic terms, when only a brief history is known.    There are currently available mathematical techniques that underlie   many recent technological advances in these areas. However, the   existing techniques deal mostly with the case when there is only one   variable (typically time or distance along a line) involved. The   immense complexity of real-life systems calls for new mathematical   developments, in particular it calls for an extension of the existing   theory to the case of more variables (allowing for instance for planar and   spatial variables). The proposed research seeks to make substantial   contributions in this direction. Interaction and collaboration with many   researchers in different fields is an integral part of the proposal. The   principal investigators also plan to involve undergraduate students in   parts of their research."

In particular, they will attempt to categorize those manifolds for which such mappings are determined by finitely many derivatives at a given point. They expect that this study will lead to discovery of new geometric, analytic, as well as algebraic invariants of these manifolds. A basic geometric and analytic problem is whether a holomorphic mapping defined on one side of a real hypersurface embedded in complex space extends to the other side of that hypersurface. More generally, one can consider smooth mappings between manifolds of higher codimension in complex space whose components satisfy the boundary Cauchy-Riemann equations. The principal investigators will study such mappings, in particular when the manifolds are given globally by polynomial equations, and will try to determine when such mappings extend holomorphically to the complex space. They will also study the relationship between algebraic and holomorphic equivalence of such manifolds.    Complex numbers and functions of complex variables have been, since the 19th century, important tools in many fundamental problems in mathematics and its application to other areas of science and engineering. The solutions of some of these problems depend on a better understanding of these tools and their basic properties. For instance, the four dimensional space-time used in relativity theory can be considered as a two dimensional complex space. The quantitative and qualitative study of the transformations of geometric objects in complex spaces planned in this proposal may lead to new understanding and solutions of problems in control theory (e.g., motion of objects in space under certain physical constraints). Complex analysis also plays an important role in finding solutions to differenti al equations which model physical problems. Results of the research planned in this proposal could lead to the discovery of new properties of solutions of these equations and hence a better understanding of the related physical problems."

With this approach he already obtained such results as the proof of a defect relation for non-linear hypersurfaces conjectured by B. Shiffman (joint work with Sodin, 1992) and the proof of the Modified Cartan conjecture in dimension three (1996). Specifically, he plans to concentrate on the following topics: normality criteria for holomorphic maps omitting hyperplanes, the study of extremal maps for defect relations, and the Inverse Problem of the Value Distribution Theory for maps to projective spaces, with special attention to the maps satisfying algebraic differential equations, both linear and non-linear.    Meromorphic functions constitute the most basic class of functions used in mathematics and its applications. This class includes elementary functions like the exponential, cosine and tangent functions, as well as higher transcendental functions, like the Gamma function, Airy functions, elliptic functions, etc., which are indispensable in physics, engineering and other applications. The fundamental problem about these functions is the study of solutions of equations f(x)=a, where f is a given function, and a is a given complex number. Usually such equations have infinitely many solutions and the question is how their location depends on the right-hand side of the equation. This is the subject of Value Distribution Theory, a great achievement of mathematical analysis in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the present century. The logic of development of mathematics and potential applications to differential equations require an extension of the main results of this theory to the case of functions whose values are no longer numbers, but i nstead are vectors. Despite major efforts by several outstanding researchers in the beginning of the twentieth century, our current understanding of this subject is very incomplete. Recent breakthroughs give hope of major new advances in the area. Such advances would extend our knowledge of a basic and fundamental mathematical subject, which is the value distribution of the vector-valued entire functions known as ""holomorphic curves in projective spaces."""

The principal focus of this research is an approach to multidimensional truncated moment problems based on an extension theory for the associated moment matrix. When this matrix admits an infinite, positive, finite rank moment matrix extension, this method yields an explicit formula for a finitely atomic representing measure supported on the joint spectrum of a normal tuple of operators corresponding to the extension. The aim of this research is to determine concrete conditions on the moment data which permit the desired extension. Existence theorems for representing measures can also be interpreted as subnormal completion criteria for multivariable weighted shifts. Another facet of this research concerns the multidimensional K-moment problem, where the support of a representing measure is required to be contained in a prescribed closed set K. A direct application of this study concerns the Multidimensional Quadrature Problem in Numerical Analysis. By applying the matrix extension technique in the context of quadrature, this research seeks to construct minimal quadrature rules for such sets as the disk, square, triangle, or annulus. The algorithms that we develop can be explicitly implemented as computer programs.    Mathematical moments are used to model many real-word phenomena, such as area, velocity, momentum, weighted averages, probability distributions, etc. In the evaluation of moments using integrals, the greatest computational costs are associated with function calls. It has long been of interest to scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to devise efficient computational methods for evaluating integrals, methods which minimize the number of expensive function calls. For classical moments, computed as integrals over a straight line, this problem is solved by  classical tools of Numerical Analysis, particularly Gaussian Quadrature. In the present study we seek to devise highly efficient computational algorithms for integrals over sets in the plane (such as a triangle, disk, or square.) We use a new matrix extension method to develop concrete computational rules for efficient evaluation of two-dimensional moments over planar sets. These rules can be coded into computer programs which enhance the ability of scientists and engineers to evaluate integrals efficiently."

Poletsky    Abstract: The first part of this project is devoted to developing methods for construction of plurisubharmonic functions using envelopes of functionals on analytic disks. It became known recently that the theory of such methods can be reduced to the study of disk envelopes of functions on domains in certain infinite-dimensional spaces. Indeed, the complete theory requires solving the classical Lelong problems in an infinite-dimensional setting. The possibility of using flexible methods in the construction of plurisubharmonic functions will allow Poletsky to make advances in the theory of boundary values of such functions, where even the correct definition of ""boundary values"" remains an open question. In particular, Poletsky intends to put forward a natural definition of these values and to establish that every plurisubharmonic function can be decomposed into the sum of a maximal solution to the Dirichlet problem with the same boundary values as the given function and a potential with zero boundary values. He will then study separately the two pieces of this decomposition.     The main tool in the differential calculus invented by Isaac Newton is the derivative of a function, a concept that furnishes a deeper and more precise understanding of the function's behavior than was possible before Newton's time. One will know a function even better if one looks at the derivative of the derivative, the derivative of that second derivative, and so on through derivatives of arbitrary orders. Not all functions, however, are amenable to the computation of these higher order derivatives. Those which do are called ""analytic functions,"" and they are precisely the functions that are most frequently encountered in the applications of calculus to other scientific disciplines. The development of calculus after Newton ushered in two significant expansions of his original framework: the investigation of analytic functions of more than one variable  and the study of analytic functions in which both the variables and the values are complex numbers. Functions fitting the latter description constitute a large and fascinating class of functions that are extremely ""sensitive"": a small change in the function in one place can somehow ripple through the function to change it everywhere. Such behavior is an enormous obstacle in the study of these functions. To overcome this difficulty, one seeks to decompose analytic functions into ""soft"" and ""rigid"" parts and to investigate these parts separately. The main objects of study in this project are the so-called ""plurisubharmonic functions,"" which are the ""soft"" parts of analytic functions of several complex variables. The goal is to understand these functions better, with the hope that in the long run the knowledge gained will translate into a better understanding of the many aspects of everyday experience in which analytic functions play important, but usually unseen, roles."

The level surfaces are the central subject   of study in the theories of phase transitions, geometric evolutions and free boundary problems. Some special level surfaces appear as the boundary of crystals and the wave fronts of shock waves in many practical problems.   We plan to develop some new ideas which help to understand the nature, stability and regularity of these level surfaces. The mathematical existence of flow of crystals and the regularity of the boundary of the crystals are also established.    Since Newton discovered the second law of physics, progress in mathematical   physics has relied on the partial differential equations, from fluid mechanics, relativity to quantum mechanics. Although partial differential equations describe nature quite precisely, they have many challenges. The major difficulty is due to their nonlinearity. Another big source of the complications comes from the singularities of some of the physical quantities. Physically these came from a phenomenon like that of the formation of a black hole or other physical phenomena such as explosion, phase transition or even super-conductivity.   We try to understand these singularities by studying the structure and the configuration of the singularity set. A class of this kind of problems comes from crystal growth and free boundary problems. The motion of the boundary of the crystal is the geometric flow problem. Here the boundary of the crystal, such as in the case of melting ice, is a level surface of the temperature function.

This is a recurrent feature in the proposal. More specifically, the proposal addresses issues of bounds and stability for oscillatory integrals, regularity of Radon transforms and degenerate Fourier integral operators, asymptotic behavior of Green's functions, exact solutions of supersymmetric field and string theories, Hamiltonian theory of solitons and non-linear WKB methods.      These are arguably among the most pressing problems in mathematics and theoretical physics today. Oscillatory integrals are, for example, a well-known feature of any physical scattering process, and progress along the lines suggested here can reduce greatly the extensive effort presently required for their numerical studies. On the other hand, the problems in the proposal concerning supersymmetric theories reflect very recent advances, indicating a deep and surprising correspondence between three seemingly different fields - namely, supersymmetric gauge theories, soliton equations, and Riemann surfaces. The origin of this correspondence is still mysterious, and it may well be essential to on-going attempts at understanding the laws of nature at their most fundamental level."

The major fact underlying this study is the existence of a Besicovitch set, which rules out the boundedness of maximal operators over all directions. When the set of directions is restricted, less is understood. Katz will work on unboundedness in all L^p spaces for maximal operators over Ahlfors regular sets of directions with dimension greater than zero. He will also try to work out Wolff's conjecture about sets that contain a d-dimensional set in each direction. Both of these problems involve finding elasticity in the known constructions of Besicovitch-like sets.    A large part of mathematics (as well as physics and signal processing) involves the interaction between time and frequency. In signal processing, time is a one-dimensional continuum and a signal is a function of time. Much depends upon what can be said about the instantaneous frequency of the signal at a given time. Time and frequency also occur as a metaphor in quantum mechanics. Position takes the place of time and momentum the place of frequency. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle limits how instantaneously we may specify a frequency. It says that a note requires a length of time to be heard -- its wavelength. In the quantum mechanical metaphor, there is no need for time -- now called position -- to be one-dimensional. Thus, neither is frequency so constrained. The relevant ranges needed to specify frequencies become rectangles oriented in various directions. To answer questions about this type of universe, it is necessary to understand the interaction between rectangles in different directions. The purpose of this project is to improve that understanding in the setting of two-dimensional space."

They have been incorporated into the renormalization theory of one-dimensional dynamical systems, played a crucial role in the foundations of higher dimensional holomorphic dynamics, enabled advances in long-standing problems in hyperbolic geometry, witnessed the solution of classical problems on analytic differential equations, and led to new concepts in  topology. The conference will bring together people looking at laminations and foliations from different points of view in the hope that it will create fruitful interactions between intimately related but somewhat separated fields.      Laminations and foliations play a fundamental role in the theory of dynamical systems, which is the general study of evolution of systems that change with time. Dynamical systems theory emerged, historically, in celestial mechanics, and has since found numerous further applications everywhere: in statistical mechanics, biology, chemistry, economics, and so on. It has deep implications for any aspect of science involving the time-evolution of complex systems.  The study of foliations is concerned with the way that a large system can be broken up into a family of smaller systems, like layers of dough in a pastry.  For  example, a physical system in which energy is conserved separates into thin layers, one for each energy level. The ability to analyze a system in this way is of crucial importance, and leads to deep connections between the dynamics and phenomena in other important subfields of mathematics, in particular, in geometry and topology. The broadly interdisciplinary nature of the subject was one of the main motivations for this conference.  With this in mind, the conference will be strongly directed towards the interests of graduate students and young researchers, who will have a chance to see a broader perspective of mathematics in its active development.  To support this educational goal, the conference will include , in addition to the customary research lectures, a number of introductory ""mini-courses"" which will provide participants with a more comprehensive outlook on different aspects of the field."

Linear operator theory has had a strong interplay  with analytic function theory and engineering for many decades.  Indeed most commercial software (at least in the control engineering community)   for solving analytic function problems is based on this type of interplay between functions and matrices. One branch of analysis closely related to applications is classical Nevanlinna-Pick-Nehari theory,or equivalently  commutant lifting theory, a part of the area called operator model theory.  The early development of this  was done for the purest of mathematical reasons,   but in the mid 1970's  and early 1980's this was shown by this investigator and others to be critical to the design of engineering systems where   stability of the system is the key constraint. This motivated much  more mathematical development and now it is one of the areas   of functional analysis most closely associated with control   engineering. For many years (since Norbert Wiener) design tools   optimized mean square performance. The theory above ultimately lead to   (commercially commonplace) tools for optimizing worst case   frequency domain performance. The aim of this proposal is to extend this core theory in radically new directions: 1.Highly nonlinear generalizations.   The goal is to find canonical ''nonlinear generalizations"" of   analytic function theory and the related parts of operator theory.   Many systems which people wish to control are nonlinear (e.g., jet engines),   so there is a big demand for an effective nonlinear theory. 2.Linear Operators} Intersections of matrix intervals, and Hereditary operators and polynomials   are the subject of work with Jim Agler. 3. Optimization over spaces of analytic functions} (with Orlando Merino and others). Qualitative theory, computer  algorithms based on this theory, a nalysis of such algorithms. Connections of this work with other branches of mathematics. These are the key optimization problems which arise in designs of linear engineering systems where there are competing constraints, or uncertainty in the math model of the physical system one is trying to control. 4. Computer operator algebra.Linear engineering systems theory and operator theory are rife with calculations in a noncommuting algebra. For example, if the classical core above is set in engineering   `statespace coordinates', the main theorems can be derived mostly by matrix algebra. Helton's group are the main providers   of software (called NCAlgebra) for performing general noncommuting calculations in Mathematica. The work has gone thru several phases and in current research the investigators now have extensive software implementing noncommutative Groebner basis algorithms due to Mora in C++ and linked Mathematica software   for sorting and ''shrinking"" the output in various ways. It is used in the  highly ambitious pursuit of trying to find computer methods for helping a researcher ''discover"" (rather than just verify) theorems in branches of operator theory and engineering systems."

Abs    Proposal: DMS-9801461  Principal Investigator: Jim Agler    Abstract:        After the spectral theorem it is difficult to think of a theorem that has had a more profound effect on the development of operator theory and its myriad applications to mathematics and science than the Sz.-Nagy Dilation Theorem.  The idea of representing a general operator in a specified class of operators as a part of a nice operator in the class has had many successes and we seek to develop this point of view with a primary focus on unsolved problems in matrix theory, operator theory,  and the theories of functions in one and several complex variables. A particular group of problems that we propose to attack involve the generalizations to several complex variables of some of the classical moment and  interpolation problems on the unit disc such as the interpolation theorem of Nevanlinna and Pick, and the moment theorems of Caratheodory and Herglotz. Another group involves deriving analogs of the theorem of Adamyan, Arov, and Krein on spaces more general than the classical Hardy space. Research intrinsic to operator theory that we will undertake  includes issues involving model theory in one variable on nonsimply con- nected domains in the plane and in several variables on domains other than the bidisc.    Operator Theory,  the particular type of mathematics that we are proposing to investigate, has direct and  concrete benefits for a number of areas of human endeavor.  For example, the model theory aspects of our proposal  all involve the generalization of the Commutant Lifting Structure, which leads to an efficient algorithm for the discovery of oil from acoustical data taken on the surface of the earth.  Other aspects would add to the theory of Linear Matrix Inequalities.  LMIs, which currently are all the rage in several areas of engineering, are an extension of linear programming, which has made large scale resource allocation and economic prediction possible. Finally, the particular brand of functi on theory we propose to study forms the mathematical core of the recently developed H-infinity control theory, which has been used to design control systems for fusion reactions inside Tokamaks and feedback stabilization systems for the space shuttle."

Inverse problems involve describing internal properties, such as the conductivity of an airplane wing, the elasticity of subterranean ore deposits, or the density of human tissue, given only measurements made externally.

Events in the past may have built up an initial stress in the object, for example, through welding or seismic fault activity.

In this project   the PI will continue to study geometric evolution problems for surfaces   driven by mean curvature. These models are widely used in material sciences, physics, and chemistry to model phase changes, domain growth,and interface controlled crystal growth. Progress on the mathematical front will   necessarily have an impact in material sciences.    The Mullins-Sekerka model is a nonlocal geometric evolution law in which   the normal velocity of a propagating interface depends on the jump   across the interface of the normal derivative of a function which   is harmonic on either side and which equals the mean curvature on   the propagating interface. It was introduced to study solidification and liquidation of materials of zero specific heat and has attracted considerable attention since then.Important contributions by Alikakos, Bates and Chen   have tied this  model to a singular limit for the Cahn-Hilliard equation, a fourth order parabolic equation which is widely used as a model for phase separation and coarsening phenomena in a melted binary alloy.  This model has also been proposed to account for aging or Ostwald ripening   in phase transitions. In general, the kinetics of a first order phase transition is characterized by a first stage where small droplets of a new phase are created out of the old phase, e.g., solid formation in an undercooled   liquid. The first stage, called nucleation,yields a large number of small particles .During the next stage the nuclei grow rapidly at the expense of the old phase.When the phase regions are formed,the mass of the new phase is close to equilibrium and the amount of undercooling is small,but large surface area is present.At the next stage, the configuration of phase regions is coarsened, and the geometric shape of the phase regions become simpler and simpler,   eventually tending to regions of minimum surface area with given volume.  The driving force of this process comes from the need to decrease the interfacial energy. There have been considerable effortsin finding a theory which describes Ostwald ripening, and the Mullins-Sekerka model is a prominent candidate.The surface diffusion flow and the intermediate surface diffusion flow are geometric evolution problems which model morphological changes where surface diffusion and interface kinetics are the transport mechanisms.   These laws constitute a class of dynamic problems where the volume   is conserved and the driving force is surface energy reduction."

Kalton    Abstract:    The aim of  this proposal is  to study a  number of problems related to the notion of an extension of one Banach space by another,  and  the  relationships  between  extensions   and unconditional  structure.   It  is  proposed  to attempt to resolve the conjecture that if every minimal extension of  a Banach space is  trivial then the space has finite cotype, and  to  attempt  a  classification  of those spaces so that every extension by a Hilbert  space is trivial. Both  these problems can be reformulated  in other terms and  would have considerable  significance  independent  of  the  theory  of extensions.  The proposer will also work on the fundamental problem in the theory of unconditional structure of  whether every  complemented   subspace  of   a  Banach   space  with unconditional basis also has an unconditional basis.    The theory of extensions can be considered in the following terms.  Suppose we are given a centrally symmetric solid  in three or more dimensions and we are allowed only to  compute its  cross-section  by  a  slice  in some directions and the shadow cast  by the  body in  the perpendicular  directions. This  allows  us  to  compute  certain information about the solid, but  not to reconstruct it  completely.  The aim of this project  is to obtain more  complete information about the body under certain additional conditions. It turns  out that many questions of importance in mathematical analysis and applications, although not  expressed in this form, can be visualized as problems of this nature, perhaps  involving infinite dimensions. An unconditional basis in a particular class of  functions  is  a collection of relatively simple functions with which we can approximate every member of  the class;  such  approximations  are  very  important  for many practical  situations,    for  example   in  engineering applications. One of the aims of this project is to decide general conditions under w hich  a basis can be constructed.

Surface maps are two-dimensional transformations; the study of such transformations, especially area preserving ones, has a long history going back to Poincare and G. D. Birkhoff.  There are numerous applications of results in this area to classical mechanics as well as to more modern chaotic dynamics.  In physical terms, Professor Xia's proposed research is on: the dynamics of bodies being acted on by gravitation; the way the dynamics of a system changes as parameters in it vary; and the dynamics of systems in which energy is conserved."

I concentrate my work on the Cauchy problem for two particular dispersive equations:   the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation and the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation.   The first question I address in my project is the following:  given a dispersive equation,   how much regularity does one have to assume for the initial profile (initial data condition)   in order to be able to insure existence and uniqueness of the wave solution at later times?   Such a question becomes more complicated to answer when one also imposes boundary conditions.  At the moment, the techniques available (Harmonic and Fourier Analysis)   only apply to the case of periodic boundary conditions. The second question I address is how certain regularity properties of the wave solution are preserved in time, once it is assumed that the wave ``lives'' for all times and it is smooth. More precisely, under these conditions, I study the asymptotic behavior of the size of the wave measured taking into account the order of differentiability. This is a very different problem than the one described above. Nevertheless the techniques I rely upon to answer both questions are very similar in their nature.    Dispersive partial differential equations are introduced to model many wave phenomena that occur in nature. Some examples are, for instance, propagation of signals in optic fibers, nonlinear  ionic-sonic  waves in plasma in a magnetic field and long waves in plasma.  In my work I improve and develop some  abstract  mathematical tools in order to obtain from general properties of the initial profile of the wave information about the evolution of the wave itself.  This information regards the time of existence of the wave, the persistence of certain properties,   the behavior near singular points, and the energy carried by the wave.  In some cases part of this information can  be recovered by conducting experiments in laboratories. Conversely, the results I obtain provide mathematical justifications for certain empirical observations."

Among the projects  on stability:  1) We have devloped an alternative approach to problems that seemed  accessible only via the KAM strategy. In dimensions one and two we  obtained finer results both in the smoothness of the conjugation of circle  diffeomorphism (completing the pioneering results of Herman and Yoccoz)  and persistence under perturbation of twist maps of certain invariant circles  (Moser's theorem and extensions), as well as smoothness of curves invariant under surface diffeomorphism.  These methods   look promising as tools for the study of existence and smoothness of invariant tori in higher dimensions.  2) Establishing that a flow is Bernoulli not only characterizes it completely  as an abstract measure theoretic flow,  but also serves as the main step in  proving statistical stability. We are in the process of formalizing general  criteria for Bernoullicity of flows. Among the projects on limit behavior we  mention the study of multiple recurrence with polynomial times and problems  dealing with dimensions of fractals and other limit sets.    Dynamical systems are mathematical models of evolutionary phenomena  in both natural and social sciences. They  also provide  important tools in statistics, computer sciences, combinatorics, etc.  In this broad and broadening subject, we direct our main effort  to problems dealing with stability: to what extent are the perceived properties of a system robust, that is, will persist if the system is perturbed (modified) somewhat.  In any sort of practical application, where the data and the parameters are known only approximately, one can hardly rely on properties which are not stable. One of our main projects is to find conditions which guarantee the existence of surfaces invariant under the system. In  the right dimension, such (hyper) surfaces separate the space into invariant regions, or domains from which orbits cannot escape, and if the surface persists under perturbation-so do the domains. In other words, we can guarantee that some conditions will never evolve into some other (specific) type."

Concerning the first   area, special emphasis will be given to the study of moment problems   associated with singular matrices, building on recent work (joint  with L.A.   Fialkow) on flat extensions of positive moment matrices, which has led to a    general framework for the study of truncated complex moment problems.    With the  aid of a new moment matrix associated to a semi-algebraic set,   progress is expected  in the localization-of-support problem.  A   characterization of quadrature domains in  terms of their moment matrices,   and further applications to quadrature and cubature  formulas will also be   sought.  As part of (ii), a characterization of polynomially  hyponormal   weighted shifts,  a structure theorem for quadratically hyponormal shifts, and   the detection of non-subnormal polynomially hyponormal operators through   the Pincus principal  function and through Putinar's 2-subscalar model, will be   sought.  The research aim  in the third area (which deals with a Sz. Nagy-   Foias dilation theory in several  variables and builds on recent work of A.   Athavale, V. Muller, F.-H. Vasilescu and  others), is to extend the existing   theory to functional Hilbert spaces over Reinhardt domains.  The suitability of   multi-shifts as standard models, the validity of von Neumann's  inequality for   special n-tuples, and the structure of C*-algebras generated by spherical   isometries, will be considered.  The fourth and final area deals with  the   invariant subspace structure of commuting contractions on Hilbert space.    Using recent results of J. Eschmeier, M. Kosiek, A. Octavio, M. Ptak, and   others, two main goals will be pursued:  (a) an extension to the Taylor   spectrum of results on spectral dominance currently available only for the   Harte spectrum, and (b) an analog of  Apostol's Theorem in several variables.       Multivariable operator theory is a rapidly evolving area of   mathematics, with deep and significant connections with areas of differential   geometry, topology, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry, and with   exciting applications to engineering, quantum and relativistic mechanics, and   computational mathematics.  The theory of truncated moment problems   provide easily accessible formulas for the evaluation of areas and volumes of   complex regions, of moments of inertia and centers of gravity. Dilation theory   and invariant subspace theory are essential tools to describe the algebraic   properties of elaborate physical or engineering systems, and the study of   transformations on function spaces has often led to the solution of problems    in control theory, intimately tied to systems theory and electrical engineering.    Our research project is aimed at resolving some outstanding problems in   multivariable operator theory, while creating recruitment and retention   opportunities for women and minorities to pursue careers in mathematics, by   engaging their participation in projects related to the interaction of   mathematics with other sciences."

To understand the long time behavior of a water wave,  Wu would like to determine whether the free surface of such a wave remains non-self-intersecting and whether solutions of water wave problems exist for all time, given that the initial free surface of the water wave is a small perturbation of still water. To be more precise, she would like to characterize those initial free surfaces that guarantee the non-self-intersection of the free surface of a water wave for all time. She also wants to study the blow-up mechanism for those solutions of the water wave problem that fail to exist for all time. The methods used to tackle these problems arise from harmonic analysis and the theory of partial differential equations. They include: decay estimates, maximal principle arguments, and the construction of a self-similar solution to the problem. To understand the motion of the interface between any two superposed fluids, Wu intends to study such fundamental questions as the existence of solutions to the equation governing the motion and the singularity profiles of solutions. To achieve this goal, she hopes to adapt the methods in her earlier work on water waves to derive a quasilinear equation equivalent to the equation that describes the motion of the interface. The reason for this approach is that the equation which models the motion of a two-fluid interface is highly nonlinear. In general, one has a better understanding of quasilinear equations than of fully nonlinear equations. The proposed research is a continuation of the work started by Nalimov, Yosihara and Craig and later advanced by the principal investigator on the existence and uniqueness of solutions of water wave problems and the work of Sulem, Dochun and Robert, Caflisch and Orellana, and Ebin on the well-posedness of vortex sheet motion.      Fluid waves, in  numerous guises, are present in some of the most familiar experiences of daily life, from the jarring impact of loud noises on our eardrums to the soothing ebb and flow of surf at a beach. The rich variety of phenomena associated with wave motion have provided generations of physicists and mathematicians with an important and challenging research subject. The general problem of motion of the free interface of two superposed fluids has applications to a wide variety of concrete physical problems. It has been used to understand the mixing of fluids, the separation of boundary layers, the generation of sounds, and coherent structures in models of turbulence. The long term objective of the proposed work is to understand wave-breaking in surface waves and the singularity mechanism in vortex sheets, both topics that have significant ramifications for physics and engineering."

Among the specific goals are to extend his earlier application of harmonic analysis and heat kernel techniques to compute the exact size (in terms of Hausdorff measures) of the limit sets of Kleinian groups to new examples (e.g., manifolds with thin parts) and new sets (the conical limit set, the set of escaping geodesics,...).  He will also attempt to extend Bowen's famous dichotomy to all divergence type Fuchsian groups, extending work of Sullivan, Astala, Zinsmeister, Jones and himself. Part of this is to further study the ``beta''s, a technical measure of how close a set is to a line segment at different scales, which is closely related to the study of the traveling salesman problem.  He will also continue his work investigating the removable and non-removable sets for quasi-conformal mappings, geometric properties of Brownian motion, and other geometric-analytic questions in classical complex analysis.<br/><br/><br/>The proposal deals with a variety of geometric questions which are united by a desire to understand traditional concepts and calculations (e.g. compute the area of a region) in non-traditional and highly non-smooth cases.  This is motivated by (at least) two points of view.  First, a better understanding of the classical case can be obtained by seeing how it succeeds or fails in a more general setting; even the failures lead to new, interesting phenomena to investigate.  Second, many applications of mathematics (polymers, fractures, shock waves, wavelet analysis, crystal growth,...) involve highly irregular and fractal objects, and we need to understand and calculate with such objects the way we have always done with much smoother quantities.  For example, Brownian motion is a mathematical object which models random movement and is of tremendous intrinsic interest, as well as being fundamental to understanding many other random processes (e.g., shapes of long polymers chains, growth of crystals by random accretion, ...). However, Brownian motion is an extremely non-smooth process and various simple geometric questions about its random paths are still unknown.  Another example is with the Kleinian groups mentioned above.  These are symmetries in non-Euclidean geometry; as such, they are fundamental objects in topology and have been an area of intense investigation for many years.  They can be associated with certain fractal objects (the limit sets) involving non-linear rescalings, where the non-linearity is of a very special type, and present a theoretical stepping stone between self-similar sets with linear rescalings (which are fairly well understood) and much more complicated rescalings found in rational dynamics and chaos theory. <br/><br/>"

Most results in the past have focused on asymptotic answers, that is, they obtain formulae that are valid, for example, when the number of variables summed is very large (the Law of Large Numbers, or the Central Limit Theorem). It is intended to find formulae that work in all situations. The second project concerns obtaining an inequality in which we wish to show that rank-one functions are quasi-convex. This would have profound consequences in harmonic analysis and the study quasi-conformal functions. It would settle the conjecture of Iwaniec concerning the best constant for the norm of the Beurling-Ahlfors Operator. It also has possible consequences in obtaining weak type estimates for singular integrals independent of dimension, which would be something quite unexpected in harmonic analysis. Finally, the research would find applications in applied mathematics, in problems dealing with homogenization of non-linear dielectrics.    The first project deals with the following problem. If we are given a number of random quanitities, what can we say about their sum? For example, what can we say about the average height of ten people picked randomly from the population? This problem is fundamental in probability theory, tracing its historical roots back to the very beginnings of the discipline. There are still many unanswered problems in this area. The second project studies the nature of the concept of convexity. This is a cornerstone property of much mathematics, and it has been used in many areas of science, such as physics and engineering. This particular project studies quasi-convexity, a notion that emerged out of attempts to understand how elastic bodies are distorted under various forces and stresses. The principal investigator (along with D. Talbot) has already used t hese ideas to study problems of a different kind - namely, problems in electrostatics."

The emphasis will be on the eigenvalue problems for the fixed and free vibrations of a membrane and for the vibration and buckling of a clamped  plate. Concentration will be focused on the following specific problems: (1) finding lower bounds for the first, or fundamental, eigenvalues of  these problems in terms of geometric quantities; (2) finding  inequalities for ratios of low-index eigenvalues and, more generally, inequalities bounding an arbitrary eigenvalue in terms of lower eigenvalues; (3) finding comparison results relating eigenvalues from two or more of the problems or relating eigenvalues for domains in one space to those in some other, perhaps better understood, space.  Included in these comparison results would be those where a given eigenvalue of one of the problems formulated in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold is related back to the  corresponding eigenvalue of a more regular problem -- for example, the  corresponding eigenvalue of a ball in a constant curvature space  (Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic space).  Because of the normalizing role they play, much of the effort will be directed at obtaining sharp bounds for eigenvalue problems in these basic spaces, and particularly at  understanding eigenvalue problems for geodesic balls in these  spaces.<br/><br/>The main reason for studying the problems described above is that eigenvalues bear a simple relation to the characteristic (or natural) frequencies of vibration of membranes and plates, as well as to the critical buckling load in the buckling problem (i.e., the minimum force that needs to be applied around the perimeter of a plate to make it buckle). The importance of such issues for physics and engineering cannot be overstated.  Here membranes and plates of arbitrary shape are contemplated, and results that control the characteristic frequencies and buckling loads in terms of geometric parameters are sought. In particular, one is often most interested in the lowest, or so-called fundamental, frequency of a membrane or plate, since it is usually the most important one physically.  Having a general understanding of how various geometrical features affect these  frequencies can be a great aid in the design of physical components,  whether the desire is to tune a given natural frequency to a  specific value or to suppress vibrations of the component in a certain frequency range (to avoid resonance, for example). The  eigenvalue problems considered also describe key properties of  waveguides, and as such have important implications for fiber optics. Moreover, it ought to be possible to establish eigenvalue inequalities of much the same form that apply to more general differential operators; e.g., the Schroedinger equation, which is fundamental to quantum physics.  <br/>"

Special attention will be paid to several key features of the theory.   First, a strong emphasis is placed on problems having a global character.  In particular, the topology of the underlying manifold is expected to play   a significant role. Also, global integral representation formulas (in terms   of multi-layer type operators) for the solution are sought.  Second, minimal smoothness assumptions are to be made on the  analytical and geometrical structures involved. In this context, a symbolic   calculus is no longer readily available and, hence, the nature of the   problems at hand is significantly altered.  The overall objective is to undertake a systematic study of such problems  via the modern tools of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.    Such problems are not only of a purely academic interest. Besides the mere   understanding of the natural limits of the theory, this study is also   motivated by real-life problems (like those involving domains with edges,   corners or cracks, discontinuous coefficients and/or boundary data,   non-homogeneous and/or anisotropic media) where non-smooth problems  are considerably more abundant than smooth ones.  Indeed, any realistic application, such as calculating the   scattered wave from the body of an airplane, will have to confront   some kind of roughness such as domains with non-smooth  boundaries. Formulating the theory which ultimately allows for the   design of efficient numerical algorithms for such problems will be one   of the main goals of the proposed research."

The main purpose of these meetings was to enable mathematicians and mathematics students in the universities in the Southeast to interact with each other and with mathematicians and students from outside the region who have also been attending the conferences and to provide a forum for presentation of recent mathematical research. The National Science Foundation began regular support of these biannual meetings in 1986. The current award  will be used to continue this conference activity for the period 1998-2001. Three Miniconferences on Harmonic Analysis and Related Areas will be held at Auburn University during the fall semesters of 1998, 1999, and 2000. Three Miniconferences on Real Analysis and Related Areas will be held at Auburn University (spring 1999), University of Louisville (spring 2000), and California State University at San Bernardino (spring 2001), respectively.  Each meeting will feature hour talks by the (usually 2 or 3) Invited Principal Speakers plus contributed 20-minute talks and problem sessions. All of the funds provided by the grant will be used to pay expenses of participants attending the miniconferences.  Expenses for Principal Speakers are paid in full and local housing, local transportation, and some meals will be provided for all participants. Additional support in the form of additional food allowances and some travel support is provided for student participants. There are no registration fees.<br/><br/>These conferences have been effective in stimulating research activity of ""professional research mathematicians"" in the areas of mathematics represented.  Speakers have been attracted from over 30 states and as many as 14 foreign countries in the past 13 years.  Possibly of more importance is the impact this activity has had on the faculty and students at the institution where the conferences are held as well as on faculty and student participants from other universities in the state and region.  Such participants usually make up about half the total who attend.  For the meetings held at Auburn, participants regularly come from UA Tuscaloosa, UA Birmingham, Troy State U, U West Ala, Jacksonville State U, U South Ala, Spring Hill Coll, U Mobile, U Montevallo, Ala State U, AU Montgomery, and Tuskegee Institute, as well as from institutions in the neighboring states of Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi.  For many of these  participants, especially the students, this opportunity for contact with mathematicians and mathematics students from other parts of the country is the most intellectually stimulating experience of the year.

Kohn    Abstract: Kohn will continue to do research in the theory of several complex variables,   partial differential equations and related topics. In particular, he is interested in: global regularity, hypoellipticity, Holder and L-p estimates, domains with piecewise smooth  boundaries, and embeddings of CR manifolds. Kohn is currently working on the subject of hypoellipticity both for boundary behavior in several complex variables and for differential and pseudodifferential operators. His interest is in finding qualitative (be they geometric or algebraic) conditions under which hypoellipticity holds. The technical  part of much of this research is connected with estimates which do not ""gain""  smoothness, so the error terms are of the same magnitude as the object one is trying to estimate. Kohn is developing techniques to deal with this type of difficulty.      Since Cardano's work on the cubic equation in the sixteenth century it has been known that complex numbers are needed, as an intermediary step, to find real solutions of certain problems even when such numbers appear neither in the statements nor in the solutions of the problems themselves. Thus, by the middle of the last century, it was recognized that complex analysis is deeply intertwined with many fundamental problems of mathematics, science, and technology. One of the most spectacular instances of this is the use of ""Dirichlet's principle"" (which arises in fluid mechanics) to understand the foundations of the theory of functions of one complex variable and, in turn, the use of complex analysis in the study of fluid flows. In recent times much of the research in complex analysis has focused on functions of several complex variables, where the counterpart of the Dirichlet principle appears in what is known as Hodge theory and in the so-called d-bar Neumann problem. Kohn is doing research in this area, research that also involves work in partial differential equations, harmonic a nalysis, and geometry. Kohn is currently working on problems of ""smoothness"" and ""propagation of singularities"" that arise in the study of partial differential equations."

The spherical maximal function arises in the solution to the 3-dimensional wave equation, and its variants play a role in understanding more general hyperbolic equations. The PI will continue to investigate L^p inequalities for maximal operators over convex surfaces, especially in the range p < 2, with attention to the related problems of multiparameter variants and L^p-improving convolution operators. He will build on the recent success in understanding regularity for the oblique derivative problem by applying the techniques used there to even more degenerate boundary value problems, both linear and nonlinear. Harnack's inequality and Holder regularity extend to a large class of equations with rough coefficients in the presence of ellipticity, the permitted roughness being essential in applications to nonlinear problems. Sawyer will attempt to obtain sharp estimates in terms of the eigenvalues of the degenerate operator when ellipticity is relaxed, in order that Holder regularity of solutions follows. Applications to the Monge-Ampere equation will also be considered.<br/><br/>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to model physical processes, often in an ""idealized"" way, but this very simplification usually leads to a better understanding of the role played by the various complex factors involved. Harmonic analysis is, roughly speaking, the breakdown of data into simple components which are easily analyzed under the processes being investigated. Analyzing existence, uniqueness, regularity and growth of solutions to PDEs through harmonic analysis has led to increased understanding of wave processes such as optics and electromagnetism, and more theoretical topics related to quantum mechanics. The study of averages related to PDEs has application to tomography as well as to theoretical aspects of solutions.<br/>"

New problems   of mathematical physics require new special functions and   suggest new approaches to studying special functions.  The Gauss hypergeometric function is an example of a classical   special function.  The Gauss hypergeometric function  satisfies the remarkable hypergeometric differential equation.   The hypergeometric differential equation is connected with   representation theory of   affine Lie algebras.  The monodromy properties of the   Gauss hypergeometric function lead to the theory of quantum groups.     Modern field theory and statistical mechanics suggest a new point of   view on the Gauss hypergeometric function, namely, one considers  the hypergeometric differential equation as a special example of   the differential equation for conformal blocks  on the Riemann sphere and the Gauss hypergeometric function as   a special conformal block on the Riemann sphere.  Thus,  a new   class of special functions arises - the conformal blocks on Riemann   surfaces. To describe algebraic properties of conformal blocks   one will need new algebraic structures. Namely, the algebraic structure   underlying the properties of conformal blocks on the Riemann sphere  is the standard quantum group structure. The algebraic structure underlying   the properties of conformal blo cks on the torus is the recently  discovered dynamical quantum group structure. One can  expect that to describe properties of conformal blocks on Riemann   surfaces of a given genus, one will need the corresponding  to this genus variant of the quantum group theory.   The aim of this project is to develop the theory of special functions   associated with Riemann surfaces of an arbitrary genus and study   algebraic structures associated with these special functions."

In mathematics, many problems of interest are just too complicated to attack them directly. There are two fundamental principles which help gain some insight into complicated phenomena: the symmetry, which helps understand the structure   of the problem, and the law of large numbers, which forces systems of a very large size behave, in a sense, in a simplified and predictable fashion. The interaction of these principles plays the  key role in the project.   For example, we study a certain quantum mechanical system of particles   and use its rich symmetries to obtain information about the behavior of this system as the number of particles becomes very, very large.

Specifically, he plans to look at the lattice of invariant subspaces of the shift operator on the Hardy space of a ""slit domain"" in the complex plane. Invariant subspaces of Hardy spaces on other types of domains such as the disk, the annulus, and ""crescent"" domains  were examined by Beurling, Sarason, Hitt, Aleman, Richter, Olin, and Yakubovich. Ross also plans to look at the 1 and 2 invariant subspaces of the (formal) shift operator on spaces of harmonic functions on the disk (e.g., the Bergman and Dirichlet spaces) and, in particular, to examine (via duality) how complications in one space are realized in the other. <br/><br/>This work combines two fields of mathematics, harmonic function theory and operator theory, both of which stem from classical problems in physics (such as heat diffusion and electrostatics) which are still active areas of research today.  It is the hope that a better mathematical understanding of the functions and operators involved will shed new light on the physical processes themselves. Investigations of the mathematics generated by the above physics problems goes back to 18th and 19th century mathematicians such as Fourier, Dirichlet, Kelvin, Weierstrass, and von Neumann and continues today with ground breaking work of mathematicians from all over the world.<br/>"

These notions will be  studied from two interlaced viewpoints. One is that of various dynamical systems and the other is that of geometric measure theory as applied to recursively generated objects. These approaches naturally meld with one another and lead to some interesting mixtures of ideas. During the last few years we have developed a fairly extensive theory of the iteration of infinitely many uniformly contracting conformal maps(hyperbolic systems) and have made some applications of it to some well known problems. We would like to extend this theory to cover a more structured iteration of maps-whose governed by directed graphs or  substitutions and random iterations. We also wish to apply our theory to  geometric object obtained as limit sets of Kleinian groups or more generally a system of maps which are not uniformly contracting(parabolic systems). We intend to develop the tools necessary to  apply our theory to continue obtaining new results about the geometric structure of sets of continued fractions and relationships to classical arithmetic density results. We also plan to develop an appropriate multifractal formalism for our systems. We want to use these tools to describe some aspects of the geometry of the Julia sets of Collett-Eckmann rational functions. Finally, we want to obtain some approximation theorems which should be useful for obtaining analogues of known section and projection theorems concerning Hausdorff measures and dimension to packing measures and dimension and other mixed geometric measures. The specific problems of this proposal arise from many contexts and their solutions will involve a mixture of techniques from various areas: complex analysis, dynamics, functional  analysis-theory of positive operators of the Reulle-Perron-Frobeni us type(transfer operators), measure theory and probability, statistical physics-equilibrium states, and thermodynamic formalism.    This work arises from problems occurring in several diverse areas-statistical physics, thermodynamics, the theory of turbulence, geometry, algorithms or recipes for generating various geometric objects which are subject to random  errors and finally, to dynamical systems where the long term behavior of   the system is governed by some seemingly strange object. Our work focuses  on some common features of all of these systems. First, we intend to show  how, in a natural way, to produce measures associated with each system.  For some systems, these measures give us a means of measuring the long term behavior of the system. For some systems, it gives us a means of quantifying the fine scale geometric structure of the object produced or of stating what the geometric structure will be like on average. To each of these measures is associated a dimension, a number which might not be an integer-a fractal dimension. These dimension numbers can be computed or estimated by some basic  formulas which we have developed. This is useful for applications. This part can be carried out with the aid of computer studies and thus is of direct interest for pratical reasons.  We intend to continue to develop applicable formulas for determining these dimensions and from that how to produce the associated measures which yield so much information about the system."

Chaotic sets for such maps tend to occur as the support of certain positive closed currents, thus pluripotential theory is a natural tool to use in understanding the dynamics of birational maps.  Diller plans to take this insight a step further, by understanding a birational map entirely in terms of its action on appropriately chosen positive currents.  For instance, he proposes to replace the projective plane by a dynamically defined quotient of the space of non-constant analytic disks as the natural domain of a birational map.  The hope is that since the refined domain will not have points which are indeterminate for the map, it will be a more natural setting for constructing and understanding the dynamically significant currents.   A dynamical system is any process that evolves in time-for instance, the weather or information traffic on the internet.   It is often both very useful and very difficult to understand the behavior of such systems.  The problems and solutions concerning such systems are often mathematical and can be reduced to sets of equations which can then be analyzed theoretically by hand or experimentally by computer simulation.  This work will contribute to the further understanding of still more complicated and ever more realistic systems."

Three other areas of investigation are proposed: stability under small random perturbations; strange attractors of a certain solenoidal type and possible applications; and the use of dynamical systems techniques in two problems from mathematical physics, the one-dimensional Schroedinger operator and the fast dynamo problem in magneto-hydrodynamics.  Physical phenomena, such as weather and atmospheric disturbances, evolve with time. Dynamical Systems is the branch of mathematics that studies the theories that lie behind the time evolutions of these and other processes. Researchers in this field analyze models proposed by physical scientists, form theoretical bases for explaining observed phenomena, and aim ultimately to predict future occurrences. One of the advances in the nonlinear sciences in this century is the recognition that relatively simple physical laws can and do have extremely complicated manifestations. Behaviors that appear to follow no logical patterns are often grouped under the term ""chaos.""  Chaotic systems are the objects of this research.

Bourgain         1. The PI intend to continue research on several aspects of nonlinear  Hamiltonian PDE's. A first line of investigation is the KAM-theory for PDE's   (on bounded domains - assuming periodic boundary conditions say), concerned   with existence and persistency of time periodic and quasi-periodic solutions.   A second theme is the wellposedness theory for the initial value problem with   special emphasis on critical nonlinearity and data of minimal regularity.       The first research direction is closely related to the theory of smooth  dynamical systems (here in infinite dimensional phase space) and localization   theory for lattice Schrodinger operators.

Nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE's such as the nonlinear wave equations   (NLW) and nonlinear Schrodinger equations (NLS) are mathematical models in a   number of issues in physics and engineering.  They are studied by many   distinct groups of scientists, with different emphasis and often different   (mathematical) tools. My interest in this proposal is an analytically purely   rigorous inv estigation. From this point of view NLW (resp, NLS) are the   typical model equations for finite (resp. infinite) speed propagation.  When considering questions of global dynamics, one should distinguish the   case of bounded and unbounded spatial domains where different features should     be expected and the ""natural"" problems (often unsolved) are also distinct.  Of course, a first question to ask is whether the solution exists for all time   and remains smooth in case of smooth data.  Next is the question of long time   behaviour, both for individual data and the dynamics in various phase space.    In the case of bounded domains, we are particularly interested in almost   periodic behaviour.  On the line, due to dispersion, scattering often occurs   and we intend to investigate this phenomenon in certain critical cases."

Abs    Abstract    Proposal: DMS-9800782  Principal Investigator: Peter Haskell      Professor Haskell plans to study the index theory of perturbed operators of Dirac type on complete and incomplete noncompact manifolds. Index-theoretic invariants of such operators extend the invariants arising from coarse geometry and suggest a formulation of a theory of ends for operator algebras. Some examples of Dolbeault operators with meromorphic perturbations have been used in physical models. Index formulas for more general examples involve the Todd class of the perturbation's possibly singular zero set.  The index of an operator that is invariant under and elliptic in directions transverse to a smooth action of a compact Lie group on a closed manifold is usually expressed as a distribution but can be expressed in terms of differences of multiplicities of irreducible representations in the operator's kernel and cokernel. Professor Haskell plans to calculate the latter version using indices of perturbed first-order differential operators on incomplete manifolds. Professor Haskell also plans to develop the index theory associated with self-adjoint perturbed Dirac operators. This will include the role of such operators in the index theory of perturbed Dirac operators on noncompact manifolds with noncompact boundaries. Such work will begin with the investigation of the effect of perturbation growth and end geometry on the spectral theory of self-adjoint perturbed Dirac operators.    Because much of physics is about quantities, such as velocity and acceleration, which represent rates of change, mathematical models of physics are often expressed as differential equations, the solutions of which are functions whose rates of change have specified properties. Index theory (for  instance, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem) is the study of geometric properties revealed by the comparison of sizes of solution sets of differential equations. Many of the most challenging problems in geometry and topology involve  spaces that extend indefinitely. Because many physical models are based on Euclidean space, physicists have studied examples of differential equations on spaces that extend indefinitely. Physical problems involving these differential equations are most tractable in the presence of a constraining force, whose mathematical manifestation is as a potential term in the differential equations (for example, in the Schroedinger equations of quantum physics). Professor Haskell plans to investigate the geometric information carried by differential equations with potential terms in more complicated geometric settings. While understanding the analysis on and geometry of complicated spaces that extend indefinitely is a goal in itself, this work may also have implications for models of geometrically constrained physical systems. Because Professor Haskell's techniques are based on ""noncommutative topology"" (that is, spaces are studied via algebras of functions on them), this work should also reveal finer structures, such as symmetries, that can be encoded in noncommutative algebras."

First, he is interested in proving local and global existence theorems for nonlinear wave equations in various settings, including wave equations outside of convex obstacles.  For this, the main analysis involves proving a suitable ""Strichartz estimate."" Such estimates in the situation where there is a boundary are much more delicate than in the case without boundary; however, some preliminary results have already been obtained in joint work with Hart Smith.  Sogge is also very interested in studying maximal averages over curves and  especially interested in trying to establish such estimates in the curved space setting.    Sogge has been intrigued for some time by certain questions in nonlinear partial differential equations and Fourier analysis. Such issues arise naturally in many contexts.  For instance, the equations of general relativity are just nonlinear wave equations. One of the main things Sogge would like to do is to show that such equations have solutions in the region outside of an obstacle. This might be thought of as a model for equations describing black holes, where the obstacle plays the role of the black hole. Sogge is also interested in basic problems in Fourier analysis. Since its introduction in the pioneering work of Fourier himself on problems of heat conduction, Fourier analysis has been the main tool to study differential equations, which constitute the formal language of physics."

From the analytical   standpoint we plan to address fundamental questions such as existence,   uniqueness, and formation of singularities for these models.  Specifically   we will consider wave maps with torsion and will study how the addition of   the torsion tensor affects propagation of regularity and development of   singularities for these equations. From the dynamical standpoint we will   start by considering the integrable versions of wave maps with torsion, as   well as other integrable equations, and will study how homoclinic   solutions behave under perturbation.  Specifically we will study how the   persistence of homoclinic orbits leads to chaotic systems. We will also   attempt to quantify the difference between temporal chaos and spatial   chaos, which is observed numerically in perturbations of the above models.   We will test for spatial chaos by actually computing the probability   distributions at two spatially distinct points and show that the mutual   information function decays to zero at an exponential rate.    Many physical phenomena are described by equations which have a geometric   interpretation.  The best known examples are Maxwell's equations and   Einstein's equations for gravity. These physical models pose challenging   mathematical questions whose answer will add significantly to our   understanding to the nature of things.  For instance, blackholes are   interpreted as a certain type of singularity that occur in the equations   of general relativity.  However in addition to blackholes, these equations   also exhibit another type of singularity called naked singularity, which   are purely mathematical and do not exist in nature.  In this project we   will consider models and study the existence and nature of singularities,   and how the geometry of the problems influence these issues.  This study   will help in the understanding of how , and of what type, singularities may   develop in the given systems.  We will also study the onset of chaos in   deterministic partial differential equations, which can exhibit spatial   chaos as well as temporal chaos.  In such systems the precise physical   information is usually lost and replaced by statistical quantities.  In   addition to this, the equations themselves become less useful and should   be replaced by effective probablistic equations to capture the stochastic   nature of deterministic spatial-temporal chaos.  In this project we will   develop tests for the occurrence of spatial chaos based on mutual   information, which measures the amount of information transmitted   spatially by the equation.  We will also attempt to develop a   mathematically rigorous procedure to derive from the original systems the   relevant effective probabilistic models."

In physics the applications range from  many-body systems (both atomic and nuclear), to quantum chaos to quantum transport in mesoscopic systems. Four areas for research are specified. The first is related to the fact that in certain random matrix ensembles the measure describing the eigenvalue distribution is the Gibbs measure for charges interacting via a potential at inverse temperature beta equal to one, two or four (corresponding to orthogonal, unitary and symplectic ensembles, respectively). The limiting spacing distributions for these ensembles are now quite well understood but the methods are applicable to these values of beta only. The question for general beta, while quite difficult, is mathematically interesting and quite important in statistical physics. A new approach looks promising and we intend to pursue it. The second area of research is the question of universality of the limiting distribution of the largest eigenvalue in matrix ensembles. This would be analogous to the universality of the Gaussian distribution for sums of independent random variables, the central limit theorem. Thirdly, we propose to study the order statistics of the spacings between eigenvalues (which is different from the spacing distributions between consecutive eigenvalues mentioned above). For example, what is the probability distribution for the largest or smallest spacing? There are known results for independent random variabl es but, apparently, none yet for for random matrices, whose eigenvalues are far from independent. Finally, we hope to complete earlier work on the asymptotics of solutions to the periodic Toda equations by determining the asymptotics on the so-called critical curves, where the asymptotics will take a very different form. The theory of Wiener-Hopf operators and operator determinants should play a decisive role in this investigation.     In the 1950s Eugene Wigner, in his now classic study of highly excited states of large nuclei of atoms, introduced a mathematical model to describe the spacing between these states. This model goes under the name of random matrix theory. Since Wigner's pioneering work, it has been shown that the mathematics of random matrices has far-reaching applications to condensed matter physics, atomic physics and the new area of quantum chaos. In mathematics itself, random matrix theory has surfaced in a multitude of different contexts. It is natural to ask why the subject has such wide applicability. In probability theory the bell-shaped curve is pervasive because of a theorem which says roughly that when one adds quantities which are random and independent, the sum follows the bell-shaped curve regardless of the distribution of the quantities themselves. The distribution functions of random matrix theory appear to have a similar universality for a class of problems in which there is a high degree of dependence in the underlying processes. In the present project the mathematics of random matrix theory will be further developed with an eye toward possible applications."

Technical description of the project.      In this project we study  problems in nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential   equations and interacting particle systems, with  common underlying theme the presence and interrelation of multiple scales. We  address the following topics: (a) interacting particle systems with multiple scales, giving rise to discrete velocity models at a mesocopic level, and to hyperbolic conservation laws or nonlinear diffusions, at a macroscopic one, (b) existence and stability of periodic and solitary waves for hyperbolic conservation laws in the presence of relaxation mechanisms, (c) relaxation models and related numerical  schemes for front propagation problems, and (d) Monte-Carlo methods and random effects in the macroscopic limit of Ising models to geometric evolutions.  In addition to the analytical aspects of the project, one of the  objectives in (c) is the development of new  computational tools, through  relaxation models, for interface tracking applications; furthermore in (d), numerical experiments based on stochastic Ising models are employed, in an attempt to understand  from a microscopic point of view the effect of random perturbations on  interfacial evolutions.      B.Non-technical description of the project.    Phenomena involving multiple, interacting scales are widespread in areas as diverse as material science, chemical engineering, biology, atmospheric and environmental sciences,   communication networks and economics.  A typical example is the derivation of macroscopic properties of a material, for instance conductivity, from  its microscopic-molecular   or even atomic-structure. The challenges these problems present to scientists and engineers are formidable at many  levels: in experiments, modelling, mathematical analysis of models, construction of effective algorithms, simulation and verification of the models. The inherent  mathematical complexity of multiscale problems and our limited  understanding of their  nature so far, require a  methodical and detailed analysis both of the actual problems, as well as of   (carefully) simplified ones, that  illustrate in a clearer way a particular aspect of the phenomenon under study. The proposed research addresses mainly the mathematical analysis of some paradigms in multiscale processes and  touches upon the development of new computational tools, suggested by the mathematical theory. The motivation of the work   stems from phase transitions problems in material science, chemical engineering applications such as adsorption processes and  water waves and gas dynamics."

Wainger is interested in L-p bounds for these operators that relate to curvature properties of the curves and surfaces.

The tools will then be applied to prove a number of results in real and complex analysis and in partial differential equations. Baernstein is also investigating particular extremal problems in which symmetries of various kinds play a role. Examples include finding the exact values of the Bloch and Landau constants in complex function theory, determining L-p norms of k-plane transforms, and investigating a conjectural integral inequality for gradients of vector fields in the plane whose truth would tell us the L-p norm of a singular integral operator related to quasiconformal mappings, and whose falsity would confirm a conjecture of C.B.

The prototypical result on which Baernstein's project is modelled is the isoperimetric inequality.

Each of the unsolved problems mentioned in the first paragraph can be interpreted as an ""extremal problem"" of the same flavor as the isoperimetric inequality, in that the expected extremals are the competitors which appear to have the most symmetry. The challenge to the researcher is to devise mathematical tools which enable one to prove in a rigorous fashion that the expected extremals really are extremal, or to discover ""counterexamples"" which show that the established guess for the extremals was wrong. The problems mentioned above come from mathematical fields with connections to various domains of application . Phenomena encountered in the search for exact Bloch and Landau constants are related to crystallography, k-plane transforms occur in tomography, and quasiconformal mappings are related to elasticity theory and to problems about optimal mixtures of materials."

Because your note came during the holiday break, I put it  aside for awhile, and then forgot about it!  Thanks for sending the   reminder.  --Bill    TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION    This project concerns multivariable operator theory.  Specifically, we  are concerned with Hilbert modules over the algebra of polynomials   in several variables.  We seek concrete (numerical) invariants  for such objects.  The simplest of these is the curvature invariant.    The curvature invariant of a Hilbert module H is written K(H).    K(H) is analogous to the mean curvature of an even-dimensional   Riemannian manifold, and there is an asymptotic formula which   allows one to compute its value in many cases.  K(H) has turned   out to be an integer in all cases we have been able to decide, and   in fact it obeys a form of the Gauss Bonnet theorem for the Hilbert   modules which admit a ""finite free resolution"" in the following   sense,     K(H) = b(1) - b(2) + b(3) - b(4) +....    where b(1), b(2), ... are the Betti numbers of the free resolution.    We conjecture that K(H) is always an integer.  Not every Hilbert   module (in the category we have) has a finite free resolution, and   we are developing appropriate tools for computing K(H) in general.      GENERAL DESCRIPTION    The flow of time in quantum theory is different from the flow of   time in classical physics, in that the observable quantities do not  commute with each other.  For example, Heisenberg's famous   equation relating the position and momentum observables of   a one-dimensional quantum system is essentially this: PQ - QP = 1.    During the past ten years, a small but determined group of   mathematicians has been working out the theory of ""E_0 semigroups"".    Among other things, these mathematical objects give the simplest   situations which describe the way the  flow of time behaves in   quantum theory.  The current project has grown out of our efforts  to find ways of distinguishing between different types of E_0   semigroups.  This is accomplished by computing certain numbers   associated with them that can take on different values.  When one   has two E_0 semigoups whose numbers are different, one can be   assured that he has two systems which are fundamentally different.    This project is concerned with the definition and calculation of   numerical quantities which are associated to simpler objects that   are closely related to E_0 semigroups."

The main theme of   this project, and also of the research of the PI over the past several   years, is to study special sets associated to solutions to differential   equations and variational problems. An important part of the study is   the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions near   these sets. The problems that the PI would continue to work on include   the geometric structure of level sets, in particular the nodal sets and   the singular sets. Such sets arise in the study of the axis of the   optical director in the Erickson model of liquid crystals. These sets   are also related to the singularities in the Ginzburg-Landau model in   the  superconductivity and in other geometric variational problems.   This study is partly motivated by the desire to understand to what   extent the solutions can be described quantitatively by polynomials or   by homogeneous solutions. These problems have a close connection with   other fields in mathematics, including several complex variables and   algebraic geometry.     The problems of the singular sets originate from  material sciences   and control theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those   sets where singularities occur. Precise definitions vary according to   problems where they arise. In reality it is impossible to eliminate   the singular sets, the so-called ""bad sets"". Hence one of the central   tasks is to investigate under what condition the singular sets can be   controlled and under what condition such sets are small. Another   application involves high-performance computing, in particular   image processing. One problem is to recover the image from a distorted   copy and the difference is measured exactly by some singular sets. It   is usually expected that such sets should be small enough to be neglected.   T he problems mentioned above in the project are simplified mathematical   models. It is the hope of the investigator that the discussion of these   mathematical problems will improve the methods to control the singular   sets in various applications."

The research focuses on geometric methods that allow one to   restate various problems in the theory of semi-dispersing  billiards in terms of geodesics in some Alexandrov spaces   (typically of non-positive curvature).  The problems that   can be attacked with our methods have to do with counting the  number of collisions in billiards,  counting the number of   periodic orbits, calculating entropy and other invariants of  billiards systems. The most important open problems that we  plan to work on are the construction of  universal model   spaces for billiards in non-positive curvature, and proving   the finiteness of the topological entropy for the first-return   map for billiards in non-positive curvature.  In addition, hope to   construct examples of billiards with areas of positive curvature,   which have infinite entropy.  We also plan to continue our  work in the areas of  differentiable and  cohomological rigidity   of lattice actions, and partially hyperbolic dynamical systems.    The theory of semi-dispersing billiards lies at the  heart of the  foundations of the statistical physics. Much of our proposed   research focuses on new geometric methods in the theory of   semi-dispersing billiards that we have  recently developed. Our   new methods have already allowed us to solve  several old problems  that had been open for at least 15 years.  In particular we have  established the finiteness of entropy (measure of chaos in the  system) for broad classes of billiards. Among other things we plan  to use our approach to study various other statistical properties  of hard-ball systems (the main model of statistical physics).  In addition to our research on billiards we plan to work in the  areas of rigidity and hyperbolic dynamics. In particular, we are  interested in various questions related to the notion of stable  ergodicity (a property of a s ystem to remain chaotic even after  arbitrary, but ""small"" perturbations)."

Also considered are   spectral questions for matrix-coefficient transfer operators.  Some of the convergence questions which will be addressed by Wierdl   concern the mean convergence of averages of measurements made on a   stochastic process at a random sequence of times that is chosen in   advance. Other questions concern subsequence ergodic theorems for   subsequences coming from members of Hardy fields, along bases for the   integers, and along sequences with big gaps. Results obtained by Wierdl in the previous grant periods suggest that in the context of Hardy fields, a meaningful characterization of the ``good'' sequences of measurements is possible.         Campbell and Wierdl will jointly consider another group of convergence   questions concerning upcrossings and related oscillatory behavior of   the ergodic averages. This line of research was initiated by Bishop,   Bourgain, Kalikow, B. Weiss and others.  Wierdl and his collaborators   discovered a fundamental connection between Ergodic Theory and   martingales.  This discovery---which often manifests itself as a   squarefunction of the difference between ergodic averages and certain   martingales---allows one to translate many of the results of   Martingale Theory, such as squarefunction, large deviation or   upcrossing inequalities, to ergodic theoretical results.         The so called Ergodic Theorem (ET) is a theoretical description of a   certain statistical behavior of matter.  Loosely speaking, the ET   makes it possible to make a large class of physical measurements in   two entirely different ways, but arrive to the same result.  It is useful to have an illustration: suppose we want to find out the average speed of the water particles in a cup of water.  Well, we would have to measure the speed of each particle separately, and then  take the average of these measurements.  This method of calculating the average speed is called  averaging in *space* since we go to different points (particles) in space to make the measurement.  But the ET says, that we would arrive to the same result if we pick a *single* particle, and start measuring its speed at 1 second, at 2 second, at 3 second, etc, and after a long enough period of time take the average of these measurements.  This method of calculating the average is called averaging in *time*.      So the above is two very different ways of calculating average speed,   and the method to be chosen depends on the circumstance.  Having  two possibilities gives great freedom in experiments.  The problem with the ET is twofold: 1) It does not specify exactly *how many* times are we supposed to   measure the speed of the single particle; the ET just says ""eventually"" the time average gets close to the space average.  2) The measurements in time has to be made *exactly* at 1s, 2s, 3s, etc.  But in practice, one cannot make measurements so promptly.  The ET says nothing if the measurements are made at, say, 1.1s, 2.8s, 3.2s, ...Our proposal addresses the above two problems:   1) we propose various ways to determine how many times does one need   to make measurements in time to get close with prescribed accuracy to   the space average.  2) We examine various randomly generated times at which measurements made will still give an average approaching the space average.  (Note Randomly generated times are much more likely to model practical   situations.)"

The philosophy of coadjoint orbits of Kirillov and Kostant predicts  that most irreducible unitary representations of reductive Lie groups  should arise by (parabolic or cohomological) induction from the (still  undefined) unipotent representations.  Each reductive group should  have just finitely many unipotent representations, and these should be  related to the (finitely many) nilpotent orbits of the coadjoint  representation.  This proposal has two parts.  The first (partly joint  with Susana Salamanca-Riba) concerns a precise version of the  Kirillov-Kostant prediction.  The goal is to characterize nicely a  small set of unitary representations with the property that every  unitary representation can be obtained from it by induction.  (The set  will include all unipotent representations, and also various  complementary series.)  The second (partly joint with William Graham)  concerns an idea for constructing unipotent representations.    More than fifty years ago, I. M. Gelfand set forth a program of  abstract harmonic analysis, a very general way to study mathematical  problems with symmetry.  Such problems appear in physics, and in  almost every part of mathematics.  One of the most fundamental  examples arises in connection with musical sounds.  In that case the  symmetry is passage through time: any two times are indistinguishable  in terms of what kinds of sounds can appear.  Gelfand's harmonic  analysis amounts to decomposing a sound into the ""pure tones"" produced  by a tuning fork (which change in an extremely simple way with the  passage of time).  Gelfand showed that a similar analysis was possible  in the presence of more complicated symmetry.  The role of the pure  tones is played by ""irreducible unitary representations.""  This  project continues work done by many people on irreducible unitary  representations.  The central idea is this.  The formal definition of  an irreducible unitary representation involves linear a lgebra and  Euclidean geometry, in the form of what are called Hilbert spaces and  unitary operators.  These are exactly the objects needed to formulate  quantum mechanics.  In physics, quantum mechanical systems arise from  Newtonian ones by an (imperfectly understood) process known as  quantization.  An idea going back to Kirillov and Kostant in the 1960s  is that irreducible unitary representations should also arise by  ""quantization"" of some simple ""Newtonian"" analogues.  These Newtonian  analogues are fairly well understood, but the problem of quantizing  them is difficult.  On the other hand, similar quantization problems  appear in many parts of mathematics and physics, so there is no  shortage of examples to consider and ideas to try."

That is, the corresponding  linear time evolutions cannot be effectively   compared at each fixed time to the initial data   using a single L-p space (Lebesgue space with exponent p)   when p is not equal to 2.  (When p = 2, there is often a conservation of   energy which provides just such an estimate.)         This obstacle is present in equations ranging from   classical field theory to the higher dimensional analogues of   hyperbolic systems dealt with in 1 space dimension by Glimm's method.   We propose to study two analytical methods developed to deal with  L-p ill-posedness in the context of nonlinear wave equations and   nonlinear Schrodinger equations.  The first is space-time estimates  for the corresponding linear problems.  We propose to study in collaboration   with T. Tao the endpoint  Strichartz estimates  for the Schrodinger and wave equation in   space dimensions 2 and 3, respectively.  This would be an extension of   previous work by Tao and the author.    We propose second to study generalized Sobolev estimates and the   method of conformal compactification.  We will be  looking, in   collaboration with C. Sogge and H. Smith, at the   specific problem of global in time existence for a   system of quasilinear wave equations  with small initial data   in the exterior of an obstacle.    Finally, we would like to bring these techniques to the question of   how the choice of gauge affects regularity of the solution in the   context of the hyperbolic Yang-Mills equations.     The physics behind many interesting systems currently   being investigated (for example, fluid flow or the   LIGO gravitational wave detectors) leads scientists to  a number of very difficult questions in nonlinear mathematics.   When we consider the nonlinear partial differential  equations arising in fluid mechanics and general  relativity, some   natural questions are ""how big is a solution at long times"" or even   ""does a solution exist for all times"". We have only very incomplete   answers to these questions.   The present proposal aims to further understand promising techniques   in nonlinear hyperbolic pde which might eventually be brought to   physical systems.  For example, the question above   regarding endpoint Strichartz estimates may shed light  on the decay properties of waves.  The obstacle problem mentioned   above is a toy model for the stability of the Schwarzschild space   in general relativity."

His philosophy involves considering the sequence of iterates of a map and looking at the distribution of values for increasing numbers of iterations instead of for increasing radius, as would be the case in Nevanlinna theory.

This will entail sharp geometric estimates for analytic circle diffeomorphisms, tools which will be used to study the boundary of Siegel disks.  A long range objective of this research is to obtain a geometric theory of small divisors applicable to higher dimensional problems and a refinement of KAM theory.       The theory of dynamical systems studies the evolution of solutions of a system of differential equations describing a physical system.  It is of fundamental importance in applications to determine the future evolution of the physical system.  Probably the most important problem is the question of stability: Will the system have a stable evolution forever or it is going to break down at some moment?  This is a common concern for engineers building planes or other moving devices, as well as with more complex situations.  Mathematicians study the simplest problems to develop the tools to treat the more complex. The theory of small divisors is a fundamental tool in the study of stability in conservative situations, where some structure (a volume, a conformal structure, ...) is preserved.  This work involves the study of conformal maps in the plane, that is, maps that preserve angles.  In this case, there are classical small divisors theorems which guarantee stability properties.  A large part of this research is devoted to the situation where the tools of small divisors fail to prove stability and the development of weaker forms of stability in that situation."

This work has enabled him to formulate a paradigm for classification problems in mathematics that bypasses the non-classifiability theory of Mackey.    It is only now becoming clear that the abstruse notions of quantum physics pondered by Bohr, Einstein, and Heisenberg in the early part of this century, will have profound effect on modern technology.  In particular, we will be able to exploit the classifically inconceivable predictions of quantum mechanics to build new kinds of computers, measure physical quantities with unprecedented accuracy, and make new materials with remarkable properties.  These possibilities were to some degree foreseen by John von Neumann, who invented the correct mathematical language for quantum mechanics.  He was the first mathematician to realize that since mathematics is based on fundamentally mistaken ideas of geometry and matter arising from classical physics, it was incumbent on mathematicians to develop new forms of ""quantized mathematics"".  For that purpose he introduced the area of operator algebras, which now constitutes one of the most exciting branches of modern mathematics.  This subject has important applications to geometry, algebra, probability theory, and mathematical physics.  The participants in this grant are pursuing some of the most exciting directions in this field.  These include the exploration of quantized symmetry  (Popa:  subfactor theory), the quantized version of infinite dimensional analysis (Effros:  operator spaces), and understanding the classification problems of operator algebra and its deep implications for such problems throughout mathematics (Takesaki:  von Neumann algebras)."

This includes a continuation <br/>of the authors' recent work on developing a mathematical theory of <br/>shock-waves that applies to the Einstein equations - the equations <br/>that describe the time evolution of spacetime curvature, the gravitational <br/>field according to general relativity.  Shock waves are relevent here <br/>because the compressible Euler equations appear as a subsystem of the <br/>Einstein equations, and emerge exactly in the limit of low velocities <br/>and weak gravitational fields.  The work includes the construction of a <br/>new cosmological model in which the expansion of the universe, <br/>(as measured by the Hubble constant), is modeled as the effect of a great <br/>explosion that generates a shock wave at the leading edge, something <br/>like a nuclear explosion into a static background, except on an enormous scale, <br/>instead of by the standard cosmological model in which it is assumed <br/>that the entire universe is expanding at a rate measured by the Hubble law.   <br/>If successful, the results will provide the first and simplest model for <br/>cosmology under the assumption that the Hubble constant measures only a <br/>localized expansion, and consistent with the energy density and background <br/>radiation levels observed in the universe today. This research also has an <br/>interesting philosophical implication in that, if there were a shock wave present <br/>from the Big Bang, then, in contrast to the standard model of cosmology, <br/>there would be an associated loss of information that would make it <br/>impossible to reconstruct the details of the initial event from <br/>present data.  In addition, a covariant version of Glimm's Method will be developed <br/>in an attempt to provide the first general existence theory of shock wave <br/>interactions for the Einstein equations.  This is a step toward developing <br/>principles that can be applied to the numerical simulation of shock waves <br/>in general relativity.  These studies will also have implications for <br/>classical fluids because the Einstein equations provide a unique setting in <br/>which natural geometrical constructs put a handle on the <br/>fluid dynamics.  This work dovetails with ongoing research <br/>into how the large time behavior of shock wave solutions is related to the <br/>geometry of the Lie Algebra that gives the scattering picture for<br/>shock wave interactions. Thus this research connects the theory of  <br/>shock waves and geometry on several levels. <br/><br/>Einstein's equations of general relativity describe the large scale development<br/>of the universe.  Although they were first proposed more than eighty years ago,<br/>they still pose formidable mathematical challenges.  This research will continue  <br/>earlier work in which exact shock wave solutions of these equations were found.<br/>A mathematical theory will be developed that leads to alternatives of the standard<br/>""Big Bang"" theory and that allows a general theoretical treatment of shock waves <br/>within the general theory of relativity.  Since these equations contain the <br/>classical fluid dynamics equations as a special case, the research will also lead <br/>to new insights for these more familiar problems. <br/> <br/>"

Veech is pursuing the question of existence of a prime geodesic theorem for a generic meromorphic finite norm quadratic differential on a generic closed Riemann surface.  Using his recently developed theory of Siegel measures, he is led to the question of whether a related Teichmuller map action of SL(2,R) on a topological component of a stratum in the moduli space of norm one quadratic differentials does not almost have invariant vectors, in the orthocomplement of the constants relative to the Liouville measure. Veech is studying moduli spaces of flat metrics with cone singularities on punctured surfaces.  For fixed cone angles, there is an identification between the Teichmuller moduli space and the moduli space of metrics up to scale which gives rise to interesting integrals over the Teichmuller moduli space. Veech is attempting to prove that these integrals, which represent natural volumes of the moduli space, are finite, using his recently developed ""Delaunay partition coordinates"" for moduli space. He is pursuing the question of whether every geodesic relative to the natural flat (cone) metric on the truncated icosahedron is either closed or uniformly distributed, reducing this to a question of whether a certain discrete subgroup of SL(2,R) which is associated to the truncated icosahedron is a lattice.<br/><br/>William A. Veech is studying periodic trajectories for a class of dynamical systems. These include systems whose descriptions require little more than high school geometry but whose analysis requires rather deep notions from disparate fields, including complex analysis, ergodic theory and representation theory of Lie groups.  Location and enumeration of periodic trajectories are central problems in the theory of dynamical systems. The former may be interpreted as the problem of predicting periodicity from knowledge of intitial conditions while the latter is the problem of obtaining quantitative information about the set of all periodic trajectories, including an asymptotic formula for the number of trajectories whose period is less than T for large T. An elementary example of a system for which both questions are for the most part unresolved is the uniform motion of a pointlike particle which is contained in a planar polygonal area and which rebounds from the sides of the container according to Snell's law, i.e. ""angle of incidence equals angle of rebound"".  To indicate the complexity of the situation it may be mentioned the the problems of location and enumeration of periodic trajectories for such motion in a regular polygon (other than equilateral triangle, square and regular hexagon) were open until only recently when they were solved by Veech.<br/><br/>"

The basis for the first subject is the progress made in the last five years in the study of quadrature domains with linear algebra techniques, and specifically using determinantal functions of pairs of matrices. There are many analogies with classical perturbation theory of self-adjoint operators which point to several open problems resulting from this approach. The second theme is based on the observation made a couple of years ago by the P.I. that practically all facts connected with multivariate cubatures can be translated into familiar terms of dilation theory (of commuting Jacobi matrices). It is expected that this point of view will be successfully exploited by both sides. The third subject is a specialization of the second, for positive measures supported by odd spheres. The complex variables and the associated Toeplitz operators (which are typical examples of spherical isometries-- ubiquitous objects in modern operator theory) are expected to carry in a closed, flexible form the basic information about the original measure. Inverse problems, that is the reconstruction of complex objects from partial data, are everywhere present in modern science and technology. To give a few classical examples we can mention the vibrations of a string, the shape of a planet knowing its distant gravitation field, or the evolution of an oil spill in water. The proposal is aimed at solving some mathematical questions related to inverse problems related to shapes or to mass distributions. A history of more than one century of remarkable discoveries in this area will be comb ined with recent advances in modern mathematics. The resulting work will be significant for the present research frontier in mathematics and potentially for applied fields such as geophysics, image processing or tomography."
