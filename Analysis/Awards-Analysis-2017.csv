Complex numbers  and functions of complex variables have become, since the nineteenth century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and its application to other areas of science and engineering. The solutions of many problems in the applied sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in these complex analytic tools and a deeper understanding of their basic properties. For example, in materials science the standard method for treating multidirectional stresses in a uniform way is to represent them as complex numbers or, in more complicated situations, as complex functions. It then turns out that, among other things, the direction of the propagation of cracks in materials is related to the properties of certain equations associated with these complex numbers or functions. Results of the research to be carried out in this project may lead to the discovery of new properties of solutions of these equations. This project has significant educational and training aspects:  At least two graduate students and one undergraduate student will be actively involved in this project. Also, the principal investigator will continue to organize international conferences on several complex variables and complex geometry, bringing together mathematicians to discuss their research and teaching.<br/><br/>In the research aspect,  the principal investigator will continue his work on several fundamental problems in complex analysis of several variables that are closely related to research in differential geometry, algebraic geometry and classical dynamics. More specifically, the principal investigator would like to continue his research on the equivalence problem and rigidity problem in several complex variables, carry further his work on the complex structure of the holomorphic hull of a real submanifold in a complex space, and further his study on the existence and regularity problem for Levi-flat submanifolds bounded by real submanifolds with CR singularities."

Periodic media correspond to crystalline structures, such as metals or semiconductors, which can conduct electrons freely at certain energies. It is proposed to study mathematically rigorous models of electron transport near the edges of the ""forbidden zones"" and develop new approaches to the effective mass approximation. Quasiperiodic operators are examples of disordered systems which, depending on the regime, can look like pure crystals, or crystals with random impurities, while being completely deterministic. One of the models under study demonstrates random-like behavior at arbitrarily small disorder and can potentially be a suitable replacement for a random environment without having to employ a large parameter space. Special emphasis will be given to multi-dimensional and multi-particle models, with possible applications to quantum spin systems and quantum information theory. The project provides research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The activities of this research project fall into several groups distinguished by the classes of the operators under study and the types of their spectra. In the area of Anderson localization for quasiperiodic operators (""random-like behavior""), the project studies multi-particle models with analytic potentials at perturbatively large disorder and low regularity models, with the latter results expected to be non-perturbative. The methods here include operator theory, harmonic analysis, real algebraic geometry, and large deviation theorems for subharmonic or piecewise-monotonic functions. In the area of absolutely continuous spectrum (""crystalline behavior""), the project investigates the relation between low regularity reducibility of Schrodinger cocycles and strong ballistic transport for the corresponding Schrodinger operators, which, in turn, is related to transport properties of quantum spin systems. In the area of periodic operators, it is intended to study possible singularities of the Bloch varieties at the edges of spectral bands, both in 2D and 3D cases. Finally, on the more abstract side, the project aims to develop a quantitative classification of almost commuting matrices in topologically non-trivial cases, which demonstrates connections both with Cantor spectra for quasiperiodic operators and with some quantum spin systems."

These include the following: the design of optical instruments using mirrors or lenses, market matching in economics, and the optimization of transportation networks. One very important question concerns the smoothness of solutions; namely, if solutions of these equations can have sharp corners or not. The question of smoothness has direct implications in the accuracy of these equations as models in the aforementioned problems. For example, in designing a lens with certain refractive properties, failure of smoothness can cause chromatic aberration (as when a prism splits white light into a rainbow), a phenomenon that lies outside the scope of the simplified model given by this class of equations. Nevertheless, this special class of equations is extremely convenient for modeling purposes, owing to the fact that their solutions often have simple geometric characterizations. This is especially important in the example of optical instruments, since in comparison with other models, it is logistically far simpler and more efficient to manufacture lenses or mirrors that arise by application of these equations than by using other models. Smoothness also plays a large role in the development of accurate and fast numerical algorithms. Effectively translating theoretical results into the language of computation is vital in creating a bridge between abstract mathematical results and practical outcomes.<br/><br/>In more specific terms, the project will be concerned with a subclass of Monge-Ampere-type equations known as generated Jacobian equations (GJEs). These contain many problems from geometric optics in the near-field regime, the Monge-Kantorovich (optimal transport) problem, and the real Monge-Ampere equation. The first portion of the project focuses on regularity and ""partial regularity,"" by which is meant the study of singular behavior of weak solutions. Specific goals are to categorize systematically the structure (size, shape, topological, and differentiable structure) of singular sets, and to characterize quantitatively the inhomogeneous data that give solutions that still exhibit regular behavior when standard conditions in regularity theory fail. The methods used to study these problems will be a combination of geometric techniques developed to analyze regularity of degenerate, fully nonlinear elliptic equations, along with techniques originating in the calculus of variations and optimal transport theory. The second part of the project focuses on the development of numerical solvers for GJEs. The intent is to leverage the understanding afforded by partial regularity to develop numerical schemes that avoid degenerate singular structures, resulting in fast, accurate algorithms to solve GJE and optimal transport problems beyond the reach of existing techniques, with a specific aim of producing algorithms backed with rigorous performance bounds. The two halves of the project are interrelated, as improved numerical tools can be an effective tool for visualizing and formulating conjectures on the singular behavior of solutions, and in turn, improved theoretical understanding of singularities leads to the development of effective numerical algorithms."

A nonlocal interaction can be illustrated by its contrast to a local interaction in a simplified picture of a population of agents (say, people) interacting across a shared network.  A local model is one in which people can share information only with their immediate neighbors, whereas a nonlocal model is one in which they can share information more broadly, possibly across an entire network, and do so instantly.  This simplified picture actually manifests itself in many situations in which a nonlocal paradigm is more fruitful than a local one, and the inclusion of nonlocal interactions often fundamentally changes the underlying mathematics that describe aspects such as the propagation of information.  This project aims to improve the study of such phenomena through the introduction of new mathematical tools.  Along the way, this project will support the mentoring of graduate students and undergraduates through involvement in research on these topics. It will also create new graduate course material that provides a more unified approach to nonlocal tools of use in treating certain current topics in data science.  <br/><br/>In the realm of mathematics surrounding nonlocal problems, there has been a surge of activity during the past twenty years.  Experts have found themselves addressing questions in roughly two categories: (1) What properties of nonlocal equations should be studied for the sake of nonlocality itself; and (2) what properties of nonlocal equations should be studied for the sake of integrating them with other fields?  In this project the principal investigators focus on the second type of question.  They aim to develop nonlocal tools that can be applied to some classical problems that are not, at first glance, necessarily nonlocal, including questions about oscillatory boundary-layer phenomena for elliptic equations and free-boundary problems of one or two phases. The key point is that there are powerful tools in the nonlocal world that could shed new light upon or produce new results for some of these equations that were not approached from this perspective earlier. Such tools include, but are not limited to, the fast growing regularity theory for nonlocal equations and theory of weak solutions for nonlocal equations (still in its infancy).  Through representation techniques for general (nonlinear) operators that enjoy a global comparison principle, the principal investigators hope to bridge the gap between some aspects of these previously disjoint classes of equations and to use this ""nonlocal"" bridge as a pathway to new discoveries."

One way of describing a system's long-term behavior is through spectral theory, which includes the finding of frequencies naturally exhibited by the system. Imagine a vibrating string or beam of fixed length. Clearly, its frequency (think ""sound"") depends on how its ends (aka boundaries) are clamped down or otherwise restricted. In general, the spectrum of a differential operator and with it the properties of a physical system can change drastically when the conditions imposed on the boundary are changed. In many cases, we know the complete spectrum for one set of boundary conditions. From there, we can gain knowledge about the system under other conditions via the theory of so-called finite rank perturbations.<br/> <br/>The primary goal of the project is to systematically study spectral theory of finite rank unitary perturbations by tightening the relationship to corresponding functional models. The rank one setting is reasonably well-understood, while a general treatment of the finite rank problem presented several digressions. Initially, non-cyclic unitary unperturbed operators posed an issue. This problem is now resolved. The general problem involves matrix-valued Herglotz and Cauchy-type transforms. The study of these transforms as part of this project will provide insight into finite rank perturbation theory. A regularization of the so-called exterior Cauchy transform (as was done in the rank one setting) is planned. Further investigations will be made into the difficult case of infinite rank perturbations with defect operators in the trace class. The analogous self-adjoint setting, as well as concrete applications to differential operators, will also be investigated."

The study of the properties of such maps led to the development of the subject known as geometric function theory. A cornerstone of this discipline is the remarkable fact that every planar region without holes can be conformally transformed into the round disk in an essentially unique fashion. Such coordinate changes have proven over the years to be of great value in a wide variety of applications in physics and engineering. In many of these applications, one has to deal with coordinate changes that are conformal in a given planar region except possibly some ""exceptional set"" of points inside the region. The question whether the exceptional set is negligible and small enough to be ignored leads to the notion of conformal removability, central to this research project and closely related to fundamental questions in complex dynamics and in random surfaces. The project will also consider several other questions in geometric function theory, such as conformal welding (a correspondence between curves in the plane and functions on the circle, recently observed to have important applications in the field of numerical vision), shapes of Julia sets (fractal sets arising from the iteration of polynomials), and the subadditivity of analytic capacity. Each of these investigations has a numerical aspect, and successful completion of the research project will enhance computational structure and build interdisciplinary connections with applied sciences such as finance and pattern recognition.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project deals with the study of the geometric properties of conformally removable sets. More precisely, the investigator will further study various settings where removability appears naturally, including the rigidity of circle domains. This first component of the research project also includes problems related to conformal welding and fingerprints of lemniscates. The second part is devoted to the study of the possible shapes of Julia sets. More specifically, the investigator plans to explore various questions revolving around the constructive approximation of planar sets by polynomial Julia sets in the Hausdorff distance, such as sharp rates of approximation, dynamical properties of the approximating polynomials, and an efficient numerical implementation of the approximation scheme. Finally, the last part of the research project concerns the subadditivity problem for analytic capacity. The investigator will further explore a conjecture that, if true, would imply analytic capacity is indeed subadditive. This involves an improvement of a numerical method for the computation of the analytic capacity of finite unions of disks."

The method of supersymmetry is widely used in theoretical physics, especially in particle physics, but its rigorous mathematical foundation is still a challenge for mathematicians. The aim of the project is to develop a broad mathematical understanding of supersymmetry.<br/><br/>More precisely, random band matrices (RBM) represent quantum systems on a d-dimensional lattice with random quantum transition amplitudes effective up to distances of some order W, which is called a bandwidth. They are natural intermediate models in the study eigenvalue statistics and quantum propagation of disordered systems;  they interpolate between Wigner random matrices and random Schrodinger operators. Wigner matrix ensembles represent models without spatial structure, where the quantum transition rates between any two sites are independent identically distributed random variables. In contrast, random Schrodinger operators have only a random diagonal potential in addition to the deterministic Laplacian on a large box in a d-dimensional lattice. The main feature of RBM is that they can be used to model the Anderson metal-insulator phase transition in three or more dimensions. It is conjectured that the crossover for RBM can be investigated even in dimension one by varying the bandwidth W; however, on a mathematical level of rigor the question is still open. The investigator is going to attack the problem using the supersymmetry approach in combination with powerful analytic and statistical mechanics techniques, including saddle point analysis, transfer operators, and multi-scale analysis."

The goal here is to show that the systems in this large class have common properties and to develop a point of view which applies to all systems in this class.<br/><br/>More specifically, the proposed project aims at developing a more unified theory of ergodic properties of translation actions on certain foliated spaces.  The best known of these systems are translation flows on flat surfaces.  A key tool used to study these systems is the use of renormalization flows on moduli spaces obtained through geometric deformations of the foliated spaces.  This project seeks to introduce these tools and ideas to the study of the dynamics of other (usually higher rank) translation actions.  For example, the subject of quasicrystals, aperiodic tilings and Delone sets is a particularly good one in which to apply the ideas used in Teichmüller dynamics.  In particular, the relationship between ergodic theory, cohomology, and geometric deformation, which has been exploited in the study of flat surfaces, can also be exploited to study the properties of systems coming from quasicrystals and aperiodic tilings.  Tools used in the study of tilings such as non-commutative geometry can also be used to study translation flows on flat surfaces including those of infinite type. This cross-fertilization of fields will be mutually beneficial."

Guiding light via topological protection is particularly exciting due to its economic and scientific importance.  Theoretical descriptions of topologically protected modes often use non-standard forms of topology, described in terms of matrix models.  The project aims to develop the theory of matrix models, and the broader theoretical subject of operator algebras, in ways that are inspired by the advances in physics.  It also intends to make knowledge from the area of operator algebras available to physicists in the form of algorithms and formulas applicable to light waves and electronic waves.  The project aims to develop an unusually direct connection between this work in mathematical analysis and current research on graphene-based electronics and silicon-based photonics.  However, the emphasis will be on a theory of matrix models with symmetries that is robust enough to work equally well with various types of systems, and on advances in matrix theory that will support future applications and future theoretical work in the area of analysis known as noncommutative topology.  <br/><br/>Models of free fermionic systems that allow hopping within a manifold can be naturally formed into a group that is abstractly isomorphic to more standard groups associated to a manifold.  This suggests that there is a reformulation of the common homology theories used in operator algebras.  Central to this project will be finding such a computable reformulation of homology theories for the whole categories of operator algebras that have zero, one, or two added symmetries.  There is now a need for numerical algorithms to analyze many of these matrix models quickly.  Although the classical matrix invariants from geometry can be dealt with by hand calculations for small problems, physicists now require calculation of these invariants on multitudes of large matrices.  Progress in such calculations can be enhanced by improved mathematical understanding of these invariants.  For example, researchers in driven photonic systems use the Bott invariant for almost commuting unitary matrices, which is on good theoretical grounds.  However, there is a related invariant, based on the emergent topology of a matrix model, that can be computed by a much faster algorithm.  This invariant will be studied, with a goal of putting it in a better theoretical context.  The emergent topology of condensed matter and other physical systems will also be used to enhance visualization of the structure of matrix models."

It is specifically focused on the study the question of determining whether or not such sets will be guaranteed to contain a translated and rotated copy of a given finite set, or of its sufficiently large dilates. This study has potential applications to analyzing and determining the true complexity of large data sets. Over the last twenty years, specifically after the groundbreaking work of Gowers on quantitative questions concerning the existence of arbitrarily long sequences of equally spaced numbers in any sufficiently large subsets of the integers, there has been remarkable progress in the study of general linear patterns via the development of so-called higher-order Fourier analysis. Perhaps the most notable achievement here is the celebrated result of Green and Tao on arbitrarily long sequences of equally spaced prime numbers. This project builds on these developments, and one of its major objectives is the development of analytic tools to understand the aforementioned occurrence of geometric and arithmetic structures in large sets. The problems under consideration arise in the context of both the integer lattice and classical Euclidean spaces. The principal investigator's approach blends the well-established delicate interplay between techniques from discrete harmonic analysis and number theory, with a new general approach based on the modern point of view of additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>The existence of prescribed geometric structures in large subsets of the integer lattice and also in large measurable subsets of Euclidean spaces is currently not well understood. The project aims to address several such problems using the modern point of view of additive combinatorics. Specifically, the approach of showing that the count of isometric copies of a given finite configuration contained a given set is controlled by certain norms of its so-called balance function. These norms measure the uniformity or randomness of the set and, if it is sufficiently small with respect to the set's density, then the set will contain the expected number of isometric copies. The next step is to establish an inverse theorem showing that the largeness of the norm of the balance function implies that the set correlates or can be approximated by some structured object on which one can iterate this procedure. Recent results of the principal investigator with collaborators indicate that this should indeed the correct framework within which one should be approaching these problems and suggest that questions concerning geometric configurations of different levels of complexity can be tackled in a systematic way using appropriate higher (geometric) uniformity norms.  The ultimate goal of this project is to characterizing those finite geometric configuration for which all its sufficiently large dilates can be realized in subsets of Euclidean space of positive upper density, strengthening existing connections between additive combinatorics and classical harmonic analysis, and establishing the analogous characterization in the discrete setting of the integer lattice."

The goal of this project is to develop new tools to study such systems; and then apply these results to study other areas of mathematics, such as number theory and representation theory. <br/><br/>There is a growing interest in recent years for irreducible higher rank algebraic actions.  Many examples of these actions exhibit a remarkable array of rigidity properties.  These examples possess strong chaotic properties.  This project aims at providing rigidity examples with less chaotic behaviors.  This project will study smooth rigidity of a broad class of algebraic actions, especially for the actions completely absent of hyperbolicity, like parabolic actions. Current tools fail to be applied to treat these actions.  The main research theme in this project is to develop a method that combines classical KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) approach with representation theory to study the rigidity behavior of a broad class of algebraic actions. The new method will afford the first local rigidity examples for parabolic actions; and has the potential to establish local rigidity for partially hyperbolic actions whose geometric properties are distinctly different from existing examples."

A useful method to understand ""functions"" is to decompose them into frequencies, in a way similar to how a musical chord can be expressed as the frequencies (or pitches) of its constituent notes. This is called the Fourier transform and is a part of the so-called Fourier analysis method. The study of noncommutative objects offers a new point of view on many topics in mathematics reflecting our daily life and offers possibly the ""right"" language for quantum mechanics. In real life, the order in which certain operations are executed can make a big difference. For example, first boiling water and adding oil is very different from first boiling oil and then adding water. This is an example of a noncommutative process. Noncommutative Fourier analysis is about functions and their properties in the realm of non-commuting variables. In mathematics, the most important examples are matrix-valued functions. <br/><br/>This project is devoted to the Fourier analysis on noncommutative Lp spaces associated with von Neumann algebras, including (non-radial) Fourier multipliers, the Mikhlin-multiplier theory, Dirac Operators,  and unconditional sequences of group von Neumann algebras. A typical object is the Hilbert transform on free group von Neumann algebras. Major challenges in the proposed research are the lack of geometric/metric structure and the lack of a commutative product in the abstract setting. The proposed research program will strengthen the existing link between Harmonic Analysis and Functional Analysis. Noncommutative harmonic analysis is motivated by quantum mechanics and prediction theory and will make valuable contributions to these areas and more applied topics such as financial modeling and signal processing."

The study of the properties of such maps led to the development of the subject known as geometric function theory. A cornerstone of this discipline is the remarkable fact that every planar region without holes can be conformally transformed into the round disk in an essentially unique fashion. Such coordinate changes have proven over the years to be of great value in a wide variety of applications in physics and engineering. In many of these applications, one has to deal with coordinate changes that are conformal in a given planar region except possibly some ""exceptional set"" of points inside the region. The question whether the exceptional set is negligible and small enough to be ignored leads to the notion of conformal removability, central to this research project and closely related to fundamental questions in complex dynamics and in random surfaces. The project will also consider several other questions in geometric function theory, such as conformal welding (a correspondence between curves in the plane and functions on the circle, recently observed to have important applications in the field of numerical vision), shapes of Julia sets (fractal sets arising from the iteration of polynomials), and the subadditivity of analytic capacity. Each of these investigations has a numerical aspect, and successful completion of the research project will enhance computational structure and build interdisciplinary connections with applied sciences such as finance and pattern recognition.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project deals with the study of the geometric properties of conformally removable sets. More precisely, the investigator will further study various settings where removability appears naturally, including the rigidity of circle domains. This first component of the research project also includes problems related to conformal welding and fingerprints of lemniscates. The second part is devoted to the study of the possible shapes of Julia sets. More specifically, the investigator plans to explore various questions revolving around the constructive approximation of planar sets by polynomial Julia sets in the Hausdorff distance, such as sharp rates of approximation, dynamical properties of the approximating polynomials, and an efficient numerical implementation of the approximation scheme. Finally, the last part of the research project concerns the subadditivity problem for analytic capacity. The investigator will further explore a conjecture that, if true, would imply analytic capacity is indeed subadditive. This involves an improvement of a numerical method for the computation of the analytic capacity of finite unions of disks."

One of the examples, x-ray tomography, has numerous applications in science, medicine, and engineering. Within mathematics, geometric tomography overlaps with convex geometry and functional analysis. The principal investigator has recently discovered that important problems in the area of geometric tomography can be solved using the most popular tool of harmonic analysis, the Fourier transform. This tool allows one to decompose data into a simple combination of harmonics (i.e., into functions with periodically repeating values) and, by doing this, to reduce geometric problems to computations related to the harmonics, the theory of which is well developed. This approach has led to analytic solutions of several longstanding problems in the area, including the Busemann-Petty problem, the Shephard problem, and the slicing problem for sections of proportional dimensions. In this project, the principal investigator plans to apply the Fourier approach to several types of problems. Volume comparison problems ask what kind of data about sections or projections is necessary to conclude that the volume of one body is greater than the volume of another body. Volume difference problems ask how errors in the data related to plane sections or projections of a solid affect the computation of the volume of this solid. Slicing problems are concerned with bounds for the volume of a solid in terms of the areas of its slices through the center. The principal investigator expects that methods developed in this project will also be applicable to several problems in functional analysis and probability, in particular to the study of stable random processes (i.e., random laws inheriting the self-reproducing property of the normal law). Stable laws are frequently used in statistics. An important part of the project is the involvement and training of graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The problems considered in this project belong to several areas of mathematics: geometric tomography, convex geometry, functional analysis, and probability. However, the strategy of solution is common for most of the results: the question is translated into the language of the Fourier transform and then treated as a problem from harmonic analysis. In geometric tomography the principal investigator plans to apply Fourier methods to stability and separation in volume comparison problems, namely, volume difference and slicing inequalities for the section, projection, and curvature functions. In particular, he plans to study quantitative versions of the Busemann-Petty problem, which asks whether convex bodies with uniformly smaller areas of central plane sections in all directions necessarily have smaller volumes. He also plans to continue his work on the slicing problem of Bourgain. Another direction of research in the project is a connection between convex geometry and functional analysis. The principal investigator has recently found that intersection bodies, one of the main objects of interest in convex geometry, can be considered as the unit balls of certain Lebesgue spaces. He plans to apply this connection to the problem of duality between intersection and projection bodies, as well as to the problem of estimating the distance from an arbitrary convex body to the classes of intersection and projection bodies. Yet another direction of research is related to a problem in probability theory going back to Levy. The problem is to characterize random vectors having the property that all linear combinations of their coordinates have the same distribution, up to a constant. A conjecture is that the only vectors with this property are mixtures of stable random vectors. The principal investigator has already made several contributions in this direction, including a solution of a 1938 problem of Schoenberg, but the main question remains open."

The study of these equations is central to at least two areas of mathematics and mathematical physics: scattering theory and general relativity.  This project will study the (often subtle) relationship between the underlying geometry of a space and the long- and short-time behavior of waves propagating on it.  Complementing the research in this proposal are educational and outreach activities, with a focus on encouraging the development of communication skills in graduate and undergraduate students.  A central component of this work is the development of a series of programs to help graduate students develop their writing and presentation skills.<br/><br/>There are two main research components of this project: The first aims to provide a full microlocal treatment of the Dirac equation, with an emphasis on establishing the phenomenon of diffraction for systems.  In this direction, the project pursues an explanation of diffraction for an electron in the presence of singularities (such as those provided by the Coulomb potential).  Such theorems reflect observable phenomena.  One example of observable short-time behavior can be seen in a freshman physics laboratory: by shining a light at the tip of a needle, one sees a radial diffractive pattern.  The second focuses on determining the asymptotic behavior of waves on curved spacetimes with conic singularities such as those arising in the theory of cosmic strings."

The seemingly chaotic behavior of smoke trails from a cigarette or milk as it is poured into coffee is easily seen; indeed, turbulent flow was famously sketched by Leonardo da Vinci over half a millennium ago. Despite its conspicuousness, turbulence remains one of greatest enigmas of both theoretical and mathematical physics. Any small progress made in developing better mathematical underpinnings to the theory could lead to profound developments in the applied sciences. Characteristic to turbulence is a cascade to small scales: in hydrodynamic turbulence this corresponds to the formations of eddies that break up to form smaller eddies, whereupon the process repeats. The aim of this research project is to investigate the mathematical structures present in such a cascade. <br/><br/>The project is guided by two underlying goals: to better understand anomalous dissipation of kinetic energy in turbulence, and to develop stronger mathematical foundations for the theory of wave turbulence. Specifically, relating to the first goal, the investigator intends to work towards resolving a famous conjecture of Lars Onsager relating to the existence of weak solutions to the Euler equations whose kinetic energy is not conserved. The work will build on previously-developed convex integration schemes and will introduce new ideas unseen in any convex integration to date. With regard to the second goal, the investigator intends to develop new mathematical methods in order to better understand how heuristic derivations made in the physics literature can be made rigorous. A key aspect of this investigation will be the use of methods from analytic number theory in order to characterize resonant and quasi-resonant interactions, which are suspected to play a fundamental role in the non-linear dynamics of the regimes of wave turbulence under investigation."

It happens to be useful and natural to make ""time"" itself more abstract and replace it with any other discrete system of symmetries, say of some object (such symmetries form what is a called a discrete group). In the case of a very chaotic physical system, one cannot effectively predict its future state. This fact gives rise to an important quantity, the entropy of the system, that measures how unpredictable it is. Entropy was originally defined directly within an information theoretic context, but it turns out that, if one views it instead from the perspective of a statistical mechanics formalism, the scope of entropy theory is increased to encompass a very large class of groups known as ""sofic groups."" Seen through this new lens, entropy becomes a measurement of how many finitary approximations the physical system has. The general question of how well an infinitary process can be approximated by a finitary one is a fundamental question of scientific inquiry, and the class of sofic groups includes many natural examples coming from geometry and number theory. This project also sheds light on the connection to physics that is inherent in its statistical mechanical and information theoretic origins. Moreover, the subject has proven to have interesting links to diverse areas of mathematics, including the following: functional analysis, ergodic theory, combinatorics, and operator algebras. Many of the links are direct consequences of the principal investigator's research.  The project is part of ongoing activity to strengthen and understand such connections.<br/><br/>This project revolves around three main problems. The first is to understand the orbit equivalence consequences of positive or complete positive entropy for actions of nonamenable groups. For example, the principal investigator has shown that actions with complete positive entropy are strongly ergodic and that positive entropy actions are not weakly compact. He seeks to prove that actions with compete positive entropy are solidly ergodic, as defined by Chifan and Ioana, which will give further indication of the Bernoulli-like behavior that these actions exhibit. Part of the interest in this objective is that it places the theory of entropy for actions of nonamenable groups in stark contrast to the study of entropy for actions of amenable groups, where it is impossible to derive any orbit equivalence consequences of entropy. These consequences of complete positive entropy apply to algebraic actions (i.e., actions on compact groups by automorphisms), for the principal investigator can already demonstrate that algebraic actions related to invertible convolution operators have complete positive entropy. A second problem is concerned with investigating the entropy theory of algebraic actions of equivalence relations, which is joint work with Lewis Bowen and Dylan Airey. One aim of this part of the project is to generalize the principal investigator's results on entropy and Fuglede-Kadison determinants from the group case to the equivalence relation case. Lastly, the principal investigator will further the connections between dynamics and operator algebras by defining sofic entropy for actions on operator algebras."

In the machine learning paradigm, one typically observes a collection of data that represents the measurements of a physical process. The data may be represented in terms of a large number of variables. To learn the physical structures inherent to the data, one looks for a small number of latent variables that describe a low-dimensional manifold which contains or ""passes close to"" the data points. Whereas classical statistical regression looks for a linear relationship in the data, manifold learning allows for possibly non-linear descriptions. The principal investigator plans to develop practical manifold learning algorithms using techniques from extension theory. Consider for instance the problem of interpolating a set of data by a smooth, convex hypersurface. Whereas all currently available solutions to this problem require that the data points be sampled uniformly from the entire surface, the principal investigator proposes an approach which would work even when there are no sampled data on large pieces of the surface. The proposed research will introduce new connections between the fields of harmonic analysis and machine learning.<br/><br/>The past few decades have witnessed the development of abstract notions of differentiation and curvature on nonsmooth spaces. To study singular solutions to mean curvature flow, for instance, it is important to develop a generalized notion of curvature. Another achievement has been Cheeger's theory of differentiation on metric measure spaces. Cheeger's spaces carry a notion of distance and volume, but surprisingly, they lack the structure of local coordinate charts usually required to define a differential calculus. One shortcoming of this approach is its inherent limitation to first order theories. That is, one can define a first order differential operator, but the notion of a second order operator, such as the Laplacian or heat operator, is meaningless at this level of abstraction. The principal investigator proposes an alternate perspective: Assume the space is embedded as a subset of a Euclidean space. One can take the differential calculus on the Euclidean space and push it forward to define a calculus on the subset. This simple technique allows one to define high-order tangent and cotangent bundles on subsets of Euclidean space. An issue with the approach is that the computation of the bundles is highly nontrivial. The first order tangent bundle can be defined by a standard blow-up argument, but the higher order ""paratangent bundles"" are difficult to understand. By focusing on a class of explicit examples of algebraic varieties with cuspidal singularities, the principal investigator will find new methods for computing with these abstract spaces. The principal investigator will develop a notion of divided difference quotients on algebraic and semialgebraic sets."

The problem of characterizing dilations for which there exist minimally supported frequency (MSF) wavelets is connected with the geometry of numbers; more specifically, with the estimate on the number of lattice points of dilates of balls. An analogous problem of classifying dilations for which there exist well-localized wavelets has implications in the study of nonisotropic function spaces. Another direction of the project is the construction of frames with desired properties, such as with prescribed norms and frame operator. This line of research is closely related with the infinite-dimensional generalizations of the Schur-Horn theorem. The problem of characterizing diagonals of self-adjoint operators has not only implications for frame theory, but it has also been extensively studied in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Finally, the problem of characterizing tight fusion frame sequences is connected with algebraic combinatorics methods that are typically not employed in analysis."

Questions of this kind come up in most branches of mathematics: probability, approximation theory, number theory, combinatorics, and discrete geometry, as well as in any discipline of science, engineering, or finance that demands computations of multivariate integrals.  A number of less obvious and more profound connections have been discovered recently: some have already been formalized and understood, while others are only heuristic and await further research.  Almost every pivotal development in uniform distribution theory, the focus of this project, has exploited applications of real analysis, functional analysis, and especially harmonic analysis. At the same time, numerous modern methods of harmonic analysis that were historically overlooked by experts in other fields that make use of uniform distribution theory are only starting to gain footholds in their areas. <br/><br/>Many questions of utmost importance to uniform distribution theory, especially in higher dimensions, remain wide open. The questions under investigation in this project include the longstanding problem of precise asymptotics of optimal discrepancy in higher dimensions, one-bit compressed sensing, embeddings of metric spaces, interplay between discrepancy and energy minimization, constructions of well-distributed point sets (low-discrepancy, cubature, energy-minimizing, lattices),  discrepancy estimates and numerical integration in function spaces, exploring  the effect of  geometry on uniform distribution properties,  and problems of  discrete geometry (tessellations, coverings, packings). Progress on these questions has to be tightly intertwined with advances on important problems and conjectures in analysis and other fields, gluing together a mosaic of apparently disconnected questions and topics. The outcomes of the project are expected to impact several areas of mathematics, enriching and cross-fertilizing them with new results, ideas, and methods."

These equations play an important role in many areas of science and engineering, and they are at the basis of computer codes used today for modeling fluids, from weather prediction to aircraft and car design, and any number of other applications. Mathematically, the equations are notoriously difficult to solve and even if we use large computers, our computer models are still not as reliable as we would like. It is interesting to compare the situation for example with calculating the stress in complicated rigid structures. The stress calculations are governed by a different set of equations, and in many cases, they can be done with very good precision. One of the reasons is that the underlying equations for stress in rigid structures are much better understood mathematically. The difficulties with fluid calculations are essentially two-fold. First, the solutions are intrinsically complicated, regardless of how good our theory is. Second, our theory is fundamentally incomplete, and therefore we have to deal with a lot of uncertainty in a very difficult computational environment. While there is not much we can do about the first difficulty, the second difficulty can be addressed by improving our mathematical understanding of the equations. The ultimate goal of the research is to understand the behavior of the solutions to the degree that we would be able to design better algorithms for the solutions. The role of good theory in solving differential equations can be well illustrated on a simpler problem of solving equations of motion for planetary systems. In that case, if we use deeper mathematical properties of the equations of motion, we can significantly extend the precision of the algorithms, and make predictions for much longer time-scales. With fluid equations, the situation is more difficult, because ultimately we cannot hope to follow every drop of water when simulating, say, an ocean current, or a fast flow in a large water turbine. In the end, we have to use some averaging, and the right choice of averaging is the most difficult part. A good mathematical knowledge of the theoretical issues surrounding the fluid equations is important for achieving these goals.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the research will focus on the following areas: the generation of small scales and long-time behavior of 2d fluids, the limits of perturbation theory, model equations, and 2-d turbulence and partial damping.  By way of example we will describe our program in the study of turbulence. This work will test (at the mathematical level) our best theories of turbulence, in the 2d environment. (The 3d problems are currently out of reach).  Currently, the turbulence theory is based on some heuristic assumptions about averaging. Can the heuristics be justified mathematically? At a more technical level, what happens if we remove viscous damping on a few high Fourier modes? The heuristic turbulence theory predicts that this will have hardly any effect on the overall behavior of the fluid (in a turbulent regime). Due to recent advances in mathematical methods, this problem may now be within reach (although it is still difficult).  The remaining problems are similarly intricate, however the principal investigator has developed new methods for each of them and it is expected that significant progress will be made."

One way of describing a system's long-term behavior is through spectral theory, which includes the finding of frequencies naturally exhibited by the system. Imagine a vibrating string or beam of fixed length. Clearly, its frequency (think ""sound"") depends on how its ends (aka boundaries) are clamped down or otherwise restricted. In general, the spectrum of a differential operator and with it the properties of a physical system can change drastically when the conditions imposed on the boundary are changed. In many cases, we know the complete spectrum for one set of boundary conditions. From there, we can gain knowledge about the system under other conditions via the theory of so-called finite rank perturbations.<br/> <br/>The primary goal of the project is to systematically study spectral theory of finite rank unitary perturbations by tightening the relationship to corresponding functional models. The rank one setting is reasonably well-understood, while a general treatment of the finite rank problem presented several digressions. Initially, non-cyclic unitary unperturbed operators posed an issue. This problem is now resolved. The general problem involves matrix-valued Herglotz and Cauchy-type transforms. The study of these transforms as part of this project will provide insight into finite rank perturbation theory. A regularization of the so-called exterior Cauchy transform (as was done in the rank one setting) is planned. Further investigations will be made into the difficult case of infinite rank perturbations with defect operators in the trace class. The analogous self-adjoint setting, as well as concrete applications to differential operators, will also be investigated."

Self-similar sets are sets that look exactly the same at different scales, such as the Koch snowflake fractal curve.  The more flexible notion of conformal self-similarity requires a set only to look roughly the same at different scales, allowing for changes of bounded distortion at each scale, such as is seen in Julia sets. Most sets observed in nature arise from processes involving randomness and satisfy the even weaker notion of ""stochastic self-similarity"": the random mechanism behind the set is the same at all scales.  This project aims at an understanding of basic properties of stochastically self-similar sets, particularly in relation to our knowledge of conformally self-similar sets.  A central role in the project is played by dendrites and the question of how such branching random fractals can be described using angle-preserving coordinate changes.<br/><br/>The Loewner differential equation is a basic tool in complex analysis that provides a bijection between two-dimensional (planar) non-self-crossing curves (such as Jordan curves) and real-valued driving functions.  The recently introduced ""Loewner energy"" of a Jordan curve can be defined as the Dirichlet energy of the driving function. It depends a priori on the initial point of the curve.  During this project several questions related to the regularity properties of curves of finite energy will be investigated, aiming at a more geometric definition of the energy and a proof of the independence of energy from the initial point.  Since curves of finite energy are known to be quasiconformal curves, the questions will be approached by methods from quasiconformal analysis, particularly holomorphic deformations and conformal welding.  A generalization of conformal welding leads to a description of dendrites via laminations.  This generalization will be explored both in the deterministic and in the stochastic setting."

Mathematically this is a very interesting object. It is closely related to the solution of the Plateau problem, which requires one to find a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space. (This classical problem is an example of those that one encounters in the calculus of variations.) The area of a surface can be understood as a measurement of energy. The basic guiding principle is that minimizing its energy will lead to a stable configuration in any physical system. In this project the principal investigator addresses questions concerning the minimization of energies, questions that take into account noise and small fluctuations of the phenomena being modelled. The hope is that this theory will be better suited than existing ones to address minimization questions that arise in nature.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's goal in the project is to show that ""almost minimizers,"" which are minimizers to noisy variational problems, inherit some of the properties of minimizers of the same functional minus the noise. This research requires the use of tools from the calculus of variations, harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, potential theory, and geometric measure theory. The project will build bridges between the aforementioned areas, hopefully transforming them in the process through the influx of new ideas. The expectation is that these new ideas will, in particular, find applications in other variational problems with free boundaries."

These have been studied using different techniques. The goal here is to show that the systems in this large class have common properties and to develop a point of view which applies to all systems in this class.<br/><br/>More specifically, the proposed project aims at developing a more unified theory of ergodic properties of translation actions on certain foliated spaces.  The best known of these systems are translation flows on flat surfaces.  A key tool used to study these systems is the use of renormalization flows on moduli spaces obtained through geometric deformations of the foliated spaces.  This project seeks to introduce these tools and ideas to the study of the dynamics of other (usually higher rank) translation actions.  For example, the subject of quasicrystals, aperiodic tilings and Delone sets is a particularly good one in which to apply the ideas used in Teichmüller dynamics.  In particular, the relationship between ergodic theory, cohomology, and geometric deformation, which has been exploited in the study of flat surfaces, can also be exploited to study the properties of systems coming from quasicrystals and aperiodic tilings.  Tools used in the study of tilings such as non-commutative geometry can also be used to study translation flows on flat surfaces including those of infinite type. This cross-fertilization of fields will be mutually beneficial."

In geometric measure theory, one studies geometric properties of sets via the behavior of some measure on them (the concept of ""measure"" generalizes the notions of length, area, and volume). In this project, the sort of set under consideration is typically the boundary (i.e., the enclosing perimeter) of some region in space, and for this a specific measure -- namely, ""harmonic measure""-- plays a central role.  Harmonic measure and its generalizations may be used to construct solutions in some region, with prescribed boundary values, to partial differential equations of so-called ""elliptic"" type.  Such equations govern various steady-state phenomena in the real world, including electrostatics and steady-state temperature distributions.   For example, harmonic measure may be used to determine the steady-state temperature distribution within some region, given a known temperature distribution on the perimeter of the region. Unsurprisingly, the geometry of the region and its boundary greatly affect one's ability to carry out such a program in practice.  A principal goal of this project is to quantify, in a natural sense, the connection between geometry and the behavior of harmonic measure and its generalizations.<br/><br/>The project has two main areas of focus. First, the principal investigator plans to find an intrinsically geometric characterization of quantitative absolute continuity of harmonic measure with respect to surface measure, on the boundary of an open set in d-dimensional Euclidean space.   He expects that such a characterization should comprise two parts: a quantitative rectifiablity property of the boundary, plus scale invariant nontangential accessibility to ample portions of the boundary.   Related to this work, the principal investigator also plans to investigate the analogous question concerning quantitative absolute continuity of elliptic-harmonic measure associated to a more general second-order elliptic operator.  Second, the principal investigator will study the solvability of other boundary value problems for elliptic equations, in several different settings.  More precisely, he intends to work toward an improved understanding of the Neumann problem in domains more general than Lipschitz domains and for nonsymmetric divergence form operators. As a first step, he plans to consider a certain family of transmission problems, for which the Neumann problem is an endpoint case. He also plans to treat boundary-value problems for certain higher-order divergence-form elliptic operators."

This theory also provides the natural mathematical framework in which physical systems as they evolve in time (called dynamical systems) can be represented and studied; Groups are the algebraic structures that represent the time in dynamical systems. Today, each of the theories of Operator Algebras, Groups, and Dynamical Systems are independently of each other among most important and well-established parts of modern mathematics and mathematical physics. But the framework of operator algebras still allows deep interactions between these mathematical concepts. The aim of this project is to exploit the existing, and develop new bridges between these different theories. This allows one to utilize the current advanced mathematical technology of each area to help overcome some open problems in the others.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with various aspects of interaction between analytic group theory (and its quantum version) and operator algebras, particularly via the theory of boundaries. Measure-theoretical boundaries (e.g. the Poisson boundary), and topological boundaries (e.g. the Furstenberg boundary) of groups were introduced and developed in the 1960s and 1970s in the seminal work of Furstenberg. These concepts were used as a tool to prove certain rigidity results for lattices in Lie groups. The former type of boundaries have since been vastly investigated and used as the main tool in some of the most substantial results in the past few decades in both ergodic theory of groups and rigidity theory of von Neumann algebras. However, topological boundaries are much less understood, and surely have not been fully exploited as a similar powerful tool in continuous ergodic theory or C*-algebraic rigidity problems. These boundaries are defined abstractly in general for all discrete (and also non-discrete) groups, and they compromise all natural notions of boundaries such as Gromov's boundaries of hyperbolic groups or Furstenberg boundaries of semisimple Lie groups. The project aims to further develop the understanding of such boundaries. The goal is to apply them to generalize various results in operator algebra theory that have been proven by using special cases of such boundary actions, for example, the existing results concerning maximal injective von Neumann subalgebras and character-rigidity. In another direction, the project aims to develop and study the boundary theory of quantum groups and investigate their possible applications to problems such as C*-simplicity in the quantum setting."

These problems arise from varied domains of physics, such as the interaction between the structure of space-time and matter in general relativity, the influence of changes in the topography on the propagation of ocean waves, or simply some toy models from plasma physics and laser propagation devised to understand the possible buildup of energy in smaller dispersive channels. These situations are different and yet all result from complex interactions between several different ""modes of propagation"" combining to create new dynamics that cannot simply be predicted by looking at each component of the system in isolation. A better understanding of these effects allows one then to develop better and simpler models that accurately describe the behavior of the system under consideration for large time. The objective of this project is to describe in detail examples where such effects are relevant and to highlight the underlying common mathematical structure, while at the same time isolating the specific features responsible for each particular phenomenology.<br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the study of the long-time behavior of three different nonlinear hyperbolic and dispersive systems in cases where scattering does not hold and nonlinear effects have a strong impact on the qualitative behavior of solutions. The principal investigator will consider the following: (i) a problem from general relativity, namely, the stability of Minkowski space for the Einstein equations in the presence of a massive scalar field; (ii) a model (NLS) problem that involves the possible growth of Sobolev norms on domains of smaller volume; (iii) a model from water-wave theory that seeks to demonstrate how a sudden and localized change in the bottom topography influences the propagation of solitary waves. In each case the principal investigator will focus on controlling solutions globally using a combination of Fourier and harmonic analysis, bilinear estimates, ordinary differential equations and geometric methods (vector fields, normal forms, tools from Hamiltonian dynamics), and adapted function spaces. The objective is to derive improved ""effective"" dynamics that control asymptotic behavior."

D. students and junior researchers from different countries. Its objectives are to present and discuss the latest results on the geometric aspects and dynamics of resonances, share points of view and ideas, and to strengthen or promote interactions.  The conference will give Ph.D. students and young scientists the opportunity to meet some of the prominent researchers in the fields related to resonances and to exchange ideas with them. To make the more specialized talks accessible to the participants, some experts will give tutorial and survey talks. Moreover, two afternoons will be devoted to talks of junior participants. This will give the Ph.D. students and the postdocs the possibility of presenting their work, which is an essential step for entering in the world of research and for building scientific collaborations. <br/><br/>The notion of resonance was introduced in quantum mechanics to study metastable states of a system, that is long-lived states from which the system deviates only with sufficiently strong disturbances. Mathematically, resonances appear either as discrete eigenvalues of the quantization of a classical Hamiltonian or as the eigenvalues of the transfer operator of the classical flow. Their study, initially aimed at Schroedinger operators on R^n, was extended to more geometric situations. Because of the role they play in various physical contexts there has been a considerable progress in understanding the geometry and the analysis of classical and quantum resonances in the last years. Nevertheless, many important and basic questions are still open. Many difficulties preventing to use classical arguments arise because of the non-self-adjoint nature of resonances. Also, in the geometric case of (locally) symmetric spaces, very little is known when the rank of the spaces is bigger than 1. Partial advances have been obtained, with several different approaches, using either harmonic analysis and representation theory, or microlocal analysis and techniques from scattering theory such as complex scaling. To study resonances in higher dimensional and higher rank geometric situations, a joint effort of different mathematical communities is therefore needed, and young researchers should have contacts with experts from the various aspects of the theory to make significant progress.

Some of these forces are attractive, some are repulsive. For instance, the formation of crystals, which are periodic arrangements of atoms, can be very roughly explained via repulsive forces coupled with a binding force. This project takes a mathematical and general view on a class of such phenomena: given a system of  N points (or particles) with a specific repulsive interaction  (typically the Coulomb repulsive force encountered in electrostatics, or other interactions which are in inverse power of the distance between two points), together with a confining force, one would like to describe  the typical macroscopic and microscopic behavior of the system as the number of points N gets very large, and possible thermal effects are included (temperature being expected to add disorder to the system). The research of the PI is concretely related to important physics models: the arrangements of vortices in superconductors, the study of energy-levels of large atoms (spectrum of large random matrices), theoretical physics models related to magnetism, but also more loosely connected to questions in biology, astrophysics,  plasma physics, Bose-Einstein condensates, atomic clusters or hydrodynamics.<br/><br/>The first topic of the project  is the statistical mechanics of Coulomb gases in an external potential and related models. This is motivated by random matrices, the fractional quantum Hall effect, and even approximation theory. One is interested in describing the macroscopic (mean-field) and microscopic arrangements of the many particles as their number N tends to infinity, and how they depend on temperature and the potential, and in particular whether some features are universal (i.e. independent of the potential) and whether there are phase transitions as the temperature varies. Recent works of the PI and collaborators  have given insight into these questions with a proof that the fluctuations of the distribution of particles in a two-dimensional Coulomb gas converge to a Gaussian Free Field, and a Large Deviation Principle result which characterizes the limiting point processes at the microscopic scale as minimizing a certain rate function. With these results, one expects that the system should ""crystallize"" into a triangular lattice as the temperature tends to 0.The methods previously developed open the way to treating several important related questions: the case of higher-dimensional Coulomb gases, the case of more general interactions, the universality of the local statistics, the existence of a limiting point process, and the description of its long-range correlations. The second topic is that of vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity, with pinning terms that introduce disorder and  the final topic is to advance the analysis of mean-field dynamics for the simplest setting of many particles interacting via a repulsive singular interaction, a notoriously difficult question."

A system of such operators forms a C*-algebra. In the finite dimensional cases, these operators are just matrices. In more general cases, these operators may be represented by infinite matrices, or matrices on infinite dimensional Hilbert space. In the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, a pair of self-adjoint operators representing observables are typically non-commutative which corresponds to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The study of C*-algebra is often viewed as the study of non-commutative analogues of the algebra of continuous functions on a topological space. There are many C*-algebras that come from different fields of sciences and the study of C*-algebras has variety of applications. It is known that C*-algebras with different appearance from different applications can be the same. On the other hand, C*-algebras from the same source may look the same but have essentially different structure. For application purposes as well as the theoretical point of view, it is extremely important to determine the structure of C*-algebras from their appearance. This project is an attempt to use a small number of computable data to completely determine C*-algebras in certain classes. In other words one may study the computable data to understand the structure of C*-algebras. <br/><br/>This project is a study of classification of amenable C*-algebras using K-theory related invariants and applications of the classification. The main part of this project is to search for a broad classification of non-unital simple amenable C*-algebras. Part of the strategy is to create new technical tools to deal with non-commutative version of non-compact spaces. The goal is to establishe a new type of existence theorem as well as a K-theoretic characterization of asymptotic unitary equivalence for non-unital simple C*-algebras. A closely related topic is to verify certain C*-algebras satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. The research of this project will also provide a new passage to greatly simplify the way in which the theory of C*-algebras is applied to various other related research areas, notably, to non-commutative homotopy theory and the study of dynamical systems. For example, it is proposed, using this broad classification theory, to study a new relation among minimal homeomorphisms on a compact metric space which is called asymptotic conjugacy, and ultimately characterize this relation via K-theoretical data."

Birkhoff in 1927.  This mathematical dynamical system serves as a good approximation to several important physical systems, for instance, sound propagation inside of a chapel or a cathedral.  This research project targets classical inverse problems for such dynamical systems, for example: if we know some properties of the particle's motion, can we infer properties of the underlying domain?  This is closely related to the question, ""Can you hear the shape of a drum?"" That is, can one reconstruct the shape of a drum solely from the sound it produces?  It turns out that properties of sound inside of a convex domain are closely related to properties of the possible trajectories of the associated reflecting particles inside of the same domain. This project aims to deepen understanding of related mathematical questions in the analysis of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is to study perturbations of convex billiards and to derive necessary conditions for integrability (for perturbation of ellipses) and for isospectrality of deformations of convex domains.  The former condition is closely related to the phenomenon of whispering galleries and the Birkhoff conjecture about characterization of integrable billiards, while the latter problem is closely related to deformation spectral rigidity.  M. Kac's question can be expressed in terms of the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation inside of a convex planar domain.  Due to the wave trace function the Laplace spectrum generically determines the length spectrum of the associated billiard inside of the same domain and connects analysis with billiards.  The second part of the project is about proving stochastic Arnold diffusion, that is, stochastic diffusing behavior for nearly integrable systems and the Chirikov conjecture.  One of challenging goals is to establish stochastic diffusive behavior inside of Kirkwood gaps for the three-body problem."

The use of complex numbers has been essential in the development of mathematics.  Partial differential equations and several complex variables are employed in string theory and twistor theory, physical theories that try to unify different physical force fields.  The existence and regularity of solutions to such partial differential equations are still not fully understood, and they form some of the most challenging problems in mathematical analysis.  The current study is not only important for the development of mathematics, but it may lead to new understanding of physical phenomena as well, with potential applications in other sciences and technology.  <br/><br/>This research focuses on some of the most important equations in several complex variables, the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the induced tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations.

Understanding the geometric aspects of these equations under the curvature conditions and their relations with function theory in complex manifolds is a challenging and important problem.  New approaches have been introduced to study these problems which connect the topology of domains in complex manifolds with the topology of Dolbeault cohomology groups.

The term ""measure"" refers to an abstract generalization of length, area, or volume, which assigns a size value to every mathematical set. Traditional outlets for geometric measure theory have expanded in recent decades. The widespread utility and current use of geometric measure theory in different areas of analysis justifies its continued development. The research component of this project seeks to advance our understanding about underlying structures of general measures and to develop new techniques that will expand the toolbox that geometric measure theory provides for researchers in adjacent areas of analysis and geometry. On the educational front, this project will support a network of early career researchers whose research involves nonsmooth analysis, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who work in a number areas.  Principal activities by the PI include organizing a Workshop for Postdocs in Fall 2017 and a Conference for Graduate Students with Mini-Courses in Spring 2019. The two conferences will be linked: postdoctoral participants from the workshop will be invited to give mini-courses for graduate students in the follow-up conference. The PI will further integrate research and education by organizing an analysis learning seminar and mentoring two postdoctoral researchers at the PI's home institution.<br/><br/>This project focuses on a constellation of questions about the structure of Radon measures in Euclidean space. The underlying theme is that general measures may be understood in terms of their behavior with respect to lower dimensional sets such as finite length curves in the plane and finite area surfaces in space. This point-of-view originated in the 1920s and 1930s through investigations by A.S. Besicovitch, which compared and contrasted properties of finite length sets with properties of rectifiable curves.  Later contributions by A.P. Morse and J.F. Randolph, H. Federer, P. Mattila, and D. Preiss from the 1940s through the 1980s produced a rich theory of qualitative rectifiability of measures in Euclidean space that are absolutely continuous with respect to Hausdorff measures; a quantitative theory of rectifiability for Ahlfors regular measures emerged in the 1990s through the work of G. David and S. Semmes. The proposed research seeks to broaden our understanding of different notions of rectifiability of measures in the absence of background regularity hypotheses from past investigations. Specifically, the PI will look for characterizations of Radon measures which are carried by countable families of Hölder continuous curves, Lipschitz graphs, or Lipschitz continuous images of linear subspaces. This goal requires integration of techniques from modern harmonic analysis and quantitative geometric measure theory. The PI will explore approaches based on the PI's work with R. Schul, which characterized Radon measures that are carried by countable families of rectifiable curves, as well as approaches based on G. David and T. Toro's extension of the Reifenberg algorithm and approaches based on K. Rajala's quasiconformal uniformization theorem."

An integral part of the project is the simultaneous development of a user-friendly numerical platform, STABLAB, for numerical stability investigation, and the systematic exploration with this platform of physical behavior in gas and fluid dynamics in the delicate situations of reacting or ionized flow.  <br/><br/>The problems addressed involve issues in dynamical systems, singular perturbation theory, spectral theory of linear operators, nonlinear partial differential equations, and rigorous scientific computation, and should result in the development of new mathematical tools of general application. In particular, development of dynamical systems tools for kinetic shock and boundary layer problems would unify and extend results obtained for Boltzmann phenomena by the ""Kyoto School"" of Sone et al using a variety of formal and analytic methods. Likewise, the introduction of new inviscid stability criteria for roll waves and of Kreiss symmetrizer techniques for analysis of modulated fronts open new directions in the study of periodic modulation. The problem on galloping detonations, if solved, will answer a longstanding question, while associated rigorous Wensel,Kramers, and Brillouin method developments will be of wide general use. Determination of simple stability criteria for roll waves in shallow water flow are of practical interest in hydraulic engineering. Finally, the development of rigorous numerical proof and error estimate techniques is potentially transformative, having broader implications for standards in scientific computing."

In this project, more general, non-smooth, functions that are defined on geometric objects (metric spaces) that may be very different from the real line will be investigated. These geometries may be abstract objects with no reasonable embedding into any Euclidean geometry, or they may be fractal, or they may otherwise admit complicated behavior at all scales. Far from being a technical curiosity, non-smooth analysis and geometry have now become important tools in many areas of pure and applied mathematics and computer science, where non-Euclidean geometries may arise.  For example, from discrete groups or dynamical systems, as limits of smooth objects, as large data sets, or in computational problems.<br/><br/>In more precise terms, the goal of this project is to study the relationship between, on the one hand, the infinitesimal and global geometry of non-smooth spaces and, on the other hand, the analysis of Lipschitz and related classes of mappings defined on these spaces. One specific goal is to further understand the spaces which allow for differentiation of real-valued Lipschitz functions (in the sense of Cheeger): what topological and geometric properties can such spaces possess, and can we construct new examples? Another goal is to understand rigidity theorems for Lipschitz mappings and rectifiable curves in metric spaces. For example, when must Lipschitz mappings between metric spaces have more rigid (e.g., bi-Lipschitz) behavior on large subsets of their domains? Can we characterize rectifiable curves in metric spaces via local flatness conditions, as in the ""Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem"" of Jones in the plane? Understanding these questions involves combining techniques from classical geometric measure theory with those of the newer field of ""analysis on metric spaces"".  Analytic investigations like these have also provided, and should continue to provide, insights into the geometry of the non-smooth."

The class of integrable systems includes several fundamental equations of nature and the mathematical foundations of integrable systems go back to classical works of Liouville, Gauss, and Poincare.  Currently, the theory of integrable systems has become an expanding area which plays an increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical physics.  Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytical tool for the study of some of the fundamental  mathematical models arising in modern nonlinear science and technology.  In addition to the traditional domain of differential equations, integrable techniques are becoming common in  such diverse fields as orthogonal polynomials, string theory, enumerative topology, statistical mechanics, random processes, quantum informatics, and number theory.  Many of the problems considered in the project have direct connections with these disciplines. <br/><br/>This research project continuous the principal investigator's long term research efforts in the theory of integrable systems. The principal goal of the project is to address the following two directions which have emerged from  recent developments in random matrix theory and in the theory of exactly solvable quantum models: (a) The study of  the isomonodromic tau functions, their asymptotics, Fredholm determinant representations and their relations to the conformal  field theory; (b) The asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz, Hankel, and Fredholm determinants arising in the study of critical phenomena in random matrices and statistical mechanics.  Each of these directions is represented by a collection of concrete problems, and they will be investigated within the same analytical framework, viz., the Riemann-Hilbert method.  The main focus of the first direction is on the long standing question of evaluation the asymptotic connection formulae, including the constant pre-factors,  for the generic families of Painleve tau functions. The principal concern  of the second direction is various types of double scaling and transitional limits - topics which are among the principal questions in both the theory of random matrices and in  statistical mechanics."

We are now capable of gathering immense amounts of data, and so it is a central concern to develop quick and efficient ways of analyzing this data.  In many instances, one can endow the points of a data set with a notion of distance and weight, thereby giving us a geometric representation of the data.  One can then try to take advantage of this geometry and leverage this information to speed up computations on the data set.  This project seeks to develop new techniques and theorems for understanding the geometric and analytic structure of spaces with some notion of distance and (possibly) weight.  Some basic questions the project will address are the following: Can I represent my space in some other space (e.g. Euclidean space) so that the geometry is preserved with high fidelity?  Does my space exhibit low dimensional behavior despite living in a possibly high (or infinite) dimensional space?  Is there a calculus available on my space that I can use to analyze functions on the space?<br/><br/>This project will study analytic and geometric properties of certain classes of metric measure spaces.  In the first part of the project, the PI will study problems about metric embeddings including whether doubling subsets of Hilbert space embed into Euclidean spaces and developing biLipschitz metric invariants to measure uniform smoothness. The second part of the project will focus on detecting rectifiable behavior in metric measure spaces.  Rectifiable spaces admit parameterizations by simple model spaces (usually Euclidean space) and so can exhibit low dimensional behavior. The PI will study Carnot notions of rectifiability and also link these geometric properties to boundedness of singular integrals.  Finally, the PI will continue his study into the nature of Lipschitz differentiability on metric measure spaces as introduced by Cheeger.  The project will determine whether such differentiation differs between real valued and RNP Banach space valued functions. If these notions turn out to be different, the PI will then seek to discover the geometric mechanisms for the former (the PI has already been geometrically characterized the latter). The PI will also seek to broaden the differentiability theory to non-Banach space target."

Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many applications. In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the flow of air past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering (for instance: signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for instance: image processing and quantum computation). Moreover, complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. The primary aim of the efforts of the PI is to further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. <br/><br/>The PI will advance the understanding of the behavior of holomorphic maps between bounded domains in higher dimensional complex Euclidean space. In the field of several complex variables, there have been many deep investigations into when holomorphic maps extend continuously to the boundary, the behavior of iterations of holomorphic maps, and the properties of the biholomorphism group of a bounded domain. The standard approach to studying these problems uses methods from partial differential equations and differential geometry. The PI will study these problems using techniques from the theory of non-positively curved metric spaces. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory, where metric space techniques applied to group theory have lead to many important results. By using metric spaces techniques in several complex variables, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This part of the activity will enhance knowledge about the biholomorphism group of complex manifolds, connections between the boundary of a domain and its complex geometry, the iterations of holomorphic maps, continuous extensions of holomorphic maps, realizations of Hermitian symmetric spaces, and the complex geometry of certain smooth quasi-projective algebraic varieties."

An early discovery of modern physics was that this state of affairs is very much different at the subatomic level. In particular, the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics asserts that it is impossible to simultaneously determine the position and momentum of a quantum particle with arbitrary precision.  In 1926, von Neumann laid the precise mathematical foundation for what it is that can actually be measured in the case of a subatomic particle. This work involved the use of operators, linear transformations acting on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Operator theory, the branch of modern mathematics that studies operators, has subsequently developed to become a far-reaching area of research in pure mathematics, and numerous additional applications throughout mathematics, physics, and engineering have been discovered. This research project involves the development of new techniques within operator theory as well as the application of established techniques to attack a number of questions involving the theory of functions. While it is not the primary focus of the project, the research has many potential applications to mathematical physics, control theory, and the theory of optimization.<br/> <br/>A pillar of modern operator theory is the Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem, which models contractions acting on Hilbert space by extending them to co-isometries acting on larger spaces. This theorem and its numerous refinements open the door to studying holomorphic functions in one and several variables through the use of operator-theoretic methods. This project studies a variety of problems in several complex variables and other areas of analysis using these operator-theoretic methods. In particular, operator-theoretic methods will be employed to study: interpolation problems of Nevanlinna-Pick and Cartheodory-Fejer type; the boundary behavior of analytic functions defined on polydiscs and poly-halfplanes; the derivation and descriptive theory of extremal holomorphic mappings arising from the Caratheodory and Kobayashi extremal problems; and the canonical derivation of representation formulae for analytic functions  in specific classes such as the Schur, Herglotz, Pick, Loewner, Bessmertnyi, and Stieltjes classes on domains in several variables. A related focus of the research is to apply modifications of the modeling methods to develop the theory of analytic functions on varieties in commuting variables and on free domains in several non-commuting variables."

As a concrete example one can consider the trajectory of a ball on an ideal table. The table is frictionless and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.   A classical mathematical problem is to study the trajectories of a ball when the sides of the table form a polygon - not necessarily a rectangle.  There can be different types of trajectories.  Some trajectories can be periodic and some can be dense on the table.  This simple problem is notoriously difficult.  It is very difficult to solve the problem for a particular table, unless it is of a special shape; for example, a rectangle or an equilateral triangle.   This leads to the study of families of tables that have similarities.  You could for instance, study the family of tables with five sides.  Taking the family of tables as a new space it is possible to define a new flow on this space.  This point of view turns out to have important consequences.  For example, we may now be able to say what happens on ""most"" tables.  This proposal studies dynamical systems by taking a similar point of view.<br/><br/>We mainly seek rigidity results where rather weak initial data about an object yields an almost complete classification of the object.  The following will be the main objectives:       <br/>(i) Employing a dynamical approach to study problems in number theory and geometry has proven rather fruitful.  However, this approach is often noneffective.  <br/>We will seek effectivization of the rigidity phenomena for the action of groups generated by unipotent subgroups on homogeneous spaces; these rigidity results have served as one of the main tools in the aforementioned applications.  <br/>(ii) There is an action of the group of nonsingular, real, two by two matrices on the moduli space of a compact Riemann surface; this is closely related to the asymptotic of the number of periodic trajectories on rational polygonal tables.  <br/>This proposal seeks generalizations of the recent exciting developments which proved certain rigidity results for this action.  <br/>(iii) We attempt to investigate dynamics on homogeneous spaces with infinite volume, and on homogeneous spaces arising from local fields of positive characteristic. There are various geometric and number theoretical applications which motivate the study of these spaces."

Turbulence plays a pivotal role in countless engineering and industrial applications such as the design of land and aircraft, where the production of turbulence must be understood deeply to achieve energy efficient and effective technology.  It has long been believed that the inner workings of turbulence may be understood in terms of the differential equations that are being used to model fluid motion, including the Euler equations.  However, the analysis of these equations has proved so difficult that much of the relationship between turbulence and solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics remains conjectural and unresolved.  Recently through the work of the investigator and other mathematicians, a new approach has emerged to analyze solutions to fluid equations that have rapid fluctuations comparable to what is seen in turbulence.  This approach is intimately tied to questions in the mathematical discipline of geometry.  This research project aims to push this new approach towards its fullest potential to improve the understanding of turbulence and to expand the frontiers of what can be accomplished through mathematical analysis.<br/><br/>At a technical level, the PI will prove rigorous results on the structure of ""weak solutions"" to the equations of fluid dynamics, including the incompressible Euler equations.

One direction of research will relate to the phenomenon of anomalous dissipation of energy and the extent to which this phenomenon may exist and be generic or stable under perturbation.  The PI will consider analogues and extensions of Onsager's conjecture on anomalous dissipation, and will also investigate fine properties of the dynamical structure of general weak solutions to the Euler and related equations.

Such embeddings form a well-established tool in theoretical computer science. Their usefulness can be seen in the following example: Analysis of large sets of data is important in many contexts. Usually data is endowed with a natural distance (degree of dissimilarity) of its elements. One of the useful approaches to analysis of such sets of data is to use some low-distortion embeddings of the set into a space whose structure is well-known, for example into a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. One can subsequently employ algorithms available in computational geometry and tools from classical mathematics. In some cases one can even visualize the structure of the set, for example, see its clusters.  Another application of embeddings is to construction of approximate algorithms in cases where the algorithms for finding the exact solution of a combinatorial optimization problem are not practical (consume too much time) and we seek not necessarily the optimal solution, but a solution that is close (in some sense) to being optimal. In many cases the best known approximate algorithms are based on metric embeddings. The project aims to deepen understanding in this important area.<br/><br/>The main goal of the proposal is to study embeddings of discrete metric spaces into Banach spaces. The existence of a low-distortion embedding into a plane is rather rare in applications.

This project will contribute to the following general question: Find new classes of embeddings of finite and locally finite metric spaces into Banach spaces and find new types of obstructions to such embeddings. The three main directions of the work are: (1) determine to what extent expanders and graphs with large girth resist nontrivially good embeddings; (2) find characterizations of well-known classes of Banach spaces in terms of embeddings; and (3) analyze structures that create obstructions to coarse embeddings of spaces with bounded geometry into a Hilbert space.

In the search for mathematical models of hyperelasticity, one must accept and explore the limits of elastic deformations.  This approach turns out to be particularly effective in the two-dimensional theory of flat plates and thin films.  Theoretical prediction of failures of bodies caused by cracks and fractions is a good motivation that should appeal to both pure mathematicians and researchers in applied fields.

Complex analysis and potential theory are central to modern mathematics and they provide powerful tools for solving important problems from other fields of pure and applied mathematics (e.g., image and signal processing) and physics (e.g., quantum mechanics; statistical physics). Making progress on the research problems in this project will contribute to the advancement of knowledge and understanding in these fields. <br/><br/>This mathematics research project deals with problems from pluripotential theory which arise naturally and have important applications to complex geometry or to transcendental number theory. A unifying theme is that the proposed problems focus on plurisubharmonic functions and on positive closed currents as objects of investigation or as some of the tools to be employed. The first direction of research is concerned with quantization problems on complex spaces. These have applications to statistical physics (quantum chaos), as well as to number theory (quantum unique ergodicity for modular forms). Coman will consider sequences of singular Hermitian holomorphic line bundles over complex spaces, and will study the Bergman spaces of square-integrable holomorphic sections defined using this metric data. In particular, he will study the asymptotics of the Bergman kernel functions and the convergence of the Fubini-Study currents associated to these spaces, and the asymptotic distribution of common zeros of random sequences of m-tuples of holomorphic sections. In the special case of the sequence of powers of a single line bundle, Coman will study the asymptotics of partial Bergman kernels corresponding to spaces of holomorphic sections of vanishing to high order along a complex hypersurface. The second direction of research addresses problems in pluripotential theory on compact Kaehler manifolds. Here there are some interesting new phenomena different from the local setting. The goals are to describe the domain of definition of the complex Monge-Ampere operator and to study the corresponding Green functions and their singularities. Coman will also consider the problem of extension and regularization of (quasi) plurisubharmonic functions on analytic subvarieties of the ambient manifold. The third direction of research deals with problems from pluripotential theory in complex Euclidean spaces and considers questions about geometric properties of positive closed currents and their approximation by analytic varieties, and about the behavior of polynomials along transcendental analytic varieties. It is expected that the latter will continue to have applications to transcendental number theory, such as to the study of the algebraic independence of values of entire functions."

Roughly speaking, microlocal analysis devises methods to keep track of the position and frequency (or momentum) of waves (or, more generally, functions) simultaneously. The project's applications are to wave propagation and other related phenomena, as well as to inverse problems for determining a function from integrals along curves (the X-ray transform) and related problems for determining the structure of a material from boundary measurements. Although the project itself concerns their mathematical theory, the problems under investigation are closely connected to the physical world. Wave propagation is ubiquitous in nature, with electromagnetic waves, such as light, being one of the most prevalent examples. The theory of general relativity is another important physical example via (the recently detected) gravitational waves. Scattering theory for quantum particles (such as protons and electrons) is another subject governed by microlocal analysis, aspects of which enter into the description of both quantum waves at large distances and semiclassical phenomena (those in which Planck's constant can be regarded as small, often the case in chemistry). The inverse problems under study are also of broad significance. One application of the theory under development here is the determination of an unknown variable sound speed in an object via the measurement of travel times of waves, which for instance is relevant to imaging to interior of Earth using the travel times of earthquake waves.<br/><br/>Parts of this project describe the long-time or far-field behavior of waves on curved space-times. Physically these arise in scattering theory and general relativity, including electromagnetic waves on a curved background. The microlocal approach to analysis on these spaces has made breakthroughs possible in work on linear and nonlinear problems on asymptotically (real) hyperbolic spaces as well as on Kerr-de Sitter space. The projects here aim to improve the understanding of Lorentzian scattering spaces, which include asymptotically Minkowski spaces (asymptotically flat spaces, which our universe approximates, at least locally, even if there is a small positive cosmological constant). Other projects concern the behavior of waves at edges -- specifically, the diffraction of the Rayleigh (surface) waves of elasticity. Yet another main area is inverse problems, building on recently-developed tools for spatially localized inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform, including the solution of fixed conformal class boundary rigidity: under suitable assumptions, one can determine a variable sound speed inside an object from the travel times of waves between points on the surface. The parts of the project in this area aim to extend the foregoing result to tensors, which describe anisotropic sound speeds in an appropriate sense; namely, the project will investigate boundary rigidity, for example, recovering a Riemannian metric from its boundary distance function."

Solutions to this system of equations can develop singularities from regular initial data; some such singularities are inside a black hole event horizon. A fundamental mathematical question concerns understanding how such singularities arise from generic initial data. In particular, this project explores questions that include: What does the boundary of the interior of black holes look like? Are they always singular? Are there singularities that are not in the black hole regions? These are questions that the strong and weak cosmic censorship conjectures in general relativity seek to address -- study of those conjectures is the central motivation for this project.<br/><br/>A particular focus of the project is to understand the singular boundary of the interior of black holes and also to understand sharp criteria under which trapped surfaces (structures closely related to black holes) may form. Recent work of the investigator and collaborators provides a resolution of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture for the Einstein-Maxwell (real) scalar field in spherical symmetry, showing that solutions arising from generic data have singular black hole interiors, in the sense that the spacetime metric cannot be extended in a suitably regular manner. This project aims to extend these results to settings without symmetry assumptions, in particular to give a complete description of the boundary of black holes that arise from perturbations of the explicit Kerr solutions. In a different direction, this project also aims to establish criteria that guarantee that trapped surfaces form, as a step towards understanding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture in general relativity."

Despite their long study, many questions about the distribution of prime numbers remain unsolved. Primes are also intertwined with the study of class numbers, which appear in many number-theoretic settings. Class numbers have been studied for 200 years, but still remain largely mysterious, although precise conjectures have been developed. Seemingly far away on the mathematical spectrum,  Radon transforms quantify the distribution of the ""mass"" of functions along lower-dimensional surfaces; they are a critical part of the theory underlying Computed Tomography medical imaging. The study of Radon transforms is a central area in harmonic analysis with far-reaching connections both to the Carleson operator, which was instrumental in answering a historic question on Fourier series, and to the new world of discrete arithmetic operators, which blends harmonic analysis with number theory. This project, which is at the intersection of number theory and harmonic analysis, explores and connects all of these themes. During the course of the work, the project will contribute to the mathematical community through training postdocs, a graduate summer school, and mathematical outreach activities for children.<br/><br/>The major aims of this research center on five projects at the intersection of number theory and harmonic analysis. First, new bounds relating to the divisibility of class numbers of number fields of arbitrary degree will be obtained. Second, new bounds will be obtained for short character sums, which historically provided an important subconvexity result for L-functions, and now in a multi-dimensional setting have the potential to impact problems involving counting integral solutions to Diophantine equations. Third, in the realm of Diophantine equations, new variations on the circle method, and closely related questions on multi-dimensional oscillatory integrals, will be developed. Fourth, new results for discrete operators will be proved by adapting number-theoretic methods to the setting of harmonic analysis. Finally, a systematic investigation of Carleson operators with polynomial phases and Radon-type behavior will be carried out."

The mathematical models considered are in regimes where there are competing influences from a disorder in the interaction and some long-range order, such as spatially slowly decaying interactions and quasi-periodic interactions. One focus is on applications of spectral theory to explain conservation laws in certain nonlinear systems and find otherwise hidden predictability in their behavior, described through the mathematical notion of integrability. The project focuses on Schrodinger operators, central to quantum mechanics, and the mathematical methods developed have the potential to illuminate other mathematical models and physical applications, such as electron conductivity in disordered materials and signal transmission using solitons. <br/><br/>One main focus of this project is the spectral theory of almost periodic Schrodinger operators and integrability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with almost periodic initial data. While a Lax pair representation formally rewrites the equation as an isospectral flow, rigorous characterizations of integrability, such as construction of an inverse scattering transform, are highly dependent on the phase space under consideration and require and motivate deep new results in direct and inverse spectral theory. Other topics considered in this project include estimates for the size and continuity of the solution in terms of spectral data, Schrodinger operators with slowly decaying potentials, higher-order Szego theorems, and transport properties of Schrodinger operators and quantum spin systems."

A main focus of this project is to find models realizing such symmetries in quantum field theory, which combines the principles of quantum physics and the theory of special relativity. The goal is to use the rich interplay between operator algebras and quantum field theory via conformal nets and to better understand possible quantum symmetries in mathematics and low-dimensional physics. One potential application is topological quantum computing, where the goal is to use quantum operations coming from non-trivial quantum symmetries to perform computations.<br/><br/>Conformal nets give rise to interesting quantum symmetries in terms of subfactors and unitary modular tensor categories.

Motivated by his work on systems with large numbers of particles, the PI, with collaborators,  has discovered some connections between optimal transportation, games with a large number of players, and Mean Field Games. These unexpected connections open doors to several new  avenues of research, some of which being  described in this proposal.  The goal of this project is to advance knowledge in various other related topics. This includes the geometry of the space of closed differential forms with  the  non--linear factorization of  differential forms.  This proposal involves  training students, mentoring postdocs and organizing  learning seminars for graduate students. The PI will remain involved in national as well as international activities. These, constitute the broader impacts of the proposed activities. <br/><br/>The PI studies the mathematical aspects of Density Functional Theory (DFT), as well as  certain  geometric clustering problems originating in combinatorial optimization. What many of these problems have in common, and what is sometimes novel in the approach for studying them, is their formulation on infinite dimensional ``manifolds''  equipped with metric, differential, and symplectic pseudo-structures.  This infinite dimensional setting often lead to a new outlook and --at least on the formal level-- to novel and simpler approaches to otherwise complex problems. A typical example is how Otto's calculus turns many nonlinear PDEs into gradient flows of geodesically convex functionals. In a similar fashion, our searching for geodesic of minimal lengths on the set of  differential forms, leads to a new concept of ``quasiconvexity,"" that looks like an extension of the concept originally  introduced by C. Morrey and used extensively in non--linear elasticity theory. Part of the challenge, however, includes turning formal arguments into rigorous ones to yield new results.  The intellectual merit of the research is that the problems to be studied have the potential of revealing principles which can be extended to a more general context."

These arise as fundamental models of a wide variety of physical systems, including the propagation of waves and the study of nonlinear optics, and are closely related to models of fluids, as well as a number of aspects of statistical and quantum mechanics.  The development of mathematical tools to understand important issues such as existence and uniqueness of solutions, as well the behavior of the corresponding evolutions on a qualitative and quantitative level, is therefore an issue of fundamental scientific importance.  As a particular example, several of the questions to be investigated in this research involve studying long-time properties of solutions to the nonlinear Schrodinger and nonlinear wave equations evolving from ""generic"" randomly chosen initial data.  In addition to being of substantial mathematical interest, investigation into these questions addresses the broader scientific issue of whether possible singularities arising in the mathematical formulation can occur in physically relevant settings.  Moreover, the topics to be studied are closely connected to a wide range of issues in partial differential equations, probability, and harmonic analysis, and the ideas and techniques developed will provide important contributions to the availability of mathematical tools for future research on related questions.<br/><br/>The particular scope of this research project is to investigate several problems concerning local and global well-posedness properties for nonlinear dispersive and wave equations, focusing on the nonlinear Schrodinger, nonlinear wave, and Korteweg-de Vries equations.  The research encompasses four broad directions, which are often interrelated, and which each contribute to the wider theme of understanding the precise dynamical behavior of solutions both locally and globally in time.  The first two directions of interest concern global in time existence of solutions, in particular focusing first on the development of global well-posedness results adapted to the energy-supercritical setting, and second on important issues surrounding probabilistic global well-posedness results in endpoint and limiting situations (in this probabilistic framework, initial data for the problem is chosen as a random Fourier series, and results are obtained by excluding sets occurring with small probability).  The third direction of interest turns to the study of local in time stability properties of solutions, focusing in particular on initial data of low-regularity.  The fourth direction of study investigates dispersive models with higher-order nonlocal terms, in which a key ingredient will be the adaptation of recent developments in the study of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations with similar nonlocal features.  In each of these settings, the PI and collaborators will incorporate techniques from harmonic analysis, probability, and spectral theory to analyze the dynamical features involved in the evolution."

Classically, the symmetries of a mathematical object form a ""group"", which is a set with a binary operation such as the integers with addition. In recent decades, we have seen the emergence of quantum mathematical objects whose symmetries form a group-like structure called a ""tensor category"", which has a collection of objects with a binary fusion operation. Tensor categories are said to encode quantum symmetry: they describe topological phases of matter in physics, and they give us quantum invariants of knots and 3-dimensional surfaces.  We are currently seeing the emergence of new mathematical objects which encode ""enriched"" quantum symmetry, which describe interfaces between 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional quantum systems. At this time, we have several competing formalisms. This project aims to unify these notions and produce exotic examples through classification. The educational component of this project includes undergraduate research and Summer schools on subfactors and quantum symmetry at the Ohio State University.  The project will incorporate the principal investigators current learning materials and those developed for these programs into a book on subfactor theory.  He will also collaborate with the STEAM Factory at Ohio State University to enhance general scientific and mathematical literacy in the community.<br/><br/>This project has two main focuses: the representation and the classification of these new enriched quantum symmetries. Unitary fusion categories have objects whose dimensions are not necessarily integers, so representing unitary fusion categories requires von Neumann factors, whose modules have a notion of continuous dimension.  In this project the principal investigator will use his previous experience in the classification of small index subfactors to classify quantum symmetries enriched in small unitary ribbon categories. This will study an enriched operator algebra theory to develop an enriched subfactor theory. The principal investigator will also develop the theory of bicommutant categories, which are a higher categorical analog of von Neumann algebras originally due to Henriques. These bicommutant categories have important connections to conformal field theory, and they are expected to be an important tool in the classification of enriched quantum symmetries."

Initially, the tools in the field were optimized for the case when the fundamental components of these objects are linear:  The Fourier Transform decomposes a signal (such as a sound) as a superposition of constant-frequency waves (notes); the X-ray transform is a way of understanding the density of a body by passing (straight line) beams of radiation through the body and measuring the strength of the beam emitted on the other side.  In recent years, however, it has become increasingly apparent that harmonic analysis tools are also useful and important in situations where curvature plays a role.  As an example, the Schrödinger equation describes the time evolution of a quantum system, and recent advances toward understanding solutions to this equation were facilitated by the fifty-year-old realization that all of the Fourier data of a solution to the Schrödinger equation lies on a parabolic object.  Curvature has a localizing effect:  since the waves all propagate in different directions, their superposition can only be large in a small region of spacetime; by contrast, if the Fourier data were to lie on a flat plane, the superposition would be constant in directions perpendicular to that plane.  Other physical signals may have Fourier data constrained to different surfaces, and one aspect of the project is to precisely quantify the localization of these signals, in a way that depends only on the curvature of the underlying object.  As another example, operators that average signals over curved surfaces arise in a variety of contexts, including three-dimensional geometric optics.  Whereas averages over translates of a fixed plane are inherently unstable in directions perpendicular to the plane, averages over curved surfaces smooth out the original signal in all directions.  The project will precisely quantify the degree of smoothing for surfaces that may have some curved parts and some flat parts.  Finally, in recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in inverse problems wherein an attempt is made to characterize extreme cases consisting of mathematical signals for which the decay and smoothing effects described above are very weak; part of the project is to study some basic questions in this direction.  These inverse problems are connected with potential applications in engineering, physics, and medical imaging.  These scientific endeavors are inextricably linked with the investigator's efforts to help train the next generation of mathematicians.  This workforce development encompasses three main directions:  advising Ph.D. students in mathematics, creating summer research opportunities for undergraduate students, and organizing a series of symposia that foster interactions among mathematicians at all levels. <br/> <br/>During the past five decades, an important theme in harmonic analysis has been problems wherein the curvature of some underlying manifold causes operators to behave better than expected.  The main part of this project considers Fourier restriction and averaging operators associated to manifolds with varying curvature.  Curvature causes these operators to behave better than would be predicted by simply counting the dimension of the manifold, and the chief goal of the activity is to prove uniform bounds for these operators by equipping the manifold with a measure that gives small weight to regions where the curvature is small.   These curvature-independent bounds are essentially the strongest possible for the operators considered.  Moreover, these results would precisely quantify the role of curvature in the associated operators.  The investigator will also work toward a characterization of functions that saturate the Lebesgue space inequalities for certain operators of this type.  As an integral part of this project, the investigator will work to train junior mathematicians by serving as a dissertation advisor, by mentoring undergraduate researchers, and by organizing symposia that will include mathematicians at all levels."

Operator algebras is an area of mathematics that emerged from the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics discovered by Heisenberg and further developed by von Neumann.

They are organized in various algebraic structures, called operator algebras, that can realized as linear operators acting on Hilbert spaces. The passage from functions to matrices often involves a process of quantization/deformation in which geometric structures are discretized in such a way that important topological spatial relations are distilled in the form of numerical invariants. The principal investigator will explore the theory of such deformations in the larger context of operator algebras. The goal is to exhibit and study new classes of algebraic and geometric structures which admit special deformations into finite matrices that capture subtle topological properties.

The purpose of this project is to improve the mathematical and scientific understanding of those equations via A) concrete research projects aimed at studying the long-time behavior of solutions to such equations, and B) an educational component aimed at introducing such problems to a new and diverse generation of mathematicians. The main focus is on the study of the so-called ""non-equilibrium behavior"" of nonlinear dispersive equations. Such a behavior is exhibited in many physically important phenomena, like turbulence in ocean waves or in the transmission of optical signals, to mention only a couple. While this turbulence is easy to observe and has very strong manifestations in nature, its scientific understanding is rather poor and the mathematical justification of the involved phenomena based on the model equations is rather difficult and is mostly still open. This project is aimed at rigorously proving turbulence phenomenon for certain nonlinear dispersive models.<br/><br/>The most important feature of the long-time behavior of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations (PDE) on compact domains is out-of-equilibrium behavior or long-time instability. This means that solutions do not exhibit long-time stability near equilibriums solutions or configurations. Such questions can be addressed from a dynamical systems perspective and from a statistical physics perspective, in what is often called in the physics literature as ""wave turbulence theory"". The proposed projects address this broad problematic from both perspectives. In terms of dynamics, the aim is to construct solutions exhibiting the so-called ""energy cascade"" phenomenon, in which the energy of a dispersive system moves its concentration zone between characteristically different length scales. On the statistical physics perspective, projects aimed at justifying the fundamental equations of wave turbulence are proposed. These are effective equations for the dynamics that are derived in the physics literature from heuristic considerations, and have very important implications on the long-time behavior of dispersive PDE, provided they are rigorously justified. The project also includes an educational component aimed at raising the interest of a younger generation of researchers in those fundamental problems through workshops, seminars, REU projects, etc."

Other examples include the modeling of water moving through a porous rock, or the physical properties of composite materials. The derivation of large-scale, ""averaged"" laws from complicated small-scale irregularities and interactions lies in the realm of statistical physics. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical tools for a rigorous understanding of such problems under the assumption that the small-scale irregularities are occurring randomly. We would like to answer such questions as: How can the large-scale physical law, including the proportionality constants, be accurately predicted from the behavior of the small-scale interactions? What is the error in the large-scale law, in other words, what length scale is large enough that we observe the averaged behavior rather than seeing the complicated random fluctuations? Such questions are not just important to statistical physics and probability, but they also have wider applications, such as to the design of optimal composite materials or the construction of geothermal power plants. <br/><br/>Partial differential equations are used to model many important physical systems, and the focus of the project is to understand the large-scale behavior of solutions to such equations under the assumption that the coefficients exhibit small-scale random oscillations. Obtaining an ""averaged"" partial differential equation that describes the large-scale behavior of the original, more complicated equation is called ""homogenization"" in the mathematical literature. If randomness is incorporated in the model, it is usually referred to as ""stochastic homogenization."" In recent years, researchers have developed a rather complete quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization for the simplest situation: uniformly elliptic equations. These equations model electrostatic properties of composite materials, for instance. The present project aims to go further by obtaining a quantitative theory of homogenization for ""degenerate"" equations as well as equations in porous media. Particular goals include rigorously justifying the Darcy-Brinkman law for fluid flow in a porous rock with quantitative error bounds; deriving the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of particles in a fluid; obtaining bounds for the diffusivity of a particle moving randomly on a percolation cluster as well as more precise estimates for the long-time behavior (intermediate asymptotics) of a diffusion in a random medium; the analysis of boundary layers in periodic and stochastic homogenization; and obtaining homogenization results for shape optimization problems.

The standard approach to studying these problems uses methods from partial differential equations and differential geometry. The PI will study these problems using techniques from the theory of non-positively curved metric spaces. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory, where metric space techniques applied to group theory have lead to many important results. By using metric spaces techniques in several complex variables, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems.

The equations considered have deep connections with a host of other areas of mathematics, including the calculus of variations, differential games, dynamical systems, geometry, homogenization theory, inverse problems, and optimal control theory. The main goal of the project is to discover new underlying principles and general methods to understand the properties of solutions of the differential equations under investigation. One of the key objects of the research is homogenization theory, in which the models (say, of physical or social phenomena) are set in heterogeneous media and have many parameters varying on a small scale. If one zooms out and looks at the macroscopic scale, one often sees a simple effective (averaging) behavior. To make practical use of the models, it is extremely important to understand deeply the qualitative and quantitative aspects of this effective behavior.<br/><br/>The project has two overarching themes: (i) going beyond mere well-posedness in order to understand fine properties of both the limiting process and the effective equation in homogenization theory (e.g., shape of the effective Hamiltonian, optimal rate of convergence), and (ii) advancing knowledge of the duality method and fully nonlinear elliptic equations (e.g., representation formulas of solutions, the vanishing discount problem, regularity). The principal investigator and his collaborators have recently developed new approaches in these (and related) topical areas, approaches that have already provided solutions to some open problems. These methods are expected to be developed further in this project, thereby bringing fresh perspectives on and insights into the field of viscosity solutions."

In this project, more general, non-smooth, functions that are defined on geometric objects (metric spaces) that may be very different from the real line will be investigated. These geometries may be abstract objects with no reasonable embedding into any Euclidean geometry, or they may be fractal, or they may otherwise admit complicated behavior at all scales. Far from being a technical curiosity, non-smooth analysis and geometry have now become important tools in many areas of pure and applied mathematics and computer science, where non-Euclidean geometries may arise.  For example, from discrete groups or dynamical systems, as limits of smooth objects, as large data sets, or in computational problems.<br/><br/>In more precise terms, the goal of this project is to study the relationship between, on the one hand, the infinitesimal and global geometry of non-smooth spaces and, on the other hand, the analysis of Lipschitz and related classes of mappings defined on these spaces. One specific goal is to further understand the spaces which allow for differentiation of real-valued Lipschitz functions (in the sense of Cheeger): what topological and geometric properties can such spaces possess, and can we construct new examples? Another goal is to understand rigidity theorems for Lipschitz mappings and rectifiable curves in metric spaces. For example, when must Lipschitz mappings between metric spaces have more rigid (e.g., bi-Lipschitz) behavior on large subsets of their domains? Can we characterize rectifiable curves in metric spaces via local flatness conditions, as in the ""Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem"" of Jones in the plane? Understanding these questions involves combining techniques from classical geometric measure theory with those of the newer field of ""analysis on metric spaces"".  Analytic investigations like these have also provided, and should continue to provide, insights into the geometry of the non-smooth."

Partial differential equations provide a rigorous mathematical description of many important physical, ecological, and economical theories (e.g., Einstein's theory of general relativity, the Black-Scholes model of option pricing in finance). They are studied both analytically and numerically in order to determine the long-term behavior of solutions and their dependence on initial data. In many cases, physically meaningful concepts, such as energy, mass, and momentum, play important roles, since having good control of these quantities may enable one to prove that solutions exist globally in time and to study their behavior. However, it is of great interest to study equations (called energy-supercritical) for which such quantities are insufficient to govern the solution. This class of highly nonlinear equations includes many famous and important ones that arise from modeling physical phenomena (e.g., Einstein's equations, the Navier-Stokes equation, the Yang-Mills equations, and Euler's equations).<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to understand, as far as possible, the behavior of ""large"" solutions to wave equations of supercrticial type, about which little is currently known. The principal investigator's potential contribution to the subject is based on two methods: (1) splitting solutions into incoming and outgoing parts and (2) a comparison principle for the wave equation. His preliminary results apply only to some (canonical) model cases, but seem promising. It will be interesting to generalize them to the nonradial case, to all dimensions, and to other types of nonlinearities and equations. One objective of the project is to take techniques (comparison principles, sub- and supersolutions) specific to the study of elliptic and parabolic equations and apply them in a meaningful way to the supercritical wave equation. The author's approach is different from those of Kenig and Merle and of others (Tao, Krieger and Schlag, Li, Wang and Yu). It leads to unconditional results and to sharp scattering criteria in several cases. Another avenue of investigation is that of linear and nonlinear evolution equations driven by time-dependent potentials. The potential can be deterministic or random (e.g., Brownian motion). This has clear applications to the study of soliton stability and some physical problems. The methods that the principal investigator has introduced, such as a structure formula for wave operators and the use of an abstract Wiener theorem to prove dispersive estimates, provide an improved way of looking at such equations, by allowing a more general time dependence of the potential, and permit stronger conclusions to be reached."

The settings for these problems involve objects known as geometric manifolds of dimension two or greater.  Associated to a given manifold are fundamental objects called its eigenfunctions.  These are the fundamental modes of vibration of the manifold, and they are the higher-dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions for the circle.  Designers of musical instruments are well aware that the shape of, say, a drum or the soundboard of stringed instrument affects the basic tones that it omits.  Similar phenomena arise for manifolds, and the principal investigator wishes to study precisely how their shapes, such as how they are curved, affect the resulting eigenfunctions.  Just as in music, one particularly expects different shapes and geometries to become more apparent in the behavior of the fundamental modes of vibration as the frequency becomes larger and larger.  These eigenfunctions are solutions of a differential equation that is similar to the wave equation, and the project will also study similar problems involving it.  The general theme is to study how solutions of wave equations are affected by their physical backgrounds, such as whether or not black holes are present or whether the background becomes very close to a vacuum near infinity.<br/><br/>Among the specific problems the principal investigator will study, he seeks to obtain improved estimates that measure the size and concentration of eigenfunctions.  In order to do this he will develop what he calls ""global harmonic analysis,"" which is a mixture of classical harmonic analysis, microlocal analysis, and techniques from geometry.  The basic estimates that one has in mind are estimates for eigenfunctions and quasimodes, and related highly localized estimates that are sensitive to concentration.  The main questions center around how the geometry and the global dynamics of the geodesic flow affect the estimates and the kinds of functions that saturate them.  The latter issue is closely related to the much-studied (but still not well-understood) questions of concentration, oscillation, and size properties of modes and quasimodes in spectral asymptotics.  These questions are also naturally linked to the long-time properties of the solution operator for the wave equation and resolvent estimates coming from the metric Laplacian.  The principal investigator is also interested in understanding the harmonic analysis and spectral theory of operators that arise from boundary traces."

For example, one may be interested in determining the general properties of a porous material, or predicting the evolution of a substance traveling through a heterogeneous medium. Such phenomena are typically modeled by partial differential equations that depend on microscopic length-scales describing the heterogeneities. Homogenization is the process of approximating such detailed equations with smoother, macroscopic models. The principal investigator will focus on the subject of so-called stochastic homogenization, in which the microscopic effects are randomly distributed. Such models are significant for developing a robust framework to represent ""typical"" physical settings that are subject to uncertainty. Generally speaking, the study of homogenization combines tools from several different areas of mathematics, including analysis, partial differential equations, dynamical systems, and probability theory. The principal investigator is committed to using collaborative approaches to the project. This flexible perspective promotes a unified understanding of the physical phenomena, as well as enhancing the theory of the relevant equations. <br/><br/>The principal investigator will focus her efforts on two main classes of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations: (a) non-divergence-form equations, which describe general diffusion processes and are frequently used in the study of stochastic control theory and geometry; and (b) reaction-diffusion equations, solutions of which represent front-like evolution and serve as the primary mathematical models in chemical kinetics, combustion, and biology. The research will encompass proposes a variety of sub-projects that are motivated by the following two objectives: (1) to show that homogenization is applicable to a broader class of partial differential equations than previously expected; and (2) to obtain more specific information about the process of homogenization than is currently known, such as error estimates or properties of the effective behavior. Questions posed initially in stochastic homogenization typically have equivalent formulations in probability theory. Consequently, the research may lead to progress in the study of random walks in random environments, first passage percolation, and large deviation principles."

This project concerns a powerful technique, called deformation-rigidity theory, to study these opposing phenomena in the framework of von Neumann algebras, i.e., algebras of infinite matrices, where the product of two elements, A times B, may be different from the product in reverse order, B times A, a fact that reflects the laws of quantum mechanics in particle physics (Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle). Von Neumann algebras are also related to group theory and ergodic theory, since transformations of spaces give rise to a special class of such algebras called II1 factors. Rigidity in this context occurs when the group of transformations can be recognized by merely knowing its associated II1 factor (which is a very coarse object). The study of rigidity of factors is an interdisciplinary endeavor and can be relevant to many areas of mathematics. It also has applications to computer science, complexity theory, design computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes. This research project aims to deepen understanding in this important area.<br/><br/>The principal investigator recently added several new tools to this study, namely an approximation/simulation technique, a representation theory, and a cohomology. In this project, he intends to combine all these tools to further study rigidity-versus-randomness phenomena in II1 factors and to tackle several famous problems in this area: the Connes Approximate Embedding (CAE) conjecture, the sofic group problem, the free group factor problem, the paving problem, and calculations of invariants for group-like objects. It should be noted that the CAE conjecture, which predicts that II1 factors can be ""simulated"" on a computer, would have striking consequences in quantum information theory."

Its problems have a number of applications in adjacent fields. Several classical problems of UP, posed decades ago by such prominent mathematicians as Norman Levinson, Andrei Kolmogorov and Norbert Wiener, remain open. Some of such problems are studied in this project. Modern methods of Complex and Harmonic Analysis that appeared in the last 30 years suggest new approaches to the classical challenges of UP.

Though ubiquitous, wave equations are far from understood. The goal of this project is to understand how the dynamics of waves change in the face of interference with themselves or with their environment. The research seeks to learn when and why some waves disperse, while other waves persist, and still others collapse. Knowing how waves behave in critical conditions drives technological progress -- smaller microchips, faster data transmission, and deeper insights into the formation of the universe. <br/><br/>This project will study dynamical properties of solutions to nonlinear wave and dispersive equations in geometric settings where the nonlinear structure is intimately tied to classical geometric notions such as curvature. Such equations arise in a myriad of physical models, ranging from Einstein's equations of general relativity, to the interactions of particles in nuclear physics. Particular examples of interest include the wave maps systems, the Yang-Mills system, semilinear versions of Skyrme's equation, and power-type nonlinear wave and Schrodinger equations. In many of these problems, solitons (coherent solitary waves) are thought to be the basic building blocks of global-in-time dynamics: as the solution evolves, it decomposes into a finite number of weakly interacting solitons plus a remainder term exhibiting linear dynamics. This is a loose formulation of the soliton resolution conjecture, which is of central importance in the field. Progress towards the proof of soliton resolution is the underlying motivation of several of the specific problems to be addressed in this project. The dynamics of solitons are also fundamental to singularity formation, often playing the role of the universal profiles for singularities that form via a concentration of mass or energy. The project will study the fine mechanics of singularity formation, and will seek to characterize the possible dynamical properties of the solution from the profile of the energy that has radiated away from the point of concentration. <br/>"

A nonlocal interaction can be illustrated by its contrast to a local interaction in a simplified picture of a population of agents (say, people) interacting across a shared network.  A local model is one in which people can share information only with their immediate neighbors, whereas a nonlocal model is one in which they can share information more broadly, possibly across an entire network, and do so instantly.  This simplified picture actually manifests itself in many situations in which a nonlocal paradigm is more fruitful than a local one, and the inclusion of nonlocal interactions often fundamentally changes the underlying mathematics that describe aspects such as the propagation of information.  This project aims to improve the study of such phenomena through the introduction of new mathematical tools.  Along the way, this project will support the mentoring of graduate students and undergraduates through involvement in research on these topics. It will also create new graduate course material that provides a more unified approach to nonlocal tools of use in treating certain current topics in data science.  <br/><br/>In the realm of mathematics surrounding nonlocal problems, there has been a surge of activity during the past twenty years.  Experts have found themselves addressing questions in roughly two categories: (1) What properties of nonlocal equations should be studied for the sake of nonlocality itself; and (2) what properties of nonlocal equations should be studied for the sake of integrating them with other fields?  In this project the principal investigators focus on the second type of question.  They aim to develop nonlocal tools that can be applied to some classical problems that are not, at first glance, necessarily nonlocal, including questions about oscillatory boundary-layer phenomena for elliptic equations and free-boundary problems of one or two phases. The key point is that there are powerful tools in the nonlocal world that could shed new light upon or produce new results for some of these equations that were not approached from this perspective earlier. Such tools include, but are not limited to, the fast growing regularity theory for nonlocal equations and theory of weak solutions for nonlocal equations (still in its infancy).  Through representation techniques for general (nonlinear) operators that enjoy a global comparison principle, the principal investigators hope to bridge the gap between some aspects of these previously disjoint classes of equations and to use this ""nonlocal"" bridge as a pathway to new discoveries."

The common mathematical structures that thread the various aspects of this project together are called quantum symmetries. Quantum symmetry can be thought of as an enriched notion of symmetry, adapted to model the complex structures arising in nature. In practical contexts, mathematicians and scientists are interested in studying properties of a given system (e.g., a mechanical system, a molecule, or a population of organisms). Understanding the symmetries of such a system - transformations of the system that preserve the relevant structure - provides a wealth of insight into its properties. In many contexts, the symmetries that one encounters are described by mathematical structures called groups. However, for certain complex systems (particularly those connected to quantum mechanical phenomena, or operator algebra theory), groups are insufficient to describe the relevant symmetries that arise. This results in the need for a more general mathematical notion of symmetry, and led to the concept of a quantum group. Quantum groups were formally introduced in the 1980's as a tool to study certain types of non-classical symmetries arising in statistical physics. Since that time, quantum groups (and related notions of quantum symmetry) have proved to have remarkable applications in topology, quantum algebra, operator algebras, quantum probability, quantum information theory, and the classification of topological phases of matter. By exploiting the quantum symmetries appearing in various mathematical and physical systems, this project aims to provide new insights into challenging problems in both operator algebra theory and quantum information theory.<br/><br/>This project is divided into three components. The first part concerns the structural theory of von Neumman algebras associated to a class of discrete quantum groups, called orthogonal free quantum groups. The principle aim here is to use recent exciting developments in free probability theory and geometric quantum group theory to solve a conjecture which states that these von Neumann algebras can never be isomorphic to free group factors. The second part of this project concerns the structure of a class of von Neumann algebras, called the q-deformed Araki-Woods algebras. The PI will use certain asymptotic distributional symmetries for these algebras to investigate finite dimensional approximation properties and algebraic indecomposability results. The third and final part of this project proposes completely new applications of quantum symmetries in quantum information theory (QIT). The PI will investigate a new method for constructing examples of quantum channels using representation categories of quantum groups. Applications of these new quantum channels to various relevant questions in QIT will be investigated."

A group of 36 research mathematicians will be brought together to discuss problems in dynamical systems, focused mainly on problems related to symbolic dynamics. There will be three extended mini-courses on exciting new research presented by three well-known experts in this field. In addition, sixteen other 30 minute talks will be presented by conference participants. Participants will include graduate students, postdocs as well as more senior researchers. The organizer will conduct a one hour ""problem session"" in which participants pose open problems in the area to stimulate discussion throughout the conference. The goal of the meeting is to bring together researchers working in different, but closely related, fields to disseminate results and initiate new lines of inquiry. As with the successful 2014 Pingree conference, the meeting participants will include a heavy proportion of young researchers who, through the mini-courses, can both learn foundational material and be brought up to speed on new developments. The Pingree Park Campus provides an ideal environment for interaction and thoughtful investigation, fostering research and development in this broad area of research. <br/> <br/>The main topic of this meeting will be group actions on zero-dimensional spaces, but related fields in dynamics will also be represented. The conference will revolve around three mini-courses, given by experts on the main topics of the meeting. Much recent activity on symbolic dynamics of general group actions centers on some unexpected connections to computability theory and algorithmic complexity. Emmanuel Jeandel is a world-renowned researcher in this area and his mini-course should provide a useful introduction, and describe current fertile directions for research. For Z-actions, symbolic dynamics is a standard tool for modeling more general systems, but similar techniques for more general group actions are still not well-understood. Anthony Quas and Ayse Sahin have done significant work of this sort, including a multidimensional version of Rokhlin's Lemma and hypotheses guaranteeing existence of Markov partitions for multidimensional systems. At least one of their minicourses will pertain to some of this work, and that the other may relate to some of their other excellent work, such as Sahin's work on actions of the Heisenberg group or Quas's work on relative maximal entropy."

Few differential equations can be solved explicitly, and approximate numerical solutions do not always give essential features of the behavior of exact solutions. A class of simple differential equations that frequently occur in applications has been studied by mathematicians for centuries; their solutions are called special functions of mathematical physics, and they are widely used in science. The general goal of this project is to extend this class of well-understood equations. Building on earlier work relevant for applications to physics, control theory, and materials science, this project aims to apply a variety of recently-developed methods to study longstanding questions of intrinsic mathematical interest. The work is anticipated to further improve understanding of the qualitative features of analytic functions defined by some basic differential equations arising in mathematical physics and geometry.<br/><br/>Most of the special functions of mathematical physics are defined by linear differential equations with at most three singularities. Solutions of the Heun equation (with four regular singularities) and the Painlevé VI equation (non-linear, with four fixed singularities and no movable singularities) lie on the boundary of the class of special functions. Because of their intrinsic mathematical interest and numerous applications in science, they have been extensively studied since the beginning of the 20th century. This research project aims to advance understanding of these important functions through the use of new geometric methods. The main topics of this project are the qualitative study of real solutions of the Painlevé VI equation, the study of Riemannian metrics of constant positive curvature with conic singularities, with the emphasis on the metrics with four singularities closely related to the Heun equation, and finally the study of the eigenvalues of some parity-time symmetric anharmonic oscillators."

Since composition of two linear maps depends on which of the maps acts first, this is a noncommutative mathematics setting where noncommutative analogues of basic mathematical theories are being developed. The principal investigator will work in two directions involving Hilbert space operators, following recent realizations in his research. On one hand the exploration of invariant properties of n-tuples of operators under certain types of perturbations leads to the study of the rings of operators which almost commute in a certain sense with the n-tuple. Connections to operator theory questions as well as to noncommutative geometry in the sense of Alain Connes are appearing. The second direction is in the area of free probability, the most noncommutative among noncommutative probability settings. Free probability, which was initiated by the principal investigator, has important connections to random matrices, combinatorics and to operator algebras. Via the random matrix connection, there are applications to certain models in physics and to models of multiuser communication systems. Recently the principal investigator found that free probability has an extension to a so-called bifree probability theory, which is a fast developing new area, with many open problems and which will also be part of the free probability problems studied.     <br/><br/>In more detail, the principal investigator will explore on one hand commutants modulo normed ideals of operators, smaller than the ideal of compact operators, which constitute a new operator algebra framework for the study of normed ideal perturbations of operators and on the other hand the bifree extension of free probability, to systems with noncommuting left and right variables. The operator theory questions involve obstructions to quasicentral approximate units relative to a normed ideal with diverse relations to almost normal operators, entropy and supramenable groups. The commutants modulo normed ideals are Banach algebras with involution of operators on Hilbert space, which have unexpectedly many relations to C*-algebras, like in the appearance of C*-algebras which are coronas of non-C*-Banach-algebras.  The K-theory aspects of these algebras are also of interest, for instance they provide a new angle on results about invariance of absolutely continuous spectra under perturbations . On the side of free probability and of its bifree extension the emphasis will be on the analysis, while other researchers emphasize the combinatorics. Trace-class commutators of hermitian operators appear both in questions about commutants modulo normed ideals and in free and bifree probability, with the possibility of being a point where the two subjects meet. The principal investigator expects to attract young mathematicians to research in areas of his investigations and in particular to continue organizing conferences and seminars about free probability, which has many connections to other fields in mathematics and provides good training for young mathematicians."

Such inverse problems in potential theory have a rich history, but the mathematical tools needed to properly answer this question, especially in the case when the operator relating the force field to the mass distribution of the body is sensitive to long-range interactions, are currently underdeveloped.  In this project, the principal investigator will develop tools to further understand this problem, concentrating especially on what can be said if one knows only that the field has bounded magnitude.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project primarily concerns the relationship between the geometry of a measure and the regularity of an associated differential or singular integral operator.  This is is a question that has attracted mathematicians ever since the Cauchy and Riesz transforms were introduced as tools to study the behavior of analytic and harmonic functions, respectively.  An integrated approach to such problems is proposed that goes through the study of reflectionless measures.  This approach has recently yielded several new results and could potentially address a number of open problems, especially those concerning the smoothness of the support of a measure that has a bounded Riesz transform.  Here new tools in quantitative geometry and higher order partial differential equations need to be developed in order to make progress. Furthermore, the principal investigator seeks to build upon recent innovations in the theory of quasilinear differential equations to consider analogous problems for a wide range of nonlinear differential operators, where no integral representation is available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
