The objective<br/>is to generalize method used in previous work of Sverak and<br/>PI to construct counterexamples in lower target dimensions,<br/>as well as to understand regularity property of minimizers<br/>under further assumptions on the integrand. The second part<br/>deals with regularity property of minimizers for both<br/>compressible and incompressible models from nonlinear elasticity.<br/>The main feature here is the singular behavior of the integrand<br/>in the compressible case and nonlinear nonconvex constraint in<br/>the incompressible case. Currently there is no general method to<br/>deal with regularity problems for such integral. We hope that<br/>the simple model problems studied in this project can help to<br/>gain insight into more general cases. The third part addresses<br/>interfacial coarsening phenomenon observed in many energy-driven<br/>models from materials science. In particular, the aim is to provide<br/>rigorous analysis on the value of the coarsening exponent for different<br/>models. The analysis is closely related to deep and interesting issues<br/>in calculus of variations, e.g.gamma limit of singularly perturbed<br/>variational problems. The well developed tools from those areas provide a<br/>better vision on the last project.<br/><br/>   The questions to be studied are motivated both by classical theory of<br/>optimization and contemporary issues in nonlinear elasticity and materials<br/>science. An outstanding open question in continuum mechanics is to determine<br/>what singularities might exist in surfaces which optimize a collection of<br/>nonlinear constraints. Knowledge of this type can help in the design of<br/>exotic materials. The study of coarsening is important for both bulk and<br/>thin film materials. Such materials are of great practical interest. For<br/>example, superconducting thin film devices are presently being evaluated for<br/>possible use in high-performance microwave filters and other applications.<br/>"

Research of this type is<br/>fundamental in the understanding of many physical and geometrical problems.<br/>Many aspects of natural phenomena are related to each other by the natural<br/>laws governing them and very often these relations are mathematically<br/>described by differential or integral equations. The study of these equations<br/>is very important in understanding the related phenomena. It is often the case<br/>that to solve differential equations computationally with sufficient accuracy,<br/>the most effective and economical way is to exploit the properties of<br/>solutions of the equations and then to develop algorithms in accordance.<br/>Besides being very useful in applied science, the study of various kinds of<br/>structures and properties of solutions to various types of equations<br/>invariably leads to new research endeavors.<br/><br/><br/>In particular, the PI's will continue the development of a class of very<br/>powerful techniques, namely the Method of Moving Planes for both differential<br/>and integral equations or systems, to the calssification and quantization of<br/>solutions to various fundamental systems of equations, to the study of local<br/>asymptotic symmetry of singular solutions and a priori estimates of solutions.<br/>The PI will also continue the joint work with W.

In part 1,<br/>the PI plans to continue his study on analytic issues of calculus<br/>of variations in L-infinity consisting of the relation between absolute<br/>minimizers of L-infinity functionals and viscosity solutions of their<br/>Aronsson-Euler equations which are fully nonlinear degenerate pdes,<br/>and uniqueness of viscosity of Aronsson-Euler equations. In part 2,<br/>based on his recent works on uniqueness of viscosity solutions to<br/>the subelliptic infinity-Laplace equation on Carnot groups, the PI<br/>aims to establish the comparison principle for fully nonlinear<br/>subelliptic pdes including subelliptic Isaas-Bellman<br/>equations and horizontal Hessian equations on Carnot-Caratheodory spaces.<br/>In part 3, the PI plans to further study partial regularity of<br/>stationary biharmonic maps such as the optimal size and possible<br/>structures of the singular set of biharmonic maps and the heat flow<br/>of biharmonic maps in four dimension and its applications.<br/>In part 4, the PI plans to continue his study on weak<br/>sequential compactness and energy quantization of harmonic maps<br/>and the heat flows of harmonic maps.<br/><br/>The proposed problems lie in the field of nonlinear pdes which<br/>provide basic laws and play crucial roles in studying problems<br/>from analysis, geometry, applied sciences. Variational problems of<br/>supernorm are not only mathematically important but also of<br/>great practical interests. There are many problems from control<br/>mechanisms, risk managements in operation research, extreme value<br/>engineering where one must design for the worst case<br/>(e.g. determine a control to minimize the cost functional which is the<br/>maximum of a function). On the other hand, since supremum norm<br/>functionals lack strong differentiability and their associated pdes<br/>are degenerate fully nonlinear equations, many new techniques must be<br/>developed for the study. Underlying many physical phenomena is a least<br/>energy principle where certain configurations or geometric shape are<br/>distinguished by having less energy or area than competing objects.<br/>The nonlinear target constraints often lead to singularities. For example,<br/>domain walls in magnetized materials, point, curve, and surface<br/>defects in various liquid crystal materials, and vortices in<br/>superconductivity. We need to develop new mathematical structures<br/>and theories in order to explain and predict such phenomena. The<br/>proposed study on harmonic maps and biharmonic maps is certainly<br/>motivated by these considerations. The research findings in these<br/>directions shall be very important to our knowledge of second (or higher)<br/>order nonlinear elliptic systems with borderline nonlinearities<br/>and many potential applications as well.<br/>"

One of the central problems is to determine when such a measure is absolutely continuous. A closely related line of research is concerned with topological properties of attractors, in particular, self-similar and self-affine sets. Especially challenging are the systems that are<br/>not uniformly contracting and those which have a substantial<br/>``overlap.'' On the ergodic theory side, the project deals with<br/>substitution and tiling dynamical systems without discrete spectrum,<br/>as well as with algebraic coding of toral automorphisms. The<br/>so-called non-Pisot case is of particular interest to us, where<br/>it is proposed to use some variants of the beta-transformation defined on self-affine sets.<br/><br/>To play the ``Chaos Game'' on the plane, one should specify a family of<br/>planar tranformations (called an iterated function system)<br/>and iteratively apply one of them at random, with prescribed<br/>probabilities. Under certain technical conditions (called<br/>``contracting-on-average'') the emerging picture will almost surely<br/>``converge'' to a set called the attractor of the iterated function<br/>system. This is a popular method to draw fractals on the computer screen, but it is more than a game: iterated functions are widely used in signal processing, image compression, and simulation algorithms,<br/>as well as in mathematical dynamical systems theory.<br/>The picture that we see on a computer screen is actually a greytone image, which is an approximation of a measure,<br/>or probability distribution. An important problem is to decide when this distribution has a density.  A related line of research<br/>is to classify the ``zoo'' of fractal objects which arise in the course<br/>of the Chaos Game. The second part of the project is concerned with<br/>another class of objects which can be obtained by iteration:<br/>infinite substitutive sequences and self-similar tilings. Now the<br/>iteration procedure involves replacing each symbol<br/>by a block of symbols, or each tile by a patch of tiles.<br/>The limiting object is then used to create a fascinating<br/>dynamical system which we study. Apart from their intrinsic beauty,<br/>such systems have found applications in physics.<br/><br/>"

The seminar already had three previous successful editions <br/>in 2001, 2002, and 2003. The scientific activities taking place at the <br/>seminar are extremely stimulating and will certain generate further <br/>advances in mathematical research in harmonic analysis and related <br/>areas. The next meeting will be held in November 2004 in Lawrence. The <br/>main speaker is Stephen Waniger. He will lecture about discrete <br/>problems in harmonic analysis. These are problems whose solution <br/>require the use of methods from analytic number theory and relate to <br/>the study of operators acting on functions defined on the n-dimensional <br/>integers or discrete subgroups of homogeneous groups. The other two <br/>invited speakers will be Loukas Grafakos who will describe results <br/>about maximal multipliers and Akos Magyar who will present some Ramsey <br/>type results on lattice points. All the topics are of current interest <br/>in harmonic analysis and address important difficult problems in the <br/>area.<br/><br/>     This annual conference is of extreme importance in the geographical <br/>area and it is quickly becoming a tradition with national and even <br/>international reputation. The seminar is structured so as to keep costs <br/>for the host university and participants to a minimum, allowing a wide <br/>range of mathematicians to attend. The main speakers chosen are at the <br/>forefront of their field, giving all in attendance the opportunity to <br/>learn of their recent work. Equally important is that the conference <br/>will allow the participating graduate and postdoctoral students to give <br/>contributed talks, thus increasing their visibility and awareness of <br/>their work in the mathematical community. This is of crucial relevance <br/>in the education of graduate students as well as for those who have <br/>recently obtained their Ph.D. The first three editions of the <br/>conference attracted a number of researchers from small universities <br/>throughout the region, in addition to those attending from major <br/>research institutions. A number of participants are faculty from small <br/>universities and colleges in the geographical area. Many of these <br/>faculty maintain research careers in spite of geographical isolation <br/>and welcome the rare opportunity to meet with other mathematicians. <br/>Strong connections with these small universities and colleges are <br/>mutually beneficial, as these schools produce many excellent <br/>undergraduate students that can be attracted to graduate education in <br/>mathematics and sciences.<br/>"

A recently discovered formula<br/>expressing the volume of projections in terms of the Fourier transform<br/>of the curvature function, has led to Fourier analytic proofs of<br/>several results on projections, including the characterization of projection bodies in terms of sections of the polar body, and the<br/>Fourier analytic solution to Shephard's problem (asking whether symmetric convex bodies with smaller projections necessarily have smaller volume) surprisingly similar to that of the Busemann-Petty problem (a section counterpart of the Shephard problem). <br/>The similarities in the Fourier analytic proofs of these results<br/>indicate in particular that there must exist deep dual connections between volumes of projections and sections of convex bodies.<br/>To achieve progress in obtaining the Fourier analytic description of this duality phenomena, the PI plans  to find extremal projections of certain classes of bodies, to undertake a further study of the projection and intersection bodies, to obtain results concerning non-central sections, and to construct a nonsmooth projection body<br/>whose polar is also a projection body in higher dimensions.<br/><br/>Convexity is a very old topic which can be traced at very least to Archimedes. It is still in favor due to its numerous applications to linear programming, tomography, medicine, and it is  a surprise that <br/>Fourier analytic methods have been applied to the subject only very recently. These methods can serve as an additional source of ideas, coming to both  fields, convex geometry and harmonic analysis, and will find new applications. At the same time, convexity is an extremely simple and natural notion. Interesting in itself, it also illustrates some facts about mathematics, facts that are more or less classical, but always important to realize, so it is a perfect field for undergraduates. First of all, questions or problems arise that are very simple to formulate and understand, so students do not need to take several classes before approaching the material.<br/>Secondly, intuition is sometimes misleading in ``obvious problems'', and the undergraduate feels the beauty of the subject. Many problems can be solved by fairly elementary means, but on the other hand, answers to many problems are still unknown or have been found recently,<br/>often using different techniques from other parts of mathematics.<br/>Therefore, it is a perfect field for research projects for more senior students and all people dealing with exact sciences.<br/><br/>"

In a different, but <br/>related, direction, maximal abelian subalgebras (masas) and general <br/>subalgebras of von Neumann algebras will be studied. In joint work, the <br/>proposer has introduced the concept of strongly singular masas, and has <br/>shown that many finite factors arising from hyperbolic groups (a class <br/>which includes the free groups) have such masas. The results so far <br/>obtained indicate that the theory can now expand to study general <br/>subalgebras.

By proving existence and robustness of random invariant manifolds and foliations, results on structural stability of deterministic systems under random perturbations will be sought. Floquet theory containing the multiplicative ergodic theorem will be developed, statistical properties of random attractors, and pattern formation in random media will be explored. The theory of smooth conjugacy for finite dimensional random dynamical systems will also be developed.<br/>The broader impacts of this project include the training of graduate students and junior faculty members in this emerging area of dynamics. Applications to the many fields mentioned above will create opportunities to interact on many levels with students and faculty members from other disciplines and will lead to advances in technology. One such example are the possible applications to the study of  nano-devices, for instance, random thermal fluctuations or quantum effects must be accounted for in order to accurately predict performance.

This is a very restrictive assumption, and it is interesting to understand to what extent properties of such maps can be deduced from other topological, combinatorial, algebraic, set-theoretic, or analytic assumptions. An example is determining the conformal type of surfaces, namely, whether a surface is conformally equivalent to to a model surface. In the higher dimensional case, biholomorphic equivalence is used in place of conformal equivalence. Some specific topics that the PI proposes to study are: surfaces whose conformal type is determined by combinatorial properties of the associated net, a question raised by EB Vinberg, and two topics related to questions raised by L. Rubel, namely, maximal growth functions that have finitely many critical and asymptotic values, and the study of complex manifolds whose biholomorphic type can be recovered from the knowledge of associated semigroups of analytic endomorphisms and the semiconjugation of analytic functions.. These questions have possible applications in several branches of Mathematics. <br/><br/>While these questions fall squarely within the framework of Geometric Function Theory. This subject has its roots in applications to the natural sciences and engineering.  Particular examples are Conformal Field Theory and Statistical Mechanics. In the latter subject, Percolation Theory uses heavily the concept of conformal invariance and its generalizations, to which this proposal is partly dedicated.<br/><br/>"

The goal of the first project is to obtain construction of characteristic classes for the important class of noncommutative spaces, arising naturally in the contexts of discrete group actions on manifolds and foliations. The approach is based on the recently developed by A. Connes and H. Moscovici theory of cyclic cohomology of Hopf  algebras. The goal of the second project (joint work with R. Nest and A. Uribe) is to obtain index theorem for algebras of Fourier integral operators, and study applications of these results.  The third project (joint work with J.

Noncommutative geometry is a field of mathematics situated on the crossroads between analysis, geometry, and mathematical physics. Discovery of quantum mechanics has shown that the classical principles of geometry are not applicable to the world of microscopic particles. Noncommutative geometry unifies geometry with analysis for the solution of the problems of quantum mechanics.

The recent Riemann-Hilbert approach by Percy Deift, Xin Zhou and others to orthogonal polynomials has produced solutions to long- standing problems related to random matrices, which in turn find applications in combinatorics and statistical physics.

This research project involves a number of areas of mathematics, including operator algebras, finite fields, number theory, and combinatorics.  In contrast to semigroups of automorphisms, a semigroup of endomorphisms may be viewed as a dynamical system that may proceed forward but not backward in time.  It is remarkable how challenging this subject has proven to be in light of the relatively simpler theory of one-parameter semigroups of automorphisms on a type I factor.  A principal goal of this proposal is to make additional progress in the classification of one-parameter semigroups of unital endomorphisms, analogous to Wigner's characterization of groups of automorphisms acting on factors of type I.     <br/><br/> The study of operator algebras traces its origins back to the work of von Neumann and others.  Their goal was to construct mathematical models that capture the behavior of quantum mechanical systems, and to use these models to make predictions about the time evolution of such systems.  As knowledge has grown and techniques in the field have been refined, connections have been established between operator algebras and a number of other areas of mathematics and science.  This proposal involves connections among the fields of operator algebras, commutative algebra, number theory, and combinatorics.  The principal objects of study in this project are known as binary shifts on a certain type of operator algebra and are defined using bitstreams of 0's and 1's such as one studies in the theory of linear recurring sequences.  A major goal of this project is to complete  the classification of the binary shifts and to relate this classification to the analysis of linear recurring sequences.  Binary shifts will also be studied for their potential applications to the theory of quantum dynamical systems, specifically those systems that may proceed forward, but not backward, in time.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

This question is not suficiently understood even for two dimensional surfaces lying in Euclidean three space. There is a direct link from the parametrization problem to the problem of understanding what measurable structures in Euclidean space are locally standard in that they arise as pullbacks of the standard structure by a homeomorphism. This latter question can be asked both in bi-Lipschitz and quasiconformal categories. To that end, the PI propose new integrability conditions for overdetermined systems that may be solvable in a nontraditional sense by geometric methods. Closely related also is the nonlinear problem of recognizing Jacobian determinants of quasiconformal transformations in Euclidean space.

One can think for example of the wake of an <br/>airfoil as a typical problem<br/>of this type. This problem can be described by the incompressible Euler <br/>equations, where<br/>the initial vorticity is ideally a finite Radon measure supported on a <br/>curve. The issue is to determine<br/>the evolution of this curve. A further assumption that the vortex sheet <br/>remains a<br/>curve at a later time leads to the Birkhoff-Rott equation. The PI's <br/>initial study<br/>shows that a vortex sheet<br/>in general can not be a curve of reasonable regularity. On the other <br/>hand, Delort's result shows that vortex sheet<br/>fits as a weak solution of the Euler equation (for initially <br/>non-negative vorticity). However weak<br/>solutions seem to be a class too big to describe the<br/>specific nature  of the vortex sheet evolution. The proposed research <br/>focuses on further pin point the<br/>nature of the vortex sheet evolution, through studying similarity <br/>spiral solutions, understanding the viscosity effects and<br/>the evolution of vortex layers.<br/><br/>Water wave is one of our most familiar experiences in daily life.  A <br/>mathematical description<br/>is the incompressible, irrotational Euler equation, defined in the <br/>moving water domain. Study of  water<br/>wave can be traced back to more than 150 years, in which the PI <br/>recently established<br/>  the well-posedness of the problem locally in time, that is, the wave <br/>will evolute<br/>without breaking for a finite time period, from<br/>any initially non-self intersecting wave surface. The proposed research <br/>focuses on the large time behavior:<br/>the global existence of smooth solutions, the wave breaking-- the <br/>mechanisms that cause the<br/>wave breaking and breaking profiles. The proposal is to initiate from <br/>existing theories on limit equations.<br/>Through comparisons of the full water wave equation with the limit <br/>equations, the<br/>PI aims at developing enough<br/>machinery and understanding<br/>that lead to further research with greater generality.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research will further our understanding of the nature <br/>phenomena such as the water wave<br/>motion and wave breaking,  the mixing of fluids, separation of boundary <br/>layers, generation of<br/>sounds and coherent structures<br/>in turbulence models.

It turns out that the category of maps with the same geometric and function theoretic properties of analytic functions are the mappings of bounded distortion, also called quasiregular mappings, or, if injective, quasiconformal mappings. Both kind of mappings solve uniformly elliptic partial differential equations in the plane. Moreover, these mappings preserve the natural Sobolev spaces which arise in the study of function theory and partial differential equations on subdomains of Euclidean n-space.<br/><br/>In recent years there has been another well-known theory of mappings whose ideas have gotten to the core of geometry and analysis, non-linear elasticity theory.  The mappings which naturally occur there<br/>are not always quasiregular, but the governing  partial<br/>differential equations are the same. This forces us to move from the<br/>classical setting of uniformly elliptic partial differential equations to degenerate elliptic equations.   Usually, however, some control of the ellipticity bounds will be necessary to achieve concrete results. These often take the form of integral estimates in some Lebesgue or Sobolev spaces. This is the theory of mappings of finite distortion.<br/><br/>In this proposal we focus mainly on mappings of finite distortion between subsets of the Euclidean n-space. We also emphasize the fundamental role of the Jacobian determinant, which already has led to<br/>a very productive study of mappings of finite distortion. The PI<br/>studies together with  Haj\l asz, Iwaniec and Mal\'y, the Jacobian<br/>determinant  (the pullback of the Riemannian volume forms) of<br/>mappings between Riemannian n-manifolds. This study makes it<br/>possible to discover new phenomena about such mappings. Also in<br/>this proposal, we investigate the Hardy-Littlewood maximal<br/>operators on Sobolev spaces, one of the most important tools in<br/>analysis.<br/><br/><br/>Geometric function theory has been quite a successful theory, with<br/>many diverse applications. The theory of non-linear elasticity for<br/>example was based on practical problems from mathematics and<br/>physics. It is necessary to study non-linear equations to<br/>understand certain physical phenomena such as bifurcation and<br/>phase transition. Our main motivation in the theory of mappings of<br/>finite distortion is to examine degenerate elliptic equations<br/>where important applications lie.<br/><br/>"

The project brings together ideas from harmonic analysis (Littlewood-Paley theory, multi-resolution analysis, wavelets) and theoretical physics (renormalization, thermodynamic formalism) to analyze the regularity and scaling properties of critical objects.  The importance of critical functions is due to the fact that they serve as models of critical phenomena like transition to turbulence and phase transitions, provide ""barriers"" between regular and chaotic behavior of physical systems, etc.   The critical objects that the investigator and his collaborators plan to study are conjugacies between (critical) circle maps, critical invariant circles of area-preserving maps, and boundaries of Siegel disks. The objectives of the project are the following:  (A) Mathematical techniques for computation of global regularity of functions developed by the PI and collaborators will be applied to a wide variety of problems of scientific interest.  (B) Recent results in theory of wavelets, as well as existing methods, will be implemented to investigate numerically the local regularity of critical functions, and the scaling properties of the associated invariant measures.  (C) Accurate Fourier and wavelet spectra will be computed, and their structure will be analyzed by utilizing techniques from harmonic analysis and renormalization methods.<br/><br/>The proposed research will supply accurate empirical data that will provide physicists with better understanding of critical phenomena and will pose challenging problems for pure mathematicians.  In the long term, developing, implementing, and testing new numerical methods will provide researchers with robust tools for numerical studies of regularity and scaling properties, which are important in many areas of science and engineering (in particular, in atmospheric science, geophysics, signal processing, data network traffic).  It will motivate new research in the theory of critical functions and self-similar measures -- a central problem of modern theory of dynamical systems.  This activity will provide research opportunities for students majoring in different branches of science and engineering.  Since the project is highly interdisciplinary, it will train students not only for academic, but also for other scientific applications, and will stimulate contacts between students and scientists in different areas."

The plan is to extend<br/>to these dynamical systems certain important results available for compact <br/>billiards, including a suitable version of Pesin's Theory. This will require <br/>the rewriting of some notions of ergodic theory for the case of a <br/>non-probability measure. Part II concerns random billiards; more precisely, <br/>billiards with a random table (changing after each collision), a quenched <br/>random table (selected once and for all from a random ensemble), or a random <br/>law of reflection (in a fixed table). In the first two cases there is a <br/>physical invariant measure, and the PI will study its ergodic properties <br/>(including Lyapunov exponents and the like) for a typical realization of the <br/>random process. In the third case an equilibrium measure can be shown to <br/>exist, and its asymptotic properties will be investigated, together with the <br/>natural question of the stochastic stability at the zero-noise limit. <br/>Similar perturbative questions are considered for the other systems as well. <br/>Part III, in the realm of equilibrium statistical mechanics, considers the <br/>question of quantum large deviations. In a collaborative project, the PI <br/>sets out to initiate a theory of large deviations for a noncommutative <br/>quasi-local algebra on a d-dimensional lattice.

By now, a fairly general <br/>understanding of symmetry of positive solutions has been achieved for <br/>second order elliptic equations on both bounded and unbounded domains, <br/>and for parabolic equations on bounded domains. For nonautonomous <br/>parabolic equations on unbounded domains the symmetry problem has not <br/>been addressed so far.  This problem is more intriguing; standard <br/>methods used in earlier symmetry results do not give desired <br/>conclusions. Exponential separation, associated with the principal <br/>Floquet bundle of linearized parabolic equations, is among new <br/>techniques  that can facilitate the analysis. The principal Floquet <br/>bundle is an interesting topic in its own right. It is a natural <br/>extension of the concept of principal eigenfunction of elliptic <br/>operators to nonautonomous parabolic operators which has already proved <br/>very useful in the study  of nonlinear equations. Both its basic <br/>properties and applications are to be further investigated. A better <br/>understanding is needed to make this tool applicable to problems on <br/>unbounded domains, however, ideas related to this concept have already <br/>triggered progress in the symmetry problem.  The next topic, large-time <br/>behavior, includes  in particular a basic question on the semilinear <br/>heat equation, as to whether all bounded solutions on multidimensional <br/>domains converge to an equilibrium. This has been already been answered <br/>(negatively) for spatially inhomogeneous equations.  For homogeneous <br/>equations, this long standing open problem will require new ideas. <br/>Competition-diffusion systems that are to be considered in the project <br/>have their origins in ecology. Bifurcations of steady states, their <br/>stability  and as complete as possible an understanding of global <br/>dynamics is expected to shed light on coexistence of species (of <br/>phenotypes) with different dispersal rates. While a large class of <br/>semilinear systems has already been successfully treated, more realistic <br/>quasilinear systems call for a new approach.<br/><br/>In less technical terms, the  project can be characterized as <br/>qualitative or geometric analysis  of solutions of  nonlinear evoution <br/>equations, such as  reaction-diffusion equations. As a rule, such  <br/>nonlinear equations can ""never be solved"". Letting aside exact solutions <br/>which are very rarely available, approximate methods, even with the <br/>presently available computation power, can seldom provide answers to <br/>questions of global nature, for example, questions on the behavior of <br/>solutions on infinite time intervals or collective behavior of solutions <br/>(structural stability). Yet, for the internal development of the theory <br/>of PDEs as well as for improvement of their modeling relevance in other <br/>sciences, such questions are important to ask and answer. For this <br/>purpose, many  methods of qualitative analysis of nonlinear PDEs have <br/>been developed, mainly in the last 2-3 decades. The present project <br/>relies on these methods, combining classical PDE techniques with <br/>dynamical systems ideas, and, at the same time, attempts at development <br/>of new techniques. Among  main objectives of the project is the <br/>description of the large time behavior of the solutions. Spatial <br/>profiles (symmetries) and temporal behavior (asymptotic periodicity, <br/>stabilization to equilibria) will both be examined.  <br/><br/>"

Using<br/>variational approach and techniques in classical analysis, Professor Ni<br/>and his collaborators have established the spike-layer steady states for<br/>an activator-inhibitor system in morphogenesis proposed by Gierer and<br/>Meinhardt based on the celebrated idea - diffusion-driven instability - of<br/>Turing in 1952. The method exploits the gap between the diffusion rates<br/>for the two chemical substances, and stability results in one space<br/>dimension have also been obtained. Very recently, progress has been made<br/>for concentration phenomena on multi-dimensional subsets. However, the<br/>complete dynamics is still far from being fully understood. It has been<br/>noted that the gap between the diffusion rates alone is insufficient to<br/>create patterns. Thus, the notion of ""cross-diffusion,"" introduced by<br/>theoretical biologists in 1979 in modeling segregation phenomena in<br/>population dynamics, deserves systematic studies. Cross-diffusion systems,<br/>which have also been used in recent years to model singular phenomena<br/>including dendritic growth of bacteria colonies, are both nonlinear and<br/>strongly-coupled in highest order terms, thus are mathematically very<br/>challenging. Professor Ni and his collaborators propose to study the<br/>effects of cross-diffusion by first obtain necessary and sufficient<br/>conditions for cross-diffusion to help create patterns, and then to<br/>investigate their qualitative behavior as well as their stability<br/>properties.<br/><br/>(II) Non-technical Descriptions:<br/><br/>Professor Ni plans to continue his research in understanding, in a<br/>mathematically rigorous manner, the phenomena and effects of various<br/>diffusion-related mechanisms and hopefully thereby to have some impact in<br/>both improving our ability in modeling more complicated and/or realistic<br/>phenomena in applied sciences, as well as in creating new and significant<br/>mathematics. In this proposal, from the viewpoint of pattern formation,<br/>Professor Ni intends to investigate the various ""concentration phenomena""<br/>in diffusion and/or cross-diffusion systems.

These include the problem of characterization of probability distributions satisfying dimension free concentration properties and related Sobolev-type inequalities, the KLS-conjecture on the dominating role of linear functionals with respect to logarithmically concave measures, the problem of existence and asymptotic normality of typical distributions in randomized models of summation. The PI also plans to address new aspects of the concentration phenomenon of product measures under additional symmetry hypotheses. As closely related, part of this activity is devoted to finite dimensional de Finetti representations for permutation invariant probability measures on product spaces and their applications to quantifying the rate of dependence of elements in long finite exchangeable sequences. A separate part is devoted to analysis of random walks on discrete structures and focuses on developing techniques based on suitable modified forms of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. <br/> The study of concentration phenomena is motivated, in particular, by classical problems of probability and statistics about general global properties of smooth functionals of stochastic processes. Concentration tools are also of great importance in asymptotic convex geometry where one explores the role of the dimension of high-dimensional convex objects. This area of research has become rather rich and proved to be useful due to the universal character of applications; on the other hand, it has accumulated a number of fundamental open questions attracting many investigators. The proposed research is aimed to push forward the study of multidimensional phenomena and to explore their connections with important effects related to the weak dependence in a broad sense. <br/>"

The subject has significant connections with algebra, coding theory and matrix theory and it has strong roots in probability and ergodic theory, as one of the basic objects (topological Markov chain or shift of finite type) is the topological support of a Markov chain and a major tool for application of the thermodynamic formalism. There remain basic open problems at the heart of the subject as well as new frontiers. The project is concerned with problems of both sorts, to be addressed with algebraic, analytic and ergodic theoretic tools, as is demanded by the nature of the subject.  At the core of the subject is the open problem of classifying shifts of finite type; the ideas involved in the rejection of Williams' longstanding shift equivalence conjecture leave this problem perhaps less intractable than before. Related to this is a set of classification problems for various symbolic dynamical systems.  At the heart of this proposal is work within ""Positive K-theory"", a setting for both solving these problems and restructuring the foundations of the subject. Classification is recast as equivalence of matrices over various rings under multiplication by chains of elementary matrices subject to positivity conditions.  Symbolic dynamics is a dynamical tool by way of symbolic extensions of given dynamical systems. There is now a general entropy theory of symbolic extensions, and the proposed research would provide a still deeper understanding of the possible symbolic extensions of a system. The proposal also aims to progress on certain problems involving Zd symbolic actions; the classification of finite state Markov chains up to good finitary isomorphism; the classification of positively recurrent countable state Markov chains up to entropy-negligible conjugacy; and the classification of toral endomorphisms up to measurable isomorphism.  The proposed research is to be done in the context of education, primarily of graduate students but also undergraduates. A vehicle for this has been the ""research interaction team"" of the P.I., meeting in the academic year once or twice weekly since September 2002.

What is common to these spaces is that they are probability spaces; the points (or states) of such a space are linked into classes which one calls ""orbits"" and these orbits have a large-scale geometric or combinatorial structure. This structure could be the structure of the orbit of a countable or continuous group action or could be the structure of a binary tree of inverse images of some finite to one endomorphism. This structure could take the form of a topology or more strongly a metric on the orbits or could be a tree or graph structure with the states as nodes of the graph.  The PI has developed a range of methods to investigate large-scale statistical properties on such spaces of orbits and to study notions of equivalence of these structures that allow for distortion or rearrangement of the orbits.  The goal of this study is to extend these methods to as broad a perspective as possible and to apply them to answer interesting and significant questions.  These methods have a significant history. They have allowed one to extend the Ornstein Isomorphism theory for Bernoulli automorphisms to endomorphisms (joint work with C. Hoffman) and give a tool for lifting large parts of the theory of actions of Z to actions of general discrete amenable groups (joint work with B. Weiss) via an orbit transference method.   This proposal suggests an array of natural directions to proceed. The generalization to trees of inverse images of endomorphisms can be pushed to a  study of trees or graphs in general and various geometric notions of similarity of such trees. Recent work indicates ways to effectively generalize to non-singular and even singular dynamics. One can also generalize both the labeling space and the index space to be continua, leading to a study of Brownian motion as the continuous analogue of a uniform endomorphism.  Work to date, and the work proposed will continue to advance our understanding of measurable dynamics and of measurable orbit structures more generally. Such structures are common in mathematics and other hard sciences.<br/><br/>Ergodic theory and measurable dynamics have their roots in thermodynamics, celestial mechanics, probability theory, and functional analysis. They have applications within mathematics to algebra, combinatorics, and number theory geometry, probability and statistics. Outside of mathematics, there are applications in physics, chemistry, electrical engineering and genetics.  The training of graduate students is central to this proposal as well. The PI, the Department and the University of Maryland have demonstrated a strong commitment to diversity and to the proper training and mentoring of students.<br/>1<br/><br/>"

One project focuses on the wave equation on singular spaces;<br/>together with Melrose, the PI has shown that in general, a singularity of<br/>a solution to the wave equation interacts with a cone point to produce a<br/>""diffracted"" spherical wavefront emanating from the cone point.  The<br/>singularity of the diffracted front may be weaker than that of the<br/>incident front if the latter is not too precisely focused on the cone<br/>point.  Melrose and the PI hope to generalize these results to more<br/>complex singular geometries, perhaps eventually to include a large class<br/>of stratified spaces.  Another direction of research involves the<br/>Schroedinger equation on noncompact manifold endowed with ""scattering""<br/>metrics (e.g. short-range perturbations of Euclidean spaces).  Together<br/>with Hassell and Tao, the PI is involved in a project to prove sharp<br/>Strichartz estimates for the Schroedinger equation in this geometric<br/>setting.  Hassell and the PI also hope to provide a precise description of<br/>the propagator for the Schroedinger equation, extending an earlier result<br/>which yielded part of its Schwartz kernel.<br/><br/>A central question in the mathematical theory of quantum mechanics is:  <br/>what is the relationship between the classical dynamics of a particle and<br/>its corresponding quantum states?  Insights into this problem have come<br/>not only from the direct study of the quantum mechanical energy operator<br/>or ""Hamiltonian"" itself, but also from studying a host of other<br/>fundamental equations involving it, such as the heat equation, the wave<br/>equation, and, naturally, the time-dependent Schroedinger equation.  The<br/>focus of the PI's research is thus the geometric analysis of several kinds<br/>of partial differential equations.  One project investigates what happens<br/>to waves as they interact with (a certain generalization of) sharp<br/>corners---the geometry of how wavefronts move can be quite subtle in these<br/>cases owing to the effects of diffraction.  Another project is to study<br/>the structure of solutions of the Schroedinger equation on unbounded<br/>spaces; such solutions describe the time-evolution of a quantum particle.  <br/>A related focus of research is to obtain certain estimates of solutions to<br/>the Schroedinger equation in order to improve our understanding the<br/>nonlinear Schroedinger equation, which arises in nonlinear optics and the<br/>theory of Bose-Einstein condensates, among other physical applications.<br/>"

The work in  (1) uses an important result of Wolff in the theory of Fourier-analytic estimates associated to the light cone. Possible areas of application include (a) multipliers related to space curves, (b) generalizations of local smoothing to special classes of Fourier integral operators, (c) local smoothing of maximal averages associated with space curves, and (d) Hausdorff dimension of Kakeya-type sets. The projects in (2) deal with special cases of degenerate oscillatory integrals and integral operators in high dimensions (larger than two) that are known to exhibit features absent in their two-dimensional counterparts. The analytic machinery is that developed by Phong and Stein for the two-dimensional case, but the results obtained are of a very different nature. A long-term goal here is to devise an analytically accessible method of resolution of singularities. Another part of this work concentrates on the double Hilbert transform along polynomial surfaces, following Carbery, Wainger and Wright.  The projects in (3) are part of an effort to understand the spectral theory of Schroedinger operators with matrix-valued potentials. This draws on earlier work of Guillope and Zworski, Laptev and Weidl, and Korotyaev.  <br/><br/>The following is a more nontechnical description of the projects outlined above, with a brief note about applicability in scientific disciplines. The projects in (1) may be viewed as a study of wave propagation in non-uniform media (as used in seismic imaging). ``Local smoothing'' quantifies the gain in regularity of the propagating wave viewed as a function of space-time compared with the same wave considered as a function of space alone for a fixed time. Offshoots of this problem have combinatorial flavors in terms of arrangements of circles in the plane, as pointed out by Wolff. The projects in (2) deal with integrals and integral operators which come up in solutions to partial differential equations, including fundamental ones like the heat equation, wave equation and Korteweg-deVries equation. An important feature of these integrals is the presence of a complex-valued exponential factor in the integrand. In the case under study, the exponent is typically a polynomial that vanishes to high degree at a point. The ``order of vanishing'' of the polynomial contributes to the rate of decay of the integrals. A main ingredient in the analysis of these objects is a technique from algebraic geometry known as resolution of singularities -- a systematic method for factorizing polynomials and studying their roots.  The spectral theory of Schroedinger operators, which is the basis for the projects in (3), is intimately related to quantum mechanics, which finds vast applications in physics and many disciplines of the engineering sciences. The current project is to understand the spectral properties of the Schroedinger operator in dimensions larger than one, and more specifically to count the number of resonances of such operators. Resonances are generalizations of the concept of bound states or eigenvalues, and have a physical significance in terms of exit times in electron motion. The interdisciplinary nature of these projects has proved an extremely rewarding research experience for the applicant."

The<br/>resulting structure bears some similarity to the classical theory<br/>of isomonodromy deformations of differential equations and<br/>degenerates to it in a certain limit. Second, we apply the<br/>isomonodromy transformations of difference equations to evaluation<br/>of the so-called gap probabilities in discrete probabilistic<br/>models of random-matrix type which arise in many different domains<br/>including combinatorics, representation theory, percolation<br/>theory, tiling models, etc.<br/><br/>The theory of isomonodromy deformations of ordinary differential<br/>equations with rational coefficients is a classical subject<br/>developed in the end of the XIXth -- beginning of the XXth century<br/>by Riemann, Schlesinger, Fuchs, and Garnier.

The idea of representing a general operator in a specialized class of operators as a part of a nice operator in the class has had many successes and we seek to develop this point of view with a primary focus on applications to problems in the theory of functions in one and several complex variables. A particular group of problems that we propose to attack involves the generalizations to several complex variables of some of the classical moment and interpolation problems on the unit disc such as the interpolation theorem of Nevanlinna and Pick and the moment theorems of Caratheodory and Herglotz. Another focus of our project will be the use of operator-theoretic methods to study function theory on analytic varieties. Research intrinsic to operator theory that we will undertake includes issues involving model theory in one variable on nonsimply connected domains in the plane and in several variables on domains other than the bidisc. This will include the continuation of our work on the symmetrized bidisc with a particular focus on applications to complex geometry and the mu-synthesis problem.<br/>Operator Theory, the particular type of mathematics that we are proposing to develop, has direct and concrete benefits for a number of areas of human endeavor. For example, the model theory aspects of our proposal all involve the generalization of the Commutant Lifting Structure which leads to an efficient algorithm for the discovery of oil from acoustical data taken on the surface of the earth. Other aspects would enrich the theory of Linear Matrix Inequalities. LMI 's, which currently are all the rage in several areas of engineering, are an extension of linear programming, a mathematics which has made possible not only the optimization of large scale resource allocation but the accurate prediction of economic markets as well. Finally, the particular branch of function theory we propose to study, forms the mathematical core of the H-infinity control theory, which has been used to design control systems for fusion reactions inside Tokamaks and feedback stabilization systems for the space shuttle.<br/>"

Other problems concerning the notion of ""partial unconditionality"" in normed spaces will also be the subject of this project.  These turn out to be related to some fascinating coding problems where one seemingly needs to predict the future in a nondeterministic way to solve the problem. Other problems will be attacked using certain machinery that meshes together the finite and infinite dimensional substructures of a Banach space (a normed linear space without holes).<br/><br/>(Non-technical description)<br/><br/>This project involves the study of the geometry of normed linear spaces. Ordinary three-dimensional space in which we live is an example of such an object.  Distance is measured ""as the crow flies"".  However other geometries and higher dimensions are necessary for applications.  A transmitted signal might be a sequence of 0's and 1's.  A corrupted signal might differ from the intended one in a number of places (0's become 1's or vice versa).  One can measure the degree of correctness of the corrupted signal by counting the number of errors.  This corresponds to a ""taxi-cab"" distance or geometry in n-dimensional space.  For example in 2-dimensional space we can measure distance by moving only E-W or N-S, i.e., along roads a taxi-cab could travel.  This project will study such alternate geometries using sophisticated tools of combinatorics and logic.<br/>Often, the goal is to discover nice substructures among seemingly random larger complicated geometries.<br/>"

This work is motivated in part by the<br/>discovery of aperiodic tilings, such as the Penrose tilings of the<br/>plane by the kite and dart polygons, tilings which can be understood<br/>as solutions of such a packing problem. The symmetries of aperiodic<br/>tilings have long been connected with the mathematics of ergodic<br/>theory, using either the translation group or the full congruence<br/>group of the space being tiled as the dynamics. The symmetry of the<br/>tilings has then been related to the conjugacy class of the associated<br/>dynamical system. Several questions are proposed here about the<br/>symmetry of packing problems, some directed at general qualitative<br/>behavior and some directed at important special cases. For instance,<br/>it is proposed to show that the symmetry of the densest packings of a<br/>hyperbolic space by spheres of fixed radius is different for different<br/>radii. (It is already known that for most radii the densest packings<br/>are aperiodic - they cannot have crystallographic symmetry.) And more<br/>generally it is proposed to show that a ""generic"" packing problem, in<br/>Euclidean or hyperbolic space, only has optimal solutions which are<br/>not crystallographic.<br/><br/>Anyone who has tried to squeeze as many pennies as possible onto a<br/>tabletop has seen that the most efficient arangement is also very<br/>symmetrical, with six pennies surrounding each.

Twenty years ago a new metallic alloy was discovered, a<br/>physical solution to a closely related optimization problem, and the<br/>alloy was found to possess a symmetry the nature of which is much less<br/>obvious, or, put another way, in which the mathematics of the symmetry<br/>is less well developed.

One of these new perspectives<br/>is the multilinear point of view that has significantly refined and enriched our classical approach of studying <br/>problems via the method of freezing variables. The basic idea in multilinear analysis is that linearly independent functional parameters are treated as linear variables,  allowing a higher degree  of freedom and greater flexibility, which often results  in a deeper and more far-reaching understanding.<br/>The principal investigator proposes to embark on an extensive  study of translation-invariant multilinear operators, both broad enough to cover most known examples, but also deep enough to include  special operators of a very singular nature. This proposal consists of three parts:  positive theory, negative results, and general theory. Proposed work on the positive theory includes extension of the range of boundedness of the  bilinear Hilbert transform and other multilinear rough singular <br/>integrals. Negative results focus on the disc multiplier outside the locally square integrable case, the bilinear Hilbert transform on products of integrable functions, as well as the Carleson-Hunt operator on spaces of nearly integrable functions and certain higher dimensional versions of all the previous operators.<br/>The proposed general theory will focus on topics concerning<br/>multilinear interpolation and extrapolation.<br/>These items provide important tools that simplify the   study of the subject.<br/><br/>The main goal of Fourier Analysis is to study complicated objects via decompositions into simpler pieces. Just as music  can be disassembled  into compositions of integral multiples of a simple basic frequency, complicated operators can be represented by their actions on a spectrum of frequencies. Fourier analysis provides the tools that relate special (time) and phasial (frequency) aspects  of the same function (signal).<br/>Irregularities of signals and images are better located once these are decomposed into small pieces and studied via Fourier analysis. For instance, noise and blurring are easily located with the application of the Fourier transform, but nowadays even more challenging feats can be achieved. In this investigation, certain operators are to be studied using decomposition techniques sensitive to<br/>both time and frequency considerations. Such operators are often defined by altering the frequency of input signals via  multiplication by a fixed and often nonsmooth function. In practice, the abrupt interruption of radio communication or television transmission by a meteorological phenomenon are examples of such operators.<br/>The protection against the loss of information can be<br/>mathematically modeled as the preservation of integrability and this is proposed to be investigated here.<br/><br/>"

Data is prescribed in Lebesgue spaces and Sobolev spaces defined on the boundary and taken on in the sense of pointwise nontangential limits.  The order of the differential equation is not restricted.  Polyhedral domains with manifold boundary provide examples of domains for which local continuous transverse vector fields do not exist; i.e. the boundary cannot be locally realized as the graph of a function in rectangular coordinates.  This is true in as low a dimension as n=3.  This fact poses difficulties in obtaining a priori energy estimates on the boundary (Rellich identities) especially for systems and higher order equations.  When such estimates can be obtained, existence can be shown for a closed subspace of data.  That the subspace is the entire Banach space of data uses a method of continuity that seems to require a combinatorial structure of the polyhedral boundary.  A theorem of E. E. Moise provides this structure in 4 dimensions, but examples in higher dimensions show its lack in general.  The PI proposes to find methods of computation to overcome this problem, among others.<br/><br/>Two standard examples of linear elliptic boundary value problems are (1) deriving the steady-state temperature distribution inside a solid body from knowledge of the distribution on the boundary (the data), and (2) deriving the systems of stresses, strains and displacements inside an elastic body from knowledge of the boundary's displacement or prescribed stresses at the boundary.  In 3-dimensional space there are naturally-occurring physical objects which take polyhedral form (crystal structures, for example).  In fact, it is reasonable to think that this occurs more frequently than taking shapes that are either infinitely smooth or as infinitely rough as a boundary surface described by a Lipschitz function.  That polyhedral domains can have boundaries not describable as graphs of functions is seen by placing one standard brick upon another in a crossed position.  The 2-dimensional surface locally about any one of the newly created vertices is not the graph of any function from any plane no matter how oriented.  This is a mild example and in general the 3-dimensional situation can be much worse.  The absence of this mathematical tool, the graph in rectangular coordinates, causes difficulties in obtaining the required estimates inside the domain and up to the boundary.  Abstract polyhedral structures in higher dimensions are present in linear programming, in modeling communications networks and economic systems.  The PI does not yet know if elliptic boundary value problems similar to the ones just described arise in any of these settings, but the motivating idea of boundary value theory, to deduce more information from a smaller amount, is certainly present. <br/>"

Muhly intends to use the invariants he has discovered for tensor algebras and their representations to analyze semigroups of completely positive maps and related structures. A particular focus will be ""continuous tensor algebras"" built from product systems. The second group (5 problems) concerns the theory and application of groupoids. First, Muhly proposes to use his recent collaborative work on the Brauer group of a groupoid to build a general cohomology theory that is based on the category of actions of a groupoid on spaces. The second two focus on the structure of operator algebras built from so-called Fell bundles over groupoids. These arise quite commonly ""in nature"" and a good portion of the effort will be devoted to specific examples. The fourth deals with aspects of operator algebras associated with topological quivers - graphs in which the vertex and edge spaces are topological spaces. The final problem concerns a generalization of the Brauer group that interacts with a variety of investigations of current interest.

Interdisciplinary activity with colleagues in physics, computer science and biology are likely. Discussions are already under way in Iowa's joint mathematical physics seminar and with colleagues in Biology.

We also plan to use quadratic differentials to solve the problem of determining the shape of droplets of perfectly conducting fluid that are held in equilibrium by electrostatic and pressure forces balanced against surface tension.  We plan to study several problems concerning harmonic measures. For example, we want to study the problem of finding the minimal ``damage'' to solutionsof the Laplace equation, when the original domain is damaged by inserting an obstacle from a given set. We also plan to use quadratic differential  techniques to continue work with R. Barnard to study R.

The second project is to explore the conformal<br/>Martin boundary for bounded domains in metric measure spaces of bounded geometry. The conformal Martin boundary is in general different from the classical Martin boundary corresponding to the Laplacian operator, and provides a more reliable gauge of the potential-theoretic boundary relevant to certain non-linear partial differential equations. The third project is to construct a distributional derivative structure on general metric spaces and thereby measure the boundary of domains and determine when spheres in such a metric space are rectifiable.<br/><br/>Potential applications of the research proposed in this project include connections between stochastic processes and analysis in abstract metric spaces.

In addition, these projects unify the theory of subelliptic equations of divergence form in Riemannian manifolds with the theory of degenerate elliptic equations in the sub-Riemannian geometry of Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces.

The research proceeds at multiple levels of abstraction.  It considers general factors of a representation class that guarantee or preclude such algorithms, it considers algorithms for specific common representation classes, and it finds algorithms for representation classes adapted to specific common (and diverse) applications, such as solutions of partial differential equations, image processing, and database query optimization.<br/><br/>Over the past ten years there has been a dramatic increase in data gathering mechanisms, as well as an ever-increasing demand for finer data analysis in applications that rely on scientific and geometric modeling.  Each day, literally millions of large data sets are generated in medical imaging, surveillance, and scientific acquisition. In addition, the internet has become a communication medium with vast capacity, generating massive traffic data sets.  The usefulness of these data sets rests on our ability to process them efficiently, whether it be for storage, transmission, visual display, fast on-line graphical query, correlation, or registration against data from other modalities.  The current state of the art in data processing is far from providing the efficient and faithful representations required in emerging applications.  With few exceptions, previous work has not provided algorithms whose efficiency or output quality, though typically validated experimentally, has been analyzed rigorously and thoroughly.  The investigators carry out fundamental mathematical and algorithmic research to significantly increase our capacity to process and manage large data sets.  The research makes significant mathematical progress in providing rigorous algorithmic results that are of great need in this field.  The research also makes significant improvements through highly efficient algorithms in the sizes of data sets that are analyzable and in the types of data processing tasks that can be carried out.

That is, there is a computable model $f^{comb}: X^{comb} \to X^{comb}$ and a homeomorphism $h: X^{comb} \to X$ conjugating $f^{comb}$ to $f$.  A recent new construction shows that for a very wide class of examples, one may take $X^{comb}$ to be the <br/>Boundary at infinity of a certain associated infinite Gromov hyperbolic one-complex and $f^{comb}$ to be a simplicial covering map from this complex to itself.  The construction is analogous to describing the action of a Kleinian group on its limit set via its action on the<br/>boundary of its Cayley graph.   Techniques from  geometric group theory imply the existence of a natural class of metrics on $X^{comb}$ such that the system becomes ``uniformly quasiregular'', i.e. iterates of $f^{comb}$<br/>distort the roundness of balls by at most a constant factor independent of scale and of iterate.   Succintly:  this process uniformizes $f: X \to X$ by providing a metric on $X$ for which $f$ is nearly conformal.   The PI proposes to apply this new point of view to the study of rational <br/>maps of the Riemann sphere to itself.  The PI will develop a unified framework with which to describe the dynamics of rational maps, Kleinian groups, and their natural generalizations.  The PI will  thereby (i)reinterpret Thurston's characterization of rational functions from this<br/>point of view; (ii) bring new methods into the study of dynamical systems; (iii) further the  development of the ``dictionary'' between rational maps and Kleinian groups, focusing on those aspects related to Cannon's conjecture and the regularity of the new metric; (iv) suggest<br/>new directions for the study of dynamical systems by formulating and developing a self-contained theory of uniformly quasiregular expanding dynamical systems, and (v) connect several areas of mathematics of current active interest, namely conformal dynamics, geometric group<br/>theory, geometric topology, and analysis on metric spaces.<br/><br/><br/>"

The central problem can be <br/>caricatured as follows:Given a distribution of iron mines throughout the <br/>countryside,  and a distribution of factories which require iron ore,  decide <br/>which mines should supply ore to each factory in order to minimize the total<br/>transportation costs.  Here the cost per ton of ore transported from the<br/>mine at x to factory at y is specified by a function c(x,y) --- so the <br/>problem can be formulated as a linear program.  However, when the mines and<br/>factories are distributed continuously throughout Euclidean space or<br/>a curved landscape with obstacles --- and the cost is related to the<br/>distance on this landscape, then the problem has a rich structure and<br/>deep connections to geometry and non-linear PDE which have only begun <br/>to be explored.  Incarnations of this problem embed in current models for<br/>surprisingly diverse phenomena.  Along with basic questions concerning <br/>the structure and qualitative features of optimal mappings, the proposed<br/>research addresses models for  front formation in the atmosphere, dissipative <br/>equilibration in kinetic theory, fluid flow, and granular materials and  <br/>geometric and dynamical inequalities.<br/><br/>After half a century of mathematical neglect, the past decade witnessed a <br/>revival of interest in optimal transportation,  and watched as it blossomed into <br/>a fertile field of investigation as well as a vibrant tool for exploring diverse <br/>applications within and beyond mathematics. The transformation occurred partly <br/>because long-standing issues could finally be resolved,  but also because <br/>unexpected connections were discovered which linked these questions to problems <br/>in physics, geometry, computer vision, partial differential equations, earth <br/>science and economics.  The time is ripe for a collaborative effort on an<br/>international scale to explore existing connections and unearth new ones, while <br/>simultaneously developing the basic theory of optimal maps and introducing <br/>students and colleagues to the challenges and promise of the field --- thus for <br/>the formation of a focused research group with these goals.  The core of our <br/>plan is to arrange sustained interactions between and around members of the <br/>group,  who in addition to collaborating scientifically, will work together over <br/>the next several years to create the research environment and manpower necessary <br/>for transportation research to flourish.  To achieve this goal, we plan to <br/>organize two workshops on different aspects of the subject.  Furthermore, we <br/>plan to share the responsibilities of training graduate students and <br/>postdoctoral fellows, by using funds from the grant to support young <br/>researchers.  This unique arrangement will give participants<br/>access to an unusually broad assortment of perspectives and expertise.<br/>Moreover,  we believe a  three-year nurturing window for young researchers to <br/>learn the subject and become involved --- if continued now --- will ultimately <br/>further advance progress in the field by more than a decade.<br/>"

It also ties in with current work by algebraic and analytic geometers on multiplier ideal sheaves. The third collection of problems concerns the so-called Density Property for complex manifolds, introduced by the PI in his PhD thesis and developed significantly since then.  The three directions are intimately related, and cannot be completely separated.<br/><br/>The main goal of the work on sampling and interpolation is to use the geometry of the space under consideration to determine the density of points needed to sample functions sufficiently so that they are faithfully stored in some digital incarnation.  Conversely, the reconstruction of the functions from their digital realization requires the use of sufficiently few points.  The geometric information that comes into consideration is the curvature of the metrics on the space. This idea was already considered by Einstein in his work on the General Theory of Relativity. The need to understand metrics rather well brings us in contact with the second circle of problems; here we consider certain metrics that arise naturally in problems of complex and CR geometry.  Finally, the ideas considered have a completely different nature when discussed on spaces with the density property.  These spaces, which are highly symmetric, have incredible flexibility properties, and enable one model to rather diverse dynamical phenomena, while still being able to use the complex structure to impose certain constraints on the results of the dynamics.<br/><br/>"

In several<br/>applications,  as in image processing, the wavelets shows up as the basic<br/>atoms used to approximate or represent the signal. If we have a symmetry<br/>group acting on the system, then we would like to write an arbitrary<br/>function as a sum of  functions that transforms in a simple and controllable<br/>way under the symmetry group, leading  to representation theory of<br/>the symmetry group.

He proposes the following four projects. Let g be a simple Lie algebra and let E be the exterior algebra on two copies of g. Then, under the adjoint action, E has three copies of g sitting in total degree two terms of E. Let A be the quotient algebra of E divided by the ideal generated by these three copies of g.  Motivated from Supersymmetric Gauge Theory, Cachazo-Douglas-Seiberg-Witten conjectured (and proved for classical g) that the bigraded algebra of invariants in A is generated by the unique invariant element of A of bidegree (1,1) subject to the only relation that its power by the dual Coxeter number is zero.  The aim of the first project undertaken by the PI jointly with Prof. P. Etingof from MIT is to prove this conjecture in full generality. They have come up with an interesting link between this conjecture and Cyclic Homology. The second project in collaboration with Prof. P. Belkale is motivated by the works of Klyachko, Fulton, Knutson-Tao, Berenstein-Sjamaar and Belkale related to the celebrated Horn's conjecture on the Hermitian eigen value problem and its generalization to any semisimple group.  The PI proposes to study the problem of deciding when three or more Schubert cycles in an arbitrary partial flag variety intersect nontrivially.  They have come up with two entirely different formulations of possible solution; one in terms of representation theory of the Levi component L of the parabolic, while the other is an inductive recipe (similar to Horn's inductive definition of his set of inequalities) which reduces the problem of deciding when three Schubert cycles intersect nontrivially to the corresponding problem for the group L and so on. Already some positive results have been obtained by them. The third project concerns proving a conjecture of V. Ginzburg on the ring of functions on the closure of the orbit of a principal nilpotent pair. By using Geometric Invariant Theory, the PI jointly with Prof. J. Thomsen from Arhus has reduced the conjecture to the study of orbit closure of the line passing through an `associated semisimple pair.' Moreover, they have made a considerable progress towards the determination of this closure. The fourth project in collaboration with Prof. C. Procesi from Rome deals with the cohomology algebra of Springer fibers. It is proposed to realize the equivariant cohomology of these varieties as the coordinate ring of an `explicit' affine variety and then obtain the singular (nonequivariant) cohomology by specialization. The problem of finding affine models for the equivariant cohomology of Springer fibers has already been solved by them for the case of special linear groups.<br/><br/>The proposed projects underline the theme of unity in mathematics as they are expected to derive ideas from several areas of mathematics including Topology, Algebraic Geometry, Representation Theory and Combinatorics. In addition, the first project owes its origins in Mathematical Physics and it is expected that its final solution will have to use ideas from Mathematical Physics in a crucial manner. All of these projects suggested by the PI represent some of the very difficult and important problems of current interest which, if solved, should also help clarify the results in the existing known cases. In addition, it is expected that the solutions will spawn a lot of activity in the area. The PI and his collaborators have considerable expertise in the techniques he is proposing to use and they have successfully used some of these techniques earlier in solving other problems. All the projects are in collaboration with other mathematicians from within USA and abroad.  The PI has recently written two books. These books should serve as a basic source for graduate students and professional mathematicians alike. The PI expects these books (both being the first in their areas) to become advanced graduate texts thus substantially promoting teaching and learning.  Currently, PI has one student Arzu Boysal working for her PhD. He has successfully supervised four PhD students earlier.<br/>"

A unifying principle is that most of the problems we study involve the global<br/>algebraic and geometric properties of rings of differential operators. The complex Weyl algebra A1<br/>(defined by the relation [p; q] = ih) is the prototypical example of such a ring which will be of special concern in the present project. It is perhaps the simplest and the most important example of a noncommutative algebra that finds applications in many areas of mathematics, physics and natural sciences. (For example, it plays a fundamental role in quantum mechanics underlying the famous Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.) His work so far has obtained essentially new results about this algebra. These mostly concern the structure of projective modules (ideals) and the automorphism group of A1. In the proposed research we intend to address still deeper questions about A1 and to give generalizations of our results, especially to higher dimensions. The mathematical results sought in the main part of the project are motivated by and applied to the theory of wave propagation which is one of the fundamental problems in classical mathematical physics. Of special interest (both from practical and theoretical point of view) is the question of when the waves may propagate without diffusion to allow the possibility of transmitting `clean-cut' (sharp) signals. Well studied in homogeneous spaces this question remains wide open in general. One of the goals of this project is to develop new mathematical tools and techniques to investigate this difficult problem in inhomogeneous and anisotropic media. The results sought in this direction are of fundamental interest and significance in mathematical theory of wave propagation and may have applications in related physical disciplines including the theory of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, space communication technologies, magnetohydrodynamics, crystal optics, etc. As a broader impact, it is expected that the interdisciplinary nature of this work will stimulate communication and collaboration between specialists in the various areas involved, as indeed this work so far has already begun to do. Moreover, several students, both graduate and undergraduate, as well as a postdoctoral fellow will collaborate in this work.<br/><br/>"

Analysis on fractals has been actively pursued in recent years. Quasiconformal mappings, an intermediate class between homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms, are natural candidates for deforming fractals. Mathematically, fractals appear as invariant sets of iterated function systems. This project provides conditions on the iterated function system under which these invariant sets are quasisymmetrically equivalent; conditions for extending such quasisymmetric homeomorphisms to global quasiconformal mappings; methods of lowering the Hausdorff dimension of self-similar fractals; and answers to related questions on more general sets. The PI, in collaboration with J. Tyson, has obtained conclusive results for Sierpinski gaskets, a special class of fractals. In nonlinear elasticity, solutions of p-Laplace equation minimize the total energy. When p is different from 2, due to the nonlinearity and degeneracy, the boundary behavior of solutions is still largely a mystery. In the late 80's, T. Wolff and J. Lewis produced unexpected examples showing, when p  was not equal to 2, solutions behave differently from the case when p= 2, i.e., Fatou's theorem fails. Recently the PI, in collaboration with R. Kaufman, incorporated probabilistic and discrete ideas into the research program, and made progress by showing that in the case of the half plane the boundary behavior is worse than previously known for certain values of p.The PI proposes to investigate the curious boundary behavior for the full range of p; to study properties of harmonic measure for the p-Laplacian on boundary of the half plane; and also to continue her work in the tree setting, where many of the probabilistic ideas originated.<br/><br/>As fractals appear everywhere in nature from ferns to galaxies, it is important to find out how two seemingly different fractals are related through transformations, and how the dimension of a fractal changes during the transformation. The success of the first part of proposal will<br/>answer some of these questions, which should be of interest to biologists, physicists and mathematicians. Many differential equations based on physical models are genuinely nonlinear; and finding explicit solutions is usually impossible. To learn the nature of the solutions, one relies on estimates from partial differential equations. In this project, ideas from discrete analysis and probability are brought in to handle some of the difficulties. The success of this project will provide new tools to study the boundary behavior of a large class of nonlinear partial differential equations and will have practical applications to nonlinear hydrodynamics, fluid flow, elasticity and dynamical systems. Moreover, some questions on trees and on fractals lead naturally to problems suitable for student research, which the PI plans to direct.<br/><br/>"

In this way, estimates in<br/>low dimension would have immediate consequences for bounds in higher<br/>dimensions.<br/>Secondly, the author plans to study Wegner estimates for the integrated<br/>density of states for singular random potentials.

One aim of this proposal is to<br/>find new tools to establish these kind of inequalities.<br/>Random Schr""odinger operators model the behaviour of electrons in disordered<br/>matter. It is a fact from every day life that highly disordered materials are bad<br/>conductors. In the last two decades, our mathematical understanding of this and<br/>related effects has grown rapidly.

An important a priori estimate for the spectral theory of random Schr""odinger<br/>operators are regularity results (i.e., smoothness) for the so-called density of states.<br/>Despite a lot of attention from several groups working in theory of random Schr""odinger<br/>operators, the regularity proofs are still mainly based on the old ideas of Wegner. They<br/>require strong nd mainly technical assumptions, excluding most physically relevant rough<br/>random potentials. Except for some very special cases, singular random potentials are still<br/>out of reach of the existing methods. So new ideas and, in particular, a better understand<br/>of the underlying physical mechanism will be required, in order to be able to establish the<br/>regularity results for rough random potentials.<br/>The third problem, embedded eigenvalues for a certain class of non self-adjoint matrix<br/>Schr""odinger operators, is motivated by the study of the non-linear Schr""odinger equation.<br/>By itself it is still a problem in linear functional analysis.

One example is a heavy ball interacting with light point-like atoms moving in a closed container (this is a classical model of Brownian motion). Another example is a heavy disk (a piston) moving back and forth in a cylinder filled with an ideal gas. The dynamics in these models is partially hyperbolic, which makes the application of the modern methods of ergodic theory possible. The PI plans to investigate the behavior of the heavy object (the ball or the piston) in the thermodynamical limit, as its mass grows to infinity, so that its trajectory converges to a di@usion process, which is either a Brownian motion, or an integral of Brownian motion, or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, or a variation thereof (depending on the details of the model). To prove the convergence, the PI will use the partial hyperbolicity and derive<br/>a fast decay of correlations and moment estimates for the relevant distribution functions.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposal derives from its applied character.

Thanks<br/>to the contributions by many mathematicians the theory of free<br/>boundaries has developed over the last decades to a very deep and<br/>beautiful part of mathematics.

The PI<br/>will study mainly inverse problems of recovering a Riemannian metric from<br/>boundary or inverse scattering data. The central problem is the boundary<br/>rigidity problem for Riemannian metrics (called also inverse kinematic<br/>problem),  where one has to recover a Riemannian metric in a bounded domain<br/>from the lengths of geodesics connecting every two boundary points. This<br/>problem is closely connected to the inverse problem of recovering a metric<br/>from the associated hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map on the<br/>boundary, and also to an associated inverse spectral problem. The PI plans<br/>to study the problem of generic uniqueness for simple metrics and stability<br/>estimates. Related problems in integral geometry will be studied, like the<br/>linearized problem: recovery of tensors from integrals along geodesics and<br/>stability estimates. The PI will also work on the elliptic anisotropic<br/>inverse boundary value problem, the inverse backscattering problem for the<br/>acoustic equation, and related inverse problems where one has to recover the<br/>coefficients of the principal symbol of the differential operator from<br/>boundary or scattering data. In the area of Resonance Theory, the proposer<br/>plans to study the location and asymptotic distribution of resonances for<br/>various systems. Both scattering systems and semi-classical Schroedinger<br/>type of equations  will be considered. Among the problems that will be<br/>studied are sharp upper bounds of the number of resonances in a disk or<br/>sector in the complex plane, upper and lower bounds connected with various<br/>characteristics of the trapped sets of the associated classical mechanics<br/>problem. Mathematical justification of numerical methods for computing<br/>resonances will be also considered. The properties of the scattering<br/>amplitude near resonances will be studied as well, which is related to the<br/>problem of observability of resonances. <br/><br/>Inverse Problems, and in particular the problems in this proposal, is a<br/>mathematical tool of great importance to other sciences. Applications are<br/>numerous: they are used in medicine for imaging the internal structure of a<br/>human body and for medical diagnostics, in non-destructive material testing,<br/>in geophysics for obtaining information about the inner structure of the<br/>earth from seismic waves, in oil exploration, etc. Riemannian metric models<br/>anisotropic media, where the speed of wave propagation may depend not only<br/>on the position but also on the direction. The boundary rigidity problem is<br/>of interest not only to scattering theory but also to Riemannian geometry,<br/>its linearized version is a problem of independent interest in integral<br/>geometry as a generalized Radon transform. Resonance Theory is part of<br/>Scattering Theory for quantum mechanical and wave equation type of systems<br/>in unbounded domains. Resonances are certain frequencies that can be<br/>observed in a variety of situations in Quantum Chemistry, Physics,<br/>Acoustics, etc. Besides being motivated by applications in other natural<br/>sciences, Resonance Theory uses tools from and encourages further<br/>development of mathematics areas as Microlocal Analysis, Dynamical Systems,<br/>and Geometry. <br/>"

Many important problems in complex and algebraic<br/>geometry concern the construction of holomorphic objects such as<br/>holomorphic sections of line bundles or maps between spaces.  It often<br/>happens that the construction problem simplifies as the degree of the<br/>line bundles or maps increases.  A classical example is the Kodaira<br/>embedding theorem, which says that there are enough sections of a high<br/>power of a positive line bundle to embed a Kahler manifold into<br/>projective space. Asymptotic results in general concern the properties<br/>of maps or sections of very high degree, where constructions often<br/>simplify. Effective results ask for the smallest power or degree where <br/>a desired effect takes place, e.g. the smallest power of a line bundle <br/>so that sections embed.  Many such results will be surveyed in our<br/>conference, with techniques ranging from partial differential equations<br/>to geometric and algebraic methods.<br/><br/>Our conference consists of seven days of lectures, with six to eight<br/>lectures a day. There will be lectures surveying past results and others which present new results.  The topics include complexity of<br/>zero-finding algorithms, moduli spaces, holomorphic maps, ground states<br/>of superconductors, and the vacuum selection problem in string theory.<br/>The lectures will expose the field to graduate students, postdoctoral<br/>researchers and junior faculty members, as well as to senior<br/>mathematicians.

The WCOAS has become a tradition among the operator algebraists in the western United States and Canada. The expected number of participants is approximately 40-50, including graduate students, postdocs, and faculty researchers coming from all over western North America. The seminar will feature several hour-long talks on current topics given by both established and younger researchers in the region and beyond. The intellectual merits of the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar are that (1) it is an opportunity for researchers to disseminate their own results; (2) it is an opportunity for researchers learn about recent research of others and to stay abreast of current work; (3) it fosters collaborative research by giving researchers the opportunity to meet and discuss their work with each other.  The broader impacts of WCOAS are that (1) it will encourage and nurture graduate students and postdocs by giving them the opportunity to present their own work, learn about recent work, and meet established researchers in operator algebras; (2) it creates a cohesive regional community of operator algebraists; (3) it fosters connections between the faculty and students at research universities and those at primarily undergraduate institutions.  The proposal is for partial support of the Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations that has met annually since 1981.  The primary objective of the meeting is to bring together graduate students, young investigators, and more senior researchers.  The program features plenary talks by eminent mathematicians, with parallel sessions of contributed papers by younger participants.  The funding will be used primarily for the travel support of graduate students and young PhDs.  <br/>"

Under the first heading are also found a number of problems pertaining to harmonic analysis on Fock spaces, the geometry of the unit ball of non-commutative analytic Toeplitz algebras generated by the left creation operators, interpo-lation sequences, and Fejer type inequalities in several variables. These results have po-tential applications to function theory in several complex variables, prediction and multi-variate stochastic processes. In recent years, there has been exciting progress in multi-variable interpolation. <br/>The PI will continue his work in this area of research and expects to find the maximal entropy solutions of several multivariable interpolation problems (Sarason, Caratheodory-Schur, Nevanlinna-Pick) including the abstract noncommutative commu-tant lifting theorem for row contractions.

The goal is to make significant progress towards a complete set of numerical invariants that classify large classes of completely positive maps.<br/><br/>Originated from the concept of quantization, operator theory links together several branches of mathematics and is closely related to mathematical physics. The motivation of this research is the recent worldwide interest in the noncommutative aspect of har-monic analysis and multivariable operator theory. The objective is to advance the under-standing of these relatively new areas of research and apply the results to the study of completely positive maps and their invariants, function theory and interpolation in several variables, multivariable linear systems and control theory, and prediction and stochastic processes.

The PI is interested in the free boundary<br/>problems with nonlocal structure, where velocities of the free boundaries<br/>depend on global characteristics of the solutions. The goal is to gain a<br/>better understanding of the following aspects of such problems: the<br/>existence and uniqueness of solutions in global time; asymptotic behavior<br/>of the free boundary as time reaches zero or infinity; waiting time<br/>phenomena; and the regularity properties of the free boundaries. The PI<br/>employs the notion of viscosity solutions to address the behavior of<br/>aformentioned free boundary problems. This approach has been succesfully<br/>used to study nonlinear PDEs and local laws of motions such as 'motion by<br/>mean curvature'. The great advantage of this approach is its seamless<br/>handling of topological transitions such as pinch-off. The key-step of the<br/>theory of viscosity solutions is to establish a comparison principle. This<br/>property leads, in turn, to the existence of solutions and allows for the<br/>further study of their properties. Techniques coming from quantitative<br/>versions of the comparison principle and harmonic analysis are employed to<br/>study further properties of solutions.<br/><br/>The classical Stefan problem of melting ice is an example of the free<br/>boundary problems. In the Stefan problem, one is modeling the evolution of<br/>the polar ice caps, and the question of interest is the location, as a<br/>function of time, of the interface between water and ice. The particular<br/>problems to which the methods of the present proposal apply also include:<br/>the<br/>Hele-Shaw problem which models fluid motion in a narrow cell between<br/>two parallel plates; flame fronts; and the interface between oil and<br/>water in a flow. This is an area where modeling and computation are far<br/>ahead of mathematical analysis. The main obstacle for developing a<br/>well-defined notion for general motion of interfaces is that initially<br/>smooth boundaries moving under smooth velocities may develop singularities<br/>in finite time. The hitting and splitting of interfaces in flame<br/>propagation is an example. It is natural to wonder whether the<br/>continuation of the solutions is uniquely determined after pinch-off, or<br/>whether additional constitutive information might be required at the<br/>singular time. The impact of the singularity to the other part of the free<br/>boundary is another interesting question.  The PI plans to investigate<br/>these questions in local and global perspectives.<br/>"

We say that two quantum systems are very strongly intertwined if there is an algebra of ""common observables"" which means that certain of one system automatically yield measurement of the other system.

For the most part these <br/>proposals are geometrically motivated approaches to specific problems in <br/>modern harmonic analysis connected to the representation theory of semi-<br/>simple Lie groups.  The first is an approach to construction and analysis <br/>of singular unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups, in two <br/>steps: (i) geometric construction of those representations, as Frechet <br/>space representations on cohomology of homogeneous vector bundles over <br/>flag domains, and (ii) transforming the representation space to a space of<br/>functions on a Stein manifold defined by a system of differential equations,<br/>by means of a double fibration transform (the complex Penrose transform <br/>is a particular case) from the flag domain to its linear cycle space.  The <br/>second project is an approach to construction and analysis of unitary and <br/>other representations for a class of infinite dimensional Lie groups, the <br/>direct limits of finite dimensional Lie groups, especially strict direct <br/>limits of finite dimensional real and complex reductive Lie groups, both <br/>in the analytic category and in the algebraic category.  The third project <br/>is to complete the investigator's work on the Harish-Chandra Schwartz space <br/>of a general semisimple Lie group, by synthesizing structural analyses of <br/>the relative Schwartz spaces.  The investigator's fourth project is to <br/>extend the notion of Dirac cohomology to a notion of partial Dirac<br/>cohomology so that it applies to all the representations of a semisimple<br/>Lie group that appear in the Plancherel formula.  The fifth project is to<br/>extend the investigator's isospectral group method from the setting of <br/>spherical space forms to the setting of locally symmetric Riemannian spaces.<br/>The sixth project is to investigate certain restrictions of discrete series<br/>representations to a class of subgroups of great geometric interest.  And,<br/>seventh, the investigator will continue his development of a method for <br/>direct reading of the character and growth properties (asymptotics) of <br/>admissible representations of finite dimensional real reductive Lie groups <br/>from the basic data that specify their construction on cohomology spaces of <br/>homogeneous vector bundles over flag domains.  One goal here is to do this <br/>in such a way that is directly applicable to the first and second projects.  <br/><br/>These seven research projects all depend on the use of symmetry to clarify<br/>analytic (and in one case geometric) problems.  Traditionally symmetry<br/>considerations are used to simplify matters by decreasing the number of<br/>variables, but here they are used to enable the use of insight, tools and<br/>results from geometry and analysis.  The symmetries are embodied in group <br/>theory, which is the algebraic abstraction of the notion of symmetry.  But <br/>modern Lie group theory incorporates classical analysis (calculus, <br/>differential equations...) and is closely tied to the geometry (Riemannian, <br/>symplectic, Kaehler, ...)  of the configurations on which the groups act as <br/>symmetries.  An important aspect of this synthesis of geometry and analysis <br/>is a geometric form of quantization that is particularly well suited to the <br/>sorts of finite dimensional groups considered in several of the projects.  <br/>This geometric quantization, originally inspired by physics and developed <br/>in some detail by mathematicians, has in turn been very useful in a variety <br/>of settings in mathematics and physics.  This is very much the case in six <br/>of the seven projects, where the geometric quantization is combined with <br/>modern differential geometry to understand various analytic problems.

Some<br/>problems have close connections with other fields in mathematics, including<br/>several complex variables and algebraic geometry. One class of problems that<br/>the PI would continue to work on includes the geometric structure of level sets<br/>of solutions, in particular the nodal sets, the singular sets and the branch<br/>sets. An important part of the study is the investigation of the asymptotic<br/>behavior of solutions near these sets or the asymptotic behavior of these sets<br/>themselves. Another class of problems that the PI would continue to work on<br/>involves the effect of level sets of known functions in the equations on the<br/>properties of solutions.<br/><br/><br/>The problems involving singular sets originate from the material science and the<br/>control theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those sets where<br/>singularities occur. Precise definitions vary according to problems where they<br/>arise. In reality it is impossible to eliminate the singular sets, the<br/>so-called `bad sets'. One of the central tasks is to identify the conditions<br/>under which the singular sets can be controlled and the conditions under which<br/>the singular sets are small. The proposed problems concerning singular sets in<br/>the project are in their simplest forms. They are related to the Erickson's<br/>model for liquid crystals and the Ginzburg-Landau equation in the<br/>superconductivity. The PI believes that the discussion of these mathematical<br/>problems would improve the methods to control the singular sets in various<br/>applications.<br/><br/><br/>"

McNinch<br/>                            <br/>The project will study reductive linear algebraic groups over a, possibly imperfect, ground field whose characteristic is a prime number p; this setting presents many important and interesting challenges. The author recently exploited a result in geometric invariant theory to give definitive existence and conjugacy results for a suitable class of rank 1 simple subgroups, called optimal, containing any given element of order p.  If this element is rational over a ground field, the techniques yield an optimal rank one subgroup defined over that ground field. The project seeks to extend these results; an optimal rank 1 subgroup is G-completely reducible in the sense of J-P. Serre, and one hopes to describe any G-completely reducible rank 1 subgroup using the optimal ones.  Moreover, the project will consider counterparts of these results for simple subgroups of rank greater than 1 -- e.g. one hopes to characterize the optimal ones. In a slightly different direction, the project seeks to extend recent results of the author on nilpotent orbits -- in the Lie algebra -- over ground fields. For an imperfect ground field, the author has showed for a rather general class of reductive groups that the orbits of the group of rational points on nilpotent elements -- i.e. the arithmetic nilpotent orbits -- have favorable properties; as consequences, for instance, one finds over a local ground field that there are finitely many arithmetic nilpotent orbits, and one finds that nilpotent orbital integrals converge; the convergence of orbital integrals was obtained in characteristic 0 by Deligne and Ranga Rao.  The project will explore related issues; for instance, it seeks to exploit recent results of the author and E. Sommers to obtain information about nilpotent orbits for groups over the field of rational functions on an algebraic curve.<br/><br/>The structure and representations of linear algebraic groups - and especially the reductive ones -- are important to diverse parts of mathematics.  The groups of their rational points over finite fields account for most of the finite simple groups; they are the natural transformation groups of many algebro-geometric questions; representations of the groups of their rational points over local and global fields carry deep number-theoretic information.  The project will focus on important aspects of these groups.  The local and global fields just mentioned are imperfect when their characteristic is positive; the author's existing results -- and those sought by the project -- on reductive groups over imperfect fields are essential to the study of linear groups in this ""number theoretic"" setting.  Reasons for tackling the proposed problems abound: results on arithmetic nilpotent orbits for a group over a local field of positive characteristic should provide tools needed for the study of the relevant ""harmonic analysis""; results on reductive subgroups defined over the ground field contribute to one's understanding and provide useful inductive tools.<br/>"

It considers both real and complex equations. There are two major achievements in the work over the previous project that will be developed in the current one. First, rather unexpectedly, the Kupka-Smale (KS) property was proved for polynomial automorphisms both of real and complex planes. The proof is based on ""persistence theorems"" and ""Petrovski-Landis (PL) strategy"". Generally speaking, persistence theorems claim the possibility of global extension of some geometric properties of polynomial dynamical systems over the whole parameter space. PL strategy makes use of persistence theorems to prove or disprove such geometric properties. New persistence theorems for heteroclinic points of polynomial automorphisms of a complex space are expected. Genericity of Kupka-Smale property for such automorphisms is suggested as a consequence. The main tool would be the PL strategy. Another achievement is an upper estimate by Glutsyuk and the PI of the number of zeros of Abelian integrals both in real and complex domains. This estimate is the best amidst other estimates of this kind due to Yakovenko and his students. On the other hand, it provides an approach to the  complete solution of the restricted version of the Infinitesimal Hilbert 16th Problem.  Together with the PL strategy, this gives an approach to the Infinitesimal Hilbert 16th Problem itself:  give an upper bound of the number of real zeros of an integral of a polynomial one-form over the ovals of another polynomial in the plane. The project suggests numerous problems on the persistence properties for polynomial dynamical systems, simultaneous uniformization and topological properties of polynomial foliations. Study of the relations between these branches of the theory is an important part of the project. Moreover, new simultaneous uniformization theorems, together with new generic properties of polynomial and analytic foliation of the complex space are expected.<br/>Theory of dynamical systems is split into two parts: multidimensional systems (realm of chaos); two-dimensional systems (realm of order). Hilbert 16th problem is a central one in the theory of two-dimensional systems. The problem itself persists the efforts of mathematicians during more than a hundred years.  Centennial history of investigations related to Hilbert 16th problem is reviewed in a survey article by the PI published in the Bulletin of the AMS in 2002. The survey contains, in particular, many results of the previous NSF projects, as well as problems that are subject to the current project. Note that two-dimensional dynamical systems provide models for various problems in physics, engineering and biology (predator-prey models). Understanding of real two-dimensional dynamics is therefore a subject of general scientific interest. On the other hand, study of complex extensions of real dynamical systems provides important new information about real systems and is interesting in itself.<br/><br/>"

The properties of its solutions for different physical systems and environments are of great importance<br/>to our understanding of quantum phenomena. On the other hand, to describe and better understand elementary particles, physicists design various mathematical models, or field theories. Of special interest are the models that use subtle topological invariants.<br/>The models of Skyrme and Faddeev are examples of such models. Their analysis poses challenging mathematical problems on the intersection of the theory of partial differential equations and geometry/topology and may bring new physical insights."

Statistics, spectral analysis, X-ray crystallography, tomography <br/>offer models and classical examples of such questions. More specifically, <br/>most of the modern inverse problems are related to (power, Fourier, wavelet) <br/>moments of mass distributions. In their turn, moment problems form a well<br/>established field of research with a fascinating history of about<br/>two centuries. The project focuses on specific moment problems arising in <br/>shape and volume reconstruction from distant measurements (for instance of <br/>electric or gravitational fields). An important component of the project is <br/>the study of the best approximation and the error bounds related to <br/>reconstruction algorithms.<br/><br/>The success of previous researches of the principal investigator on similar <br/>two dimensional questions guarantee positive results in his attempt to expand <br/>his horizon to three or more dimensions. He will collaborate with several <br/>experts in pure and applied mathematics, as well as with graduate students and<br/>young research assistants. Their combined efforts and results will be <br/>significant for present studies in functional analysis, function theory and <br/>numerical mathematics, as well as for some specific branches of applied<br/>mathematics and engineering."
