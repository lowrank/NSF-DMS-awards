It consists of two parts. The first part is devoted to the study of the Hilbert transform, one of the classical objects of mathematical analysis. The second part involves applications to special functions and spectral problems for differential operators. Despite being one of the most studied elements of complex and real analysis, the Hilbert transform is far from being completely understood. The first part of this proposal deals with a long standing problem of boundedness of the two-weight Hilbert transform and related topics. The second part of the project contains problems related to generalizations and applications of the celebrated Beurling-Malliavin theory. This theory was originally developed in the early 1960's to solve the problem of completeness of exponential functions in the space of square-summable functions on an interval, one of the canonical problems of Harmonic Analysis. The recently developed Toeplitz operator approach allows one to extend the classical theory and apply it to other families of special functions. Another important set of applications lies in the area of direct, inverse and mixed spectral problems for differential operators, such as the Schroedinger operator, Krein's string operator and more general canonical systems of differential equations.<br/>     <br/>         The applications considered in this project are related to second-order differential equations, such as the Schroedinger equation or the string equation, that are used in mathematical physics to model the behavior of quantum systems, wave propagation and various other physical phenomena. One of the important aspects of such problems is the ability to analyze physical characteristics of the system by looking at spectral data. A large part of this project is devoted to the further development of the mathematical tools necessary for such spectral analysis. The PI will actively involve his students in this project and will continue to review recent results related to this project in his graduate courses at Texas A&M University. The results obtained in this project will be published in scientific journals and reported at research conferences.<br/>"

The primary goal is to achieve a good understanding of the interplay between linear dispersive dynamics and nonlinear effects. On the linear side, the project will study the global-in-time dispersive properties for wave and Schroedinger equations evolving on curved backgrounds. This is also in part directed toward the conjectured stability of the Schwarzchild and Kerr black hole solutions of the Einstein equations in general relativity. On the nonlinear side, a key topic to be explored is that of multiscale analysis. This corresponds to nonlinear dispersive equations that evolve in  regimes where linear and nonlinear effects are strongly interlaced. Thus while one might see coherent linear dynamics on a very short, possibly frequency dependent time scale, these are lost at larger times. The challenge is then to uncover larger patterns that remain coherent on longer and longer time scales.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, dispersive equations are equations whose solutions can be thought of as superpositions of waves travelling in different directions. Nonlinear effects allow these waves to interact, which may lead to modified propagation patterns (creating new waves) or possibly to the phenomenon described by mathematicians as ""blow-up."" Many of the equations considered in this project have their origins in physical theories such as general relativity, many-body quantum field theory, surface wave propagation, and plasma physics.  For this reason, it is hoped that the results of the research may shed some light on the corresponding physical phenomena. The project involves graduate students and postdocs, as well as several domestic and international collaborators.<br/>"

One problem is to understand the enhancement of diffusion by fluid flow by studying certain advection-diffusion partial differential equations. The PI will investigate the link between the geometric and dynamical properties of flows and their efficiency in enhancing diffusion.

On the technical level, the focus is on the study of properties of (generally high-dimensional) convex bodies, random matrices, Gaussian measures and processes, and of approximation problems. Specific sample directions of planned research are related to the slicing problem, the Mahler conjecture, the Gaussian correlation conjecture, combinatorial dimensions of classes of functions, singular numbers of random matrices, signal reconstruction (notably, compressed sensing), and links to quantum information theory. A combined, focused effort is expected to bring new insights toward a better understanding of the participants' respective fields of research, which - while related and occasionally overlapping - are not identical and often employ different perspectives.<br/><br/>The area of mathematics encompassing the methods and the problems described above has recently entered a period of rapid growth. In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract. Special attention will be paid to recruiting members of groups under-represented in the field of mathematics."

Two thrusts concern global regularity and compactness of the d-bar-Neumann operator in a domain. The principal investigator has recently developed a theory that unifies the known positive results concerning global regularity that is expected to provide an important step towards a desired characterization of this property in terms of properties of the boundary of the domain. It is not known how far the known potential theoretic sufficient conditions for compactness of the d-bar-Neumann operator are from being necessary. Building on his recent work with a graduate student (S. Munasinghe) that provides a different approach, the investigator will seek to characterize compactness. A third thrust of the project initiates a new direction of research: the available evidence suggests that regularity properties of the d-bar-Neumann operator in a domain should have positive implications for the existence of a Stein neighborhood basis of the closure of the domain. The fourth thrust results from a collaboration of the investigator with the postdoctoral researcher A. Raich, in which he and the principal investigator showed that the classical sufficient conditions for compactness of the operators in the interior of a domain (with a necessary modification) also yield compactness of the operators on the boundary. The goal is to combine their methods with earlier methods of the investigator to show that finite type implies subellipticity on the boundary.<br/><br/>The study of analysis in several complex variables is motivated both by the centrality of the subject to mathematics and by its usefulness. For example, one of the central laws of nature, causality, when transcribed via a mathematical device called the Fourier transform, leads immediately to analytic functions of several (in this case four) complex variables. Partial differential equations, on the other hand, arise in all areas of science that deal with systems that change over time: physics, engineering, economics, biology, meteorology, environmental sciences, and others. This project is thus located on the basic research end at the intersection of two areas of mathematics that are central to the scientific and technological enterprise. It will impact human resources development directly through funding for graduate students and through the investigator's supervision of postdoctoral researchers, and indirectly through the investigator's organization of and participation in workshops/conferences and through his expository writing.<br/>"

The workshop is planned as an interdisciplinary event to discuss several cutting edge problems on the border between modern mathematics and mathematical physics, more specifically, problems broadly associated with so-called Laplacian growth, stochastic and discrete Loewner evolutions, quadrature domains, gravitational lensing, Hele-Shaw flows, and integrable systems. The topics chosen for  the workshop are  ""hot"" topics which are on the borderline between mathematics and physics.  Recently, most of these themes, long studied in mathematical physics, received an unexpected but dramatic insight from classical complex analysis based on the notion of Schwarz function of an analytic curve.<br/><br/>The funding is intended  for the U.S. participation in the planned workshop. The workshop is a step in a larger initiative conceived by the organizers to create a multi-facetted joint USA-Europe series of collaborative projects and will serve to increase internationalization of newly developed collaborations and promote the establishment of in-depth scientific partnerships.  Supporting the travel of promising young researchers and graduate students to the workshop where scientists from Europe and the US, old and young, prominent and just beginning, are essentially spending 24 hours together in an inspiring and congenial environment, discussing appealing and important problems in mathematics and physics, will encourage many younger students to pursue some of these topics in their future research. Most of the funding is designated to support the travel costs of young scientists, graduate students and members of the underrepresented groups. <br/><br/> <br/>"

Among the ensembles to be studied are real asymmetric ensembles and ensembles of cosquare matrices. The latter ensembles consist of matrices whose eigenvalues are complex and satisfy an invariance property with respect to the unit circle. This invariance property is analogous to that of complex conjugation in real asymmetric ensembles, and the unit circle replaces the real line as an exceptional set in the study of eigenvalue statistics. Of particular interest is the study of the integrable structure of cosquare ensembles. Recent work by the PI on the integrable structure of real asymmetric ensembles suggests that cosquare ensembles have an analogous integrable structure. This discovery will further our understanding of ensembles with two (or more) different species of eigenvalues. Specific topics to be investigated include the joint eigenvalue density, a closed form for ensemble averages and correlation functions, as well as the limit law for the spectral radius (as the size of the matrices increases) and asymptotic results for the proportion of eigenvalues of unit modulus. The proposed research also aims to apply these results to Diophantine problems via the investigation of ensembles which arise naturally from heights of polynomials. The connection between polynomials and cosquare ensembles stems from the fact that the set characteristic polynomials of cosquare matrices is identical to the set of monic self-inversive polynomials. The latter arise naturally in the study of integer polynomials of small height. <br/><br/>An additional goal is the study of the integrable structure of Hermitian ensembles whose<br/>inverse temperature parameter (beta) is a square integer.  Random matrix theory is a branch of mathematics which has application to fields as varied as physics, neuroscience, wireless communication and the study of prime numbers. This ubiquity arises via ?universal? mathematical models which are naturally applicable in many diverse contexts.<br/>The study of these universal models not only leads to new discoveries in their areas of application, but also leads to surprising connections between seemingly disparate areas of science and engineering. Random matrix theory is but one example of the pursuit of abstract mathematical knowledge leading to advances in applied sciences. The goal of the proposed research is the investigation of two particular universal models and their application to the study of the integers. One of these universal models also has applications in the study of random networks, dynamics and cortical electric activity; the proposed research will potentially further our understanding of these fields. The other proposed model is new and has application to the study of integers; past precedents suggest that this universal model will find eventual application in a wider variety of contexts.<br/><br/>"

The goal is to understand the behavior of the correlation functions for these models in the localized and transport regimes. The first-order correlation function, the density of states, has been extensively studied. One part of the project is to prove its smoothness and a lower bound on the density. Of special interest is the second-order correlation function called the current-current correlation measure. One component of the project is to prove the existence of a density for this measure and to study its properties. This is important as the diagonal values of the density give the conductivity. Other second- and higher-order correlation functions arise in the study of eigenvalue statistics for random Schrodinger operators. These correlation functions and related ones for certain random matrix models will also be explored. The integer quantum Hall effect is closely related to these ideas and the project involves a study of quantum Hall systems using nonequilibrium stationary states.<br/> <br/>The propagation of electrons in solids has long been an important focus of condensed matter physics. Quantum mechanics has been successful in providing an understanding of metals, semiconductors, and insulators. The nature of finite conductivity remains elusive.  It is believed that the natural disorder of crystals, due to dislocations and defects that are observed in nature, is partially responsible for the transport properties of crystals. The focus of this research is to understand the mathematical and physical basis for finite conductivity by modeling crystals as an ordered array with random impurities. Experimentally observable quantities, such as the density of states and the conductivity, can be estimated in these models."

The continuation of this research is expected to lead to a complete classification in the general case and to results about related problems, in particular about dilation theory. After this, it will be attempted to extend at least some of the results to the case of n-tuples of commuting operators associated to bounded symmetric domains.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposal consists in solving some long open problems of operator theory by the combination of ideas from different branches of mathematics. This will constitute substantial progress in operator theory.  The broader impacts include advancing operator theory and widely distributing the results in a wy to be useful to all working in the field. This will furnish a method that may have applications in physics and will have a beneficial effect on teaching and research activities both at the CUNY Graduate Center and at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore.

Almost all the problems in this proposal involve ""peaks of concentration""; they correspond to small regions in space (often assimilated to points or lines) where some of the variables can take extremely high values. Such peaking zones can be part of the data or part of the unknown. For example, in nuclear physics, positive nuclei are fixed zones of high density surrounded by a diffuse cloud of electrons floating around them. A surprising mathematical discovery is that some natural NLPDE admit no solution when high-density data are concentrated in regions that are ""too small."" In mathematical language, this can be expressed by saying that some measures (e.g., Dirac masses) are not admissible data. The principal investigator proposes to classify all admissible measures for a large class of NLPDE. In other problems, the zones of high concentration are part of the unknown. Singularities may appear when a ""mild"" external field is applied to the system. The examples of this phenomenon that are relevant to the current project arise in the physics of liquid crystals and superconductors. In this project, the principal investigator will continue his research in several directions, addressing such issues as the following: What kind of external action is required to produce singularities?  Describe the nature, the strength, and the location of singularities?<br/><br/>In the real world, one often encounters phenomena of extreme intensity, which appear in small regions of space or persist only during a small time interval. A short list of examples includes the following: vortices (similar to tornadoes) in fluid mechanics and superconductors, fractures in solid mechanics, self-focusing beams in nonlinear optics (e.g., in lasers), defects in liquid crystals, black holes in astrophysics. One of the project?s goals is to describe all possible singular behaviors for a large class of nonlinear models. It is important to understand what causes such ""blow-up"" phenomena, in order either to avoid them or to enhance them. Mathematically similar problems occur not only in physics but in many other areas of mathematics.<br/>"

More specifically, the principal investigator wishes to continue his research into various rigidity problems in several complex variables, as well as their applications and interactions with super-rigidity problems in the theory of complex singularities and complex geometry. He will study the equivalence problem for real submanifolds in complex spaces and further the present understanding of the local hull of holomorphy for a real submanifold in a complex manifold. He also intends to investigate the simultaneous embedding and filling problem for a CR family of embeddable compact, strongly pseudoconvex, three-dimensional CR manifolds and to explore the Grauert-Siu-Ling direct image theory through an approach that makes use of the d-bar equation. Various geometric and analytic properties for CR mappings will be pursued, as well.<br/> <br/>Complex numbers and functions of complex variables have become, since the nineteenth century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and its application to other areas of science and engineering. The solutions of many problems in the applied sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in these complex analytic tools and a deeper understanding of their basic properties. For example, in materials science, the standard method for treating multidirectional stresses in a uniform way is to represent them as complex numbers or, in more complicated situations, as complex functions. It then turns out that, among other things, the direction of the propagation of cracks in materials is related to the properties of certain equations associated with these complex numbers or functions. Results of the research to be carried out in this project may lead to the discovery of new properties of solutions of these equations. The project has significant educational and training aspects: several graduate students will be actively involved in this project. Finally, the principal investigator is planning to coorganize conferences on several complex variables and partial differential equations, bringing together mathematicians (including young people and members of underrepresented groups) to discuss their research and teaching.<br/>"

The concrete equations just listed either do not satisfy the convexity condition or do not exhibit uniform ellipticity.

The Loewner equation relates a continuously increasing sequence of planar simply connected domains to a real-valued function, the driving term of the equation. The correspondence is by means of conformal maps onto a standard domain (such as a disc). Through this mechanism complicated two-dimensional shapes can be encoded by seemingly simpler objects, namely, real-valued functions of a real variable. The correspondence between a shape and its driving term is complicated and leaves many open questions. The aim of this project is to provide a better understanding of this correspondence. For instance, the principal investigator will study the continuity of the sets under deformations of the driving terms. In light of  Oded Schramm's SLE and the spectacular work of Lawler, Schramm, Werner, Smirnov and others, random driving terms (in particular, Brownian motion) are especially interesting and will be a focus of the research. <br/><br/>Conformal mappings are often used to change coordinates from one region to a simpler region, such as a disc. They have applications in many areas within mathematics and to several branches of physics. On small scale, conformal maps look like rotations and dilations. Hence it is plausible that rotation- and dilation-invariant mathematical models of physical phenomena (e.g., Brownian motion, percolation, crystal growth, electrodeposition) are invariant under conformal coordinate changes. Theoretical physicists have long used this heuristic and obtained predictions for many of these models. Oded Schramm's discovery of the stochastic Loewner evolution (SLE, the Loewner equation driven by one-dimensional Brownian motion)  and Smirnov's work on percolation have put this philosophy on a firm mathematical  basis. The results obtained in recent years have generated a lot of excitement in both the mathematics and the physics communities. They have also created a new bridge between the two disciplines.

Several of the problems involve mutilinear operators. Torres will work on problems involving norm estimates for variable coefficient bilinear singular transforms and bilinear pseudodifferential operators, maximal functions for the multilinear Caldern-Zygmund theory, multilinear weights, and multilinear strongly singular integral operators. In particular, several issues about the regularity of the symbols and kernels of the operators investigated, end-point estimates, Lebesgue and Sobolev space estimates, and related problems will be considered. The PI will also carry on research on the characterization of various spaces using information about the samples of functions. Finally, Torres will continue to investigate mathematical formulations that quantify quasi-ordered geometries in connection with Fourier analysis.<br/><br/><br/>Quite often the solution of a hard problem in analysis cannot be achieved until effective ways to decompose functions and transformations are found.  Fourier analysis decomposes a function into a superposition of waves oscillating in time with specific frequencies. Other related time-frequency decompositions refine this analysis by codifying information at multiple scales or levels of resolution. This permits the understanding of more interesting properties of functions and the operations that transform them. The techniques have established themselves as very valuable tools in many areas of science and engineering. Applications are found in compression of information, audio filtering, satellite photography, and other forms of image processing. The extreme effectiveness in applications of the time-frequency techniques has become evident through research originally done in mathematical analysis. New progress in this area is expected to continue to have impact in problems in other disciplines where there is a need to quantify complicated multi-scale information and organize it in a coherent way.<br/>"

Morever, advances in one of these fields has frequently triggered advances in the other. Two of the most important examples of such equations are the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations. The problems under consideration in this project include: the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations on complex projective spaces, the geometric aspects of these equations with curvature terms, and their relationship to function theory in complex manifolds. The behavior of these equations under the curvature condition has not been explored systematically earlier, and an understanding of them in this context holds promise for impact on algebraic and complex geometry. New applications of these equations to complex foliation theory also yield important results in topology, geometry, and dynamics. For example, the principal investigator's recent work on the nonexistence of Levi-flat hypersurfaces in complex projective spaces is a holomorphic version of the classical Poincare-Bendixson theorem in dynamical systems. <br/><br/>An important aspect of the research that will be done in this project rests in the fact that these problems are central to several different areas, namely, complex variables, complex geometry, and partial differential equations. These classical fields in mathematical analysis have contributed to our understanding of many important phenomena in physics. Since physical problems quite often involve variations in both time and space, the equations that govern them often need to be expressed in the language of complex variables. Many such equations involving several complex variables in a geometric setting have yet to be thoroughly analyzed, and many of the associated physical phenomena, such at the existence of a conic drop in an alternating-current electric field, have yet to be satisfactorily explained. The principal investigator hopes to tackle such remaining and new problems in geometry and topology. She interacts with mathematicians from many different areas in different parts of the world. She has taught courses on the subjects to students and researchers alike in many countries. Such interdisciplinary and international approaches bring new perspective and greater depth to each of the fields involved.  In particular, recent progress in the so-called Dirichlet and Neumann problem on nonsmooth domains has found application in other disciplines, for instance, in physics and engineering."

In string theory, space-time is modeled by a new kind of mathematical structure called gerbes. A very useful way to think of the stringy space-time is to consider it as a ?noncommutative space? in the sense of Connes.  Such a noncommutative space can be constructed using the convolution algebra of a certain groupoid.

The PI plans to use methods and techniques of harmonic analysis (on the group of affine transformations of a real line) to search for a corresponding deformation theory in the framework of C* algebras, which can be considered as the set of continuous functions over noncommutative spaces. Other topics in this project concern cyclic cohomology, a noncommutative analogue of the classical De Rham cohomology, which encodes some topological properties of the algebras in question.

The main subject of study is the so- called hyperbolic dynamical systems that provides a mathematical foundation for the paradigm that is widely known as ""deterministic chaos"" -- the appearance of irregular chaotic motions in purely deterministic dynamical systems. This paradigm asserts that conclusions about global properties of a nonlinear dynamical system with sufficiently strong hyperbolic behavior can be deduced from studying the linearized systems along its trajectories. The study of hyperbolic phenomena originated in seminal works of Artin, Morse, Hedlund, and Hopf on the instability and ergodic properties of geodesic flows on compact surfaces. Later, hyperbolic behavior was observed in other situations (e,g, Smale horseshoes and hyperbolic toral automorphism). The systematic study of hyperbolic dynamical systems was initiated by Smale, Anosov and Sinai who studied dynamical systems with sufficiently strong hyperbolic behavior. Such systems possess high level of unpredictability and exhibit strong chaotic behavior. In the proposal the PI considers the weakest (hence, most general) form of hyperbolicity known as nonuniform hyperbolicity. The theory of nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems originated in the work of the PI (sometimes this theory is referred to as ""Pesin theory'') and the study of these systems is based upon the theory of Lyapunov exponents.<br/><br/>There are three main topics in the proposal. 1. Thermodynamic formalism for nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems -- this is to build statistical physics of phase transitions for systems with nonzero Lyapunov exponents based on recent works on Markov extensions and tower constructions. 2. Mixed hyperbolicity and stable ergodicity -- this is to study how ""typical"" the systems with nonuniform hyperbolic behavior are. A recent result by Dolgopyat and the PI shows that such systems exist on any phase space. 3. Coexistence of hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic behavior -- this is to complement the famous Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory by constructing particular examples of systems with coexistence of nonzero Lyapunov exponents and areas with zero entropy. The PI also proposes to apply his work to the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation and the Brusselator model -- the famous models in neurobiology and chemistry. They provide interesting new and ""naturally"" appearing examples of nonuniformly hyperbolic systems as well as demonstrate transitions from relatively simple Morse-Smale systems to ""strange"" attractors and to Smale horseshoes."

Advances achieved based on these methods engendered fruitful applications to Diophantine approximation problems in number theory  and provided first examples of existence of invariant geometric structure for   large classes of actions. <br/>There are several major directions in the proposed program:<br/><br/>1.Local differentiable  rigidity  for partially hyperbolic  and parabolic actions of higher rank abelian groups with the emphasis on the combination of  the dynamical systems,  harmonic analysis/group representation  and geometric methods.<br/><br/>2.

Its simplest and most basic manifestations can be seen from the following elementary example: a small number of equations or inequalities of a special type may imply much larger number of equation. For example, if the arithmetic mean on  n numbers coincides with the geometric mean (one equation) then the numbers are all equal ( n-1 equations). An example from the PI's earlier research is conceptually similar albeit technically  much more sophisticated:  a compact surface of negative curvature, i.e. a  bounded geometric shape where any geodesic triangle has the sum of its angles less than 180 degrees, for which two numbers characterizing global and statistical volume growth (topological and metric entropy) coincide has constant negative curvature, i.e. the sum of the angles of a geodesic triangle is uniquely determined by the area.  The research under the present grant involves both deeper investigation of rigidity phenomena for dynamical systems with multi-dimensional time, and expansion and development of striking  application to several areas of mathematics and mathematical physics.  <br/><br/>Here is an  interpretation of some results from the  area 3. above. Investigation  of chaotic  behavior in deterministic dynamical  systems plays a central  role in application of the modern theory of dynamical systems to various areas on natural and social sciences.  Here is the  crucial difficulty which  impedes efforts in more comprehensive understanding of important models:  while it is  often relatively easy to establish  existence of some initial conditions which produce chaotic behavior, proving chaotic behavior of  most or many (in the sense of volume in the phase space) is beyond the  present on even anticipated mathematical methods. PI and his collaborators discovered that for systems with multidimensional time under certain very general conditions this difficulty is overcome: global conditions of topological or dynamical nature which a priori guarantee only existence of some chaotic orbits in fact imply existence of  such orbits which fill positive volume in the phase space."

Most of the elliptic and parabolic problems are formulated in the context of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, but various model equations will also be studied and the insight obtained from the model equations is expected to be important. The main emphasis is on developing methods and techniques for problems that are out of the reach of perturbation theory. For certain classes of equations (such as, for example, the Navier-Stokes equation) such problems are of considerable theoretical and practical importance. <br/><br/>Partial differential equations represent a basic tools for modeling many natural and technological phenomena. For instance, the equations describing fluid flow (on which an important part of this project will concentrate) are used in weather prediction, climate research, and various technological applications, such as the design of optimal aerodynamical shapes. The equations of fluid dynamics are notoriously difficult to solve, even with the help of the largest computers. Some of these difficulties are intrinsic, but some are due to the fact that our mathematical understanding of the equations themselves is incomplete. Advances in theoretical understanding of partial differential equations can lead to substantial improvement in practical methods for solving them. In the final analysis, the main task of the theoretical investigation is to find some simple and natural parameters that control the behavior of the solutions. Once a good set of such parameters is known, it becomes much easier to design practical methods for calculating the solutions. Reason: armed with such parameters a researcher knows what is important and what is not when one tracks a solution. The researcher can then focus computational power on the aspects that really matter. The proposed research can have a significant impact in this direction.<br/>"

The experts in these aspects of complex dynamical systems are concentrated in France, England, Japan, and the US (with smaller groups in Chile, Spain, Poland, and Germany, to name a few); with this project, the Principal Investigator will bring together some of these experts to work with students and clarify these connections between algebra and dynamics.<br/>"

In the past several years, we have developed a method to investigate the ergodic theoretical properties of parabolic flows based on the study of invariant distributions (distributional obstructions to the existence of solutions of cohomological equations), on the Gottschalk-Hedlund theorem and on the construction of a renormalization dynamics. We have succesfully applied our ideas in several papers where we have proved bounds on the speed of ergodicity in a few fundamental cases. We intend to test our method further in other more challenging cases, which so far have been out of reach mainly beacuse no renormalization scheme is available. The problems that we intend to attack include longstanding open questions such as the question on weak mixing on invariant surfaces for flows in rational polygons and the question on the speed of (unique) ergodicity for nilflows.<br/><br/>Our long term goal is to contribute to develop a theory on a class of weakly chaotic dynamical systems, called parabolic, which, despite some recent progress, are not yet sufficiently well understood. Parabolic motion is characterized by a power-law divergence (for instance linear, quadratic, etc.) of nearby trajectories with time. It represents an intermediate situation between strongly chaotic motion (exponentially fast divergence) and regular motion (no or extremely slow divergence). Motions at the extreme ends of the spectrum are comparatevely much better understood than parabolic motion. We will study specific questions on the dynamics of specific classes of examples, chosen for their fundamental nature and for their relevance in applications to physics, to geometry and to number theory. For instance, certain parabolic systems are relevant in the study of celestial mechanics, or as a testing ground for conjectures on the relation between classical and quantum mechanics (quantum chaos), other systems have deep connections to questions in number theory. Advances in our understanding of these systems will improve our fundamental knowledge of dynamical phenomena which are relevant for the natural sciences and for technological applications."

One driving feature is the exploration of universal behavior in these areas.   McLaughlin's previous work in nonlinear partial differential equations has concerned the study of violent oscillations in somewhat specialized ``integrable'' nonlinear partial differential equations. Very recently, conjectures have emerged, analogous to the famous universality conjectures in random matrix theory, which posit that the microscopic generation of these oscillations is universal over entire families of nonlinear partial differential equations.  In random matrix theory, universality refers to the phenomenon that eigenvalue statistics of random matrices tend, as the size of the matrices grow to infinity, to behave in a universal way, independent of the exact form of the probabilistic laws used to generate the random matrices.  McLaughlin proposes to extend the current realm of universality substantially, in nonlinear partial differential equations and random matrix theory, and to probe the limits of universality: what conditions on V are sufficient to see a deviation from the typical universal behavior?  A variety of research projects are also proposed whose aim is the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The understanding and eventual control of complicated phenomena is a primary goal of scientific research.  Through this fundamental goal we enhance our ability for technological advancement. Physical models for complex nonlinear phenomena often boil down to the study of partial differential equations in parameter regimes where their solutions exhibit singularly wild behavior. In other instances, statistical theories with great amount of randomness are developed to understand complex phenomena. ``Universality'' refers to robustness of certain phenomena, and to the counter-intuitive prevalence of the same phenomena across a wide array of different physical situations and models.  Two examples:  (1) Waves in the ocean can organize themselves into ""trains"" transporting energy, and analogous trains are also observed in laser beams propagating in optical fibers.  (2)  Statistical fluctuations of nuclear resonance levels measured in the 1950s led to a new type of universality, and the same statistical behavior has been observed in a wide variety of situations modeled with randomness, as far-flung as the statistics of spacings between parked cars!  Scientists' ability to predict dramatic behavior through the analysis of such general nonlinear partial differential equations, or statistical theories, is limited. However, there is a class of canonical models for a wide variety of physical settings. Their singular behavior is a guide for the understanding of some complicated phenomena in nature. Some of these are partial differential equations, others are statistical models, but the unifying feature of these models is that researchers are making great progress in their analysis. McLaughlin's research involves the detailed rigorous analysis of these models; he (with collaborators) is developing methods to understand, predict, and control their behavior.  The broader impacts of this research program stem from the emergence of universality as a new paradigm in nonlinear science: probing its range of applicability is fundamental in emerging areas as well as established ones.  Another very important aspect of the proposed research is the continued training of graduate students in these rapidly developing areas.<br/>"

The mathematical challenge that they pose lies in analyzing qualitatively the long-time behavior of solutions for as arbitrary a class of initial data as possible. In particular, one wants to decide whether singularity formation in finite time can occur, and if so, to describe the dynamics of it. For a long time, only very special cases were amenable to a rigorous analysis. Recent advances in harmonic analysis, however, as well as new insight into how to apply methods of spectral theory in the context of nonlinear problems, have made it possible to construct examples for a greatly expanded class of situations and to uncover exciting new phenomena, for example, a great variety of different types of singularity formation. Nevertheless, a host of questions remain, and to answer some of them is the goal of this project. The topics on which the project will focus include the stability of these blow-up phenomena in the absence of any symmetry assumptions (which would make them more readily observable in computer simulations) and a useful description of the totality of all possible blow-up rates. Furthermore, as the techniques mentioned above apply only in the context of energy-critical equations, it remains to find ways of dealing with the supercritical context. This goes beyond exhibiting isolated examples (which have been known in some supercritical cases for a while). All Wave Maps equations in four-dimensional (and higher dimensional) space-time belong to the supercritical regime. <br/><br/>This research should be of relevance to a number of other fields. Numerical simulation of the equations under investigation, simulation that is of interest to physicists, is inherently difficult to carry out accurately in the case when singularities are present. It is not uncommon that such simulations result in contradictory scenarios, from which only a careful theoretical analysis leads to correct conclusions about the underlying dynamics. On the other hand, knowledge of the correct qualitative behavior of the solutions, a goal of this project, would allow one to implement the correct computer algorithms for computing highly accurate solutions, even in the presence of singularities. A concrete example would be the propagation of lasers in weakly interacting nonlinear media. This phenomenon is described by nonlinear Schrdinger equations, and singularity formation in their solutions has a bearing on issues such as laser focusing. A second application relates to Einstein's equations of general relativity, which reduce under certain symmetry assumptions to equations of Wave Maps type. A qualitative understanding of the latter would have a bearing on our understanding of the development of black holes. Finally, the principal investigator is hopeful that his techniques will carry over to much more general classes of equations, such as parabolic nonlinear problems. These turn up in a variety of contexts (e.g., engineering problems describing processes of combustion, geometric flows)."

When an autonomous system with a saddle point and a homoclinic solution is subjected to periodic perturbations, the stable and unstable manifolds of the perturbed saddle intersect each other transversally, creating a homoclinic tangle for the time-periodic map. Melnikov's method has been introduced for the purpose of detecting these homoclinic tangles for the time-periodic map in concrete systems of differential equations. This research project follows a new route.  We construct a Poincare section that mixes the original phase dimensions with time in the extended phase space and computed explicitly the return maps induced by the differential equations.  Consequently, we can apply various theories on non-uniformly hyperbolic maps developed in the last thirty years, such as the Newhouse theory on homoclinic tangency, the theory of SRB measures, the theory of Henon-like attractors and rank one maps, to the studies of periodically perturbed homoclinic solutions. We also extend our study to quasi-periodically forced equations.<br/><br/>To mathematically study a problem of practical importance from a given science discipline, such as astronomy, physics, engineering and biology, we usually start with certain established natural laws and write them in mathematical terms. For instance, to study the motions of celestial bodies in the solar systems, we start with Newton's Law of Gravitations, and write a set of mathematical equations. Mathematician's task is then to solve these equations to predict the future positions of the celestial bodies, to discuss issues such as the long term stability of the solar system. We also write mathematical equations for electric circuits, for biological systems, and so on. One of the major discoveries in the studies of these mathematical equations is the common occurrence of a dynamics phenomenon that is called ""Chaos"", partly reflecting our inability in predicting futures of complicated systems. Many mathematical theories have been introduced to study chaos, and these studies have led to the discoveries of many complicated but understandable structures. This research introduces a new way of studying chaos and the theory developed can be used in analyzing many systems of classical and practical importance."

The second cluster focuses on ground state properties: area laws for the local entropy and entanglement, the spectral gap above the ground state and its relation with the behavior of correlation functions, and the quality of approximation of ground states by matrix product states.  The third cluster contains a number of questions in computational complexity theory: computational complexity classes, QMA-completeness, the connection between gapped Hamiltonians and complexity, and the computational power of stoquastic Hamiltonians, all of which relate to quantum spin systems.<br/><br/>Condensed matter physicists, mathematical physicists, functional analysts, workers in quantum computation, and computer scientists recently have begun to discover the close relationships that exist between several of the important questions in their respective fields.  A small number of key properties about quantum spin Hamiltonians, the dynamics they generate, and their ground states are the main ingredients needed to address questions about the physical behavior of quantum spin models, about the computational efficiency of numerical algorithms to compute ground state properties and simulate dynamics, and about new complexity classes that are emerging in the theory of quantum computation.  This project brings together experts in condensed matter physics, functional analysis and spectral theory, probability theory, and computer science to develop a coherent mathematical theory that clarifies the interrelationships of these key properties and, in particular, their relevance for the emerging field of quantum complexity theory in the context of quantum computation. <br/>"

Physicists have developed powerful techniques for studying phase transitions, but the mathematics of these methods is not well understood. This research will further our understanding of critical phenomena by developing the mathematics behind two of the most important of the physicist's tools - the renormalization group and conformal invariance.

The basic questions are: (i) Do we have existence and uniqueness of solutions, and continuous dependence on data, in a certain class? (ii) Can solutions blow up? (e.g. black holes in general relativity) (iii) What is the long time behavior of solutions? More specifically, the PI is mainly working in two areas. One project is to study the problem of existence of global solutions of Einstein's equations and of other related equations. The first goal is to simplify, generalize and refine the existence results for Einstein's equations. A long term goal is to study the stability of large solutions like black holes in general relativity. This is related to one of the main problem is mathematical relativity, the cosmic censorship conjectures of Penrose. The question of stability or blowup of large solutions is also the main question now in nonlinear wave equations. Another project is studying a class of problems that occur in fluid dynamics and general relativity, in particular, proving the well-posedness for the free boundary problem of the motion of the surface of a fluid in vacuum. The first goal in this area is to prove local existence. A long term goal is to study the long time behavior of astrophysical bodies such as gaseous stars as well as other interface problems of fluids and solids. To solve these problems the PI and collaborators are developing new techniques that could be useful for studying many other problems as well. In particular, they are using geometric methods to study hyperbolic differential equations.<br/><br/>The PI and collaborators greatly simplified the existence proof for Einstein's equations and its generalizations and refinements will have a large impact. It makes it much easier for graduate students to get in to mathematical relativity. Moreover, the detailed asymptotic behavior they prove in harmonic coordinates will be useful for the physics community. The physicists are building large gravitational wave detectors to observe the Universe. In order to know what to look for there is a large effort in doing numerical calculations for Einstein's equations and the only successful attempts have been in harmonic coordinates. It is also conceivable that understanding the properties of and controlling the interface between two fluids could have industrial applications. In particular there is a version of the problem for plasma physics in magneto-hydrodynamics and controlling the plasma is needed for constructing fusion reactors.<br/>"

For a finite real multi-sequence, we seek concrete necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a positive Borel representing measure in Euclidean space, a measure such that the power moments of the measure coincide with the corresponding elements of the multi-sequence. We associate to the multi-sequence a corresponding moment matrix. It is known that a representing measure exists if and only if the moment matrix admits an extension to a larger, positive semi-definite moment matrix, which in turn admits a flat, i.e., rank-preserving, extension to a still larger moment matrix. This research concerns the existence and minimal size of such moment matrix extensions. Column dependence relations in the moment matrix determine an algebraic variety which contains the support of any representing measure, and this research concerns a description of the algebraic varieties for which it is possible to establish the desired flat moment matrix extensions. More generally, this research concerns representing measure whose support is contained in a prescribed semi-algebraic closed set. In this case, we require flat extensions (as above) for which the localizing matrices corresponding to the semi-algebraic set are also positive semi-definite. This part of the research is concerned with semi-algebraic (or algebraic) sets for which positive polynomials admit degree-bounded weighted sum-of-squares representations; applications directly concern finite convergence in Lasserre's polynomial optimization theory. Another aspect of this research concerns algorithms for explicitly computing finitely atomic representing measures; applications of this part of the research lead to the construction of minimal or near-minimal multivariable cubature rules in Numerical Analysis. <br/>        The aim of this research is to develop new existence and uniqueness criteria for finitely atomic representing measures in multivariable truncated moment problems. Truncated moment problems play an essential role in aspects of such fields as Operator Theory (subnormality of weighted shifts), Interpolation Theory (classical Nevanlinna-Pick theory), Numerical Analysis (multivariable cubature rules), Control Theory (signal processing), Optimization Theory (polynomial optimization over a region), and Real Algebraic Geometry (representations of positive polynomials as weighted sums-of-squares). The principal focus of this research is an approach to multidimensional truncated moment problems based on an extension theory for the moment matrix associated to the moment data. When this matrix admits an infinite, positive, finite rank moment matrix extension, this approach yields an explicit formula for a finitely atomic representing measure supported on the joint spectrum of a normal tuple of operators corresponding to the extension. The primary goal of this research is to determine concrete conditions on the moment data which permit the desired extension. This research also concerns algorithms for explicitly computing finitely atomic representing measures corresponding to moment matrix extensions. Another aspect of this research concerns the interplay between the existence of representing measures and the existence of sum-of-squares representations for positive polynomials; this aspect is directly related to Lasserre's algorithm for polynomial optimization. Another application of this research concerns the development of new minimal cubature rules on classical domains such as the disk or triangle. Broader impacts will include undergraduate training and research projects for science students from underrepresented minorities, and the use of computing, particularly simulations, as an experimental methodology in mathematics and computer science courses.<br/>"

The plan of attack relies on geometric and physical intuition, drawn especially from the theory of nonlinear elasticity and materials science. This represents a trend that in recent years has become more pronounced, and it has led to increasing efforts by pure and applied mathematicians to combine such ideas and results. The project centers on the remarkable relationship (first envisioned by the principal investigator and Jani Onninen) between mappings of finite distortion and hyperelasticity. Both theories are governed by variational principles and problems of compelling common mathematical interest. The new fronts that have been created in geometric function theory include polyconvex integrals of the distortion function and the associated total n-harmonic energy. Of special interest are mappings of smallest mean distortion, whose existence, regularity, and global invertibility are related to deep unsolved mathematical questions. For instance, the present proposal takes on difficult questions concerning deformations of spherical rings in Euclidean n-space, and a much studied conjecture of Nitsche (1962). This is a tentative first step toward an n-dimensional theory of moduli, a subject that hopefully will develop into a very coherent analogue of Teichmuller theory in higher dimensions. The project features new concepts (such as free Lagrangians) and challenging questions galore, some already prepared for answers, others of a more speculative, long-term character. <br/><br/>With its elaborate design, this project will encourage the dissemination of modern geometric function theory, a classical field that has undergone a tremendous transformation in recent years, to a wider audience and will enhance the understanding of the subject's pervasive presence in applications. The project reflects continued efforts by the principal investigator to provide an active and welcoming research environment for graduate students and young scholars through effective training, the creation of educational materials, and the fostering of scientific partnerships both within the U.S. and overseas. This endeavor has hitherto been particularly effective for groups historically underrepresented in mathematics, especially women. The proposed problems will find considerable interest among geometric analysts, especially researchers in such physically relevant fields as partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, and nonlinear elasticity theory. <br/>"

The concept that connects the three areas is the notion of an accretive map, which can be thought of as a far-reaching generalization of an increasing function of one real variable. Some of the problems to be addressed within the project are the following: (1) bi-Lipschitz equivalence of Euclidean spaces with nonsmooth conformal metrics, in particular with metrics defined by  Riesz potentials; (2) construction of quasisymmetric maps as vector-valued potentials of possibly non-doubling measures; (3) geometric properties of measures that satisfy a stronger, isotropic form of the doubling condition; (4) uniform continuity and Lipschitz continuity of approximate duality maps in Banach spaces; (5) variants of the Beurling-Ahlfors extension theorem for accretive maps and for complex gradients of real-valued functions. <br/><br/> A fundamental problem in geometry and analysis is to find a parametrization of a given metric space (i.e., a set with a notion of distance) that makes it possible to visualize the space and to understand its structure. (One practical situation in which this issue arises is the construction of flat maps of the mammalian cerebral cortex.) The Riemann mapping theorem provides a parametrization of a surface that preserves all angles but that can significantly distort distances between points. This distortion of distances can sometimes be reduced by a carefully chosen additional deformation of the flat region onto which the surface is mapped. Our current understanding of such deformations of Euclidean spaces is far from complete even in two dimensions. The principal investigator is interested in using accretive maps to shed new light on this subject. Under an accretive map a space can be significantly stretched or shrunk at multiple locations, but it is never rotated by more than a predetermined amount. <br/>"

This encompasses such diverse areas as the study of singularities of solutions of the wave equation, which is the ""nearby"" behavior of waves, as well as the asymptotic behavior of waves on curved space-times, such as in general relativity. The project will employ geometric microlocal techniques to explore new problems in these areas. Some of these techniques are constructive, such as the ones used by the author in the description of the scattering operator on asymptotically de-Sitter-like spaces, and some rely on phase-space energy estimates, such as the microlocal positive commutator estimates employed by the author in the proof of the propagation of singularities on domains with corners and in showing that the wave diffracted by a smooth edge is more regular (which can be interpreted as ""weaker"") than the incident wave under suitable hypotheses, in joint work with Melrose and Wunsch.<br/><br/>Most people are familiar with the following two descriptions of the propagation of light. First, in geometric optics, light propagates in straight lines, reflecting from smooth surfaces according to Snell's law (i.e., the angles of incidence and of reflection are the same, as if light consisted of billiard balls). Second, light can be described by the wave equation, its propagation thus being similar to that of water waves. There is a close relationship between these two viewpoints. Namely, for solutions of the wave equation, the propagation of sharp signals (or ""singularities"" of signals obtained, for example, by turning on light instantaneously) is precisely described by the simpler geometric optics picture. Part of this project can be regarded as an extension of this work to a more general setting, such as reflections from curved edges. As wave propagation is ubiquitous in the physical world, a more precise understanding of it has many potential applications, for instance, to inverse problems. In a material with cracks inside it, one would like to find out the location of these cracks by probing the material with waves (say, sound waves, or x-rays). These cracks are typically not smooth (e.g., they may have edges or corners), but they still fit into our general geometric framework. One can use our proposed results -- namely, that the reflections from the tips of the cracks are weaker (in a certain sense) than the reflections from the smooth parts -- combined with the very precise understanding of reflections from the smooth parts, to locate the cracks. The rough conclusion: the tips can be ignored.<br/>"

Concerning the first area, we plan to extend recent work on flat extensions of positive moment matrices (joint with L. Fialkow and H.M. Mller), which has led to a general framework for the study of TMP.  We plan to apply these methods beyond the extremal case, to obtain algebraic and geometric invariants for solubility, to further develop an appropriate analogue of the Riesz-Haviland Theorem, and to investigate the duality between TMP and degree-bounded representations of polynomials nonnegative on a prescribed semialgebraic set.  The second area deals with a multivariable approach to LPCS and with subnormality for Toeplitz operators.  Building on work of C. Cowen for the case of hyponormal Toeplitz operators, our approach is to first characterize 2-hyponormality, then k-hyponormality, and eventually subnormality.  We would also like to develop further the ideas in recent joint work with J. Yoon and S.H. Lee to search for necessary and sufficient conditions for two commuting subnormal operators to admit a joint normal extension, including some useful connections with Agler's abstract model theory.  The third area deals with structural and spectral properties of multiplication operators on functional Hilbert spaces over Reinhardt domains.  We plan to extend the study of the spectral picture of subnormal multivariable weighted shifts to hyponormal ones, exploiting recent results (joint with J. Yoon) which highlight some of the pathology that arises when a Berger measure is absent, and using the groupoid techniques introduced in joint work with P. Muhly.<br/><br/>Hilbert space operators are infinite generalizations of matrices.  The infinite generalization of a vector is frequently a function and for this reason Hilbert space operators are frequently modeled as the operator of multiplication on a space of functions.  Part of this project involves finding such models for operators or tuples of operators.  Once such models are obtained many basic questions about the structure of these operators become more natural.  A separate part of the research deals with inverse problems, esp. moment problems, which are related to power moments of mass distributions, and arise naturally in statistics, spectral analysis, geophysics, image recognition, and economics.  Our research is aimed at resolving some outstanding problems in multivariable operator theory, while creating recruitment and retention opportunities for women and minorities to pursue careers in mathematics, by engaging their participation in projects related to the interaction of mathematics with other sciences.  The results on truncated moment problems have been used by S. McCullough to obtain a structure theorem in Fejr-Riesz factorization theory; by J. Lasserre in the study of semi-algebraic subset of the plane; and by J. Lasserre and M. Laurent to convert polynomial optimization into an instance of semidefinite programming.  We anticipate that such connections with areas outside of operator theory will continue to arise.  Several open problems in this proposal are written to generate research projects accessible to undergraduate and graduate students, especially those related to cubatures, low-degree moment problems, their connections with algebraic geometry, and multivariable weighted shifts.  <br/>"

One topic concerns the complex structure of domains arising naturally in holomorphic dynamical systems. It is conjectured that a stable manifold of a hyperbolic holomorphic automorphism is biholomorphically equivalent to complex Euclidean space. Instead of studying stable manifolds for one automorphism, one can translate the problem to the more general setting where an attracting basin of a sequence of automorphisms is studied. This topic is related to open problems in several complex variables and complex geometry. Another suggested topic is to study the polynomial automorphism groups in three or more complex variables. In two variables the structure of the polynomial automorphism group is known exactly, which is extremely helpful to those interested in iteration problems of polynomial automorphisms. A recent breakthrough by Shestakov and Umirbaev in dimension three has renewed the interest in this classical problem. In addition to discrete dynamical systems, the principal investigator will also study Riemann surface laminations in complex projective space. Examples of such laminations may occur by integrating holomorphic vector fields.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems are used throughout the sciences to model movement and change. Many dynamical systems suitable for rigorous analysis are generated by very special mappings, namely, by polynomials, rational functions, or other real analytic functions. It is natural to extend such functions to the complex plane so that the tools of complex analysis can be used to investigate these systems. Often the study of the corresponding complex analytic dynamical system gives valuable information regarding the original problem. This project considers dynamical systems in several complex variables. The problems put forth in this proposal are motivated by and related to problems in complex analysis, complex geometry, and affine algebraic geometry, areas that have a broad range of interest and application both within mathematics and within other disciplines.<br/>"

The annual Shanks Lectures at the Department of Mathematics, Vanderbilt University date back to 1985.  The SEAM affords established and new researchers, and advanced graduate students, the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas and discuss the wide variety of mathematics encompassed within modern and classical analysis. In particular, the conference has traditionally provided an opportunity for young researchers to present their work and to discuss their research with more experienced mathematicians. The diverse topics presented during the conference provide a unique opportunity to see the wide variety of problems in analysis.   The Shanks Lectures have played a prominent role in the Mathematics Department at Vanderbilt University for the past 23 years.

A related aspect of the project is the rapid generation of data sampling points on curved surfaces (such as the earth) which can be used to measure a variety of physical properties.   Such methods for point generation are also useful for testing detection devices such as radar systems.

Roughly speaking, in harmonic analysis one investigates properties of functions and ``operators"" (i.e., mappings which transform one function into another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces, which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the pieces.  The name itself arose by analogy to the decomposition of a musical sound into its various frequency components (``harmonics"").  Geometric measure theory involves the study of the relationship between geometric properties of sets, and their ``measures"" (the latter are generalizations of the notions of length, area, and volume).  Partial differential equations and systems of elliptic type describe a wide variety of phenomena in the real world, including electrostatics, and steady-state temperature distributions and elastic deformations.  In the last decade the interplay between these different subfields of mathematics has turned out to be a fertile ground for investigation, with much exciting work remaining to be done.  Progress on the problems to be considered would in all likelihood open up further avenues of investigation in these areas. All such progress will be disseminated by the PI via lectures at conferences, seminars and graduate courses, and via electronic preprints posted on his website and on the ArXiv.  The PI plans to involve two postdocs and two graduate students in work related to this project."

The other part applies the Bellman function method to computing the operator norms of the maximal function on Lebesgue spaces in non-martingale settings, the Riesz transforms on the space BMO, and the generalized Beurling-Ahlfors transform on differential forms; in addition, an extension of earlier sharp results for the John-Nirenberg inequality is studied.<br/><br/>Among the practical areas that may be directly affected by the project are the fields of image and signal processing, including applications to medical tomography.

The Bellman function method itself links such computation to the existence of positive solutions to certain differential equations. On the other hand, the theoretical synergy, which is at the heart of the project, will result in the development of novel powerful techniques, affecting applied as well as pure aspects of Fourier analysis.

The theory of subfactors was intitiated by Jones, who discovered symmetries associated to certain inclusions of von Neumann algebras which led to powerful new knot invariants. This geometric aspect of subfactor theory is captured in the notion of a planar algebra, developed by Jones as a description of the standard invariant of a subfactor, which had been axiomatized by Popa. Subfactor theory can be thought of as a nonommutative Galois theory, and it is an open problem to classify lattices of intermediate subfactors. The present project will study intermediate subfactors along several distinct but related lines. First, we will continue the classification of quadrilaterals of subfactors, on which the PI has previously worked with Jones and with Izumi. Second, we will analyze planar relations that reflect the presence of multiple intermediate subfactors, following work of Bisch-Jones on the planar algebra of a single intermediate subfactor. Third, we will study compositions of supertransitive subfactors, following Bisch-Haagerup's study of compositions of group-type subfactors. <br/><br/><br/>The theory of operator algebras was inspired by von Neuamnn's work on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, and has been closely linked with mathematical physics ever since. Subfactor theory in particular has had applications to statistical mechanics and to algebraic quantum field theory. The planar algebra approach is a new direction to understanding the underlying symmetries. Intermediate subfactors, which are algebras sandwiched in between two von Neumann algebras, represent ""sub-symmetries"", and understanding these sub-symmetries is a fundamental problem in subfactor theory. This project aims to apply the theory of planar algebras to the classification of intermediate subfactors. This should lead to a better understanding of planar algebras and the structure of von Neumann algebras. <br/>"

The PI plans to use methods and techniques of harmonic analysis (on the group of affine transformations of a real line) to search for a corresponding deformation theory in the framework of C* algebras, which can be considered as the set of continuous functions over noncommutative spaces. Other topics in this project concern cyclic cohomology, a noncommutative analogue of the classical De Rham cohomology, which encodes some topological properties of the algebras in question.

The latter is expected to provide quantitative information of interest to physical practitioners in shock and detonation theory. A larger goal is to move beyond simple stability analysis to the study of nontrivial dynamics including bifurcation, interaction, and behavior of complex flows. The project involves interesting and nonstandard issues in singular perturbation theory, dynamical systems and bifurcation, spectral theory of linear operators, and nonlinear partial differential equations, and should result in the development of new mathematical tools of general application. The plan of attack centers around Evans function and related spectral techniques developed recently by the investigator and various collaborators.<br/><br/>The stability of regular flow patterns is an old and central topic in fluid, gas, and plasma dynamics, deciding which (stable) patterns will typically be observed, and which  unstable) are only mathematical and not physically observable solutions.  The transition from stability to instability is of particular importance, since it usually signals the appearance of alternative, more complicated flow patterns close to the original (now unstable) one- this is a way to understand complicated flows by the study of simpler and better-understood ones.  Our goal is to move existing theory from the qualitative to the quantitative regime, obtaining new information of use to practitioners at the same time that we advance the mathematical theory.  The planned activities  expected to strengthen and extend existing networks of cooperation across field, and to aid in training of graduate and postdoctoral students. The ultimate aim of these investigations, of quantitative predictions of transition to instability, would, if achieved, be of direct and practical use at the level of engineering, in chemical, manufacturing, and other processes."

These systems are closely related mathematically, all sharing common features with the Navier-Stokes equations of multidimensional, compressible fluid flow and arise in a variety of applications, including the flow of compressible fluids and gases, shallow-water theory, magnetohydrodynamics, and the modeling of self-gravitating stellar systems. The primary goal of the project is to achieve precise, mathematically certain statements about these models by applying techniques from the fields of analysis and partial differential equations. This research seeks to impact the underlying physical science by validating the models, setting limits on the range of applicability of the models, or in some cases even invalidating the models under consideration. At the intellectual level it applies a reasoning process quite distinct from that in which laboratory data is compared with predictions based on numerical simulations. Indeed, the mathematical mechanisms which insure well-posedness of realistic models nearly always have physical counterparts; this means that the challenge to analyze these models with strict mathematical rigor is also a challenge to understand the physical phenomena at a newer, deeper level. Additionally, by identifying the correct framework in which a mathematical model is well-posed and the mathematical mechanisms which make it so, this research can point the way to the effective design of methods for generating approximate solutions by computer simulation. <br/><br/>This project will address various mathematical questions relating to important physical models of compressible fluids and materials. These models arise in a broad range of applications, including supersonic flight, dynamic meteorology, combustion processes, and stellar dynamics. While the main goal in constructing these models is to achieve a predictive capability, the systems of equations which comprise them are far too complicated to be ""solved"" in any explicit sense. On the other hand, adequate approximate solutions can frequently be generated by computer methods. The intelligent and effective design of such methods depends crucially, however, on a rigorous understanding of why solutions do exist, in what sense they exist, and in what ways they are sensitive to noise in the data. The project will therefore seek to provide this rigorous mathematical framework for these models and to determine possible limits on the range of their applicability. A second goal of the project will be to attract and nurture the development of younger mathematicians to this area of research. Specifically, the PI will continue collaborative research with present and future graduate students and postdocs, will teach an advanced graduate-level course on mathematical problems in compressible flow in the second year of the grant period, and will continue supervising undergraduate research in Indiana University's REU program approximately every third summer. <br/>"

Harmonic measure is a fundamental object in complex analysis, and its multifractal structure provides an appropriate framework in which to describe the conformal geometry of sets in the complex plane. It is well known that harmonic measure exhibits its extremal behavior in domains that are bounded by fractal sets (i.e., sets of nonintegral Hausdorff dimension). Experience has shown that in this context it is more productive to work with random fractals than with deterministic ones. A motivating reason for doing so is that it allows one to bring to bear on problems a wide range of powerful probabilistic and analytic tools. There are a number of classes of random fractals that arise in physics as scaling limits of lattice models and that simulate real physical phenomena. Study of the multifractal structure of harmonic measure on such random fractals may help to solve some longstanding problems in geometric function theory -- or at least to improve significantly our understanding of them. The research will also shed new light on the linkages between complex analysis and theoretical physics. <br/><br/>The project is closely related to multifractal analysis, an interdisciplinary subject that lies on the border between mathematics and physics. It emphasizes interaction between complex analysis, probability theory, and statistical physics. All these areas can benefit from this project.

His genius at mathematics began early in life. He started to learn calculus when he was 7 years old, at which age he began high school; by the age of 9 he was already very good at university-level calculus. By the age of 11, he was thriving in international mathematics competitions. Tao was 20 when he earned his doctorate from Princeton University, and he joined UCLA's faculty that year.

This is a nonlinear Schroedinger equation which arises from geometrical considerations and also as a version of the Heisenberg model of ferro-magnetism. The fundamental question is, under what conditions on the data, is there global existence of the solutions and when is there ""blow-up"" of solutions. To study this, we shall investigate the dynamics of solutions with very rough initial data and will use fine tools from harmonic analysis and Riemannian geometry as well as partial differential equations methods. It is expected that the analysis will be more difficult than the Wave map equation which has been studied extensively recently.  The Schroedinger map equation has a special nonlinear term; under this project various other non-generic nonlinearities will also be studied. <br/><br/>Since the primary problems to be studied in this project arise in well-known physical theories, the results obtained should have some impact for theories of electromagnetism and ferromagnetic materials.

In some remarkable experiments, the experimentalists have learned to tune the inter-atomic interaction from very weak to very strong, observing thereby different phases of the gas. Within our first project we intend to study the weak-coupling regime, which is usually called the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-regime. Mathematically, this regime can be quite accurately described by the famous BCS gap-equation. This equation describes the wavefunction of, so called, Cooper pairs. It is highly non-linear, nonetheless, in a recent work we were able to link the BCS gap-equation to the spectral analysis of a linear, pseudo-differential, operator. This allowed a precise characterization of the class of potentials giving rise to superfluidity. In further projects we plan to study the energy gap, continuity properties of the momentum distribution, and higher order calculations of the critical temperature, as well as systems with where the two spin states are unequally populated, all questions that are particularly important for applications, such as the classification of different types of superfluids. <br/><br/>Our second project concerns the study of relativistic particles, described by Dirac's operator. In recent works with Lewin, Solovej and Sere we established a framework within mean-field approximation which allows us to obtain ground states via a minimization principle, which is a major departure from prior results.  Although originally developed in the context of QED these methods can be applied to quite arbitrary infinite quantum systems. All our previous results hold in the case of  zero temperature. In near future we plan to extend<br/>our results to arbitrary positive temperature. The second part of our project on Dirac particles is associated with gravitational forces.  First, we consider classical Newtonian forces and study a time-evolution which is supposed to describe the dynamical collapse of white dwarfs. Second, we plan a more innovative approach, incorporating general relativity. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The goal is to develop new mathematical tools for superfluid systems and Dirac systems. Such methods lead to different points of views and increase the understanding of the underlying physical systems. For example, in the long run, such methods could help to understand the mechanism of high T_c-superconductors. These have all kind of applications such as ultrafast computers, magnetic levitation, loss-less powergrid, etc. The work will include multiple collaborative efforts and contribute to the training of PhD students."

The first area involves analysis on rough geometries.  This includes analysis on domains with rough boundaries.  Work with S. Hofmann and M. Mitrea has developed the theory of singular integral operators on a class of uniformly rectifiable domains that the authors call regular Semmes-Kenig-Toro domains, characterizing them as the class for which certain important families of layer potentials are compact, and has opened up what promises to be a very successful expansion of the theory of elliptic systems to this class of roughly bounded domains.  Another topic in this area that Taylor will continue to investigate involves wave propagation on manifolds with rough metric tensor, arising as Gromov-Hausdorff limits of a class of smooth Riemannian manifolds with Ricci tensor bounded below.  The second area involves evolution equations.  Taylor has worked with A. Mazzucato, M. Lopes Filho, and H. Nussenzveig Filho and produced a detailed analysis of the vanishing viscosity limit of 2D circularly symmetric Navier-Stokes flows, with particular emphasis on the behavior of the boundary layer.  Taylor and Mazzucato have been investigating a class of 3D channel flows, and have a program that is beginning to yield results on this technically more challenging problem.  They plan to push further the results they have on these flows, variants such as pipe flows, and related singular perturbation problems.  Taylor also proposes to continue to investigate analogues of the Gibbs phenomenon and the Pinsky phenomenon that arise in the short time behavior of solutions to nonlinear dispersive equations with discontinuous initial data, expanding the scope from nonlinear Schrodinger equations to other classes.<br/><br/>The analytical tools developed to tackle these problems have the potential to impact both the understanding of fundamental mathematical issues and the understanding of physical phenomena, such as wave phenomena and fluid flow phenomena, which these mathematical theories address.  Taylor?s work on boundary problems has dealt with the problem of how to identify a region by how its boundary vibrates, and is part of a vigorous effort to identify hidden structures, be they behind a wall or underground.  Many important fluids have very small viscosity, and understanding the role of this small viscosity in their behavior is an old and challenging problem, on which recent progress can produce new insights.  The proposed work also has applications to the understanding of propagation of electromagnetic waves and elastic waves, which are vibrational modes in solid materials.  The project will also play a role in training graduate students, including Taylor?s Ph.D. students.<br/>"

Most of the proposed problems revolve around a harmonic analysis problem -- the Small Ball inequality, which provides a lower bound for hyperbolic sums of Haar functions. While in two dimensions the sharp form of the inequality is established, the higher dimensional case is extremely difficult due to subtle combinatorial complications. This inequality is intimately related to the discrepancy theory, although this connection is  yet to be understood. One of the main objects in this theory - the discrepancy function - quantifies the extent of equidistribution of a point set and measures the set's adequacy for numerical integration. It is known that this function must necessarily be large in various senses, however precise estimates in the most interesting cases are established only in two dimensions. The Small Ball inequality is also related to sharp estimates of the small deviation probabilities for Gaussian processes, in particular the Brownian Sheet, and the entropy number estimates of certain mixed derivative spaces in approximation theory.<br/>   <br/>This project investigates important and delicate connections between diverse fields of mathematics. Some parts of the proposed research have potential for applications in areas outside pure mathematics, e.g. mathematical finance.

The meaning of the words faithful, big, and low is clearly context dependent, and it is often the case that winning a little more in one of these three categories yields a loss in the other two.  In many cases it   makes sense to assume something about the geometry of the data set.  This task has thus far yielded much attention from computer scientists and applied mathematicians using  a wide range of approaches. The PI proposes to use and develop  harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory techniques to attack these problems.

Some problems that the PI is planning to work are related to time-frequency analysis, which was used in the celebrated Lacey-Thiele's theorem on the bi-linear Hilbert transform. These problems include uniform bounds for the bi-linear Hilbert transform,  the disc and the corresponding maximal bi-linear  multiplier,  the Hilbert transform along Lipschitz vector fields, and multi-linear Carleson-type operators arising in the almost everywhere convergence of  spherical partial sums of Fourier series in higher dimensions.  Some problems are related to Szemer\'edi's theorem on arithmetic progression and the (multilinear) oscillatory integrals, in which the time frequency analysis is unvaluable. These type of problems contain the bi-linear Hilbert transform along curves, and the multi-linear oscillatory integrals along curves, the muliti-linear oscillatory integrals with non-degenerate phases which was first studied by Christ, Tao, Thiele and the PI. Some problems are associated to the Kakeya problem such as the Lipschitz maximal functions, initiated by Lacey and the PI, and the Zygmund conjecture. Recently, C. Muscalu and the PI generalized the Carleson-Hunt theorem to the multi-linear case.  And M. Lacey and the PI had been able to use the time-frequency analysis to obtain some conditional results for the Hilbert transform along Lipschitz vector fields. A fundamental subject in analysis is the differentiability of the integral of certain functions. Recently M. Lacey and the PI proved some estimates for a Lipschitz Kakeya maximal function by a completely new method based on some crucial geometric observations. It turns out that a complete understanding of the Lipschitz Kakeya maximal function is a key to answer the question on the differentiablity of certain functions in a Lipschitz choice of directions, which was posed by A. Zygmund about seventy years ago. The Hilbert transform along curves had been understood well by work of many people in the last several decades. However, the bi-linear Hilbert transform along curves is a new field. Some partial results such as  uniform estimates for some para-products arising in the study of this type of problem were obtained by the PI. As the linear case, the relation of multi-linear singular integrals along curves and  multi-linear oscillatory integrals is an interesting and important topic in analysis. This relation is only partially understood. Based on it,  D. Fan and the PI obtained an affirmative result for the bi-linear oscillatory integral along parabolas incorporating some oscillatory factors, which is a starting point for understanding the bi-linear Hilbert transform along curves. <br/> <br/>The main theme in harmonic analysis is disassembling and assembling complicated objects into simpler well-understood pieces, called frequencies, by analogy to decomposing musical pieces into arrangements of a few basic tones. In signal processing, harmonic analysis is used in the detection of irregularities of signals and images, the protection against the loss of information due to a sudden and unexpected interruption, and the retrieval of the original data. These applications provide the main practical motivation for some theoretical research described in this proposal. The research experience and results gained by investigating these difficult problems such as the Stein's and Zygmund's conjectures help the PI better understand a wide range of topics. It also provides the PI with some new visions on mathematics that greatly benefits the PI's teaching.

We will focus on the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian, the thin obstacle problem, nonlinear integro-differential operators, and optimal design of composites. The obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian is closely linked to lower dimensional obstacle problems, as the PI has recently shown in collaborative work. Thus these two problems will be investigated together. The PI also intends to generalize the concepts of viscosity solutions, well-posedness, and regularity results from the theory of fully nonlinear elliptic equations to nonlinear integro-differential equations. The PI intends to apply ideas from free boundary problems to some questions about composite design in materials science. The microstructures that maximize a certain effective quantity, or a combination of such, may sometimes be found by solving a free boundary problem. Analysis of this problem will provide a better understanding of these optimal structures.<br/><br/>The free boundary problems studied in this project arise in elasticity, financial mathematics, and composite material design. The obstacle problem is originally a model for the shape of an elastic membrane resting on a solid body. The same equation is used in financial mathematics for pricing American options. When stock prices have large jumps they may be modeled using discontinuous processes; this results in an obstacle problem for an integro-differential operator. The research proposed here studies the qualitative properties of the solutions of this problem as well as general nonlinear problems arising from stochastic games driven by random processes with jumps. Related ideas are also applied to the design of composite materials.  Suitable free boundary problems enable the analysis of the microscopic structures that are optimal for certain purposes, such as to maximize  the sum of the thermal and electric conductivity in a material.<br/><br/><br/>"

The geometry may result, for example, from the introduction of a boundary, from the influence of a nonflat metric, or from consideration of nonhomogeneous materials. One major aspect of this project is to study global-in-time measures of dispersion, such as localized energy estimates and Strichartz estimates, for variable coefficient wave equations. As compared to the flat cases, one encounters additional difficulties that arise, for instance, because of the focusing of Hamiltonian rays, trapped rays, and the possibility of eigenfunctions or resonances. A particular example of interest is to study the wave equation on nonflat solutions to Einstein's equations, such as the Schwarzschild space-time. A second major component of this project is to study the long-time existence of solutions to certain nonlinear wave or elastic wave equations. Of special interest here are problems in anisotropic elasticity or existence questions for nonlinear wave equations in exterior domains where certain invariances, which are typically used to prove long-time existence, are not available.<br/><br/>A class of fundamental open questions in theoretical physics revolves around the stability of solutions to Einstein's equations.  Namely, if the universe starts close to a certain known solution, one might seek to prove that it remains close to that solution for all later times. The only known rigorous proofs of stability are for the so-called flat solution. It is believed that a good understanding of the dispersive nature of wave equations will play an essential role in any proof of stability, and the first set of questions described above seeks to provide some insights into this. Understanding the lifespan of solutions to partial differential equations is of basic interest.  The objective is to estimate the amount of time that a solution may exist prior to, say, becoming infinitely large (blow-up phenomena). Of particular interest in this project is the lifespan of solutions to certain problems in nonlinear elasticity. These problems resemble certain questions in nonlinear wave equations where the proofs of long-time existence rely heavily on the many invariances of the linear wave equation. In nonhomogeneous materials, however, these invariances may be lost, so different techniques are required. As a model problem for problems where isotropy is maintained in planes, such as hexagonal crystals, certain two-dimensional isotropic problems will first be studied. Here one must make more delicate use of the nonlinear structure of the equations in order to show such long-time existence."

The main work will be on harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces and the corresponding representation theory. This work includes both Riemannian and non-Riemannian symmetric spaces, compact and non-compact spaces as well as the infinite dimensional limits of those spaces. The focus is on the interplay between geometry and harmonic analysis/representation theory. The work combines methods and ideas from several areas of mathematics: complex analysis, group action on real and complex manifolds, classical harmonic analysis, and applied mathematics. Most parts of our projects will be carried out in collaboration with specialists in the USA, Europe and Mexico. Other problems involve participation of our graduate students. The first set of problems centers about local Paley-Wiener type theorems for compact symmetric spaces and their inductive limits. In short, the problem is to describe the image of the space of smooth functions, supported in a sufficiently small geodesic ball, as holomorphic functions of exponential growth. We will also study the projective limit of those spaces to derive a Paley-Wiener type theorem for inductive limit of symmetric spaces. Later we will also consider similar problems for more general commutative spaces.  A second class of problems is related to the image of the heat semigroup in the space of holomorphic functions on the crown. Here we will also consider infinite dimensional limit. Other planned research directions involve geometric action of simple Lie groups on compact manifolds and harmonic analysis on compactification of Riemannian and non-Riemannian symmetric spaces as homogeneous spaces. This leads to questions of decomposing restricitions of unitary representations to subgroups and generalization of some will known results for complex bounded symmetric domains to their real counterparts. Our work will also involve problems from harmonic analysis on Euclidean space, in particular Radon transforms, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, wavelet analysis, wavelet sets, harmonic analysis related to finite Coxeter groups, and function spaces associated to representations of topological groups (generalized Coorbit spaces) as well as function spaces related to Schrodinger operators (Besov spaces). <br/><br/>Harmonic analysis and geometry are two subjects closely related to physics and applied sciences. Those two topics include wide spectrum of deep and wide-ranging problems in pure and applied mathematics as well as basic sciences.  Our research is centered around fundamental questions in harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces. Those spaces can serve as models or approximation for the real world that we live in. Other problems that we plan to work on involve questions arising in engineering and sciences, in particular wavelet analysis and Radon transforms. One of our planned projects includes the use of symmetries to construct function spaces as well as constructing minimal wavelets in higher dimension.  The proposed research involves the graduate student of the PI and helps educate them in research and mathematical reasoning."

The multi-scales and complexity of the problems in nature often necessitate the use of random media. In many applications, it is also common to have only ``statistical'' (random) and not ``exact'' (deterministic) information. In addition, the modeling of the fluctuations of the physically relative quantities leads to equations  with ``singular'' (white noise type) dependence on some of the variables. In this context, random homogenization and stochastic partial differential equations become the natural mathematical objects. The randomness is associated with singular dependence on the state variables and lack of compactness, two facts that give rise to challenging mathematical problems. Overcoming them requires the development of new methods and techniques. In biology, recent experiments at the molecular scale have led to new sophisticated mathematical models. Novel tools and ideas are needed to study these problems further and to identify all the relevant regimes/scales of the parameters, which affect  the experimentally observed behavior.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to continue his program to develop methods to study nonlinear deterministic (parabolic/elliptic and hyperbolic) deterministic and stochastic partial differential equations arising in models in areas such as continuum and statistical physics, biology, engineering, etc. The emphasis of the proposal is on the development of theories for <br/>(i) weak (stochastic viscosity) solutions of fully nonlinear, (degenerate) parabolic<br/>stochastic pde, <br/>(ii) the homogenization of nonlinear, parabolic/elliptic and hyperbolic pde in spatio-temporal random  media, <br/>(iii) the study of properties (regularity, error estimates) of viscosity solutions, and (iv) the analysis of some  models in mathematical biology.<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

It also proposes to study a closely related problem whether K-theoretic data of a minimal dynamic system could determine the structure of the minimal dynamic system by studying the associated transformation C*-algebra together with other K-theoretic data of the system.  Viewing C*-algebras as non-commutative topological spaces, it also proposes to study (approximate) homotopy theory in C*-algebras.<br/><br/><br/>In the micro-scopical physical world, an observable may be modeled by a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space, according to Dirac and von Neumann. A system of such operators forms a C*-algebra. Such a system has the structure of addition and multiplication like the system of complex numbers. However, in a C*-algebra, multiplication may not be commutative which corresponds to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Let X be a compact metric space and F be a transformation from X to X which is assumed to be invertible and both F and its inverse are continuous. The pair (X, F) forms the associated transformation C*-algebra.  To study the dynamical structure of (X, F), one may start with the associated C*-algebra.  The study of the structure of the associated C*-algebra provides the information of the original dynamical system. One of such examples is the special case that X is the unit circle and F is an irrational rotation on the circle. The associated C*-algebra is a unital separable simple amenable C*-algebra. This C*-algebra can also be formed by a typical non-commutative relation of two unitary operators. It is also known as non-commutative torus. There are many C*-algebras come from different fields of sciences and the study of C*-algebras has variety of applications. For example, C*-algebras may be formed by operators on some Hilbert spaces, by classical dynamic systems, by non-commutative geometry, by group representations, or, by many other studies such as quantization. To classify a class of C*-algebras is to use a few computable data to completely determine C*-algebras in the class and their structure, in the process, one may also understand the related operators on Hilbert spaces, dynamical systems, non-commutative geometry, group representations, and, in turn, these may further provide applications to other parts of the scientific world.<br/>"

The third cluster contains a number of questions in computational complexity theory: computational complexity classes, QMA-completeness, the connection between gapped Hamiltonians and complexity, and the computational power of stoquastic Hamiltonians, all of which relate to quantum spin systems.<br/><br/>Condensed matter physicists, mathematical physicists, functional analysts, workers in quantum computation, and computer scientists recently have begun to discover the close relationships that exist between several of the important questions in their respective fields.  A small number of key properties about quantum spin Hamiltonians, the dynamics they generate, and their ground states are the main ingredients needed to address questions about the physical behavior of quantum spin models, about the computational efficiency of numerical algorithms to compute ground state properties and simulate dynamics, and about new complexity classes that are emerging in the theory of quantum computation.  This project brings together experts in condensed matter physics, functional analysis and spectral theory, probability theory, and computer science to develop a coherent mathematical theory that clarifies the interrelationships of these key properties and, in particular, their relevance for the emerging field of quantum complexity theory in the context of quantum computation. <br/>"

The problems divide roughly into two areas, positivity conditions in complex analysis and CR geometry. The ideas on positivity conditions have already had an impact on the principal investigator's work on complex variables analogues of Hilbert's seventeenth problem, his work with Catlin on isometric imbedding, and his work with Varolin on stability criteria for Hermitian metrics. One of the main concerns here is a nonlinear Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, both for metrics on holomorphic line bundles and in a general setting. The second area primarily concerns CR mappings between spheres and hyperquadrics. Two main issues arise: group-invariant CR mappings and the complexity of smooth CR mappings between spheres in different dimensions. The group-invariant mappings exhibit surprising connections with number theory and combinatorics. The principal investigator intends to explore the connection with number theory. For instance, he will investigate certain cubic and higher order Diophantine equations that arise when considering CR mappings from Lens spaces to hyperquadrics. These equations involve an injectivity result that is elementary in the simplest case, where binomial coefficients arise, but quite subtle in general. He will continue to develop notions of complexity for CR mappings, to study proper holomorphic mappings, and to seek connections with sub-Riemannian geometry.<br/><br/>Mapping theorems in one complex dimension have played a crucial role in mathematics, physics, and engineering for at least a century. The situation in higher dimensions is much more subtle and new phenomena arise. Eventually the applications of higher dimensional complex analysis will permeate all of science, as one-dimensional complex analysis does now. The crucial point of departure in this research is to pass from the unit circle to the unit sphere. The role of CR mappings between spheres in different dimensions has become more prominent in recent years. CR mappings are boundary analogues of complex analytic mappings. Their study leads to an unusual combination of analysis, geometry, and algebra. Progress has led to complex variables analogues of Hilbert's seventeenth problem, to isometric imbedding theorems, to a new kind of complexity theory, and to helical CR structures.  Recent investigations have led to number-theoretic questions that form the foundation for the proposed work. This work will continue to impact complex analysis, especially via the portion concerning positivity conditions, but it will also broaden the scope of CR Geometry to include applications to complexity theory and to number theory. The proposer has organized several meetings around these topics, a program in 2005 at MSRI for graduate students and a workshop in 2006 at AIM for researchers. He will be giving a course at PCMI to graduate students on related material. Finally, he has introduced both his postdoctoral fellow Jiri Lebl and his current graduate student Dusty Grundmeier to the possible new applications of CR geometry."

A common thread of these problems is that they have a variational formulation which has a geometric interpretation. By focusing on the relationship between the analytical aspects and geometric aspects of these nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, the PI  will develop new methods and techniques to systematically obtain energy estimates, free boundary regularity bounds, and well-posedness. The research will be based on the geometric methods that arise either from variational principles or from the geometric nature of the problems and analytical methods that arise in studying existence, uniqueness, regularity, and long-time behavior of solutions to nonlinear PDEs. <br/><br/>These problems are prototypical for the study of free boundary regularity and rapidly-oscillating solutions in hyperbolic partial differential equations. Their resolution should be an important contribution to our understanding of this area. They are a cohesive set of problems that will require new methods and techniques that may well be useful in other area of PDEs. Fluid interface problems arise in many physical, medical, and engineering models. Problems involving fluid-vacuum interfaces arise in the study of water waves and astrophysics including the shape of stars. Problems involving fluid-fluid interfaces arise in multi-phase fluid flows while problems involving fluid-deformable structure interfaces arise in biomedical modeling such as cell deformation. Interface problems in magneto-hydro-dynamics are central to the theoretical and practical study of producing energy by fusion. The free boundary problems to be studied in this project may shed light on the instabilities present in the magnetic fields used for confining plasmas. We will also study the interface between hot and cool plasmas, i.e., the transport barrier. A systematic mathematical analysis of these problems should help us understand how various types of instabilities originate. The identification of ill-posed problems should also be very beneficial for modeling considerations and applications.<br/>"

I gave several applications of these ideas, notably to the convergence of matrix algebras to coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups. I propose to continue to strengthen this theory, and to apply it in several directions suggested by the many situations in the physics and mathematics of quantization where one has a sequence of quantum spaces which appear to be converging to another space, either quantum or classical. As a major new direction I will try to develop an analogous theory for the quantum versions of the superstructure of vector bundles, connections, Yang-Mills actions, etc. I will also try to extend my theory beyond the quantum analog of locally compact spaces, so as to attempt to deal with the approximations of quantum field-theory models, especially those of integrable systems, say by quantum lattice models. <br/><br/>Our nation's technological and economic success has at its foundation the mathematical models of the world around us which scientists develop in order to understand how to use the flood of data which flows from the laboratories of the experimental scientists. But human beings and computers can only deal with finite collections of numbers at a time.  Thus in applying these mathematical models it is almost always necessary to approximate the infinite variability of our world by finite collections of numbers. It is then crucial to understand how valid any given approximation is. With respect to individual calculations this matter has received extensive study. But less study has been made of how complex models as a whole can be approximated well by simpler models as a whole. Relatively little is known about such ""global"" approximations in the case of the models of quantum physics, which is the part of physics which governs chemical and biochemical reactions, the functioning of semi-conductors, and many other key technologies. In the classical realm there is an important form of global approximation called Gromov-Hausdorff distance. I have developed a quantum analog of it, and successfully applied it to a few examples. I propose to strengthen this theory, and to apply it to a broader class of examples, so as to better understand how to effectively approximate various models of quantum phenomena of current interest.<br/>"

The main focus of the proposed research is the study of dynamical systems with multidimensional time. Intensive research during the past two decades proved that wide variety of such systems which display certain degree of chaotic behavior, are remarkably rigid. These results induced fast progress towards some long standing conjectures in number theory and quantum mechanics.  Rigidity of such systems stands in sharp contrast with flexibility of chaotic systems with one-dimensional time. There are two main themes within the proposed research. The first is to explore further stability and rigidity of algebraic multidimensional-time systems with less chaotic behavior: existence and local rigidity (i.e. differentiable stability) of partially hyperbolic abelian actions on nilmanifolds, and local rigidity of parabolic abelian actions on certain classes of locally symmetric spaces. In this direction the proposed research involves the KAM theory approach and thus requires a detailed study of the corresponding infinitesimal problem: the description of the first cohomology over these actions.  The second theme is to explore the existence and stability properties of non-algebraic systems which are strongly partially hyperbolic.  Such systems have specific structure of invariant foliations which on one hand  imposes restrictions for the manifold of the action, and on the other hand it tends to be robust under small perturbations thus leading to certain degree of stability for the action. The research in this direction leads towards global classification of strongly partially hyperbolic multidimensional-time systems.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems and chaos are the areas of mathematics which have flourished during past years while maintaining a strong connection with their roots which lie in the study of various phenomena in domains like cell biology, nano technology, meteorology and engineering. The studies of evolution of nature systems in time represent one of the core scientific interests today. The problem of stability of systems is one of the main issues which arises in the study of nature systems as mathematical models are merely approximations of the natural phenomena. In celestial mechanics, stability of the solar system is one important topic, and the KAM theory turned out to be a powerful tool towards better understanding of the system's long term behavior. Systems with multi-dimensional time appear in quantum mechanics, where rigidity of such systems is present in the form of uniform distribution of quantum states.  Multidimensional-(lattice) time systems also appear in the mathematical formalism for quasicrystals, whose physical properties and generation have been intensively studied. In hardware architecture one of the recently explored venues is extending the classical methodology to multidimensional time (multidimensional scheduling). The principal investigator will continue to encourage undergraduate students, female in particular,  to take active part in the research process and will make an effort to expose them to various aspects and applications of this research. These activities will benefit from the grant."

This will be the Institute's principal activity during that period.<br/><br/>Arithmetic geometry is the application of methods of algebraic geometry to questions of relevance to number theory.  Specifically, given a system of equations for which one wants to study its rational solutions (or solutions over a given number field), one studies this system using methods of algebraic geometry and attempts to show finiteness or sparseness of the set of solutions.  The focus of this program is to do so using ideas stemming from the Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem in diophantine approximation.<br/><br/>Hyperbolic geometry (as envisioned by this program) is the study of analytic functions from the complex plane to complex algebraic manifolds, again studied through the lens of algebraic geometry.  If there are no such functions (other than constant functions), then the manifold is said to be hyperbolic.  A weaker condition would be to show that such maps have sparse image.  The main methods used in this program stem from the work of R. Nevanlinna in value distribution theory.<br/><br/>Although the above two paragraphs describe very different areas of mathematics, their statements and methods have been found to be very similar, for reasons that are not fully understood.

The funds will be used principally to support young mathematicians who do not have other sources of support, but may also help cover travel expenses of some senior participants.

Particular attention will be paid to non-commutative objects and phenomena, and to links with other areas of mathematics and other mathematical sciences, which motivate most of the problems that are being studied. Sample research topics include: structural properties of high-dimensional convex bodies and of high-dimensional normed spaces, metric entropy (of convex sets or of linear operators) and duality of such entropy, derandomization of various probabilistic constructions appearing in functional analysis, some geometric questions related to quantum information theory and quantum computing, and problems motivated by links to mathematical programming. Typically, the questions are (or can be) expressed in the language of geometry of Banach spaces (of high, but finite dimension) and are to be analyzed using the diverse methods that originated or were developed in that context. The approach depends on identifying and exploiting approximate symmetries of various problems that escaped the earlier ""too qualitative"" or ""too rigid"" methods of classical functional analysis and classical geometry. Finally, to explain our emphasis on non-commutativity, we point out that it simply reflects the fact that the final outcome of a process may depend on the order of operations involved; the best known, but by far not the only manifestation of that principle is quantum mechanics.<br/>  <br/>On the elementary level, Analysis is a study of functions, or relationships between quantities and the parameters on which they depend. Since very many naturally appearing relationships are linear or at least convex, a good understanding of convex functions and, consequently, of convex sets is a prerequisite for understanding those relationships. The number of free parameters in the underlying problem can often be related to the dimension of objects in the corresponding mathematical model. Since real-life systems or processes (say, physical, biological or economic) usually exhibit very many degrees of freedom, the high-dimensional setting is of particular interest. This is exactly the domain of asymptotic geometric analysis, which studies quantitative properties of various geometric structures as the dimension goes to infinity. While investigation of high-dimensional phenomena often suffers from the curse of dimensionality (the complexity of the problem exploding with the increase in dimension and resulting in intractability), we may say that the asymptotic approach exploits the blessing of dimensionality, with symmetries of the problem becoming apparent only when the dimension is large. While this is a project in pure mathematics, many of the research topics arose in, or were motivated by, other fields such as mathematical physics, operations research, control theory, computer science or probability and statistics. Accordingly, any progress has a potential impact cutting across disciplines. On the one hand, this research may help to advance the applied areas by providing a new perspective and ? conceivably ? leading to breakthroughs.  On the other hand, the problems and ideas arising in those areas will feed back into the fundamental research, contribute to maintaining the vitality of mathematics and potentially open completely new directions of inquiry. Additionally, the project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in intensive research, thus contributing to the development of scientific base and infrastructure. <br/>"

They have different physical properties: electrical and heat conductivities, elastic coefficients, etc. This variety of properties can be explained by  inner structure of solids: first, by types of atoms constituting a solid, and, second, very important, by the arrangement of  atoms forming a solid. For example, both diamond and graphite are built from the same atoms of carbon, and their completely different properties are due to different arrangements of atoms. A profound problem in solid state physics is to explain the connections between micro structures of solids and their macro properties. In our days, with the development of new industries which are able to produce materials with prescribed inner structures, this problem becomes more important, since understanding fundamental connections between inner structures and macro properties will give opportunities for industry to produce more materials with desired properties.<br/><br/>For a long time all materials studied consisted of periodic arrays of atoms or were amorphous. However, in the last decades a new class of solid state matter, called aperiodic crystals, has been found. An aperiodic crystal is a long range ordered structure, but without lattice periodicity. It is found in a wide range of materials: organic and anorganic compounds, minerals, metallic alloys, even some proteins.<br/><br/>The Schroedinger equations with quasi-periodic potentials are used todescribe a particular kind of aperidoc crystals: modulated crystals. Spectral study of these equations leads to understanding of the mechanism of electrical conductivity in modulated crystals, especially, of the  phenomenon of the metal-insulator transition.  The  metal-insulator transition means that at near zero temperatures a material abruptly changes its properties from an electrical conductor to insulator, when an external parameter, controlling electrons energy inside the solid, passes certain critical value.  Metal-insulator transition can be described mathematically in terms of spectral properties of the corresponding Schroedinger equation. The insulator corresponds to localized eigenfunctions (localization) at low energies, while the conductor corresponds to non-localized eigenfunctions extended states at higher energies.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to describe extended states in the high energy region for multidimensional quasi-periodic Schroedinger operators. Because of the lack of periodicity the usual ""periodic"" techniques for the study of this operator no longer work, and new techniques have to be developed. The PI will develop a new modification of KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Mozer) method to solve the<br/>problem."

The goal is to study existence, uniqueness and regularity and geometric properties of transonic shocks arising in self-similar shock reflection for potential flows and full compressible Euler system. Euler system for potential flow consists of the conservation law of mass and Bernoulli law for the velocity. In the case self-similar flow the system can be reduced to a second-order, nonlinear equation of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type for the velocity potential. Transonic shocks are discontinuities in the gradient of a solution, such that the type of equation changes from hyperbolic to elliptic across the shock. Transonic shocks arise in many situations of physical importance. Boundary value problems for transonic shock solutions can be formulated as free boundary problems for the elliptic phase. This framework will be applied to the study of self-similar shock reflection for potential flow. Shock reflection problem will also be considered for full compressible Euler system, which is a more physical model.  This leads to the study of free boundary problems for a coupled system consisting of a nonlinear second order equation of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type and transport equations. One of the goals is to verify von Neumann criteria for transition between regular and Mach reflection. (2) Another area of research is to study the system of semigeostrophic equations, a model of large-scale atmosphere/ocean flows, using methods of Monge-Kantorovich mass transport. In recent years a progress was made in the study of semigeostrophic system with constant Coriolis parameter in the flat geometry. We will study a more physically relevant case of the system with variable Coriolis parameter on a manifold. This includes study of new Monge-Kantorovich-type problems, and Monge-Ampere equations associated with these problems.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems arise naturally in many models in physics, fluid dynamics, economics. Free boundaries correspond to sharp changes in the variables describing the problem. Significant progress has been made during last several decades in the study of free boundary problems. However in the case of nonlinear partial differential equations and especially equations of mixed type many important questions are yet to be studied. This is the first theme of the project. Better understanding of properties of free boundaries, such as stability, regularity and geometric properties, makes possible to understand complex phenomena in models and applications. We plan to study transonic shocks in a flow of compressible fluid or gas. Another area of the project is optimal transportation problem. Recent progress in Monge-Kantorovich mass transport problem includes many important applications to nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular to the models for front formation in the atmosphere, kinetic  theory, fluid flow, elastic crystals, granular materials, and microeconomic decision problems. We plan to work on the applications of mass transportation problem to the models of atmospheric flows. The broader impact resulting from the project will be achieved since the project addresses the problems important in engineering and meteorology.

An interesting feature of the theory of dynamical systems is that it helps us better understand such crucial phenomena in the time evolution of the above mentioned systems, as the high sensitivity of the solution to initial conditions, sometimes referred to as chaos, or chaotic behavior. My present proposal targets the investigation and better understanding of a popular and important class of mostly chaotically behaving mathematical models, namely the so called mathematical billiards. They got their name after the fact that they model the physical motion of ball shaped particles interacting with each other via elastic collisions.<br/><br/>   Due to the above said, this project is primarily devoted to a special class of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems with singularities, namely hyperbolic, or at least partially hyperbolic mathematical billiards. Such systems have been playing an important role in the rigorous mathematical foundation of statistical physics, so that studying them and establishing their ergodic and statistical properties is getting more and more physical relevance. The main part of the proposal focuses on a the final steps in proving a fundamental conjecture regarding hard ball systems, namely the so called ""Boltzmann-Sinai Ergodic Hypothesis"", which states that any finite system of (totally elastic) hard spheres moving on a flat torus is fully hyperbolic and ergodic, of course, on the level set of its trivial first integrals. The proof of this conjecture (in its full generality) up until now has been notoriously withstanding any attack against it. The hardest part in presenting an inductive proof (induction on the number of interacting spheres) has been so far proving the so called ""Ansatz"", a global dynamical-geometric condition, claiming the almost sure hyperbolicity of singular orbits inside the realm of all singular trajectories.  Since by now I got extremely close to make the closing steps in this big project that spanned over a couple decades of hard research work of several people, I can now confidently include finishing the proof of this hypothesis as the first major part of the recent proposal. Furthermore, this plan also contains my promise to join efforts with my colleague N. I. Chernov to publish a comprehensive book on the complete proof of the Boltzmann-Sinai Ergodic Hypothesis. The goal of publishing such a volume is two-fold: First, it would provide a comprehensive exposition of this theory with a unified system of notations, references, etc. for easier reading. Secondly, it would more thoroughly and clearly explain many involved technicalities of the theory, in order to make it accessible for a wider group of researchers of dynamical systems.  The subsequent parts of the proposal contain blueprints for further research in this direction by generalizing the original Boltzmann-Sinai Hypothesis to cylindric billiards, and billiards in physically more relevant containers, i. e. rectangular boxes, convex domains, etc. These sections also address some further open problems in the theory of mathematical billiards that still remain open after my attampts to prove them in my previous research period. Their list can be found in the detailed description of the current proposal."

The quintessential examples of sub-Riemannian settings are the so-called Carnot groups, whose fundamental role in analysis was first highlighted by E. M. Stein. They now occupy a central position not only in such mathematical areas as hypoelliptic partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, and CR geometric function theory, but also in the applied sciences (e.g., mathematical finance, mechanical engineering, neurophysiology of the brain). The most distinctive feature of sub-Riemannian spaces is that the metric structure can be viewed as a constrained geometry, where motion is only possible along a prescribed set of directions, changing from point to point. The principal investigator has a long-term project aimed at exploring geometric and analytic properties of these structures. More specifically, she proposes to continue her study of the Bernstein problem and of the regularity of minimal surfaces in Carnot groups, to investigate subelliptic boundary value problems, and to develop a regularity theory for fully nonlinear equations of Monge-Ampere type. Another area of interest in this project is the investigation of elliptic and parabolic free boundary problems naturally arising in the theory of flame propagation. The principal investigator also intends to study a class of minimization problems, in which the relevant functional is modeled after the one introduced by Alt and Caffarelli. One of the main objectives of the proposed research is to prove regularity properties of the free boundary. The necessary tools from harmonic analysis and partial differential equations for the study of these problems will be developed concurrently. Finally, motivated by the striking analogy between the theories of minimal surfaces and of free boundaries in the Euclidean setting, the PI plans to merge her different lines of research into a yet quite unexplored area, namely, the study of free boundary problems (both of obstacle and Alt-Caffarelli type) in Carnot groups. The principal investigator will integrate her research plan with several educational, mentoring, and outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project will conduct research that lies at the interface of calculus of variations, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory. The focus is on the study of analytic and geometric properties of solutions to variational inequalities and partial differential equations involving a system of noncommuting vector fields. The problems under consideration not only arise in a variety of mathematical contexts (e.g., optimal control theory, mathematical finance, and geometry), but also are of interest in other fields such as mechanical engineering, robotics, and neurophysiology.  Another proposed research area concerns free boundary problems, which naturally arise in physics and engineering when a conserved quantity or relation changes discontinuously across some value of the variables under consideration. The free boundary appears, for instance, as the interface between a fluid and the air, or between water and ice.  Part of the project aims at studying regularity properties of the free boundary in burnt-unburnt mixtures. The results of this investigation will lead to a better understanding of the models, to the improvement of simulation methods, and ultimately to a precise description of how flames propagate in nonhomogeneous media.  Several elements of this project find their motivations in the applied sciences. On the other hand, the solutions to these probelms involve an interplay of ideas from different areas of analysis and geometry. It is conceivable that all these different fields will benefit from this synergy.  The principal investigator is committed to the training of future generations of mathematicians, and to increasing the representation of women in the scientific community, via the organization of a variety of educational and mentoring activities for graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students.<br/>"

Boundary and lens rigidity for compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary are inverse problems where one wants to recover the manifold from the distance (travel times)between each two boundary points, or the scattering relation on the boundary. A linearization of these problems is the integral geometry problem of recovering of a tensor field from integrals along maximal geodesics. The proposer will study this type of questions for various systems: Riemannian manifolds, asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, Lorentzian manifolds, and non-metric Hamiltonians. The case of caustics will be studied carefully. The motivation to study those problems comes both from pure mathematics:  rigidity questions in geometry, inverse scattering, inverse boundary value problems for hyperbolic equations, math theory of relativity, integral geometry of tensors; as well from applications to geophysics, medical imaging, oil exploration, non-destructive testing, cosmology and conformal field theory, etc. The proposer will study stable ways to recover the parameters of the system (the metric, the Hamiltonian, etc.). One of goals of this project in the scattering theory part is to study the asymptotic distribution of resonances and it relation to the classical mechanical behavior of the system.<br/><br/>The Inverse Problems that will be studied in this project serve as mathematical models in many practical situations:  in medicine for imaging the internal structure of a human body (CT, ultrasound, thermoacoustic tomography); in non-destructive material testing; in geophysics for obtaining information about the inner structure of the earth from travel times of seismic waves, or from travel times of reflected acoustic waves; in oil exploration; in theory of relativity, theoretical physics, etc.  Riemannian metrics model anisotropic media, where the speed of wave propagation may depend not only on the position but also on the direction and this project's emphasis is on the study of anisotropic media. Anisotropy naturally occurs in Earth, in the human body, etc. The proposed research will develop further the mathematical tools of travel time tomography, and will analyze the stability in various situations. The theory of resonances, as a part of scattering theory, is of fundamental importance for quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry. Resonances can be observed as certain peak frequencies and one of the objectives of this research is to relate them to the properties of the system."

The first project concerns open systems from which orbits are allowed to escape.  The project will study various mechanisms which facilitate or hinder escape in nonuniformly hyperbolic systems (such as billiards or Henon maps) and quantify the relation between escape rate and positive Lyapunov exponents.  The second project investigates the behavior of dynamical systems which are comprised of (possibly infinitely many) smaller components linked together, with orbits or energy allowed to pass between components. When focused on one component at a time, such systems generalize the discussion of open systems in a natural way by allowing both entry and escape.  The third project concerns the Ulam discretization problem for hyperbolic maps.  This is an important tool used in the numerical study of dynamical systems.  All three projects involve a detailed analysis of the spectral properties of the transfer operator associated with the corresponding system without relying on restrictive Markovian assumptions on the dynamics.<br/><br/>Much research in dynamical systems has focused on closed systems in which the dynamics are self-contained.  In many modeling situations, however, it is not possible to obtain such a global view so that it becomes necessary to study local systems which are influenced by other unknown systems, possibly on different scales.  Such considerations motivate the study of the types of systems considered in this project:  systems in which mass or energy may enter or exit through deterministic or random mechanisms.  Many of these problems are motivated by models from mathematical physics.  For example, open billiards are used to model atom traps.  Extended and linked particle systems are used to create mechanical models of heat conduction in solids and to investigate metastability in molecular processes.  In addition, the method of Ulam discretization provides a practical way to approximate complex systems numerically.  The research will provide analytical tools to solve problems posed and approached formally in the physics literature.  The project will both promote and be informed by this interdisciplinary dialogue.<br/>"

Scattering experiments are widely used in the natural sciences to determine the structure of objects which are far away, like the stars, very small, like the atom, or difficult to reach, like the Earth's core.  In a famous experiment of 1909, for example, by studying the scattering pattern of alpha particles passing through gold foil Rutherford determined that the atom consisted of a nucleus surrounded by electrons.  Semi-classical analysis is a type of phase space analysis which investigates the dependence of operators and related objects on a small parameter.  Originally motivated by Bohr's, or the quantum-classical, correspondence principle, which asserts that classical mechanics is the limit of quantum mechanics as Planck's constant tends to 0, semi-classical analysis has found, however, many applications in diverse areas of science.  The role of the small parameter in these fields can be played by the inverse of the square root of the nuclear mass in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the magnetic field strength in solid-state physics, the adiabatic parameter in adiabatic theory, the inverse of the square root of the energy in high-energy spectral problems, and others.<br/> <br/>By building upon recent advances in semi-classical analysis and scattering theory the research supported by this grant aims to contribute to the following aspects of these fields.  First, it seeks to establish new instances of the quantum-classical correspondence by relating quantum scattering objects to classical ones in the semi-classical limit.  Second, it aims to investigate mainly scattering in the presence of particles or signals which never leave the interaction region.  Such configurations are by now recognized to have a significant impact on the behavior of scattering systems but very few of them have been completed elucidated in the literature.  Lastly, to achieve these goals this research will further the theory of semi-classical Fourier integral operators.  The interesting and important properties of these operators have made them a strong tool not only in semi-classical analysis but also in related fields.  All of these developments have the potential to contribute to the solutions of inverse problems as well as to the advancement of the fields of science mentioned above.<br/><br/>"

The first part of the project deals with the regularity of a family of fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations. These equations turn up in the optimal mass transport problem and in geometry. The second part is the investigation of global regularity, blow-up phenomena, partial regularity, and regularity criteria for several models of nonlinear parabolic equations in fluid mechanics. These include the well-known Navier-Stokes equations, the quasi-geostrophic equations, and some other related models. The third component is a study of error estimates for finite-difference approximations to solutions of fully nonlinear and possibly degenerate elliptic and parabolic Bellman equations. Bellman equations surface in many areas of mathematics (e.g., control theory, mathematical finance, differential geometry). It is thus a natural problem to seek numerical methods for approximating solutions to such equations. The fourth portion of the project concentrates on the theory of second-order linear elliptic and parabolic systems. A crucial difference between scalar equations and systems is that the classical maximum principle and the Harnack inequality are no longer applicable for systems.<br/><br/>The projects described in the previous paragraph are interesting not only from a mathematical perspective. They are also of central importance and have significant applications in areas such as physics, economics, and finance. For instance, one application occurs in the area of fluid mechanics and turbulence, where one would like to estimate external flow over all kind of vehicles such as cars, airplanes, ships and submarines, to understand the formation of hurricanes, or to predict the earth's atmospheric circulation. These examples are all related to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, the theory of which is far from complete. Another important application is in finance, say, to calculate numerically the expected performance of a stock portfolio. For example, the Black-Scholes option pricing model in finance, which is a well-known mathematical model of the market for equity, is closely related to the partial differential equation that governs heart flow. Moreover, many of these problems are naturally modeled as coupled systems of partial differential systems rather than as single equations. The results obtained under this research will help to improve the mathematical models that are used in such applications."

Support is requested for speakers, graduate students, post-docs, and partial support for other participants.  Approximately 60 participants are expected, including 30 graduate students and post-docs to attend the yearly weekend seminar, which will feature 6 hour-long and 5 half hours-long talks on current topics. <br/><br/>The WCOAS is a two decades-long tradition among the operator algebraists in the western United States. The seminar provides a tremendous opportunity for researchers in the field, which fosters and reinforces ties among the western universities. Additionally, the seminar provides young researchers with a forum to present their latest results and discuss them with senior mathematicians. This creates opportunities and future connections for graduate students. Furthermore, this event keeps the field specialists updated with the latest discoveries and projects.  For math graduate students, this will be an inspiring event: they will be able to observe and interact with professionals devoted to mathematical research. The high concentration of operator algebraists in the western United States and Canada has been the main reason for the huge success of the WCOAS. <br/><br/>"

In the context of the Fourier transform on Euclidean space or the flat torus, topics such as restriction theorems, Strichartz estimates (space-time integrability estimates for wave and Schroedinger equations), and Bochner-Riesz means have been subjects of great interest for quite some time. However, many questions remain on how these theories should play out on a bounded domain.  Here it may be appropriate to think of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, and replace restriction theorems for the sphere with integrability estimates on clusters of eigenfunctions.  In this regard, the PI intends to explore integrability estimates on restrictions of these clusters to curves in the domain.  In the case of Strichartz estimates, analogies can be drawn with some of this restriction theory or a parametrix-based approach can be employed. This latter approach is currently being used by the PI and his collaborators to obtain results for general bounded domains.  Improvements on these estimates will be pursued for manifolds with a specific geometric structure such as the unit disk or the unit ball.  Finally, related problems involving Strichartz estimates in exterior domains will be examined along with applications to nonlinear equations.<br/><br/>Fourier analysis continues to be a significant factor in the development of both mathematical and physical theories.  In particular, it strengthens our understanding of the partial differential equations that arise in mathematical physics.  The research pursued here expects to have several applications to the study of wave phenomena and the equations which model it.  These investigations should yield insight on how the presence and shape of obstacles influence the development of waves, a subject of great scientific interest.<br/>"

The ultimate goal is to understand the intricate relations between the geometry of the domain, the nature of the data, the structure of the equation, and the regularity of the solutions. Among other problems, the project addresses fundamental properties of solutions to the higher order elliptic equations in arbitrary domains (such as maximum principle and Wiener criterion), sharp estimates on the solutions of Dirichlet and Neumann problems in terms of the data in the presence of boundary singularities, as well as elliptic operators with complex bounded measurable coefficients. The research plan incorporates techniques originating from different branches of modern analysis (harmonic analysis, operator and spectral theory, function spaces) and promotes the development of new methods, which unravel some completely new phenomena. <br/><br/>The elliptic problems naturally arise in various branches of physics, such as electrostatics, thermodynamics, and elasticity. However, despite its long history, the theory of elliptic partial differential equations contains many open questions. This work will contribute to further progress in the aforementioned areas of science and engineering, and the results of the proposed research will be disseminated at various levels: through publications and presentations in national and international professional meetings, communication with researchers in analysis and other fields, formal and informal educational and outreach activities. <br/><br/>"

For example, the functional determinant of an elliptic operator is a problem originating in spectral theory and mathematical physics, and the analysis of the particular problem we consider is a variational problem leading to a fourth order elliptic equation.  The associated Lagrangian is unbounded, and the existence of solutions and their qualitative properties is highly nontrivial.  Similar equations are used to model the properties of thin films. Another set of problems the principal investigator will explore involves certain fully nonlinear equations arising in conformal geometry and the theory of optimal transportation. Higher order regularity for these equations fails when the underlying manifold is negatively curved. While the structural reasons for this lack of regularity are in some sense understood (i.e., how the nonlinearity leads to the failure of certain estimates), there is no geometric description of the nature of singularities.    <br/><br/>The interaction of geometry and analysis dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and yet continues to be an important and highly active field of mathematical research. The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to understand certain properties of the physical world, and differential geometry was developed to understand the geometry of curved spaces--for example, the curvature of the surface of the earth, or the curvature of space by matter as predicted by general relativity. In the same way that Descartes realized that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential equations. The research in this project involves disparate problems from geometry and mathematical physics, but its various aspects are united by the role played by mathematical analysis in their study.  <br/>"

The object of study are Schroedinger operators whose potentials are obtained by sampling with a continuous function along the orbits of an ergodic transformation on a compact metric space. This framework covers many examples of interest, such as almost-periodic potentials and random potentials. The spectral properties of such operators are closely linked to the dynamical behavior of an energy-indexed family of SL(2,R)-valued cocycles over the given ergodic transformation. Of interest are in particular the Lyapunov exponents associated with these cocycles. The following spectral problems will be investigated: purely absolutely continuous spectrum for quasi-periodic potentials at small coupling for arbitrary irrational frequency, the genericity of Cantor spectrum for suitable classes of transformations and sampling functions, the irregularity of the Lyapunov exponent as a function of the energy, spectral phenomena for perturbed quasi-periodic potentials, and restrictions put on the potentials by the existence of absolutely continuous spectrum.<br/><br/>Quantum mechanics is a fundamental branch of physics whose foundations were established during the first half of the twentieth century. The study of quantum mechanical phenomena in disordered environments has been an area of ongoing active study since the 1950's. A landmark paper was published by Anderson in 1958. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for his work on the absence of diffusion for certain random lattice Hamiltonians. Another event of importance was the discovery of quasicrystals by Shechtman in 1982, which was reported in a 1984 paper he wrote jointly with Blech, Gratias and Cahn, and which caused a paradigm shift in crystallography and solid state physics. The mathematical study of electronic properties of disordered structures is carried out within the framework of ergodic Schroedinger operators. Since the potentials of these operators are defined dynamically, namely by sampling along the orbits of one or more ergodic transformations, it is quite natural that dynamical systems tools should prove to be useful in the study of such operators. The field has recently taken major leaps after a number of very talented young researchers from dynamical systems entered it. This has also lead to fruitful collaborations across the disciplines and there is promise for further success of these interactions."

The first set of problems concerns approximating an arbitrary Blaschke product, in uniform norm or in BMO norm, by Blaschke products whose zeros are sufficiently separated that the corresponding Riesz mass is bounded in all holomorphic coordinate systems (i.e., it is a Carleson measure). A particular problem in this area is to find a direct proof of the equivalence of two conditions, the Muckenhoupt condition and the Helson-Szego condition, that are necessary and sufficient for the Hilbert transform to be bounded on a weighted Hilbert space. Another is to resolve the Nikolski conjecture that there is a Riesz basis of evaluation functionals for any model subspace (i.e., the orthogonal complement of an invariant subspace for the unilateral shift on Hilbert space). Solving these problems should require deeper understandings of the Hilbert transform and the hyperbolic metric. The second set of problems it to prove the corona theorem for some classes of infinitely connected plane domains, including the complement of the product of the Cantor middle-third set with itself and the complements of positive length subsets of Lipschitz graphs. The third problem set involves extending beautiful recent work of David, Tolsa, Volberg, and others on analytic capacity to Lipschitz harmonic capacity in higher dimensional Euclidean space, in particular, to prove that n-dimensional Lipschitz harmonic capacity is a bilipschitz invariant.<br/><br/>The methods to be used on these problems will be constructive, so that in some cases they can yield explicit computer-aided constructions of analytic functions and conformal mappings. Analytic functions and conformal mappings have broad applications in fluid dynamics, acoustics, and electrical engineering, and in these applications explicit constructions are more useful than general existence theorems. The mathematics needed to study these problems includes many ideas and methods from harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, hyperbolic geometry, and geometric measure theory. As a result, the students who work on these problems will obtain a broad mathematical training.<br/>"

Its intent is twofold. On the one hand, it is concerned with the behavior of nonlinear waves and solutions to nonlinear dispersive equations arising in physics, nonlinear optics, and ferromagnetism. On the other, it is focused on wave-packet analysis techniques and the study of multilinear singular operators, in both the non-translation-invariant and nontensorial settings. These are two areas that are intimately related to one another by way of decompositions, frequency interaction analysis, and nonlinear estimates. The first part of the project concentrates on the study of certain nonlinear partial differential equations and systems, including the spin-model known as the hyperbolic Ishimori system, which plays a central role in the theory of ferromagnetism. This system arises naturally from the Landau-Lifshitz equation governing both the static and the dynamic properties of magnetization when coupling to a mean field is taken into account. The global-in-time behavior of solutions with special symmetries and initially carrying small energy will be studied. In particular, one would like to know whether such systems are close to equilibrium as time evolves. The principal investigator will also study soliton solutions of the associated hyperbolic cubic nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Of special interest here is the existence of symbions, which are solutions of symbiotic form to dark and bright solitons. A longer term goal is to understand the blow-up dynamics associated with large energy data. In a slightly different direction, the principal investigator plans to obtain sharpened local well-posedness and almost sure global existence results (i.e., for ""generic data"") for certain periodic nonlinear equations for which there remains a gap between the local-in-time results and those that could be globally achieved for all solutions.  The approach is to construct and to exploit the invariance of the associated Gibbs measure that, just like typical conserved quantities, controls the growth in time of the solutions through its support. The second major component of the project is part of a comprehensive program to develop wave packet analysis and time frequency techniques to study multilinear pseudo-differential operators. Their treatment departs from the classical multilinear theory because the behavior of the associated symbols may be governed by a variety that is allowed to change at each spatial point or curvature assumptions are not necessarily imposed in certain directions.<br/><br/>Wave phenomena in physics such as light, sound, and gravity, are mathematically modeled using partial differential equations. Nonlinear wave models arise in quantum mechanics and ferromagnetism, as well as in the study of vibrating systems, semiconductors, and optical fibers. Nonlinear Schroedinger equations are fundamental physical equations, for they govern the motion of quantum particles, such as electrons. Some of the topics that the project will explore are of basic interest in connection to both the theory of vortex filaments in three-dimensional fluids and aerodynamics -- a vortex filament can be visualized as a thin tube in which the flow has vorticity -- and to  current work in nonlinear fiber optics that is of fundamental importance in today's telecommunication systems. The hyperbolic nonlinear Schroedinger equation has recently received increased attention by physicists and applied mathematicians studying the evolution of optical pulses in normally dispersive nonlinear array structures. Nonlinear Fourier analysis in general (and adapted wave-packet analysis in particular) consists in decomposing complex structures via modulated waveforms into basic building blocks that are localized and thus relatively easy to understand. These blocks can then be put back together in a straightforward manner. The modulated waveforms capture amplitude, scale, frequency, and position, just like a musical score. The objects to which the technique applies include speech, radar signals, oscillatory expressions arising in optics, wave propagation, and other phenomena of a nonlocal nature.  This analysis is thus well adapted to study the nonlinear effects that allow waves to interact and produce new modified propagation patterns."

This conference will feature<br/>both introductory and advanced lectures on the rapidly developing relationships among these established fields. Since the fundamental tools in these research areas are quite different, there is a need for experts in different aspects of the conference to both present overviews of their subjects and point out the interactions among these topics. <br/><br/>Speakers and participants have been invited from the US and Europe. Already over 30 top mathematicians from the three conference fields have agreed to attend, including Spencer Bloch, Alain Connes, Alexander Goncharov, Dirk Kreimer, and Richard Melrose. The attendance for this conference is expected to be roughly 75 -- 100 mathematicians and mathematical physicists. <br/><br/>The three fields of motives, quantum field theory, and pseudodifferential operators are well established and active as independent fields, but until the past decade they have been viewed as essentially disjoint enterprises. The theory of motives was developed by Grothendieck in the 1960s as an arithmetic algebraic geometric setup incorporating diverse cohomology theories. Perturbative quantum field theory first appeared around 1945 to explain laboratory results in quantum electrodynamics and other field theories, and depends heavily on the calculation of Feynman integrals. Finally, the theory of pseudodifferential operators, dating from the 1960s, is a framework to treat all classical differential, Green's and heat operators in one setting.<br/><br/>Until recently, connections among these apparently very different fields were limited mainly to the appearance of Green's operators in quantum field theory. The unexpected appearance of multiple zeta values as values of Feynman<br/>integrals indicated a deep connection between quantum field theory and motives, the usual setting for multiple zeta functions. In addition, the Hopf algebra structure encoding the complicated combinatorics of Feynman integrals, <br/>uncovered by Connes and Kreimer, appears both in the theory of multiple zeta values and symbol calculations for pseudodifferential operators. Further research has shown that the connections are much more than coincidences, and<br/>the work of Bloch, Connes, Esnault, Kreimer, Marcolli and others points towards the possibility of a noncommutative geometry explanation or a direct motives/quantum field theory connection.<br/><br/>This is the first conference on this topic in the US. Since junior faculty and graduate students are encouraged to attend with partial NSF support, the schedule will include introductory lectures on the three conference areas and on Hopf algebras and multiple zeta functions. Other speakers will give research level talks on the conference areas, with a particular emphasis on their interactions."

The emphasis of the work will be on the qualitative properties of solutions to the initial value problem associated with any such system. Unique continuation properties of nonlinear dispersive models will be investigated by exploiting the relationship between the dispersive relation and the structure of the nonlinearity. A specific problem will be to establish the uniqueness of a solution, as well as its possible reconstruction from some incomplete information given at two different times. Other problems concerning the time evolution of several forms of the vorticity will be also considered. <br/><br/>As a consequence of the classical principle of determinism, the evolutionary laws of a physical system together with an initial configuration should delineate the state of the system at all future times. To rephrase this in mathematical terms, the laws of physics are encoded in a system of partial differential equations whose solutions should exist and depend uniquely and continuously on the initial configuration. Hence, the development of a mathematical framework in which the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution to a given system can be verified and quantified is a problem of fundamental importance. Mathematical analysis offers a powerful tool for investigating the properties of solutions to these models well beyond the point of purely phenomenological assumptions. Much of the research in this project is devoted to such basic questions for models describing the dynamics of water waves and incompressible fluids."
