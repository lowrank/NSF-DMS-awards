"1101742","Classification of group actions and structure of transformation group C*-algebras","DMS","ANALYSIS PROGRAM","07/01/2011","04/15/2011","N Phillips","OR","University of Oregon Eugene","Standard Grant","Bruce P. Palka","09/30/2015","$174,812.00","","ncp@uoregon.edu","1585 E 13TH AVE","EUGENE","OR","974031657","5413465131","MPS","1281","","$0.00","This project has two main lines of investigation. The first is the classification of actions of finite groups on Kirchberg algebras (purely infinite, simple, separable,  nuclear C*-algebras). A theorem very similar to the classification of Kirchberg algebras satisfying the universal coefficient theorem should be possible at the very least when the group is cyclic of prime order, the action is in a suitable bootstrap class (as is required for the classification of algebras), and the action is pointwise outer. One expects classification up to conjugacy, not just cocycle conjugacy. Various extensions of this expected result are also under investigation. The second avenue of research is the study of the transformation group C*-algebras of free minimal actions of the group of integers, and the product of several copies of the group of integers, on compact metric spaces. In all cases, the objective is to describe the structure of these algebras. For the integers acting on an infinite dimensional space, the principal investigator seeks to relate the mean dimension of the action to the radius of comparison of the crossed product. For the product of copies of the integers acting smoothly on a compact manifold (and in some other cases), the principal investigator hopes to prove that the transformation group C*-algebra is stable under tensoring with the Jiang-Su algebra and that it has related good behavior. For the same group, but now acting on the Cantor set, the principal investigator would like to prove that the transformation group C*-algebra has tracial rank zero.<br/><br/>This project would have a number of broader impacts. First, one of the proposed results would provide a new and striking link with another part of mathematics.  Second, previous work of the principal investigator has connections with the study of the quantum mechanical behavior of an electron in a quasicrystal, and some of the work in this project has the potential to shed further light on this problem. Third, the principal investigator is active in supervising graduate students at one of the few institutions in the Pacific Northwest with a substantial Ph.D. program. Moreover, he is serving as an informal coadvisor to students at two other universities. Fourth, through continued research interaction with former graduate students, the principal investigator expects to help support mathematical research at primarily undergraduate institutions and to foster international cooperation with Mexico. Fifth, some elementary questions and numerical experiments related to the project can become undergraduate senior theses at the principal investigator's university. Such projects expose undergraduates to mathematical research, and thus advance the overall technological preparedness of the U.S."

It concerns open problems on completeness of complex exponentials in weighted spaces of square-integrable functions posted decades ago by such prominent mathematicians as Norman Levinson, Andrei Kolmogorov, Mark Krein, George Polya and Norbert Wiener. Three key problems in this area, the Beurling-Malliavin Problem, the Gap Problem and the Type Problem will be revisited in this project. The Beruling-Malliavin Problem was solved in the early sixties, although its numerous generalizations and applications remain open. A solution to the Gap Problem was recently suggested by the investigator. The solution brings up a number of new questions that will be considered in this project. The Type Problem, perhaps the most studied and important of the three, remains open. Recent partial results, produced via the approach used for the Gap Problem, suggest that a full solution may finally be within reach.<br/><br/>The problem of approximating an arbitrary wave by combinations of simple waves, or ""harmonics,"" belongs to the very foundations of Harmonic Analysis. Versions of this problem have been studied by many famous mathematicians. Despite considerable efforts, many of such questions remain open. Such problems have a number of important applications in Approximation Theory, Signal Processing, Prediction Theory, Spectral Theory of differential operators and Mathematical Physics.  Further progress in this direction is the main goal of the project. Solutions to these problems could bring a satisfactory closure to the decades-long study of this area of Harmonic Analysis. Some of these problems remained open for more than half a century, and some of them were even considered ""transcendental,"" i.e. not having a closed form solution. However, a recently developed approach, described in the main part of the proposal, has produced solutions to several of such problems and brought new optimism to the area. A research conference in the area of the project was recently held at Texas A&M University (January  2011). A survey of the main topics of the project will be included in the graduate Complex Analysis classes taught by the investigator at Texas A&M University. Two minicourses in the area of the project, directed at young researchers, will be given by the investigator at an international research program in 2011."

The PI has been working on SLE for a number of years, and has made some important contributions to this area. The proposed project focuses on studying the geometric properties of the SLE curves of various kinds. To do this project, the PI will use the stochastic coupling technique he developed earlier. This technique is used to construct more than one SLE curve in single domain in such a way that the curves commute with each other. It was applied to prove the Duplantier's duality conjecture, the reversibility of chordal SLE and whole-plane SLE (for some parameters), and that it is possible to erase loops on a planar Brownian motion to get an SLE curve. In the proposed project, the PI will continue the application of the coupling technique. This includes constructing simple SLE loops on the Riemann sphere, proving the reversibility of the natural parametrization of SLE, and studying the behavior of SLE in multiply connected domains.  <br/><br/>The proposed research plan will give people better understanding of the behavior of the SLE curves growing in simply and multiply connected domains. This will then increase understanding of a number of two-dimensional Statistical Physics lattice models (e.g. critical percolation, critical Ising model, Gaussian free field, and loop-erased random walk) in different kinds of domains since SLE have been identified as the scaling limits of these models. The project will also have significant impacts on Conformal Field Theory.  A significant part of this proposal is its educational component. The PI will develop undergraduate courses on Probability and Complex Analysis at Michigan State University to include the newest development of the PI's research area. He will also teach specialized graduate courses on SLE, and involve graduate students in working under his supervision."

Thermodynamic formalism is a powerful and versatile tool in the study of the global statistical properties of dynamical systems, originally motivated by ideas from statistical mechanics. Key goals of the project are (1) to study the evolution of dynamical invariants of negatively curved manifolds under Ricci flow, (2) to develop thermodynamic techniques to study the beta-transformation and related maps, (3) to develop thermodynamic formalism for the Teichmueller flow.<br/> <br/>Since the 1930?s, a key motivation in the development of the ergodic theory of dynamical systems has been the study of problems in geometry. This project belongs to that rich tradition, and covers a selection of problems where state of the art techniques will produce new results at the intersection of dynamical systems and geometry. The investigation of the effect of Ricci flow on dynamical invariants of negative curvature manifolds combines the powerful techniques of smooth dynamical systems with state of the art innovations from the Ricci flow literature. The beta-transformation, which has been studied extensively since 1957, arises naturally in number theory. New results are now possible due to a recent breakthrough co-authored by the Principal Investigator. Teichmueller theory is an area of intensive current research at the intersection of geometry, topology, number theory and dynamics. There is great scope for the development of thermodynamic formalism for systems arising in this context, and the results will be useful for a variety of geometric and statistical applications. The project will both advance the theory of dynamical systems and build connections between different branches of mathematics (dynamics, PDE, number theory, Teichmueller theory). The focus of this research is on deriving fundamental pure results, so there is significant potential that the tools developed here will yield future applications in dynamics, geometry and beyond. In addition, the project has a number of educational benefits. The Principle Investigator will (1) disseminate the research through publications and talks, (2) integrate research with teaching by delivering mini-courses and seminars for graduate students and advanced undergraduates, (3) work with Penn State Outreach to promote learning and participation at the K-12 level, with particular emphasis on underrepresented groups."

To further these ends, particular attention is given to the study of boundedness properties in the setting of Lebesgue and modulation spaces of bilinear pseudodifferential operators and molecular paraproducts, and to weighted bilinear Poincaré and Sobolev inequalities through the study of bilinear representation formulas and bilinear fractional integral operators in the context of Carnot-Carathéodory spaces.

Part one concerns Aleksandrov-Clark Theory, which relates rank one perturbations to functional models, the Hilbert transform, holomorphic composition operators, rigid functions and the Nehari interpolation problem. A formula (a generalization of the normalized Cauchy transform) for the adjoint of the Clark operator has recently been proven by the principal investigator in collaboration with Salem Prize winner S. Treil. It should be possible to gain some control over the embedded singular spectrum for rank one perturbations, a long standing problem in the field. Part two pertains to the interpretation of a wide class of singular integral operators, including those of Calderon-Zygmund type, in the two-weight situation with very general measures (in particular, non-doubling). Singular integral operators play an essential role in modern Analysis. The last two parts are devoted to aspects of cyclicity. Cyclicity is related to the question for which measures the corresponding Hardy space is dense in that of square integrable functions with respect to the measure, to the backward shift operator, and a classical result of Douglas, Shapiro and Shields connects cyclicity with pseudocontinuation; and thus opening a new area of complex function theory. In part three, the goal is to prove that (assuming cyclicity of the operator) any non-zero vector yields cyclic vectors for rank one perturbations for almost all parameters. This may be useful in practice. It should be mentioned, that for a cyclic operator, it may not be easy to find a cyclic vector. Two interesting new notions are introduced for the setting of an operator on a separable Hilbert space: Subcyclic vectors (a refinement of the definition of cyclic vectors) and a certain graph. Apart from studying their properties, a deep relationship between them in the context of Anderson-type Hamiltonians has preliminarily been proven by the principal investigator in collaboration with E. Abakumov and A. Poltoratski. The last part of this project is connected to the famous problem of Anderson localization, which was suggested by Nobel laureate P. W. Anderson in 1958. The PI will study the cyclicity of vectors for Anderson-type Hamiltonians (a generalization of most Anderson models, e.g. random Schroedinger operators) via analytical as well as numerical methods.<br/><br/>The underlying goal is to develop the mathematical tools necessary to understand the dynamics of physical systems. Such systems are often described by second-order differential equations, like the Schroedinger equation from quantum mechanics (the governing mechanics at the molecular level) and the string equation which is the cutting edge attempt to unite quantum mechanics with general relativity (the theory describing gravity). One of the objects of study - 'singular integral operators' - have become a useful tool in perturbation theory. The latter is concerned roughly with the following question: Given certain information about a physical system, can one predict what happens in the case where one parameter, for example in the initial condition, is changed/perturbed? Cyclicity, for physicists, means that the spectrum (e.g. of light) is simple or non-degenerate. In many problems it is important to know whether this is the case or not. For example, the above-mentioned Anderson localization addresses the question whether or not an impure crystal allows the diffusion of waves or, roughly speaking, whether all electrons stay within a bounded region in space. The results obtained in the scope of this project will be published in scientific journals and reported at research conferences. The proposed subjects provide a wealth of accessible research questions for undergraduate and graduate students. The principal investigator will write expository articles, give seminars at the student level, and mentor young researchers interested in the many open problems she will make available."

The first of these concerns the perturbation theory of operator algebras with particular reference to the longstanding Kadison-Kastler problem, which asks whether operator algebras that are close in a suitable metric must be isomorphic (or even unitarily equivalent). This is part of a more general and very difficult problem: when two algebras are the same (isomorphic), how can we recognize that this is so? The difficulty arises because the same algebra can have many different, seemingly unrelated, representations. In recent joint work with coauthors, the principal investigator has made considerable progress on the Kadison-Kastler problem, and he plans to continue this work in several directions: an isomorphism result for close crossed product algebras, the K-theory of close algebras, the shared properties of close algebras, and the question of whether close containments lead to embeddings. Recent progress has come for algebras that have the similarity property, and this has a reformulation in cohomological terms. Thus the second main area of focus will be the Kadison-Ringrose problem, which asks whether certain cohomology groups (which act as obstructions to desirable properties) must vanish. This will involve the theory of completely bounded linear and multilinear maps and also connects to the bounded projection property.<br/><br/>The modern study of operator algebras has evolved from two main sources. Matrices, which are generalizations of numbers, were introduced to solve equations and now find applications from computer graphics to search engines for the internet. In formulating quantum mechanics mathematically, von Neumann found that he needed infinite-dimensional versions of matrices called linear operators, which were best studied in operator algebras. Moreover, the time-evolution of quantum mechanical systems came to be expressed in terms of the crossed product by groups of automorphisms. The emerging theory of quantum computation is substantially based on the theory of completely bounded and completely positive maps at the matrix level, and these topics underlie much of the work that will be undertaken. Thus, the results obtained in these areas are likely to impact some of these more concrete areas, since the finite factors are those operator algebras that most closely model matrix algebras. An important aspect of the principal investigator's work has been the training of postdoctoral researchers and doctoral students. Most of the young people who have been mentored by the principal investigator are now in faculty positions where they are training the next generation of scientists and engineers. A scientifically and mathematically trained workforce is essential for the technological future of the country, so the principal investigator will continue to give a central role to the mentoring of young mathematicians."

The unifying method to be employed is an underlying geometric-combinatorial vision which often manifests itself through multiscale analysis (i.e., the analysis of a problem on different scales.) This method will be applied in the contexts of so called ""K-QC mappings"" (mappings sending an infinitesimal circle/ball to an infinitesimal ellipse/ellipsoid), geometric measure theory (GMT, which analyzes sets and measures on them -these are generalizations of length, area and volume-), harmonic analysis (decomposing a signal into elementary pieces of wavelike character), and potential theory (study of Coulombic potential and related topics.)  <br/><br/>The mathematical objects involved have found abundant applications in other disciplines, so the problems proposed will advance knowledge in those areas. Fractals (GMT) appear naturally in electrodeposition and Diffusion Limited Aggregation. The internal structure of lungs has a high fractal dimension (to capture more oxygen.) Fourier analysis is often applied in signal and image processing. QC maps are solutions to problems in non-linear elasticity, and have found applications in string theory. Uniform rectifiability appears in minimizers of the Mumford-Shah functional (originally used for image segmentation.) Geometric combinatorics is used for fair division and voting problems in the social sciences, and for phylogenetic trees models in biology. Distance sets are used in industry to study the dimensionality of data sets. The PI will continue preparing students for the Putnam Competition, participating in the Math Club, and mentoring graduate students informally in the context of graduate courses. Fractals and geometric combinatorics are excellent areas for promoting teaching and training of undergraduates and postdocs. The basic notions of multiscale analysis, dimension, combinatorics, etc. are deep enough to convey some flavor of research yet can be successfully explained in an elementary way."

The primary example is the propagation of electrons in a crystal with impurities. The impurities are modeled by a random process and the expectations of observable quantities, such as diffusivity, conductivity, and the density of states, represent the average over these quantities over many measurements. Several models are studied: the impurities may be located at the lattice points of the crystal representing alloy-type models, or they may be localized at interstitial sites whose location is given by a Poisson process. In a perfect crystal, the electrons propagate freely provided their energies lay in fixed energy bands determined by the crystalline structure. The spectrum is absolutely continuous and the conductivity is infinite. The addition of random impurities changes this description. If the disorder is sufficiently large, all electron states are localized in space and the conductivity is zero. At weak disorder, and in dimensions greater than two, it is believed that there is finite conductivity at certain energies, whereas there are localized states at other energies near the edges of the bands. This is an open conjecture and one of the main motivations for the proposed research.  The main projects of this proposal concern spectral and transport aspects of random one- and many-body random Schrodinger operators. The regularity of the density of states and higher-order correlation functions, including the conductivity measure and the inter-band light absorption coefficients, will be thoroughly investigated. The behavior of these quantities in the weak disorder regime is particularly interesting. Very little is known for even the simplest correlation functions, such as the density of states. The dynamical properties of random Schrodinger operators are also manifest in the spectral statistics of various models. For many one-particle Schrodinger operators, the local spectral statistics in the disorder regime is Poissonian. This is expected for many-particle Schrodinger operators and is part of the proposed research. <br/><br/>The propagation of electrons and waves in random media is a hallmark of the physical world. Random impurities in semiconductors impact the electronic properties of these devices. Although the one-electron model is a good description of many phenomena, a complete picture requires the use of multi-particle Schrodinger operators. The behavior of these random models is just beginning to be studied and is one of the components of this research proposal. The investigator, together with several doctoral students at the University of Kentucky, will investigate transport and spectral phenomena of several random models. One of the main goals is to understand correlations between various particles and how the disorder influences them."

The Teichmuller space of a surface is the space of all possible shapes of the surface, where a shape of the surface is the hyperbolic metric on a surface up to isometries homotopic to the identity. Therefore the invariants of hyperbolic metrics on a surface are used in the study of Teichmuller spaces. The PI?s approach is to first consider the Teichmuller space of the hyperbolic plane called the universal Teichmuller space as this space contains all other Teichmuller spaces. An invariant called a shear associated to an ideal triangulation of the hyperbolic plane is used to parameterize the universal Teichmuller space. The PI intends to continue his study of the universal Teichmuller space and related Teichmuller spaces in terms of these invariants called shears. In particular, the PI intends to describe the Weil-Petersson metric on the Teichmuller space of a finitely punctured closed surface in terms of shears on ideal triangulations of the surface, where triangulations can be both locally finite and locally infinite. He also intends to implement these formulas on the computer with the help of some undergraduate and masters students from Queens College. Another direction in applying shear invariants to the Teichmuller spaces is to find a parameterization of Takhtajan-Teo  Teichmuller space in terms of shears and to find a formula for the Weil-Petersson metric in this space. This direction has possible applications to Sharon-Mumford?s approach to two-dimensional shape analysis in Computer Vision. The Quasifuchsian space of a closed surface supports a Weil-Petersson metric as well which is defined by taking the second partial derivative of the product of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit quasicircle and the Sullivan-Paterson measure. The PI intends to investigate the infinitesimal Sullivan-Paterson measures and their intersection numbers to obtain another expression for the Weil-Petersson metric on the Quasifuchsian space similar to the situation of the Fuchsian (Teichmuller) space.<br/><br/>Riemann surfaces are two-dimensional objects which locally look like open subsets of a plane and that have transition maps which preserve angles. Each Riemann surface supports a unique hyperbolic metric in its class of conformal metrics. The PI studies the variations of hyperbolic metrics on a surface thought of as a single space of metrics called the Teichmuller space. The Teichmuller space is of interest in complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, dynamics, differential geometry and physics. One aspect of the project is related to the Computer Vision given by the approach of Sharon-Mumford as well as to the mathematical physics in the approach of Nag-Sullivan and Takhtajan-Teo. The project is building tools for study of the universal Teichmuller space and it has a potential for applications to the above mentioned fields. Another part of the project involves undergraduate and masters students from Queens College. The students participating in the project will be exposed to an active research agenda thus contributing to the human resource development in the sciences and engineering."

The main emphasis of this research is placed on two aspects of the subject: (1) the study of supersymmetric and exotic conformal field theories using operator algebraic techniques, and (2) the study of a vast generalization of a conjecture from finite group theory to the general setting of subfactors. The applications of these operator algebraic techniques are expected to produce answers to a number of  representation theory questions and to shed light on certain exotic subfactors, such as those arising from conformal inclusions. The general framework of subfactors will also provide new insight into some old group theory conjectures. <br/><br/>The theory of operator algebras was introduced by John von Neumann in order to provide a proper mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. Noncommutativity (i.e., the fact that a product AB may differ from BA), which is a key feature of quantum mechanics, is an important aspect of operator algebras. Vaughan Jones's subfactor theory is built on this noncommutative  framework and has provided linkages of operator algebras with some major parts of mathematics. Conformal field theory is a theory describing critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, and it also plays an important role in string theory. The remarkable interactions between subfactors  and conformal field theory have led to many interesting mathematical developments. The aim of this research is to find solutions to some of the important mathematical issues that surface in this context and that have a wide range of applications."

Topics of the summer school and the conference are centered around quantizations,  covering several different fields of mathematics, including mathematical physics, geometric quantization, deformation quantization, and quantum analogues of classical objects. These topics are closely related to recent developments in functional analysis, representation theory of Lie groups, and spectral geometry. The summer school is geared toward undergraduate students and graduate students followed by a conference.  The summer school consists of two weeks of program with the first week aimed at undergraduate students and the second week geared to graduate students. The summer school and the conference will promote research activities in areas of mathematics related to quantization. The organizers have selected lecturers with a broad array of interests and backgrounds, including some physicists. The summer school and conference will give graduate students access to a wide array of current research activity in quantization, and give the students an opportunity to interact with prominent researchers. A public lecture by a physicist engaged in the Large Hadron Collider project in Europe will help enhance public awareness of science, and also give mathematicians the opportunity to interact with an experimental high energy physicist. The undergraduate summer school will expose top undergraduates to important ideas in mathematical physics, and encourage them to learn more about physics. The volume of proceedings of the conference will serve as a resource for students and researchers interested in learning about quantization. <br/><br/>Quantization is an important topic in mathematics and physics. From the physics point of view, methods of quantization are procedures for building models for quantum mechanical systems from analogous and more intuitive classical mechanical systems, which provide strikingly precise experimental predictions. Much of the development of theoretical physics in the 20th century may be regarded as the process of refining quantization to give improved experimental predictions, and the search for a unified field theory is an attempt to quantize general relativity in a manner compatible with existing quantum theory. On the mathematics side, problems related to quantization and quantum mechanics provided a strong motivation for the development of functional analysis, the representation theory of Lie groups, and spectral geometry. More recent developments with much current activity include geometric quantization, deformation quantization, and quantum analogues of various classical objects. The Program on Quantization will inaugurate a new Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame. It will combine two week-long summer schools, one aimed at advanced undergraduates and one aimed at graduate students with a conference devoted to the most recent advances in the area. The invited speakers at the conference are among the world's leading experts in the mathematics of quantization."

The Loewner equation is closely related to the ""Zipper-algorithm"" of Kuhnau and Marshall, and to conformal welding. Another aspect of Rohde's research is to prove convergence of this welding algorithm, and to study generalized weldings corresponding to non-simple curves.

How does water percolate through soil? What are the patterns of spin-alignments in ferro-magnets? These problems are too complex to allow for a precise and simple mathematical answer.

This changed in 1999 with  the invention of the Schramm-Loewner Evolution SLE, the Loewner equation driven by one-dimensional Brownian motion. The last decade has witnessed tremendous progress on old mathematical problems and  even provided physicists with new and unexpected insights, as well as furthering interactions between probabilists, mathematical physicists,  and complex analysts. Rohde's research aims at foundational questions of this emerging theory. Specifically, he is working on path properties of solutions of the Loewner equation in both the deterministic and probabilistic setting, and he is working towards an understanding of the large-scale behavior of random sphere-triangulations."

It is also planned to study several models related to Bloch electrons in constant or random magnetic fields. Other important objectives are the study of issues related to Cantor/non-Cantor spectra of quasiperiodic operators.

The development of the rigorous theory is expected to contribute to the understanding of all the above phenomena, and in particular, may lead to finding new materials with desired physical properties.  Disordered systems are also used in modeling many other micro and macro effects: from quantum localization to earthquakes.

The first two projects aim to understand some aspects of oscillatory integrals, which are important in the restriction/extension theory of Fourier transforms to hyper-spaces with curvature in the Euclidean spaces. The extremisers problem for the Tomas-Stein inequality asks whether there exists a function which optimizes the inequality so that it becomes an equality. It also includes questions of characterizing extremisers such as establishing the smoothness property. The first project concerns the extremisers problem for the Tomas-Stein inequality for the one and higher dimensional spheres. The second project focuses on studying an oscillatory integral with a non-elliptic phase, which is in form of Strichartz estimates. It is motivated by the applications of these estimates in the Schrodinger equations. The third project is to investigate the Cauchy problem for the two dimensional water wave equations with surface tension. It is well known that an important step in approaching this problem in previous works is a reduction of the original system of equations to a suitable and equivalent quasilinear system. So it remains an interesting question how such a reduction will play a role in developing its wellposedness theory.<br/><br/>The proposed research will result in broader impact from several points of view. First, these problems under investigation lie at the interface of several branches of mathematics, e.g. analysis and partial differential equations. Thus their solutions will facilitate interactions among these fields. Moreover, these problems concern both the development of mathematical techniques and the human understanding of the fundamental concepts in mathematics. For instance, the Tomas-Stein inequality is an important measure of properties of a basic operation in mathematics, the Fourier transform, and goes back to a fundamental question: when is an infinite series (in this case the Fourier series of a given function) summable?  Examples of ways in which these problems impact applied science and engineering are many and varied. For instance, the water wave equation is used as a model to describe the propagation of surface waves on a river or the ocean. A rigorous study of this model will provide the theoretical ground for modeling and computational simulations, which in turn allow researchers to gain some insight into some destructive physical phenomena such as the rogue waves and tsunamis. Finally, sharing the research experience through the investigator's teaching activities will increase the awareness and appreciation of mathematics research, and improve diversity of the scientific community and the society."

The investigator will capitalize on the recent successes and progresses achieved and confront problems that are needed to complete the development of the subject. At the same time novel problems and innovative approaches to study them will be introduced and explored. Singular integrals have played a crucial role in questions related to elliptic regularity, generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations, Sobolev embeddings, Littlewood-Paley theory, and other problems in partial differential equations and the study of function spaces. Multilinear singular integrals represent a next step in the proven successful enterprise of computing operations on functions via their spectral resolution and the understanding of them through the revealing lenses of the Fourier transform. Among the speci&#64257;c goals of the proposal are the study of bilinear or multilinear operators with minimal regularity assumptions; the development of more precise extrapolation and weighted estimates techniques; and the analysis of bilinear multipliers with singularities in the frequency domain not well-understood yet, but which are of critical importance for further progress in the field. <br/> <br/>Recent work on multilinear operators has already found both foreseen as well as unexpected applications outside harmonic analysis. Some of the questions to be investigated in this proposal can have potential impact in other mathematical disciplines, in particular in partial differential equations. Fourier analysis methods provide ways to analyze information by decomposing it into simple building blocks or wavelike components. Particular operations are easy to perform in these components by exploiting the fact that waves which oscillate at different frequencies do not interact much with each other. This is a basic idea in the analysis of signals and their transformations, and progress in the development of new Fourier analysis techniques often translates into schemes and algorithms for compression of information, pattern recognition, and other application of image processing in science and engineering. The investigator will continue to interact with graduate students and colleagues in the early stages of their careers. His research will be integrated with his teaching, training, and mentoring activities, which include the direction of PhD students working under his supervision.

More importantly, some systems that are not modeled in terms of random matrices do exhibit random-matrix-like behavior when the size of the systems tends to infinity, a curious phenomenon that is known as the ""universality"" of random matrices.

The first part of the project was inspired initially by explorations in mathematical physics. It revives a proposal of George Mackey to correspond representations of a semisimple Lie group with those of its Cartan motion group, but it does so in the light of more recent developments in noncommutative geometry. The second component of the project seeks to develop links between the index-theoretic approach to representation theory incorporated into the Baum-Connes theory and the geometric representation theory of Beilinson and Bernstein. A third segment of the project aims to investigate more deeply the connection between the Baum-Connes theory and the Langlands classification of irreducible representations. The goal of the final major portion of the project is to frame the ""quantization commutes with reduction"" phenomenon in symplectic geometry within noncommutative geometry.  It is expected that this will lead to a clearer understanding of the range of the phenomenon. Although the project initially involves the relatively well-understood representation theory of compact groups, a long-term aim of the project is to apply insights gained more broadly within representation theory, guided by the outlooks of the individual components.<br/><br/>Group representation theory is a recurring theme in modern mathematics.  Its origins lie within algebra, but the subject has important ties to geometry, to differential equations, and to many other mathematical areas.  This project focuses on the groups that capture mathematically the concept of continuous symmetry (such as the continuous, rotational symmetry of a circle, which may be rotated about itself by any angle, as opposed to the discrete symmetry of a square, which may be rotated about itself only by quarter turns). These groups are basic to the mathematical expression of the laws of physics, thanks to the continuous symmetries (rotations, translations, and others) intrinsic to physical space and time. The fundamental observable quantities in physical science such as energy and momentum are paired with these symmetries. For example, the law of conservation of energy is a restatement of the expectation that the laws of physics remain unchanged as time passes. In quantum theory, the symmetries of space and time imply that fundamental particles correspond to so-called irreducible unitary group representations, and it becomes a matter of interest and importance to determine these representations. Within mathematics, the same representations have been found to be intimately linked to the theory of special functions, to number theory, and to differential equations, among other areas. It is the common objective of the various components of this project to bring new mathematical techniques to bear on representation theory. The long-term goal is to conceptualize and deepen our understanding of an area that has been central to mathematics and its applications for more than a hundred years."

The main subject of study is hyperbolic dynamical systems that provide a mathematical foundation for the paradigm that is widely known as ``deterministic chaos'' -- the appearance of irregular chaotic motions in purely deterministic dynamical systems. This paradigm asserts that conclusions about global properties of a nonlinear dynamical system with sufficiently strong hyperbolic behavior can be deduced from studying the linearized system along its trajectories. The study of hyperbolic phenomena originated in seminal works of Artin, Morse, Hedlund, and Hopf on ergodic properties of geodesic flows on compact surfaces. Later, hyperbolic behavior was observed in other situations (e,g, Smale horseshoes and hyperbolic toral automorphism). The systematic study of hyperbolicity was initiated by Smale, Anosov and Sinai who studied systems with sufficiently strong hyperbolic behavior. Such systems possess high level of unpredictability and exhibit strong chaotic behavior. In the proposal the PI considers the weakest (hence, most general) form of hyperbolicity known as nonuniform hyperbolicity. The theory of nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems originated in the work of the PI (sometimes this theory is referred to as ``Pesin theory'') and the study of these systems is based upon the theory of Lyapunov exponents. The PI's theory has a wide impact on the entire field. The PI will work with graduate students during the period of this award."

Geometry investigates the shape of spaces, through invariants such as curvature.  Topology explores the properties of spaces which remain invariant under continuous deformations.  One basic such invariant, the genus, is the number of ""holes"" in a surface.  Dynamical systems concern the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time.  Especially in recent years, geometry and dynamics have developed in mutually beneficial interaction.  Case in point are topology, geometry  and complex dynamics in low dimension which in many aspects mirror each other.  Many of the most exciting developments in these areas are truly interrelated, and benefit from each other either by idea, analogy or actual tool.  At the same time, connections with other fields such as group theory, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics have strengthened dramatically.   These developments have been amazing in their breadth and depth, and demonstrate the vitality of these areas."

The particular mathematical problem under investigation is that of the motion of the interface separating a two- or three-dimensional, inviscid, incompressible, and  irrotational fluid, under the influence of gravity, from a region of zero density, neglecting the effects of surface tension. The questions the principal investigator seeks to answer focus on the later-time behavior of surface waves in the open ocean for initially small wave disturbances. In particular, her primary objectives are (1) to identify those initial data that lead to finite time blow-up of the interface and to understand the nature of the singularities that develop in the interface and (2) to identify the largest set of initial data that lead to situations in which blow-up is avoided for all time. The principal investigator also seeks to justify rigorously the modulation approximations of the two-  and three-dimensional water wave problems.<br/><br/>Rogue waves are relatively large surface waves that are observed in deep ocean waters. Often appearing in perfectly clear weather without warning, they are blamed for the damage and inexplicable disappearance of numerous large ships and ocean liners. With the resolution of the questions under study in this project, the principal investigator hopes to provide insights into effective designs of computational and laboratory simulations of water wave motion and thereby to advance our understanding of the causes of natural phenomena associated with such waves, including the behavior of rogue waves. The analytical tools developed to carry out the research may also serve to shed new light on related problems in mathematical physics. The proposed research will involve graduate students."

In particular, the award will support the attendance of these young mathematicians at an advanced course entitled ""Dynamical Systems, C*-algebras and Classification,"" which will be held during June 14-23, 2011. The award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>The classification of C*-algebras via K-theoretic invariants has recently been invigorated by the discovery that the Cuntz semigroup - roughly, a semigroup of isomorphism classes of countably generated Banach modules over a C*-algebra - contains an enormous amount of information. Explicit calculation of this semigroup has led to classification theorems for C*-algebras of minimal dynamical systems, among others. The connections between classification, C*-algebras, and dynamics have been further strengthened by progress on proving the hyperfiniteness of amenable group actions on the Cantor set. Another new front has opened at the interface of descriptive set theory and operator algebras, where the Borel complexity of various equivalence relations (including, naturally, isomorphism) allows one to quantify the complexity of various classification problems in C*-algebra theory. Thus, the Cuntz semigroup and classification problems in C*-algebra theory form an active and rapidly developing branch of functional analysis, one which will afford many research opportunities. The award provides a very good opportunity for young mathematicians with research interests in the area of C*-algebras to be exposed to the latest developments in the field, to interact with researchers from other countries, and to possibly initiate future collaborations.

Such spaces are quite often described well by noncommutative operator algebras: in particular, the Baum-Connes and coarse Baum-Connes conjectures predict that a good connection between the classical and noncommutative worlds is provided by higher index theory.  These conjectures have many applications to geometry and topology, such as to the Novikov conjecture, and to the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics.  It has recently become apparent, however, that coarse geometric properties associated to certain quotients of discrete groups and expanding graphs are obstructions to these conjectures: the investigator intends a systematic investigation of the geometric, analytic, and algebraic properties associated to these obstructions, and the phenomena thus allowed to exist.   He also intends to apply realted ideas of coarse geometry and noncommuative geometry to prove classical index theorems associated to elliptic operators on symmetric spaces (with suitable boundary conditions).<br/><br/>Many natural spaces occurring in geometry have very bad properties from the point of view of classical mathematics.  Inspired by quantum mechanics, one tries to describe these spaces using noncommutative mathematical structures - here 'noncommutative' means that the order in which one performs operations matters.   If such a 'noncommutative description' is accurate in some precise sense, then a great deal of information about geometric spaces becomes available.  It is known, however, that aspects of these descriptions fail for spaces called expanding graphs - for essentially the same reasons that make expanding graphs useful in computer science and the theory of networks.  The investigator plans both to study, and to use, 'noncommutative descriptions' in borderline cases, particularly for spaces related to expanding graphs and the discrete groups that can be used to construct them.  A better understanding of exotic properties of discrete groups, and thus of their connections to other areas of mathematics and computer science, is also a central goal."

Despite over two centuries of intensive research and a massive body of results, today partial differential equations on domains are thoroughly understood only when both the coefficients and the domain exhibit smoothness.  However, the dominance of irregularities in real life and numerous problems in modern mathematics demand for an extension of the classical  ""smooth"" theory. Three major directions for this extension pursued by the PI are: (a) the study of boundary problems with rough data on non-smooth domains; (b) the second-order elliptic operators with non-smooth coefficients; (c) elliptic PDEs of higher order. The scope of the proposed work incorporates a full range of sharp well-posedness and regularity results, asymptotic formulas, introduction and analysis of new measures, capacities and new function spaces, numerical experiment, localization phenomena.<br/><br/>Given the ubiquitousness of irregularities in nature and in man-made mechanisms, their understanding is essential to science, engineering, industry, and to society in general. Indeed, most classical models only provide a nice, smooth approximation of the objects and processes. However, perfectly uniform smooth systems do not exist in nature, and every real object inadvertently possesses singularities (a sharp edge of the boundary, an abrupt change of the medium, a defect of the construction). They often have a decisive effect on the occurring phenomena, but cannot be captured in a smooth set-up (e.g., the fractal structure of lungs). The present project combines the mathematical pursuit and a rigorous educational program towards the general goal of advancing analysis of partial differential equation in non-smooth media and preparing a diverse array of mathematicians working in related areas. The latter objective will, in particular, be achieved through a novel Workshop for Women in Analysis and PDE."

The first two projects aim to understand some aspects of oscillatory integrals, which are important in the restriction/extension theory of Fourier transforms to hyper-spaces with curvature in the Euclidean spaces. The extremisers problem for the Tomas-Stein inequality asks whether there exists a function which optimizes the inequality so that it becomes an equality. It also includes questions of characterizing extremisers such as establishing the smoothness property. The first project concerns the extremisers problem for the Tomas-Stein inequality for the one and higher dimensional spheres. The second project focuses on studying an oscillatory integral with a non-elliptic phase, which is in form of Strichartz estimates. It is motivated by the applications of these estimates in the Schrodinger equations. The third project is to investigate the Cauchy problem for the two dimensional water wave equations with surface tension. It is well known that an important step in approaching this problem in previous works is a reduction of the original system of equations to a suitable and equivalent quasilinear system. So it remains an interesting question how such a reduction will play a role in developing its wellposedness theory.<br/><br/>The proposed research will result in broader impact from several points of view. First, these problems under investigation lie at the interface of several branches of mathematics, e.g. analysis and partial differential equations. Thus their solutions will facilitate interactions among these fields. Moreover, these problems concern both the development of mathematical techniques and the human understanding of the fundamental concepts in mathematics. For instance, the Tomas-Stein inequality is an important measure of properties of a basic operation in mathematics, the Fourier transform, and goes back to a fundamental question: when is an infinite series (in this case the Fourier series of a given function) summable?  Examples of ways in which these problems impact applied science and engineering are many and varied. For instance, the water wave equation is used as a model to describe the propagation of surface waves on a river or the ocean. A rigorous study of this model will provide the theoretical ground for modeling and computational simulations, which in turn allow researchers to gain some insight into some destructive physical phenomena such as the rogue waves and tsunamis. Finally, sharing the research experience through the investigator's teaching activities will increase the awareness and appreciation of mathematics research, and improve diversity of the scientific community and the society."

The problems in the calculus of variations concern the stability of singularities. Unlike in the scalar case, the minimizers of regular variational functionals for vector-valued functions can have singularities. How stable are these singularities? This question will be addressed. The topic also has connections to nonlinear elasticity.<br/> <br/><br/>Theoretical research in partial differential equations ultimately has a very practical goal, which is the understanding and prediction of behavior of solutions of the equations. For example, fluid flows are usually described by the Navier-Stokes equations. Do the solutions of these equations correctly describe what we see ""in practice,"" and can we use the equations to make precise predictions about the flows? From what we know about these equations, the answers seem to be yes, but the mathematics of the equations is still not very well understood. Indeed, we do not yet have satisfactory mathematical explanations for the behavior of solutions that can be observed either in experiments or in computer simulations. The information we need to obtain from the computations can usually be formulated in simple and concrete terms. For instance, at what speed will an aircraft stall? The question is simple, whereas the behavior of the solutions underlying this question is complicated. Can we somehow manage the complexity by finding the most important mathematical parameters of the flow that are still ""controlable""? When we study regularity of solutions, the situation is quite similar: there seems to be a very large spectrum of behaviors that solutions can exhibit. Can we obtain some control of the solutions by focusing on relatively few ""right"" parameters? What are the right parameters? This research project focuses on questions of this nature. If we can identify some good quantities that govern the behavior of the solutions and that we are able to control, then it becomes much easier to calculate the solutions themselves, since the theoretical information tells us where to focus our computational resources."

The Kadison-Singer problem is a major problem in this area of mathematics that has been unsolved since 1954. The principal investigator has made some recent progress on the problem and will explore three new avenues of attack on it. Operator systems and completely positive maps play a central role in several areas of mathematics, including quantum computing, quantum information theory, and applications to C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras. The principal investigator will continue to develop the general tensor theory of operator systems and continue to apply this theory to problems in quantum information and quantum computing.<br/><br/>The area of mathematics known as frame theory is concerned with systems that are used to sample signals of various types and then to reconstruct the signals from the samples, such as one does when sampling a soundwave, burning it to a CD, then playing back the music from the CD. Engineers always build redundancy (or oversampling) into such systems in order to ameliorate the effects of errors in the numerical values of the samples. Progress on the Kadison-Singer problem should translate to a more precise understanding of how redundancy behaves than exists at the present time. Roughly, it asks whether or not systems with ""finite redundancy"" can always be divided into finitely many systems with no redundancy. The second goal of the project is concerned with developing the mathematics of quantum information theory and quantum computing. Although no one can predict whether or not quantum computers will ever be built, if they are, it is certainly vital to the national interests to have developed sufficient human resources to be competitive in putting them to use. Consequently, the principal investigator's students are introduced to this area, and his work on the tensor theory of operator systems has applications to questions about parallel structure in the quantum setting."

While there has been progress in describing these statistical properties for uniformly hyperbolic systems, uniform hyperbolicity seldom holds for physical systems and models based on non-uniform hyperbolicity are more realistic. Return time statistics quantify probabilities of a physical system transforming into or returning to a state in a certain period of time. Extreme value statistics give limit laws for successive maxima of a time series of observations on a system. Borel-Cantelli lemmas are a fundamental tool in establishing the almost-sure behavior of stochastic processes. The aim is to extend our understanding of these statistical properties to non-uniformly hyperbolic systems including those with polynomial correlation decay rate. A further goal is to obtain large deviation estimates for functions on dynamical systems with discontinuities (or singularities) or which give rise to multiplicative cocycles, such as matrix valued functions.<br/><br/><br/>Some physical systems are so complex that, although they may be modeled by mathematical equations, they are best described from the viewpoint of statistics. For example, knowing the probabilities of a hurricane located offshore affecting certain towns on the coast is useful information and more certain information usually cannot be given. However, it is a major problem that the classical statistical assumption of complete randomness (independence of successive observations) is seldom satisfied for realistic models of physical systems since successive observations are highly correlated.  Extreme value theory estimates the likelihood of observing an event of a certain magnitude, while large deviations estimates the probability of an outlier or rare event. This project aims to improve predictions of complex physical systems by providing an understanding of extreme value theory, large deviations and other statistics for a wide class of physically realistic mathematical models. The PI will also continue to work towards improving science education at all levels and by informing the public through outreach activities."

The principal investigator will study global behavior of solutions to nonlinear dispersive equations. These equations describe the evolution of waves, in particular in situations where different groups of waves propagate at different velocities so that waves ""disperse"" over time. Typical equations are the nonlinear Schrodinger and wave equations, since mathematically they represent the simplest nonlinear dispersive models and physically they describe wave propagation in applications such as nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics, plasma physics, quantum mechanics, and Bose-Einstein condensates. The nonlinear terms in dispersive equations create complicated but fascinating dynamics such as moving and interacting solitons, contracting or fixed singularities, collapses, etc. The study of solutions exhibiting such properties will be the focus of this proposal. The phenomenon of collapse is arguably ""the most"" nonlinear occurrence possible in an evolution equation, so it is, in general, very difficult to study. Recently there have been significant analytical strides made in the understanding of singular solutions to dispersive equations, hence it is quite timely to focus a research effort in this direction. Thus, the  thrust of the project will be to provide descriptions of both the formation and the dynamics of singularities and to investigate the various thresholds that separate different types of global behavior in solutions to nonlinear dispersive equations.<br/><br/>This project studies differential equations that describe dispersion of waves appearing in various physical contexts: laser optics, fluid and air dynamics, and quantum and plasma physics, to name just a few. The methods developed here can be applied to problems not only in mathematics and physics, but also in statistics, engineering, biology, and medicine (for example,to study phenomena as wide-ranging as the formation of tsunamis or errant cardiac rhythms). Understanding when and how singularities occur is important for numerical simulations and real-time engineering applications as well. The principal investigator will disseminate the results of this project online, through a (freely accessible) institutional website and various free preprint servers, and she will present the latest advances at national and international conferences. Furthermore, this proposal includes mentoring and training activities at the highest levels of scientific and mathematical competency. The principal investigator will organize seminars, colloquia, undergraduate talks, and similar activities specifically designed to instruct students on the topics of the project, as well as on the general areas of partial differential equations and analysis.

These problems and related generalizations are deeply connected to some of the most important conjectures in modern mathematics, including the Kakeya conjecture, the Bochner-Riesz conjecture, the Restriction conjecture, and Sogge's local smoothing conjecture.

A major component of this proposal is to study problems, which arise naturally from the recent work of the investigators.

Other examples are crystallography, robotics, stereology, and electron microscopy. One of the ideas of this proposal is to connect theoretical results from Convex Geometry to those practical areas via Geometric Tomography and Harmonic Analysis. In addition, the advantage of the problems addressed in this proposal is that most of them are ""intuitively clear"" not only to undergraduate students, but also to children in high school or even middle school.  Even the geometric notion of duality can be explained to a child in the high school. On the other hand, the answers are (very often) counter-intuitive, different in the plane and in the space, and this stimulates an interest of students to the subject.

The first explores a quasi-local structure of the dynamics corresponding to non-relativistic systems. Due to the fact that such systems have no equivalent to a finite speed of light, the dynamics associated with, for example, a nearest neighbor Hamiltonian does not generally preserve locality in the strict sense. An approximate form of locality, or quasi-locality, has been demonstrated for many systems governed by Hamiltonians with short-range interactions. Recent developments have shown that these estimates, known as Lieb-Robinson bounds, are valid in a variety of contexts and useful in a number of important applications. The investigator proposes the study of several systems for which there are no known quasi-locality results. Given these estimates, certain intriguing questions may be within reach of rigorous and detailed analysis. The next area of focus concerns random perturbations of specific quantum spin systems. For single particle systems, it is well known that disorder leads to localization: a metal with sufficiently many impurities loses its conductance properties. This phenomenon should persist in many-particle interacting systems, and the investigator proposes to analyze the emergence of localization in random quantum spin systems. In fact, a dynamical form of localization, in terms of explicit Lieb-Robinson bounds, is proposed as a possible means of quantifying and thus further investigating this predicted behavior.<br/><br/>In condensed matter physics, a wealth of intriguing, physically relevant phenomena is described in the context of quantum many-body systems. For example, the oscillations of atoms in a crystal and the alignment of spins in a magnet can both be quite effectively described by quantum lattice models. These quantum lattice systems also provide a framework for more theoretical considerations. In fact, discrete versions of quantum field theory and the basic models in the theory of quantum information and computation can be expressed in this setting. The main goal of this proposal is to further develop the theory of quantum lattice systems by analyzing a number of specific models. A crucial ingredient in this proposal will be the investigation of locality estimates which demonstrate that disturbances do not propagate arbitrarily fast through the systems under consideration. Several important applications of these locality bounds have already appeared in the mathematics and physics literature. As a new example, the investigator proposes a detailed analysis of locality properties for random systems. Random systems are particularly interesting because they are predicted to exhibit a metal-insulator phase transition with increasing disorder. Sufficiently detailed analysis may suggest design specifications for materials, e.g. fiber-optic cables, that necessarily have impurities dispersed throughout. In this case, the potential impact of this proposal, beyond the scope of mathematics and physics, may be substantial. Moreover, interested graduate students working on the project will learn the language and techniques used by scientists in a number of fields. After completing their thesis, they should be well prepared for either an academic position in the sciences or a more technical role in industry."

The idea of representing a general operator in a specified class of operators as a part of a nice operator in the class has had many successes and we seek to develop this point of view with a primary focus on unsolved problems in matrix theory, operator theory, the theories of functions in one and several complex variables, and the development of holomorphic function theory on analytic varieties. One group of problems that we propose to investigate involve the generalizations to several complex variables of classical moment and interpolation problems on the unit disc such as the interpolation theorem of Nevanlinna and Pick, and the moment theorems of Caratheodory and Herglotz. Another group involves extending the Caratheodory-Julia Theory to several variables with a long term goal of building a geometric approach to the boundary regularity of holomorphic mappings. Research intrinsic to operator theory that we will undertake includes issues involving model theory in one variable on non-simply connected domains in the plane and in several variables on domains other than the bidisc as well as the generalization to several variables of the work of Loewner on operator monotone functions.<br/><br/>Operator Theory, the particular type of mathematics that we are proposing to investigate, has direct and concrete benefits for a number of areas of human endeavor. For example, the model theory aspects of our proposal all involve the generalization of the Commutant Lifting Structure which leads to an efficient algorithm for the discovery of oil from acoustical data taken on the surface of the earth. Other aspects would add to the theory of Linear Matrix Inequalities and Quadratic Programming. Linear Matrix Inequalities and Quadratic Programming, are a far reaching extension of Linear Programming, which has made large scale resource allocation and economic prediction possible. In addition, to being a powerful tool in engineering, they have been used to develop state of the art algorithms for global positioning with incomplete sensor location data . Finally, the particular brand of function theory we propose to study, forms the mathematical core of the H-infinity control theory, which has been used to design control systems for fusion reactions inside Tokamaks and feedback stabilization systems for the space shuttle."

An extensive theory already permeates, under different circumstances and goals, wide areas of analysis, geometry and applied mathematics. The investigators perceive, however, that there are new, emerging areas of added complexity.

The project involves a system of personnel exchanges between the home institutions, designed to provide a rich training experience for students and postdocs. In addition, there will be an emphasis month every year of the project in one of the home universities and a summer school designed to bring members of the group - including graduate students and postdocs - together to stimulate scientific progress.

These include many important equations in classical field theory and continuum mechanics (e.g., Einstein's equations of general relativity, Euler's equations for fluids). The basic questions are: (i) Do we have existence and uniqueness of solutions, and continuous dependence on data, in a certain class? (ii) Can solutions blow up (e.g., black holes in general relativity)? (iii) What is the long-time behavior of solutions? More specifically, the principal investigator is working in two main areas. One part of the project is to study the problem of existence of global solutions of Einstein's equations and of other related equations. The first goal is to simplify, generalize, and refine the existence results for Einstein's equations. A long-term objective is to study the stability of large solutions like black holes in general relativity. This is related to one of the central problems in mathematical relativity, namely, the cosmic censorship conjecture of Penrose. The question of stability or blow-up of large solutions is also the main question now in the area of nonlinear wave equations. A second component of the project involves studying a class of problems that occur in fluid dynamics and general relativity, in particular, proving the well-posedness for the free boundary problem of the motion of the surface of a fluid in a vacuum. The first goal in this area is to prove local existence. A longer-range goal is to study the long-time behavior of astrophysical bodies such as gaseous stars, along with other problems related to the interfaces between fluids and solids. To solve these problems the principal investigator and his collaborators are developing new techniques that could be useful for studying many other problems as well. In particular, they are using geometric methods to study hyperbolic differential equations.<br/><br/>The principal investigator and his collaborators have recently simplified greatly the existence proof for solutions to Einstein's equations and their generalizations. The continuing refinement of those ideas that constitute part of the current project could have a significant impact. To name just one, the new approach should make it much easier for graduate students to study mathematical relativity. Moreover, the detailed asymptotic behavior that these methods reveal through the introduction of so-called harmonic coordinates will be useful to the physics and astronomical communities. Physicists are in the process of constructing large gravitational wave detectors to observe the universe. In order for the scientists to know what to look for with these instruments, there is a need for a large-scale effort in doing numerical calculations and simulations based on Einstein's equations. The only successful attempts hitherto to do so have been with the aid of harmonic coordinates. It is also conceivable that understanding the properties of and controlling the interface between two fluids could have industrial applications. In particular, there is a version of the problem for plasma physics in magneto-hydrodynamics. As is well known, the ability to control a plasma is essential to the construction of fusion reactors."

More precisely, the investigator proposes to study two groups of problems. The first group focuses on analyzing regularity of solutions to the super-critical nonlinear wave (NLW) and Schrodinger (NLS) equations. The last two decades brought numerous advances in understanding global existence of solutions to the so called ""critical"" nonlinear PDEs, where criticality is understood in the sense that a PDE possesses a quantity globally controlled in time which has the same regularity as a certain scaling invariant norm. However obtaining global in time solutions to super-critical equations remains a challenging problem. Here by a super-critical equation we mean that the conserved quantities are at lower regularities than the scaling invariant norm. A famous example is the 3D Navier-Stokes equations that describe the most fundamental properties of viscous incompressible fluids. Other examples involve various nonlinear wave equations that appear in the context of general relativity as well as Schrodinger equations. With her collaborators, the investigator proposes to work on three projects towards obtaining partial regularity results for super-critical NLW and NLS inspired by similar results available in the context of the 3D Navier-Stokes. The second group of problems focuses on projects related to derivation of the NLS from many body quantum dynamics. The investigator, together with Chen, proposes to develop further the work that they recently started on the Cauchy problem for the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) hierarchy, which is an infinite system of coupled linear non-homogeneous PDEs, that appear in the derivation of the NLS. The GP hierarchy describes the dynamics of a gas of infinitely many interacting bosons, while at the same time retains some of the features of a dispersive PDE.  Based on these dispersive features, the investigator proposes to investigate solutions to the GP hierarchy and illustrate that, in some instances, the GP can be studied using generalizations of methods of dispersive PDEs.<br/><br/>Suggested problems involve important mathematical questions such as existence and regularity of solutions to PDEs that describe various wave phenomena. For instance, the NLS and their combinations with the Korteweg-de-Vries and wave equations have been proposed as models for many basic wave phenomena. Due to their physical significance, it is essential to develop tools to understand behavior of solutions to these nonlinear equations and the investigator plans to work in that direction via adapting some tools from her earlier work on equations of fluid motion (such as Navier-Stokes equations that describe fundamental properties of viscous fluids) to the context of dispersive equations. On the other hand, the investigator plans to continue her recent work on physically inspired questions related to derivation of dispersive PDEs from many body Boson systems. The proposed activity contains an interdisciplinary approach in the sense that it has potential to bring dispersive PDE methods to the level of many body quantum dynamics and vise versa. In particular, the long term goal is to try to adapt some of the recent advances from dispersive PDEs to the many body systems, where one has physically relevant questions that are beyond the reach of known mathematical methods."

The focus is on several classes of tilings that are more complicated than previously studied. This includes hierarchical ""fusion"" tilings, akin to self-similar ""substitution"" tilings, only where the structure can be qualitatively different at each length scale. It also includes tilings with infinite local complexity (where tiles fit together in infinitely many local patterns) and tilings of non-Euclidean spaces where the relevant group action is not amenable. In each setting, the goal is to understand which combinatorial, topological and ergodic properties of simpler tilings carry over, and to create examples where other properties do not.  A further goal is to address the broad conceptual question: how do ergodic and topological properties of a tiling space relate to geometric properties of the underlying tilings?<br/><br/>Tiling theory has many applications within science and engineering and has been used to model materials such as quasicrystals, to code information on computers, and to solve abstract problems in logic.  However, much of the theory is built around a small set of classic examples, mere islands in the sea of possible tilings. This project aims to bridge these islands, developing both a more general theory and qualitatively new examples, examples that will allow for a still broader range of applications.  For example, tilings of curves spaces may aid in the design of efficient computer networks. In addition to supporting basic research, the grant supports the training of a PhD student in the mathematical sciences, thereby addressing a severe shortage of young American scientists. It also supports visits by researchers who will give lectures to graduate and undergraduate students."

This entails having a program of visitors in the field at all levels and for varying durations and holding four conferences in the field during the course of the year.  Microlocal analysis is analysis in phase space.  It is the mathematics underpinning the semi-classical limit in quantum mechanics, as well as having applications in other areas of physics and geometry.  The proposed project would bring together researchers using microlocal methods in widely disparate contexts, ranging from quantum mechanics to representation theory, complex geometry, and mirror symmetry.  The central feature of the emphasis year is to be a program of four workshops, as well as mini-courses from visiting mathematicians.  The topics of the workshops will be: (i) Algebraic Microlocal Analysis (D-modules and deformation quantization); (ii) Analytic Microlocal Analysis (microlocal analysis in the complex domain); (iii) Spectral and Scattering theory in the C-infinity setting; (iv) Nonlinear Evolution Equations. These four workshops represent quite distinct areas of microlocal analysis, reflecting the major areas of concentration in the field at Northwestern. The workshop on Analytic Microlocal Analysis is intended to unify and bridge the different areas.  Many of the technical triumphs in microlocal analysis lack approachable expositions, and the emphasis year should help make microlocal tools more accessible to researchers in many fields.<br/><br/>Microlocal Analysis is a part of analysis and geometry that studies functions, differential equations, and other objects on a space in terms of its phase space. A point of the phase space describes a position of a particle on the original space together with its momentum. In particular, its dimension is double that of the original space. The phase space plays a fundamental role in classical and quantum mechanics, as well as in optics (as the space of light rays) and other parts of physics. There are more general types of phase spaces, called symplectic manifolds. In particular, large classes of complex manifolds, or geometric spaces based not on real but on complex numbers, are in this class. There are other, less well-understood, connections between symplectic manifolds and complex manifolds; they are expressed by the mirror symmetry, an area of both string theory and geometry. All this suggests that microlocal methods play crucial role in many areas of mathematics and physics. In fact these areas spread all the way from quantum field theory to differential geometry to complex analysis to number theory.  The goal of the Emphasis Year at Northwestern is to bring together leading researchers working in these different areas.<br/>More information can be found on the website:<br/>http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~dbaskin/spscconf/"

Topics in the proposal encompass such diverse areas as the study of diffractive phenomena for the wave equation at edges, as well as the asymptotic behavior of waves on curved space-times, such as in general relativity. The project will employ geometric microlocal, or phase space, techniques to explore new problems in these areas. Some of these techniques are constructive, such as the proposed construction of the forward fundamental solution and the scattering operator on a class of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces, while others rely on phase-space energy estimates, such as the microlocal positive commutator estimates that are expected to be of use in the study of the asymptotic behavior of the wave equation on curved space-times (such as Kerr-de Sitter space, describing rotating black holes), of wave equations with global conditions replacing initial conditions, and in wave propagation on curved space-times with asymptotic edges and cusps. Even elliptic problems, which correspond to stationary (no propagation) problems, can sometimes benefit from a different point of view: recent work on the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent of the Laplacian on asymptotically hyperbolic spaces, and on its high energy behavior, provides an example.<br/><br/>Wave propagation is ubiquitous in the physical world, with electromagnetic waves (e.g., light waves) being one of the most prevalent examples. A typical question is how waves interact with structures such as edges, generalizing the well-known law of reflection from mirrors. Scattering theory is another subject governed by propagation phenomena. For instance, scattering phenomena enter into the description of quantum waves on large scales, mathematically modelled as ""infinity."" As propagation phenomena are ubiquitous in the physical world, their more precise understanding has many potential applications. A concrete physical application that is expected to be of interest is developing scattering theory (i.e., investigating how light waves or quantum particles behave globally, in the context of curved space-times, which give a description of our universe in the framework of general relativity). Some of the techniques involved are also expected to benefit the understanding of imaging problems, for instance, in the geophysical context."

The general question is:  if a dynamical system exhibits chaotic behavior, how is this reflected in the quantum mechanical picture?  The ""correspondence principle"" suggests that properties of the classical dynamics should be reflected in the quantum system as the uncertainty tends to 0.  The Quantum Unique Ergodicity (QUE) Conjecture states that, for Riemannian manifolds of negative sectional curvature - for which the geodesic flow is highly chaotic - pure states should become equidistributed in the semiclassical limit.  However, the connection between classical dynamics and high-frequency spectral data remains very mysterious.  In fact, various models of quantum chaos show conflicting phenomena in this semiclassical limit: QUE is now known to hold in many cases under certain arithmetic assumptions, but for simpler ""toy models"" of quantum chaos that are not covered by the QUE conjecture, it is known that some pure states can fail to equidistribute.  It seems that some of the finer properties of the dynamics and/or spectrum are responsible for this behavior, and isolating these key properties is a main focus of this research.  In addition, it has become clear that methods from many different fields are required to shed light on this problem, and in doing so this research also aims to fortify the bridges connecting these disciplines.<br/><br/>For much of the last century, connections between some of these these fields (eg., between dynamical systems and number theory, or between geometry and spectral theory) have provided insight for many difficult problems, and promise to continue to do so for a long time to come.  The recent infusion of ideas from mathematical physics and ergodic theory has led to a great deal of progress in the type of difficult spectral problems described above, and being at the intersection of so many different areas of active research, the questions of quantum chaos are particularly well positioned to make contributions to a wide variety of endeavors, both in purely theoretical mathematics and in problems of an applied nature.  This also makes the projects attractive to graduate students and post-docs of different backgrounds, and part of this program is to add to the rapid growth of diverse researchers in the field through courses, seminars, and collaborations.  Thus this research aims not only to study the specific problems surrounding the QUE conjecture, but also to contribute to the rapidly growing network of connections between these important subjects of active research, and ultimately to a wide range of advances throughout the sciences."

More specifically, we study questions on the interface of both these fields, and use harmonic analysis techniques to study questions in GMT. We study problems of the form ""Find a biLipschitz map from a significant part of a given metric space to Euclidean space"", ""Characterize biLipschitz images of the Euclidean plane"" or ""When is a metric space built from biLipschitz images of standard pieces and how do we find these pieces?""  On the harmonic analysis side, this is related to questions of the form ""When is a function decomposable into a sum of nice functions, and how do you construct this decomposition?"" This last question is a standard one in Littlewood-Paley and wavelet analysis, and transferring the methods from these rich theories into the setting of GMT yields a significant toolbox.  This type of study of GMT is very related to many questions that arise in applications. In many applications one is given a large data set represented as a subset of a metric space, such as a high dimensional Euclidean space, and one seeks to faithfully represent a large portion of this data set as a subset of a low dimensional Euclidean space. Faithfully here, means that one can still perform the same data mining tasks on the image of the data portion. It is because of this connection to data mining that the above task has thus far yielded much attention from computer scientists and applied mathematicians using a wide range of approaches.  The framework of dimensionality reduction also includes data compression and data approximation. These have applications in many areas of science; for examples document analysis, face recognition, clustering, machine learning nonlinear image denoising, segmentation and processing.<br/><br/>The project is geared towards a better understanding of the geometry of collections of points in a given space.

The plan is to give applications in such directions as Morse and Maslov indices, multidimensional eigenvalue problems (via the Birman-Schwinger perturbation determinants for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators), and the spectral properties of the Evans function. Keldysh' type theorems for operator valued meromorphic functions will be applied to the spectral analysis of the differential operators that appear as linearizations about traveling waves and more complicated multidimensional patterns, using and further developing the freezing method for evolution equations. On the more applied side, the spectral theory of nonselfadjoint differential operators and the Evans function approach, combined with abstract results on spectral properties of strongly continuous (but not analytic) operator semigroups, will be used to discuss nonlinear stability of traveling fronts for concrete physically important models arising in chemical kinetics and combustion theory.<br/><br/>The topic of this proposal is situated at the intersection of several areas of applied and pure mathematics. It includes the study of such properties of complex systems described by infinitely many parameters evolving in time as their stability, understood as ability to stay preserved under small perturbations. The main theoretical instrument that will be used and further developed in the course of this project is the theory of determinants of infinite dimensional matrices utilized in quantum mechanics and scattering theory. Combined with the theory generalizing Wronski determinants of differential equations, this will allow us to compute indices indicating the degree of instability of propagating waves and other more complicated dynamical patterns. We will apply these methods to the study of equations describing combustion of solid fuels and of the evolving in time interaction of several chemical reactants."

Among the main directions of the proposed research are: 1. To investigate the relationships among boundedness of layer potentials, properties of harmonic measure, and uniform rectifiability. 2. To investigate the structure of uniformly rectifiable sets. 3. To develop and apply ""local"" Tb theorems to study the regularity of free boundaries and the solvability of elliptic boundary value problems. 4. To develop techniques to study the solvability of boundary value problems for complex elliptic equations, or more generally, for strongly elliptic systems, with bounded measurable coefficients.<br/><br/>The project lies within the field of harmonic analysis and its application to, and interaction with, geometric measure theory and the theory of elliptic partial differential equations.  Roughly speaking, in harmonic analysis one investigates properties of functions and ""operators"" (i.e., mappings which transform one function into another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces, which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the pieces.  The name itself arose by analogy to the decomposition of a musical sound into its various frequency components (""harmonics"").  Geometric measure theory involves the study of the relationship between geometric properties of sets, and their ""measures"" (the latter are generalizations of the notions of length, area, and volume).  Partial differential equations and systems of elliptic type describe a wide variety of phenoma in the real world, including electrostatics, and steady-state temperature distributions and elastic deformations.  A particular focus of the present proposal is to explore further the relationship between geometry and properties of ""harmonic measure."" The latter area of investigation has already found application in recent work in acoustical engineering, in particular in the design of a room with desirable acoustic properties. Progress on the problems to be considered would in all likelihood open up further avenues of investigation. All such progress will be disseminated by the investigator via lectures at conferences, seminars and graduate courses, and via electronic preprints posted on his website and on the ArXiv web site.  The investigator will involve Ph.D. students and a postdoc on problems related to the proposed work. Two former postdocs are already involved in the project."

Such spaces are quite often described well by noncommutative operator algebras: in particular, the Baum-Connes and coarse Baum-Connes conjectures predict that a good connection between the classical and noncommutative worlds is provided by higher index theory.  These conjectures have many applications to geometry and topology, such as to the Novikov conjecture, and to the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics.  It has recently become apparent, however, that coarse geometric properties associated to certain quotients of discrete groups and expanding graphs are obstructions to these conjectures: the investigator intends a systematic investigation of the geometric, analytic, and algebraic properties associated to these obstructions, and the phenomena thus allowed to exist.   He also intends to apply realted ideas of coarse geometry and noncommuative geometry to prove classical index theorems associated to elliptic operators on symmetric spaces (with suitable boundary conditions).<br/><br/>Many natural spaces occurring in geometry have very bad properties from the point of view of classical mathematics.  Inspired by quantum mechanics, one tries to describe these spaces using noncommutative mathematical structures - here 'noncommutative' means that the order in which one performs operations matters.   If such a 'noncommutative description' is accurate in some precise sense, then a great deal of information about geometric spaces becomes available.  It is known, however, that aspects of these descriptions fail for spaces called expanding graphs - for essentially the same reasons that make expanding graphs useful in computer science and the theory of networks.  The investigator plans both to study, and to use, 'noncommutative descriptions' in borderline cases, particularly for spaces related to expanding graphs and the discrete groups that can be used to construct them.  A better understanding of exotic properties of discrete groups, and thus of their connections to other areas of mathematics and computer science, is also a central goal."

The tools involved are partly intrinsic to these areas, but also involve input from other areas, such as combinatorics and algebraic geometry. One important theme is the use of the combinatorial Littlewood-Richardson rule in the study of eigenvalue problems for compact operators on a Hilbert space or for self-adjoint elements in a finite von Neumann algebra. This rule (and its continuous extensions) also plays a role in a different direction concerning the classification of invariant subspaces of certain operators. A second major theme is the study of weak and strong limit laws in free probability, as well as regularity questions for free convolutions. There are many problems here where methods of classical function theory yield interesting, and sometimes unexpected results. Other problems of operator theory to be considered treat the spectral Nevanlinna-Pick problem and its analogues, hyperinvariant subspaces, and p-entropies. Of these questions, the Nevanlinna-Pick problem is inspired by control theory questions and may have practical applications, while p-entropies have applications in theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to solve several problems in functional analysis by highlighting their connections to areas of mathematics that do not seem, at first glance, to be related. An example is the use of methods of algebraic geometry in the solution of analysis problems. Some of the areas of study in this project have potential applications in engineering, especially in control theory (specifically, the control of large structures), and earlier results of the principal investigator have actually been incorporated into engineering projects. Besides their purely scientific merit, the activities supported by this grant are expected to have an impact through the training of doctoral and postdoctoral students and the creation of new course materials that will incorporate some of the research findings from the project. The principal investigator has trained a number of Ph.D. students, of whom three are women and one is Hispanic. The work of these students has had a significant impact on the fields that they entered (operator theory, free probability, control theory, and partial differential equations). The principal investigator has also mentored several postdoctoral associates who went on to successful careers. Finally, the principal investigator has directed two undergraduates in the Indiana University REU program. As indicated, mentoring activities at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels will play an integral role in this project."

The problem can be neatly captured in the so called final state conjecture (FSC): generic asymptotically flat initial data sets have maximal future developments, namely solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations, which look, asymptotically, in any finite region of space, as a Kerr black hole solution. The focused research effort described in this proposal identifies four related problems whose solution will greatly advance our understanding of the FSC. The first three, 1) Uniqueness and 2) Stability of the Kerr solutions and 3) Formation of black holes, are at the heart of the theory of black holes. The last one, 4) Bounded L2 curvature conjecture and break-down criterions (the problem of evolution for very rough initial conditions and optimal sufficient conditions which insure regularity of the space-time), is a topic loosely connected with the celebrated cosmic censorship conjecture, which is itself a necessary ingredient, and a formidable intellectual obstacle, for resolving the FSC.<br/><br/>Each of the four related problems identified above are, in themselves, very difficult and deep challenges in general relativity which have witnessed a lot of progress in recent years based on new analytical and geometric ideas. Furthermore, recent advances in numerical relativity have allowed new classes of solutions to the field equations to be obtained in highly non-trivial situations. Advances toward solving the FSC will require continued development within individual methodologies, though we plan to accelerate progress via a closer interaction amongst the different approaches. Cooperation between mathematical and numerical relativity can substantially help the former by endowing it with a powerful experimental tool and also help the latter to formulate key questions connected with the development of new numerical codes. To be successful, this will require training a new class of researcher, proficient in both the relevant formal mathematics and high performance scientific computing. We will engage graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in this effort, giving them the skills necessary to have a strong impact in their future careers, whether in academia or the broader work force. The research carried out will strengthen the foundations of general relativity and our understanding of black holes, which is of significant import to the broader nascent scientific field of gravitational wave astronomy."

Of particular interest are equations that prescribe higher-order curvature invariants that control the global geometry of higher dimensional manifolds. The project seeks to develop new tools to solve these equations and to describe the behavior of the solutions. A key difficulty in handling such equations is the absence of a maximum principle, and the principal investigators propose to compensate for its absence by using integral inequalities as the main working tool. It is expected that the study will yield extensions of the well-known mixed volume inequalities to more general domains in Euclidean space, as well as sharp Sobolev inequalities in CR-geometry.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to provide new insights into and to create new tools for the study of the theory of geometric partial differential equations, a subject that has evolved into a basic toolbox in many areas in mathematics, applied mathematics, and engineering, to say nothing of mathematical physics.

It asserts that the results of any measurements of the physical universe in the Einstein space can be predicted by taking another set of measurements near the ""far end"" of the universe (which is referred to as its ""boundary""). A case of particular interest is the situation when the boundary space is three-dimensional, a case in which geometric understanding is already well developed.

There are two types of singular structures to be studied here: vortices (i.e., zeros of complex-valued order parameters) and phase boundaries (i.e., nodal sets of real-valued order parameters). Much of the work concerns the setting where the physical model--Ginzburg-Landau, Gross-Pitaevskii, Allen-Cahn, or Kawasaki-Ohta--is considered on a curved surface. The general goal is to further our understanding of what role curvature plays in the stabilization or destabilization of vortices and phase boundaries. The principal investigator plans to attack these problems through a combination of techniques including gamma-convergence, renormalized energy methods, second-variation arguments, constrained minimization, and parabolic nonlinear partial differential equations methods.<br/><br/>The investigations to be pursued in this project arise from mathematical models for superconductors and superfluids, grain boundaries in alloys, and di-block copolymers. The main thrust of the research is to gain a better understanding of how curvature may play a role in affecting the behavior of these physical systems. For example, in recent years physicists have succeeded in producing superconductors in the shape of spherical shells, rather than just being flat, but at this point there is little theoretical work devoted to understanding how this shape may affect the response of the superconductor to an applied magnetic field. There may be hidden benefits or surprising behavior induced by the curvature of the superconducting surface that can be revealed through a careful mathematical analysis of the underlying models.  The principal investigator will carry out much of this research in collaboration with Ph.D. students who will gain valuable experience studying these applications of mathematics as part of their dissertation work."

Such maps have been studied for about twenty years, with specific examples playing a crucial role in the development of a more general theory. Based largely on these examples, there is a clear conjecture describing what one should expect from the ""most unstable"" part of the dynamics for these maps, i.e. the support of the measure of maximal entropy.  Significant progress has been made and verification of the conjecture is almost complete for rational maps in two variables.  The dynamics away from the support of this measure of maximal entropy is also of significant interest. In certain cases, there is a physically relevant invariant real slice that is away from the support of this measure.  In other cases, one may be interested in the topology of the Fatou set, on which the dynamics of the map is stable. For these types of questions, we need new conjectures, which the PI believes will be best developed by studying appropriate examples. The PI proposes three different projects, each providing examples that can motivate a deeper theory of complex dynamics in several variables.  They are: (1) study of rational maps arising as renormalization operators for the Ising model (a model for magnetic materials) on hierarchical lattices, (2) study of Fatou components for globally holomorphic maps of the complex projective plane, and (3) investigation of the first properties for a family of postcritically finite rational maps that have indeterminate points.<br/><br/>All three of the proposed projects will work out details for the dynamical behavior of specific rational maps in several variables. This will push the contemporary theory and also help to develop new conjectures.  Moreover, the project related to the Ising model will help to build new connections between three fields (real-dynamics, complex dynamics, and statistical physics), while potentially leading to a deeper theoretical understanding of magnetic materials.  There is significant potential for broader impact, particularly by fostering better communication between researchers in dynamical systems and mathematical physics.  Work related to these projects can influence students of all levels, from very talented high school students (with whom the PI actively works) through Ph.D. candidates, by exposing them to contemporary research that crosses between disciplines."

However, many open questions still remain. The proposed research is directed in three main directions: (a) a better understanding of the relation between zonoids and intersection bodies, such as conditions that ensure that an intersection body is the dual of a zonoid, or the study of the asymptotic behavior of zonoids whose polars are zonoids; (b) the study of the convexity properties and fixed points of the intersection body operator; (c) reconstruction of non-symmetric bodies from lower dimensional information, such as the area or the perimeter of their parallel sections. <br/><br/>Convex bodies appear as objects of study in many areas of Mathematics, and have applications in Physics, Medicine, and Computer Science.

Convexity holds central importance in optimization and linear programming problems. This project works towards the advancement of the mathematical understanding convex bodies and the relation between their analytic and geometric properties.  The proposed educational program, which includes graduate classes and seminars, undergraduate projects at North Dakota State University, and visitor exchanges with other Universities, will help prepare mathematicians to work in these areas.

The underlying theme of the research is to devise new techniques and tools in the deformation theory of operator algebras. The idea of deformations of algebras is intimately related to K-theory, as is revealed by the development of E-theory. In particular one can read the K-homology of a locally compact connected space X from matricial deformations of the algebra of continuous functions on X. In what may be regarded as a counterpart of this property in condensed-matter physics, Kitaev has proposed very recently a classification of topological insulators that is based on real K-homology and that relies ultimately on a classification up to approximate unitary equivalence of matricial deformations of spaces. A first objective of the project is to study invariants of C*-algebras that integrate the primitive spectrum along with homological invariants. This is naturally tied to the idea of deformation and the theory of continuous fields and will involve the study of KK-theory and E-theory parametrized by spaces that are not necessarily Hausdorff. A second objective is to investigate the existence of deformations of group C*-algebras into matrix algebras with the property that they detect the K-theory of the group C*-algebras. In addition, the principal investigator aims to provide formulas for computing invariants associated with these deformations. A third objective is to study invariants of simple C*-algebras that capture properties not detected by K-theory or tracial states. In particular, the project will investigate rigidity properties of simple C*-algebras.<br/><br/>The physics of elementary particles has led to new mathematical theories in which numerical functions are replaced with infinite arrays of numbers or matrices.  Matrices can be multiplied, but unlike numerical multiplication, the order of the factors is essential, so that A times B is not always equal to B times A. This property of matrix multiplication, called noncommutativity, is crucial for the interpretation of very complex phenomena in quantum mechanics that might initially appear completely counter-intuitive (e.g., Heisenberg's uncertainty principle). The passage from numbers to matrices often involves a process of deformation in which spatial structures are discretized in such a way that the possible twists of surfaces (or even more complicated objects) are captured in the form of numerical invariants. This project is concerned with the theory of such deformations and connects classical geometry with noncommutative geometry, a theory that proposes a reconstruction of the general concept of space that is better aligned with the principles of quantum physics than is traditional geometry. Moreover, the deformation theory that the principal investigator will study provides mathematical tools relevant to physical phenomena that are observed in certain special materials. These materials behave as insulators in their interiors, while permitting the movement of charges on their surfaces, due to exotic metallic states localized there. Such remarkable new materials, known as ""topological insulators,"" have already had a considerable impact on condensed matter physics and are expected to find technological applications in magneto-electronics, an emerging field in which spin currents are used instead of charge currents, and in quantum computing."

The first aim of this project is to extend our understanding of nonlinear dispersive equations by using the method of space-time resonances, which was introduced recently by the principal investigator and his collaborators, Nader Masmoudi and Jalal Shatah. The method of space-time resonances combines the standard notion of resonances, well known since at least Poincare's time, with a study of the spatial localization of solutions. Its aim is to understand the stability of equilibria. It involves delicate multilinear harmonic analysis questions, which the principal investigator plans to study systematically. The second aim of this project is to deepen our understanding of self-similar blow-up. This is a mechanism for the formation of singularities in the solutions of nonlinear dispersive equations, a topic of fundamental importance in the study of such equations.<br/><br/>So-called nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations are a class of equations describing extremely varied physical phenomena: surface water waves, the physics of charged fluids (plasmas), or quantum mechanical effects, to name but three. The range of applications is very broad:  the physics of water waves includes the study of tsunamis; as for plasma physics, it is not only very important for our understanding of the universe but is also crucial for many industrial applications. The aim of the principal investigator is to deepen our understanding of this very general class of equations at a fundamental level. He intends to study two questions in particular. First, when are the equilibria of these equations stable? Second, how do these equations develop singularities or, stated differently, how can ""smooth"" solutions of these equations become increasingly ""jagged""? Answers to these questions would, for instance, help understand how tsunami waves propagate or how laser beams focus."

Specific issues to be investigated include `algebraic stability' for degree growth of maps, laminarity of invariant currents in codimension greater than one, and how to intersect dynamically natural closed currents to produce invariant measures.<br/><br/> A dynamical system, at its most general, is any 'thing'-e.g. the weather, a bacteria colony, an economy, or a solar system-that evolves in time according to definite mathematical rules. Given the present state of the system, one often wants to know something about its future state.  Will the earth warm significantly in the next century?  Will the solar system fly apart?  What are the long term financial effects of a given tax cut or government intervention?  In a broad mathematical sense, all of these questions reduce to understanding whether some aspect of a dynamical system is 'stable' or 'unstable'.  That is, does it vary slowly and predictably as the system evolves, and or is it prone to change rapidly and chaotically with a small variation in the system.  The research proposed here aims at better understanding mathematics of dynamical systems, and in particular at determining and describing those parts of a system which are most unstable.  Funding for this proposal will also support the two PhD students the PI is currently advising.

It will improve the recent explicit constructions of matrices with the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) so as to match  more closely the optimal efficiency of  probabilistic constructions.   RIP matrices are used in compressed sensing to reconstruct a sparse signal by a measurements vector of much  smaller dimension  than that  of the signal. A vector contained in a Banach space can be approximated by finite expressions involving the elements of a basis or a redundant dictionary such as a frame. Typically these approximants are selected by a greedy algorithm such as the X greedy Algorithm or the Thresholding Greedy Algorithm.  Convergence results for these algorithms depend on geometrical properties of the Banach space such as uniform smoothness. They also depend on unconditionality properties of the dictionary. An important related open problem in Banach space theory to be resolved is to show that the family of constants (Elton constants) corresponding to the  nonlinear projection of  a vector onto sets of  large coefficients is uniformly bounded.  Closely connected to this is the quantization problem of replacing arbitrary real coefficients by a finite alphabet of coefficients. The existence of dictionaries with good quantization properties will be related to the geometrical properties of the Banach space. Quantitative results will be obtained in the finite-dimensional setting. <br/><br/>A Banach space is a collection of objects called vectors which can be added together or multiplied by numbers to form other vectors. There is a concept of distance between vectors which is analogous to the familiar notion of distance between the points in the three-dimensional world which we inhabit.  Mathematicians have found that Banach spaces provide the correct framework in which to formulate major areas of mathematics such as Functional Analysis and Partial Differential Equations. Banach spaces are also used by scientists and engineers to model problems in applied areas such as fluid mechanics, signals processing, and  finance. There are many different Banach spaces which can be distinguished from each other by geometrical properties such as smoothness and convexity. An individual vector belonging to a Banach space is usually identified by an infinite string of numbers called coefficients.  An important problem in data compression is to find a method to select the most significant coefficients so that the resulting finite string vector is a short distance from the original vector. The project will concentrate on this and other problems involving geometrical properties of Banach spaces."

The first group of questions is concerned with the return times phenomenon for measure-preserving systems. Here, one is interested in the convergence of weighted averages along flows in dynamical systems, specifically when the weights are generated by a flow in a second dynamical system.  Two problems of particular interest are to determine the amount of Lp regularity required for convergence, especially when the averages are replaced by singular integrals, and to determine, in terms of variation-norm estimates, how quickly this convergence occurs. These problems should be addressed by proving suitable extensions of the Carleson-Hunt theorem. The second group of questions concerns the bilinear Hilbert transform. One problem of interest here is to find new estimates which are uniform in the parameter which determines the singularity set for the transform. A second problem is to determine the rate of convergence for truncated transforms and the associated maximal operator. Although, at first glance, these two groups of questions may not seem to be related, their resolution is expected to be largely guided by a common set of tools. <br/><br/>The proposed research falls under the broad umbrella of harmonic analysis, a discipline which studies the decomposition of many types of data into combinations of basic waves of varying frequencies. These decompositions have been broadly applied in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and finance. An application which is especially relevant here is data compression, where one seeks to represent a signal, such as a movie or audio track, accurately while using a minimum amount of storage space. Convergence rate estimates, as in the previous paragraph, can in principle be used to characterize how much space is needed to give a ""good"" representation of a signal.

Kerr spacetimes and perturbations of such are of particular interest, due to aspirations to contribute to a proof of the stability of this family of solutions to Einstein's equations.  Recent work has focused on proving localized energy estimates and Strichartz estimates, which are both measures of the dispersive nature of the wave equation which are known to be fairly robust.  The former have played a key role in Tataru's recent proof of the long conjectured Price's law, which asserts a certain decay rate for solutions to the wave equation on the Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds.  A key feature of these blackhole spacetimes which demands extra attention is the existence of trapped rays.  In flat space, light travels on lines which escape to infinity.  Thus packets of a solution which are initially overlapping but traveling in even slightly different directions quickly spread out, and this spreading promotes decay.  On Schwarzschild, the paths on which light travels are dictated by the geometry, and in particular, there is a region, called the photon sphere, where photons can orbit the blackhole.  Such trapping, where the rays remain in a compact set, is a known obstacle to certain dispersive estimates, such as localized energy estimates.  Trapping also occurs on the Kerr family of spacetimes, though its geometry is more complicated.  <br/><br/>General relativity asserts that the universe is a (1+3) dimensional curved space and that gravity corresponds to the curvature of this space.  A common description is to think of the universe as a trampoline.  A mass, such as a bowling ball, which is placed on the trampoline causes it to curve in such a way as to attract other objects on the surface.  Einstein's equations model the curvature and evolution of such curvature of universes.  Though Einstein's equations are quite nonlinear, a few special solutions are known.  These are typically found by imposing many symmetries to simplify the equations.  Of particular relevance to this proposal are the Minkowski space time, the family of Schwarzschild space times, and the Kerr family of space times.  These correspond to the flat solution, to spherically symmetric black holes, and to rotating black holes respectively.  A natural question to ask is whether these solutions are stable.  That is, if one starts close to, say, a member of the Kerr family of space times, will it necessarily remain close to a member of the Kerr family.  The only rigorous proofs of (nonlinear) stability are for the Minkowski space time, which began with the seminal work of Christodoulou and Klainerman.  The stability of the Kerr family of space times is a major open problem in mathematical relativity which has been garnering much interest recently.  A thorough understanding of the decay properties of the wave equation on such backgrounds is considered to be prerequisite knowledge to any proof of such stability.  The studies in this proposal are expected to directly contribute to this.  The teaching components of this proposal consist primarily of the development of a course on general relativity as well as a first year seminar course.  The research and teaching components are integrated through reading seminars and directed research projects."

These problems are of interest to various fields in physics and mathematics, especially modern complex analysis where respective insights and methods are often shared. The class of problems described in the proposal is probabilistic in nature, and the use of probabilistic methods is essential.

In physics Dyson gas appears in Quantum Hall Effect, in Calogero models describing particles with fractional charge and statistics, quantum chaos and random matrix theory. In mathematics Dyson gas appears in the theory of Selberg integrals, complex analysis, the theory of orthogonal polynomials and integrable models of statistical mechanics. In recent years it became clear that Dyson gas has an intrinsic relation with conformal stochastic geometry and representations of Virasoro algebra.

The proposal builds on the momentum of such unification by focusing on interdisciplinary problems of current interest that fall into the realm of conformal stochastic geometry. Some of them have accurate mathematical formulations; others have not been so far formulated in a rigorous way. One of our goals is to develop mathematical formulations of important physical problems in the domain of conformal stochastic geometry. The broader impact of the proposed research lies in bringing together ideas from various fields of physics and mathematics including complex analysis, probability theory, random matrices, conformal field theory, non-equilibrium growth phenomena, and disordered systems. The proposed research will result in bringing these fields closer by communicating the results to various research communities and promoting collaborations between practitioners in diverse areas.

The proposed problems have direct applications in the theory of automorphic forms and in the Langlands program. They also have analytic and geometric aspects. The problems are divided into three topics: Harmonic analysis, representation theory of groupoids and the integrability theorem. Here are brief descriptions of those topics: The PI views harmonic analysis on spherical spaces as a generalization of representation theory. His aim is to transfer certain fundamental results from representation theory to the realm of harmonic analysis on spherical spaces.<br/>The notion of a groupoid is an interesting generalization of the notion of group. The PI proposes to re-build the representation theory of p-adic groups for the case of groupoids. The integrability theorem is a theorem from the theory of D-modules which has powerful applications in the theory of invariant distributions on real manifolds, which in turn is an important ingredient of representation theory. The theory of D-modules, however, is not applicable to the p-adic case. Based on a previous partial result, the PI proposes to provide an analog of the integrability theorem for the p-adic case.<br/><br/>The propose project is about representation theory and harmonic analysis. A model example of the problems in this project can be the Fourier series. The Fourier series is a decomposition of a function on the circle as a sum of imaginary exponent (which are closely related to the trigonometric functions sine and cosine). These exponents change in a very simple way when you rotate the circle. The problems that the PI studies are, in a sense, a generalization of this construction for higher dimensional cases. In general, group theory can be viewed as the study of symmetries of mathematical objects, representation theory - as the study of symmetries of vector spaces, and harmonic analysis - as the study of spaces of functions over geometric objects that possess symmetries. The geometric objects that are studied are real and p-adic manifolds. Real manifolds are geometric objects that locally look like a line, a plain, a three dimensional space (like the one we live in) or a higher dimensional space. p-adic manifolds are certain analogues of real manifolds. Representation theory of real groups and harmonic analysis on real spaces have various applications in geometry, analysis and subsequently in physics, signal processing, image processing and biology. Both the p-adic and the real case have many important applications in number theory. More specifically, in the theory of automorphic forms and in the Langlands program."

The immediate focus is the study of the algorithm developed by the PI for creating the martingales; if it can be taken to its conclusion for each function, then that will prove the conjecture. The conjecture is motivated by the problem of the sharp norm of the Beurling-Ahlfors transformation in the plane, and its generalizations to space, but it has a wider scope and implies even stronger inequalities and provides further insight into the geometric behavior of functions. The principal investigator has found that in three dimensions, the conjecture has a new physical interpretation as a relation between the static electric and magnetic fields: they also would be related by rotations and a pair of martingales. Secondly, the principal investigator  proposes to study the order of growth and other global properties of the solutions to the Painleve differential equations. <br/><br/>The first part of this project strives to create new structures tying together analysis and probability theory, with a connection to the physics of the static electromagnetic field in dimension three. Work in the second part of the proposal addresses the properties of Painleve transcendents, an important class of nonlinear special functions. Painleve equations appear in numerous ways in current work on other parts of mathematics, such as differential geometry and random matrices. They are being used in ongoing work by a large number of scientists in physics, astronomy, and engineering, for example in the following areas: bubble break-off and other Hele-Shaw problems in incompressible viscous fluids, resonant oscillations in shallow water, general relativity and cosmology, plasma physics, superconductivity, non-linear optics and fiber optics, polymers, polyelectrolytes, and colloids, the Ising model in physics, correlations functions in an antiferromagnet model, quantum field theory and topological field theory. Painleve equations unify many fields as they provide a connection to integrability for non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations. This project contributes to increasing our knowledge of the behavior of the Painleve transcendents and should benefit those applying these equations. The graduate students of the PI will be involved in both parts of the project."

First, stability issues for the 2-fluids Euler-Maxwell equation, which is one of the fundamental equations in plasma physics, are considered. The goal is to prove that, under certain conditions, small perturbations of an equilibrium will not develop shocks, and that, actually, the plasma will get back to equilibrium, even in the absence of dissipation. Such a result would be of great physical and mathematical importance as it is known to be false for the compressible Euler equation in the absence of a self-consistent electromagnetic field. In a second part, a study is made of the Schrodinger equation on a curved background. In this case, many classical tools from the Euclidean theory break down and one expects the appearance of many new phenomena due to the influence of the geometry of the background. In particular, a study will be made of the effect of the growth of the volume on the global existence and global behavior of the solutions to the energy-critical equation. Finally, in a third part, ideas developed before are used to upgrade some known results about the homogeneous fourth-order equation to the more physical inhomogeneous equation. <br/><br/>Understanding how a fluid can be stabilized by a self-consistent electromagnetic field in the absence of any friction represents a cross-disciplinary collaboration between pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and physics, with applications in fluid engineering. More specifically, proving that a plasma at rest is stable under small perturbations would be a major physical discovery and would most certainly greatly enhance our ways to control plasma. This is especially fitting since plasma stability is one of the main factor limiting performances in tokamaks. Finally, beyond industrial applications, plasma represents the state of more than 99% of the matter in the universe and any work providing better understanding of this state would be of great importance. Dispersive equations and equations on curved spaces (manifolds) provide a rich area of interaction between various branches of mathematics as well as between different sciences. The study of equations on curved spaces is of interest to geometers, analysts, and number theorists in mathematics, as well as to theoretical physicists working in quantum chaos and general relativity. Fourth-order equations naturally arise in many different branches of physics and mathematics, especially those linked with elasticity and are critical to understand phenomena as diverse as the movement (and possible oscillations and breakdown) of bridges or the structure of blood vessels and the interaction between their membranes and the biofluids."

From a theorem of Gelfand we know that a unital commutative C*-algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of continuous functions on some compact Hausdorrf space. The structure of a commutative C*-algebra is thus completely determined by the underlying space, or the topological structure of the space. A homomorphism from one commutative C*-algebra to another is induced and determined by a continuous map from one underlying space to another. Thus, in the noncommutative setting, this project comes down to a study of noncommutative topology. The central goals of the project are (1) to use K-theory-related data to classify separable, simple, amenable C*-algebras, (2) to determine approximate unitary equivalence classes of homomorphisms, and (3) to find applications to the study of noncommutative topology and topological dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The simplest C*-algebra is the system of all complex numbers. The next most simple C*-algebras are systems of matrices of complex numbers. In general, C*-algebras are systems of operators (which can be thought of as generalizations of matrices). For example, differentiation and integration are operators on certain function spaces. Operators can also be used, for example, as models for observables for the microscopic physical world. A system of operators has the structure of addition and multiplication, just like the system of numbers. Unlike the system of numbers, where two times three is the same as three times two, in a general C*-algebra the product A times B may not be the same as B times A. This noncommutativity reflects the reality of quantum physics and corresponds to the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle. C*-algebras arise in many diverse areas of science and engineering, of which quantum mechanics is just one important example. For purposes of application, as well as for theoretical reasons, it is important to understand the structure of C*-algebras, or the structure of systems of operators formed from different applications. The aim of this project is to find the simplest essential data that determine both the structure of a C*-algebra and the relations that exist between C*-algebras so that applications become possible. To be useful, the data should be easy to obtain and relatively easy to compute. Furthermore, if two C*-algebras give rise to the same set of data, then the algebras should be identical for purposes of all applications. The prinicipal investigator has to search these data and invent tools to provide a proof that such data can indeed be used to determine completely the structure of the corresponding C*-algebras. The expected immediate applications will be to the study of dynamical systems. However, a long-term impact should be felt in many other areas of mathematics (e.g., linear algebra, operator theory, group representations, noncommutative topology, noncommutative geometry). In the last few years, some related research involved the training of several Ph.D. students. This project will also include both graduate student training and the mentoring of postdoctoral researchers."

Common themes in all three areas are spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, and rescaling arguments leading to singular limit spaces.<br/><br/>The project aims to study two nonlinear analogs of the heat equation: evolution of surfaces by mean curvature, and Hamilton's Ricci flow.  Evolution by mean curvature has been studied for decades as a natural model for evolving surface interfaces.  Ricci flow describes an evolving geometry, and was used in Perelman's solution of the Poincare conjecture.  The primary objective of the proposed research on these equations is to study singularities and show that they have a very special form.  Another component of the research program is an investigation of spaces which have a self-similar or fractal character, using analytic tools that have been developed in the last few years.  Here one of the goals is to deform the space into an optimal form, if possible, in order to reveal hidden symmetries,  and otherwise show that no hidden symmetries exist.  This is very useful for understanding the asymptotic shape of infinite groups, and is part of confluence of several research trends over the last 10-15 years.  Another application of similar ideas is to  embedding problems in theoretical computer science: Cheeger, Naor,  and the PI were able to substantially improve the previous best known results on the embedding of spaces of negative type, in connection with the quantitative version of the Goemans-Linial conjecture."

The principal investigator will apply and develop methods of noncommutative geometry to study the index theory of hypoelliptic Fredholm operators associated to various geometric structures (most notably contact structures and foliations). His belief is that the results will pay off in two directions: hypoelliptic operators provide examples of phenomena not exhibited by elliptic operators, yielding new insights that further the development of index theory itself, and, conversely, index formulas of hypoelliptic operators will lead to new results in geometry. A specific aim of the project is to develop new applications of index theory to contact geometry.<br/><br/>In the early 1960s the British mathematician Michael Atiyah and the American mathematician Isodore Singer derived an important formula. The ""Atiyah-Singer index formula"" established a deep connection between two central branches of mathematics: analysis (the modern version of differential and integral calculus) and topology/geometry (the study of higher dimensional curved space). The index formula subsumed several important classical results and has subsequently led to numerous applications and new developments in many areas of mathematics as well as in theoretical physics. The continued relevance of index theory is evidenced, for example, by the very recent proof of the celebrated ""Weinstein conjecture,"" which says that (under certain mild hypotheses) every mechanical arrangement of moving objects (a ""dynamical system"") can be configured in such a way that the collective motion of the system will exactly repeat itself after a finite time-interval. The proof of this theorem makes use, in crucial places, of the formula of Atiyah and Singer. This project extends the applicability of index formulas to a large new class of problems that were not covered by the original theory. Ideas from the emerging area of noncommutative geometry (a recent and radical revision of the foundation concepts of geometry inspired by quantum theory) play a central role in this work. This project establishes substantial new connections between separate branches of pure mathematics, and it opens up a new area of application of the index formula that has been crucial to the development of mathematics for the last fifty years."

The proposed treatment of these questions can be briefly described as follows. One represents the Hilbert space on which the contractive semigroup acts as a chain of subspaces so that on each of the subspaces the semigroup acts almost as a group of unitaries. The corresponding spectral picture produces a chain of spaces of analytic functions. The goal is then to understand the properties of the semigroup by investigating these spaces and their relationship to the spaces generated by a certain model semigroup. The latter often reduces to a problem about invertibility properties of certain Toeplitz operators. In its essence, the method that the investigator suggests to treat these problems can be viewed as a delicate form of the classical argument principle. It has in its basis the powerful method of N. Makarov and A. Poltoratski regarding the injectivity problem for Toeplitz operators. As is often the case in harmonic analysis, the delicate properties of the Hilbert transform again should play the central role.<br/><br/>The majority of the problems proposed in this project lie within the area of harmonic analysis. The core idea of harmonic analysis is the possibility of representing complicated signals as a combination of simpler signals - atoms which are in a sense canonical for the problem at hand. Due to the imprecision of measurements one is sometimes required to use a slightly different system of atoms,  which may or may not possess the ideal properties of the canonical system. Careful analysis is required to determine to which extent the properties present under ideal measurements continue to hold in a real world situation. A large part of this project is devoted to the further development of the mathematical tools necessary for such an analysis. Potential applications are possible in the areas of signal processing and control theory. In addition, another goal of this project is to popularize the classical areas of harmonic and complex analysis by softening some existing deep techniques, thus making them more accessible to the future generations of mathematicians as well as to other scientists. As a member of a major science-technology university, the investigator will also incorporate some of these new ideas to offer an up-to-date, quality education of the new generations of STEM majors, at both the undergraduate and graduate level."

The investigator is interested in how the geometry, the boundary and the regularity of the metric influence certain basic estimates.  Problems of this kind arise in the study of harmonic analysis on manifolds, the study of local and global solutions of nonlinear wave equations and in the study of eigenfunctions in quantum chaos.  Although these topics are widely separated in their physical and historical origins, the relevant mathematics is closely related.  Techniques and insights in the various areas cross-fertilize each other in a fruitful way.  In particular, a common theme of much current research (and the problems in this proposal) is to try to understand and exploit the mass concentration of eigenfunctions and solutions of linear and nonlinear wave equations. The basic estimates that we have in mind are Lebesgue-space estimates (both linear and bilinear) in space for eigenfunctions and quasimodes, and (local or global) Strichartz estimates in spacetime.  The main questions center around how the geometry and especially the presence of a boundary affects the estimates and the kinds of solutions that saturate them.  The latter issue is closely related to the much studied (but still not well understood) questions of concentration, oscillation and size properties of modes and quasimodes in spectral asymptotics.  In the non-compact setting it is also closely related to the distribution of resonances and their relations to trapped geodesics.  In the compact setting we are also interested in exploring how concentration properties of eigenfunctions are related to their nodal sets, which is the set of points where the function vanishes. The investigator wishes to use current and new estimates for eigenfunctions to make further progress on Yau's conjecture about the size of these sets.  He also is interested in seeing how certain curvature assumptions affect these estimates and exploring connections with quantum ergodicity.<br/><br/>The above problems arise naturally from interactions between mathematics and areas in physics that include general relativity, quantum mechanics, and quantum chaos.  The techniques employed include stationary phase and the study of propagation of singularities.  There is a very active group of researchers in quantum physics groups at major universities studying high-energy eigenstates, and the investigator is especially interested in making further contributions to this area."

Applications include Hermitian analogues of Hilbert's 17-th problem, revolving around new matrix positivity conditions for Hermitian polynomials on algebraic sets. This work is closely related to a non-linear form of the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and to the notion of Hermitian nullity of a set with respect to a real ideal.

It will establish that the isentropic Euler equations can be understood as a steepest descent on a suitable space of probability measures, by proving that a sequence of approximate solutions generated by a certain variational time discretization converges to a measure-valued solution of the conservation law. For the particular cases of one space dimension and of self-similar solutions, it will be shown that these measure-valued solutions are weak entropy solutions in the classical sense. A novel solution concept for the isentropic Euler equations will be explored in the framework of second-order differential inclusions. The interpretation as a differential inclusion will also be applied to one-dimensional models of compressible fluid flows with interactions, in the context of sticky particle dynamics. Stability of sticky particle solutions will be shown and global existence will be established. The variational time discretization will be used to derive new numerical methods for the two-dimensional isentropic Euler equations. Finally, the project will investigate the fine structure of solutions through gamma-convergence of the energy dissipation functional.<br/><br/>The compressible Euler equations model the dynamics of compressible fluids, in particular, of gases. They express in mathematical terms a simple but fundamental principle of physics: that mass and energy must be preserved. They form the basic building block for mathematical models in various disciplines of science and engineering. One example is aerodynamics: an understanding of the properties of solutions to the compressible Euler equations are necessary to design more efficient airplane wings or cars with smaller aerodynamical resistance. Other examples include the theory of combustion processes, weather and climate modeling, models of blood flows, and more. This project will advance the mathematical understanding of the compressible Euler equations by harnessing tools from another field in mathematics that has attracted a lot of interest recently and is developing rapidly: optimal transport. This theory grew out of a very simple engineering problem: How does one move an amount of sand or debris from one place to another, with minimal effort? When applied to the compressible Euler equations, this theory expresses the idea that typically nature tries to do things in the most economical way. This point of view allows us to gain new insights into the nature of the compressible Euler equations and the properties of their solutions."

These projects are inspired by comparing and contrasting these two types of dynamics and geometry. This has been a fruitful approach for the PI and many other researchers, who have found that results in one setting can be translated to the other, and that this process yields insights to both sets of problems.

As such, these problems provide mentoring opportunities at several levels, from postdoctoral fellows, to PhD students, to undergraduates, to high school students and teachers. The study of flat surfaces has significant concrete applications to the dynamics of interacting particles, and other important physical systems.

The main goal of the project is to study the spectral theory of these Laplacians, in particular, the interplay between the spectral behavior of the complex Laplacians and the geometric structure of the underlying spaces. Problems to be addressed in this project include explicit computations, positivity, pure discreteness, and stability of the spectrum. The principal investigator will also study boundary behavior of the Bergman and Szego kernels, as well as the relationship between these kernels.<br/><br/>Complex analysis is an essential tool in physics and engineering. The classical differential operators known under their technical names as the Dirichlet- and Neumann-Laplacians have been used to study heat diffusion and fluid dynamics by physicists and engineers for more than two centuries. The so-called complex Laplacians are the analogues of these classical operators in the setting of complex analysis in several variables. Spectral theory of differential operators plays an important role in many areas of biological, medical, and physical sciences. For example, the inverse problem--the problem of determining the shape from spectral properties--has applications in fields such as medical imaging. Pure discreteness of the spectra of the complex Laplacians is intimately related to diamagnetism and paramagnetism, topics widely studied in quantum physics and chemistry. Ideas and techniques developed in this project can potentially have repercussions in other branches of mathematics and sciences. The project also has significant impact on the development of human resources: the principal investigator will develop topics courses and engage graduate and undergraduate students in research activities. Research in this project will be incorporated into the teaching and learning process. In addition, this project will also facilitate interdisciplinary research activities among mathematicians, biologists, and computer scientists."

Two examples are the surface of least area dividing a solid into two halves of equal volume and the first nodal set, the surface where the lowest energy eigenfunction changes sign. The project considers at the same time abrupt transitions from one phase or material to another and more gradual transitions. A main goal is to study the interaction of all levels of the transition and to establish that the transition happens in the simplest possible way. The proposal suggests large-scale geometric mechanisms that cause optimizing level surfaces to resemble parallel planes at smaller scales. A second aspect of the project is to study the fluctuations of a lattice growth model known as internal diffusion-limited aggregation (internal DLA). In the limit, as the lattice size tends to zero, this process approaches a continuum free boundary evolution known as Hele-Shaw flow. In a first, key step, the principal investigator and his coauthors, Lionel Levine and Scott Sheffield, have shown that the fluctuations are closely related to the Gaussian Free Field, a random distribution in two or more dimensions that is analogous to Brownian motion in one dimension.<br/><br/>The interfaces treated in this proposal arise as profiles of wakes and jets, as the boundary surface between oil and water or between ice and water, and in other phase transitions in physics.  In each of those cases, the optimal shape is dictated by a physical principle. There are, moreover, examples of interfaces governed by economic principles, such as the surface where an insulating material meets the outside air, optimized to minimize the total cost of the insulating material and the energy needed to maintain a desired temperature. The probabilistic lattice model mentioned above was proposed in the 1980s by chemists Paul Meakin and John M. Deutch to describe the movement of molecules in industrial chemical processes such as electropolishing, etching, and corrosion. The fluctuations studied in this project are the very issue of concern to chemists, who want to estimate the roughness of metal surfaces at the molecular scale. In addition to conducting his own research, the principal investigator organizes and supervises graduate student mentors of undergraduates and high school students in two MIT summer programs, one of which is the internationally recognized Research Science Institute (RSI)."

An important particular case is that of flows along stable foliations of pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms.A specific tool essential for this study is the symbolic coding, developed and studied by the proposer, of translation flows as suspension flows over Vershik automorphisms, a construction developing earlier work of S.Ito.

Despite over two centuries of intensive research and a massive body of results, today partial differential equations on domains are thoroughly understood only when both the coefficients and the domain exhibit smoothness.  However, the dominance of irregularities in real life and numerous problems in modern mathematics demand for an extension of the classical  ""smooth"" theory. Three major directions for this extension pursued by the PI are: (a) the study of boundary problems with rough data on non-smooth domains; (b) the second-order elliptic operators with non-smooth coefficients; (c) elliptic PDEs of higher order. The scope of the proposed work incorporates a full range of sharp well-posedness and regularity results, asymptotic formulas, introduction and analysis of new measures, capacities and new function spaces, numerical experiment, localization phenomena.<br/><br/>Given the ubiquitousness of irregularities in nature and in man-made mechanisms, their understanding is essential to science, engineering, industry, and to society in general. Indeed, most classical models only provide a nice, smooth approximation of the objects and processes. However, perfectly uniform smooth systems do not exist in nature, and every real object inadvertently possesses singularities (a sharp edge of the boundary, an abrupt change of the medium, a defect of the construction). They often have a decisive effect on the occurring phenomena, but cannot be captured in a smooth set-up (e.g., the fractal structure of lungs). The present project combines the mathematical pursuit and a rigorous educational program towards the general goal of advancing analysis of partial differential equation in non-smooth media and preparing a diverse array of mathematicians working in related areas. The latter objective will, in particular, be achieved through a novel Workshop for Women in Analysis and PDE."

The proposers intend to concentrate on the following specific problems: geometry and topology of real and complex spectral loci of the one-dimensional Schrödinger operators with polynomial and rational potentials; singularities of implicit analytic functions defined by entire relations; general properties of certain classes of meromorphic functions occurring in holomorphic dynamics and in spectral theory of the Schrödinger operators; polynomial approximation of discontinuous functions on systems of intervals.

Their solutions are waves that spread out in space as time evolves but that conserve energy. Probably the best known equation within the class of dispersive PDE is the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, which models a variety of physical waves, from signals in fiber optics to the macroscopic dynamics of the Bose-Einsten condensate. In the last fifteen years enormous progress has been made in settling fundamental questions on existence of solutions to the equation, their long-time behavior, and singularity formation. The thrust of this body of work has focused primarily on deterministic aspects of wave phenomena that have been studied with sophisticated tools from nonlinear Fourier analysis, analytic number theory, and geometry. The principal investigator's main line of research has revolved around this aspect of mathematics for along time. More recently, a growing interest has been shown in incorporating nondeterministic points of view into the field of dispersive PDE. This has become one of the principal investigator's favorite lines of work in the last couple of years, and one that will be pursued in this project.  Another new element in the project is the study of the ""process"" used by mathematical physicists to pass from a complex system of particles interacting with one another to a macroscopic wave function that is able to describe the most important features of the system as a whole. More precisely, the principal investigator will study the effective evolution equations arising as an appropriate limit of many body quantum dynamics. <br/><br/>From a mathematical point of view the types of problems that the principal investigator intends to explore in this project lie at the intersection of Fourier analysis, analytic number theory, numerical analysis, geometry, probability, and mathematical physics. Often it is difficult to ""communicate"" in so many different mathematical languages, but the time seems ripe to start such a conversation. The description of the problems that the principal investigator proposes in her research program should testify to this fact. Although she conducts her research mostly in the realm of pure mathematics, the solutions to the problems she considers have the potential to see very concrete and very diverse consequences in real life. For example, understanding the most efficient way to send a signal through a fiber optic cable or being able to anticipate the properties of a gas when the temperature approaches absolute zero are two very different phenomena in nature. On the other hand, they are both aspects of solutions to the same dispersive equation, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation that is one of the foci of this project, and they can be studied using the same mathematical language. In recent years, the world has witnessed incredible advances in technology. As scientists and engineers seek to take even greater strides in the technological arena, they are guided by experiments, but also by mathematical models, such as those provided by research on the Schrodinger equation. There is no doubt that solid predictions on the mathematical side will help target the experimental component in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible, thus saving resources as well as valuable time."

In recent years, there has been significant progress in the mathematical understanding of the effects of flow on combustion.  Nevertheless, the inherent complexity and richness of the phenomena continues to present a challenge to our study of this problem.  These models are given by nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular, by reaction-diffusion equations which may also be coupled to equations of fluid dynamics.  One of the goals of the proposed research  is a continuation of previous work on passive combustion in periodic, random, as well as general inhomogeneous media.  The main questions of interest include the effects of flows on mixing and on speed-up of propagation of reaction.  In addition, simplified models will be considered and experience gained from their study will be applied to the original problems.  Another goal of the project is the study of propagation of reaction in a model of active combustion, with direct feedback of reaction on the fluid motion via the buoyancy force and gravity-induced mixing.  In many situations this effect cannot be ignored, particularly in highly turbulent combustion regimes.  Although this is a very difficult problem, limited progress has been achieved recently and it is proposed here to build upon these results.  The developed techniques will also be applied to the study of other related models, including systems of reaction-diffusion equations and a model of liquid suspensions.<br/><br/>Reactive processes, such as burning in internal combustion engines, nuclear reactions in stars, and forest fires, are ubiquitous in nature.  Their study is relevant to several branches of science and engineering such as astrophysics, biology, environmental science, and chemical engineering.  The research proposed here focuses on the influence of the motion of the underlying medium, such as fluid flow, on the speed of spreading of reactive processes.  It aims at improving our understanding of fundamental mathematical models describing such processes, which may provide useful qualitative insights into real life phenomena.  An important part of this proposal is its educational component.  The principal investigator (PI) plans to develop an undergraduate partial differential equations (PDE) course at the University of Wisconsin, mentor undergraduate mathematics majors in the study of advanced topics, and organize a Research Experience for Undergraduates program in analysis and PDEs.  The PI will also teach specialized graduate courses and involve graduate students in working under his supervision."

Scattering experiments are widely used in the natural sciences to determine the structure of objects which are far away, like the stars, very small, like the atom, or difficult to reach, like the Earth's core.  In a famous experiment of 1909, for example, by studying the scattering pattern of alpha particles passing through gold foil Rutherford determined that the atom consisted of a nucleus surrounded by electrons.  Semi-classical analysis is a type of phase space analysis which investigates the dependence of operators and related objects on a small parameter.  Originally motivated by Bohr's, or the quantum-classical, correspondence principle, which asserts that classical mechanics is the limit of quantum mechanics as Planck's constant tends to 0, semi-classical analysis has found, however, many applications in diverse areas of science.  The role of the small parameter in these fields can be played by the inverse of the square root of the nuclear mass in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the magnetic field strength in solid-state physics, the adiabatic parameter in adiabatic theory, the inverse of the square root of the energy in high-energy spectral problems, and others.<br/> <br/>By building upon recent advances in semi-classical analysis and scattering theory the research supported by this grant aims to contribute to the following aspects of these fields.  First, it seeks to establish new instances of the quantum-classical correspondence by relating quantum scattering objects to classical ones in the semi-classical limit.  Second, it aims to investigate mainly scattering in the presence of particles or signals which never leave the interaction region.  Such configurations are by now recognized to have a significant impact on the behavior of scattering systems but very few of them have been completed elucidated in the literature.  Lastly, to achieve these goals this research will further the theory of semi-classical Fourier integral operators.  The interesting and important properties of these operators have made them a strong tool not only in semi-classical analysis but also in related fields.  All of these developments have the potential to contribute to the solutions of inverse problems as well as to the advancement of the fields of science mentioned above.<br/><br/>"

The study of quantum mechanical phenomena in disordered environments has been an area of ongoing active study since the 1950's. The mathematical study of electronic properties of disordered structures is carried out within the framework of ergodic Schrödinger operators. This project therefore has a potential impact on physics as it improves our understanding of quantum mechanical transport properties of media exhibiting certain kinds of disorder. Through the training of graduate students the project has in addition an impact on human resource development."

The first part of the project focuses on the shock reflection problem, one of the most fundamental multidimensional shock wave problems. The objective is to study existence, uniqueness, and geometric properties of solutions to the self-similar potential flow equation and the full compressible Euler system, which together model regular shock reflection. The self-similar potential flow equation is a nonlinear second-order equation of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type for the velocity potential. The regular shock reflection problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem for the elliptic phase of the solution. In recent work, G.-Q. Chen and the principal investigator have established the global existence of a regular shock reflection solution for the potential flow in the case where the wedge angle is larger than the sonic angle. The goal of the present project is to extend these results in several directions, including proving existence of subsonic regular reflection (thus completing the proof of the von Neumann detachment conjecture in the framework of potential flow) and including the case of the compressible Euler system. In recent years, progress has been made in the study of the semigeostrophic system with constant Coriolis parameter in flat geometry. The second component of this project will include the investigation of a more physically relevant case of the system, one with variable Coriolis parameter on a manifold, and also a study of solutions that correspond to singular measures in the ""dual"" variables.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems arise in many models in physics, fluid dynamics, engineering, and economics. In physical systems, ""free boundaries"" are regions of rapid variation of conditions between two very different states, such as shock wave in gas dynamics.  Mathematically this rapid transition is simplified as occurring infinitely fast along a surface of discontinuity in the partial differential equation governing the physics. Location of this surface is not known at the outset, thus one must solve both for physical states and their boundaries. Significant progress has been achieved during the last several decades in the study of free boundary problems. However, in the case of nonlinear partial differential equations and especially for equations that have very different properties in the regions separated by the free boundary, many questions remain. The principal investigator plans to apply the techniques of free boundary problems to study some fundamental multidimensional shock waves in gas dynamics, specifically shock reflection patterns. This involves free boundary problems for nonlinear equations and systems of complex structure, for which new methods will be needed. Understanding properties of free boundaries, such as their regularity, stability and geometry, allows better analysis and numerical methods in models and applications. Another focus of the project is the semigeostrophic system, which models large-scale atmospheric/oceanic flows and is used in meteorology, in particular in models of front formation in the atmosphere. Methods include study of related Monge-Kantorovich-type problems. The Monge-Kantorovich mass transport theory has recently been applied successfully in several areas (e.g., kinetic  theory, fluid flow, elastic crystals, granular materials, urban planning, microeconomic decision problems). Broader impact resulting from the project will be achieved since the project addresses the problems important in engineering and meteorology. Also, graduate students will be involved in the work on the project."

The central focus is the geometry and algebra of the mapping class group of a closed surface, specifically the geometric and algebraic behavior of subgroups and profinite completions of this group, and spaces upon which they act. Much of the project is viewed through the lens of hyperbolic geometry, whose theorems and techniques cast a seductive profile upon the mapping class group. The core of the project falls into three parts: (1) continuation of an ongoing project with C. Leininger, relevant to Gromov's Coarse Hyperbolization Problem, to understand convex cocompact subgroups of mapping class groups of surfaces; (2) continuation of a program of the PI, J. Brock, and C. Leininger to produce purely pseudo-Anosov surface subgroups of mapping class groups and surface bundles over surfaces with hyperbolic fundamental group; (3) work devoted to completion of M. Boggi's program to establish the congruence subgroup property for mapping class groups of surfaces, building upon prior work of the PI.<br/><br/>A moduli space is a collection of geometric objects that is itself a geometric object. A practical example is the collection of all possible arrangements of cell phone towers on the surface of the Earth.  One may use the distances between individual towers to define a distance between two arrangements of towers, and the collection of arrangements of towers becomes a geometric object itself, a ""space"" of arrangements. Geographical constraints limit the feasible configurations of towers, and understanding the geometry of the space of feasible configurations can have direct bearing on which configurations provide the best network coverage. The project is concerned with moduli spaces of hyperbolic manifolds, of which the space of configurations of cell phone towers on the Earth is a special example.  There is an intriguing analogy between moduli spaces of hyperbolic manifolds and the hyperbolic manifolds themselves.  In other words, there is a sense in which a collection of hyperbolic manifolds may be roughly considered a hyperbolic manifold itself, creating a sort of information feedback loop reciprocally informing the study of both the hyperbolic manifolds and their moduli spaces. It is this analogy that lies at the heart of the project."

Interest in the infinite case is motivated by connections between infinite IETs and more classical topics. Progress on these classes of examples will make significant contributions to the field of infinite ergodic theory, and to the subject of dynamical systems. Recently, the work of the principal investigator and others in the field have shown the existence of parallels between the theory of infinite IETs, and the much more well developed theory of horocyclic flows on non-compact hyperbolic surfaces. Motivated and directed by these connections, known results about infinite IETs will be extended and new results will be produced.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems is the study of any system which updates according to a fixed rule. For example, a finite number of particles behaving according to the rules of Newtonian mechanics is a dynamical system. This project concerns systems which are said to have low complexity, meaning that similar states for the system take a very long time to become dissimilar. These systems are of interest because they arise naturally from geometric, algebraic and physical questions. Despite the relevance of these systems, questions involving low complexity systems often can not be directly addressed by approaches prevalent in the theory of dynamical systems, because, for instance, these systems are not hyperbolic. This is particularly true for questions about the long term statistical behavior of low complexity systems. This project will extend the collection of tools which do apply to low complexity systems, and further extend the classes of systems to which these tools apply. Progress on these questions is of importance to the development and applicability of the theory of dynamical systems, which is one of the primary mathematical approaches available to understand the physical world.

First, stability issues for the 2-fluids Euler-Maxwell equation, which is one of the fundamental equations in plasma physics, are considered. The goal is to prove that, under certain conditions, small perturbations of an equilibrium will not develop shocks, and that, actually, the plasma will get back to equilibrium, even in the absence of dissipation. Such a result would be of great physical and mathematical importance as it is known to be false for the compressible Euler equation in the absence of a self-consistent electromagnetic field. In a second part, a study is made of the Schrodinger equation on a curved background. In this case, many classical tools from the Euclidean theory break down and one expects the appearance of many new phenomena due to the influence of the geometry of the background. In particular, a study will be made of the effect of the growth of the volume on the global existence and global behavior of the solutions to the energy-critical equation. Finally, in a third part, ideas developed before are used to upgrade some known results about the homogeneous fourth-order equation to the more physical inhomogeneous equation. <br/><br/>Understanding how a fluid can be stabilized by a self-consistent electromagnetic field in the absence of any friction represents a cross-disciplinary collaboration between pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and physics, with applications in fluid engineering. More specifically, proving that a plasma at rest is stable under small perturbations would be a major physical discovery and would most certainly greatly enhance our ways to control plasma. This is especially fitting since plasma stability is one of the main factor limiting performances in tokamaks. Finally, beyond industrial applications, plasma represents the state of more than 99% of the matter in the universe and any work providing better understanding of this state would be of great importance. Dispersive equations and equations on curved spaces (manifolds) provide a rich area of interaction between various branches of mathematics as well as between different sciences. The study of equations on curved spaces is of interest to geometers, analysts, and number theorists in mathematics, as well as to theoretical physicists working in quantum chaos and general relativity. Fourth-order equations naturally arise in many different branches of physics and mathematics, especially those linked with elasticity and are critical to understand phenomena as diverse as the movement (and possible oscillations and breakdown) of bridges or the structure of blood vessels and the interaction between their membranes and the biofluids."

A central part of his theory consists of a quantum analog of the classical Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces. He has given several applications of these ideas, notably to the convergence of matrix algebras to coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups, which is one of the main examples of interest to physicists. Recently he has had initial success in extending his notion of quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance so as to treat the analogs of vector bundles over quantum metric spaces. (Vectors bundles provide the foundation for the gauge theories widely used by physicists.) He has also had recent success going in the direction of expressing the quantum distances in terms of Dirac operators, with the technical advantages that Dirac operators bring. In this project he will continue to strengthen this theory and to apply it in several directions suggested by the many situations in the physics and mathematics of quantum models where one has a sequence of quantum spaces that appears to  converge to another space, either quantum or classical. In particular, he will try to develop analogs of quantum Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for quantum versions of superstructures beyond vector bundles, such as for connections, Dirac operators, and Yang-Mills actions.

Scientists develop such models in order to understand how to use the flood of data that flows from the laboratories of the experimental scientists. However, human beings and computers can deal only with finite collections of numbers at a time. Thus, in applying these mathematical models, it is almost always necessary to approximate the infinite variability of our world by finite collections of numbers. It is then crucial to understand how valid any given approximation is. With respect to individual calculations, this matter has received extensive study. On the other hand, less study has been made of how complex models as a whole can be approximated well by simpler models as a whole. Relatively little is known about such ""global"" approximations in the case of the models of quantum physics. Since quantum physics is the part of physics that governs chemical and biochemical reactions, the functioning of semiconductors, and many other key technologies, it is of great importance to understand how well complex quantum models can be approximated by simpler models. In the classical realm, the global notion of approximation known as ""Gromov-Hausdorff distance"" is widely used. The principal investigator has developed a quantum analog of Gromov-Hausdorff distance and successfully applied it to a few significant examples. In this project he seeks to strengthen this theory and to apply the strengthened theory to a broader class of examples.

In 1993 the PI, Boshernitzan,  initiated study of Quantitative Recurrence (QR) obtaining a quantitative enhancement of the celebrated Poincare recurrence theorem claiming that typical orbits of dynamical systems (under some mild conditions) return arbitrarily close to their initial position. The quantitative enhancement addresses the question how soon and how close this recurrence takes place. It turns out that the answer to these questions is possible in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the space. In the last two years the PI and his student, Jon Chaika, initiated research that studyies in a  quantitative manner the Connectivity and Proximality phenomena in dynaThe Connectivity property of a dynamical system manifests itself in that, for a typical pair of points in the space, the closures of the orbits of these points coincide. Connectivity is more restrictive than Recurrence. Certain assumptions (like minimality or ergodicity) are imposed for the phenomenon to hold.  The Proximality property manifests itself in that a typical pair of points is proximal, i.e. their orbits approach each other arbitrary close. The phenomenon of Proximality is not universal (but it holds for weakly-mixing systems). Some initial results on Quantitative Connectivity and Proximality (QCP) were obtained recently in joint work by the PI and his student, Chaika, where a number of important related questions were posed. These results generalize and strengthen some classical results in Diophantine analysis (in Number theory) and are related to the recent work of others in the area of ""shrinking targets"" and ""monotone shrinking target property"" of dynamical systems. The results are detailed and complete and of interest when applied to IETs. IETs are invertible piecewise orientation preserving isometries of the unit interval into itself and their study is motivated not only by their intrinsic interest as generalizations of the rotations of the unit circle and the simplest invertible maps which preserve Lebesgue measure, but also by their applications such as to area preserving flows in compact surfaces, and in Teichmuller theory. <br/><br/><br/>The study of QR initiated in 1993 attracted a lot of attention in the national and international mathematical community motivating much further research and development in this and related areas.

Many open problems and various connections with other fields of mathematics (Ergodic Theory, IETs, Teichmuller Theory, area preserving flows in compact surfaces), may keep researchers in the subject busy for years to come.

Free boundary problems of this type appear naturally in many applications, ranging from the theory of elasticity (the Signorini problem, or the thin obstacle problem), mathematical finance (American options), combustion, boundary heat control, and more generally, in problems with boundary phase transitions. An important source of such problems that has emerged recently is the study of free boundary problems governed by nonlocal integro-differential operators, such as the fractional Laplacian. There has been a significant progress in recent years in some problems with lower-dimensional free boundaries. However, there are still a number of fundamental questions that have yet to be addressed and the current project aims to do just that. Particular questions include monotonicity formulas for nonlocal operators, appropriate generalizations of the boundary Harnack principle, and the partial hodograph-Legendre transform, both in stationary and time-dependent situations.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems are problems for partial differential equations that are defined in domains whose boundaries are not known beforehand (i.e., are ""free""). A further quantitative condition must be then provided at the free boundary to prevent indeterminacy. Problems of this sort arise in a large number of areas of applied and industrial interest. The paradigmatic example is the classical Stefan problem, which is to model the melting and solidification of ice: the free boundary here is the moving interface between the regions occupied by the water and the ice. Other important examples occur in filtration through porous media (e.g., an oil field), where free boundaries occur as fronts between saturated and unsaturated regions, and others come from combustion (propagation of the flame front), mathematical finance (optimal time for exercising an option), biology (regions occupied by different species), and so forth. Because of the abundance of applications in various sciences and real world problems, free boundary problems are considered today to be one of the most important directions in the mainstream of the analysis of partial differential equations and offer opportunities for collaboration between mathematicians, physicists, engineers, materials scientists, financial practitioners and other industrial researchers, and biologists."

One interesting feature of these operators is that the so called T1 and Tb theorems, so successful in the classical ""linear growth case,"" can no longer be applied this time, because the corresponding expressions are far from being BMO functions. The new methods that the investigator plans to develop in order to understand them, are related to his recent new approach on Calderón commutators and also to the study of the so called flag paraproducts that he introduced a few years ago.<br/><br/>The present project lies within the realms of classical analysis, but its results and methods have potential applications to other mathematical areas as well, including mathematical physics and partial differential equations.

The basic idea is as follows: take an infinite (and therefore difficult for the human mind to comprehend) mathematical object that one seeks to understand; then approximate this object by similar, yet finite (and therefore theoretically easier for the human mind to comprehend) mathematical objects;  finally, fit all of these approximations together to compose a clear understanding of the infinite mathematical object.  The mathematical objects in this proposal bear the technical name C*-algebras. They were first studied in the context of quantum mechanics but have since realized numerous connections to nearly all areas of mathematics, for example, to dynamical systems and to group theory.

The first project concerns open systems, which are inspired by physical models in which mass or energy is allowed to escape.  The project will study various mechanisms that facilitate or hinder escape in nonuniformly hyperbolic systems and use the relation between entropy and positive Lyapunov exponents to quantify the escape rate.  The second project develops a powerful approach, the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator, to study the statistical properties of particle systems, which are an important class of models from mathematical physics. The third project investigates the behavior of dynamical systems which are comprised of (possibly infinitely many) smaller components linked together, with orbits or energy allowed to pass between components.  When focused on one component at a time, such systems generalize the discussion of open systems in a natural way by allowing both entry and escape. All three projects involve a detailed analysis of the spectral properties of the transfer operator associated with the corresponding closed system without relying on restrictive Markovian assumptions on the dynamics.<br/><br/>Much research in dynamical systems has focused on closed systems in which the dynamics are self-contained.  In many modeling situations, however, it is not possible to obtain such a global view so that it becomes necessary to study local systems that are influenced by other unknown systems, possibly on different scales.  Such considerations motivate the study of the types of systems considered in this project: systems in which mass or energy may enter or exit through deterministic or random mechanisms.  Many of these problems are motivated by models from mathematical physics.  For example, open particle systems are used to model atom traps; extended and linked particle systems are used to create mechanical models of heat conduction in solids and to investigate metastability in molecular processes.  The research will provide analytical tools to solve problems posed and approached formally in the physics literature. The project will both promote and be informed by this interdisciplinary dialogue.  In addition, the project will support undergraduate research in mathematics.  Using the highly visual nature and physical motivation of the problems described, the PI will recruit undergraduate students to work on projects related to these topics during the summers.  Students will disseminate the results of their research at poster sessions and through publication in undergraduate or research journals, as appropriate.  By stimulating interest in research careers in mathematics and creating a peer community supportive of that interest, the project will contribute to the important goal of integrating research and education."

Introduced by O. Schramm in 2000, these processes have been a tool in the solution of several open problems of interest to both mathematicians and theoretical physicists.

From the start, applications to other fields of mathematics and physics have influenced and even dictated the subject's development. Moreover, even though operator algebra theory has broadened considerably over the past thirty years or so, unexpected connections between different areas within the subject regularly arise.

Thus, while classical semi-algebraic geometry is the study of polynomial inequalities, non-commutative semi-algebraic geometry studies polynomial inequalities involving matrices, or non-commuting variables, as unknowns.   While the subject has its own intrinsic mathematical interest, it is also motivated by the fact that non-commutative inequalities arise naturally from in a number of engineering systems problems that are modeled by a signal flow diagram.   Because of the importance of convexity in optimization, of particular interest is the case where the solution, synonymously feasible set, is determined by a linear matrix inequality (LMI) or can be transformed via a non-commutative analytic map or fully matricial function, to a convex set or a set which is governed by an LMI.<br/><br/>Many problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering are modeled using matrices. Unlike for numbers where the order of multiplication does not matter, matrix multiplication is not commutative - the order does matter. The project will develop a theory of non-commutative inequalities; i.e., a theory of inequalities involving matrix unknowns thus providing tools of use to researchers in mathematics, science, and engineering.  Convex problems are especially important because they can be solved efficiently using numerical routines.   A potential outcome of this project is the precise identification of those problems, particularly from systems engineering, which can be analyzed, perhaps after a change of variable, using convexity."

During the period 2001-2010, the principal investigator has developed a series of techniques for studying rigidity in this framework, which is now called deformation/rigidity theory. This led to a large number of striking rigidity results in both the von Neumann algebra and orbit ergodic theory settings, and to the solution of many long-standing problems. The principal investigator's techniques and results naturally entail some exciting new directions of research and problems in all these areas. They also provide new tools for approaching some of the classical   (hitherto ""intractable"") problems in von Neumann algebras, such as: the Connes rigidity conjecture; the structure and classification of free group factors; superrigidity properties of algebras arising from groups and their actions. In this project the principal investigator, with his students and collaborators, will systematically investigate these directions. He intends to deepen his interaction with the areas of group theory, ergodic theory, and descriptive set theory, using operator algebra techniques. This activity should lead to further surprising results and solutions to problems in all these areas. The principal investigator expects the framework of factors to continue to play a crucial role in this interplay between diverse areas of mathematics. <br/><br/>""Rigidity"" in mathematics occurs when objects in a certain class (functions, function algebras, etc.) can be recognized without having very much initial information about them. Results of this type are usually interdisciplinary and can be relevant to many areas of mathematics. They can also have interesting applications to computer science, complexity theory, design of computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes. The principal investigator's work in recent years has focused on the study of rigidity in the class of objects known as von Neumann algebras. These are algebras of infinite matrices, wherein the outcome of the multiplication of two elements A and B may be different depending on the order in the product (i.e., AB may be different from BA). Theses algebras where introduced by von Neumann in the 1920s in his effort to provide a rigorous approach to quantum mechanics in particle physics. He related the algebras, at the outset, with such areas of mathematics as group theory and ergodic theory by noticing that actions of groups on so-called probability measure spaces give rise to a remarkable class of von Neumann algebras. Rigidity in this context occurs when the group action can be recognized by merely knowing the associated von Neumann algebra. The principal investigator has recently developed a completely new set of techniques for studying such phenomena, creating a framework that is now called deformation/rigidity theory. He has obtained a number of surprising and intrinsically beautiful results that create a bridge from von Neumann algebras to rigidity in other areas of mathematics and lead to deep interdisciplinary activity. The problems that the principal investigator intends to work on over the next three years are increasingly ambitious, having to do with famous unsolved problems about the classification of factors arising from ""rigid groups"" and ""free groups."" The projects are important to both von Neumann algebra theory and to the adjacent mathematical areas of group theory, ergodic theory, logic (descriptive set theory), free probability, and subfactor theory. The proposal should further contribute to the cross-pollination of these areas and to substantial progress in each of them. The principal investigator's work in rigidity theory has already had considerable impact in many areas, with a large number of research articles and Ph.D. theses sprouting directly from it. He expects his techniques to have an even broader impact in the future, leading to new developments and solutions to problems in a variety of subjects. He also expects this research to have direct and indirect impact in applied mathematics and in the aforementioned areas of computer science."

Particular problems that will be investigated in this project include the failure of von Neumann's inequality in several variables, function-theoretic aspects of analytic functions realized as transfer functions generated by operator tuples, and the analysis of functions of positive real part in terms of ""noncommutative spectral measures,"" that is, positive functionals on operator systems. A unifying theme will be the theory of composition operators in several variables, especially compactness questions.<br/><br/>The project belongs to the branch of mathematics known as Operator Theory.

The proposed optimal allocation problem is the prototype for a class of problems (e.g. optimal storage problem) arising in mathematical economics. It aims at finding an optimal allocation plan as well as an associated optimal allocation path to minimize overall cost of transporting commodity from factories to households. Also, the proposed dynamic model for mud cracking not only increases our understanding about mud cracking but also may be useful in predicting the position of future cracking of a similar material (e.g. a prediction of an earth quake), and hence provide increased public safety.

The quintessential examples of sub-Riemannian settings are the so-called Carnot groups, whose fundamental role in analysis was first highlighted by E. M. Stein. They now occupy a central position not only in the study of hypoelliptic partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, and geometric function theory, but also in the applied sciences such as mathematical finance, mechanical engineering, and the neurophysiology of the brain. The most distinctive feature of sub-Riemannian spaces is that the metric structure can be viewed as a constrained geometry, where motion is possible only along a prescribed set of directions, changing from point to point.  The principal investigator has a long-term project aimed at investigating geometric and analytic properties of these structures. More specifically, she proposes to continue her study of the Bernstein problem and of the regularity of minimal surfaces in Carnot groups, to investigate subelliptic boundary value problems, and to develop a regularity theory for fully nonlinear equations of Monge-Ampere type.  Another area of interest in this project is the investigation of elliptic and parabolic free boundary problems that arise naturally in the theory of flame propagation. The principal investigator also intends to study a class of minimization problems in which the relevant functional is modeled after the one introduced by Alt and Caffarelli. In addition, she is interested in exploring variational inequalities of elliptic and parabolic type with obstacles confined to lie in lower dimensional manifolds. One of the main objectives of the proposed research is to prove regularity properties of the free boundary. The necessary tools from harmonic analysis and the theory of partial differential equations for the study of such problems will be developed concurrently. Finally, motivated by the striking analogy between the theories of minimal surfaces and of free boundaries in the Euclidean setting, the principal investigator plans to merge her different lines of research into a yet quite unexplored area, namely, the study of free boundary problems (both of obstacle and Alt-Caffarelli type) in Carnot groups. <br/><br/>The principal investigator has a research program that lies at the interface of the areas of mathematics known as the calculus of variations, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory. The focus is on the study of analytic and geometric properties of solutions to so-called variational inequalities and partial differential equations involving a system of ""noncommuting"" vector fields. The proposed problems not only turn up in a variety of mathematical contexts (e.g., optimal control theory, mathematical finance, and geometry) but are also of interest in other fields such as mechanical engineering, robotics, and neurophysiology. A second focus of the project concerns free boundary problems, which surface in physics and engineering in situations where a conserved quantity or relation changes discontinuously across some value of the variables under consideration. The free boundary appears, for instance, as the interface between a fluid and the air, or between water and ice.  One of the proposed projects aims at studying regularity properties of the free boundary in burnt-unburnt mixtures. The results of this investigation will lead to a better understanding of the models, to the improvement of simulation methods, and ultimately to a precise description of how flames propagate in nonhomogeneous media.  As mentioned earlier, several parts of this project find their motivation in the applied sciences. On the other hand, their solutions involve an interplay of ideas from different areas of analysis and geometry. It is conceivable that all these different fields will benefit from this synergy. The principal investigator is committed to the training of future generations of mathematicians and to increasing the representation of women in the scientific community via the organization of a variety of educational and mentoring activities for untenured faculty and graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students."

The main objective is the identification of the second order term of the ground state energies and the free energies of these systems. The quantum systems considered in this project include trapped systems in the Gross-Pitaevskii limit or extended systems in the thermo-dynamical limits. Furthermore, we also propose to remove the prevailing assumptions on the positivity of the interaction potentials. A related problem on the ground state energy of charged bose systems with Coulomb interactions will also be considered. The second project, Eigen-states, Eigenvalues of Random Matrices, concerns the eigenvalue gap distributions and the localization-delocalization transition of eigen-states. We focus on the band matrix ensemble, the generalized Wigner ensemble, the Wishart ensemble and the symplectic ensemble. The goal is to prove the universality of the local eigenvalue statistics of these ensembles and the localization-delocalization transition of eigen-states of band matrices.<br/><br/><br/>This first project of this proposal is aimed to develop new mathematical tools for dealing with complex problems in many-body quantum systems. New mathematical methods lead to different points of view and can thus increase the understanding of physical systems. The second project aims to establish the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems. The mathematical model for these systems in the simplest form is given by matrices with random entries. Our project is designed to provide rigorous proof that conduction does occur in the random matrix models."

In the first part, the theory of Hardy fields is used to describe good sequences of measurements. Based on two decades of previous work, it has become clear that a complete characterization of good sequences in terms of Hardy fields will be  possible - quite a surprising development in almost everywhere questions. The second part deals with multiple ergodic averages.  It is suggested that  complete characterizations of good sequences for mean convergence and recurrence are possible in terms of Hardy fields. Random modeling of sequences is also investigated.<br/><br/><br/>The mathematical impact of the work on almost everywhere convergence is on Fourier analysis and number theory. The Fourier analysis connection is related to the work of Magyar, Stein, Wainger and others. The number theory connection is with bases of the integers. The mathematical impact of the work on multiple averages is in additive combinatorics: problems related to Szemerédi's theorem. Each of these mathematical connections have been established previously by the PI. As with most theoretical mathematical work, it is difficult to predict the impact on other sciences and other activities of humanity.  But quite pleasingly, the proposer has already found some connections in physics and computer (hardware) security. His collaborations in the foundation of thermodynamics and in hardware security have come about because of work on subsequence ergodic questions. It is also important to note that the connection between the project's activitiy and other parts mathematics has led to some important educational insights into how to teach and view some basic mathematical theories."

Anosov systems constitute the paradigm of chaotic dynamics and have been intensively studied since the late sixties. Still, some questions are wide open, most importantly, the question of classification of Anosov diffeomorphisms. There are three major directions in the proposed program. 1. Smooth classification of Anosov systems. This will continue the research program started in the PI's recent work and aims at gaining fundamental understanding of the structure of the space of higher dimensional Anosov systems. 2. Study of the global topology of the space of Anosov diffeomorphisms and the Teichmuller space of smooth conjugacy classes. 3. Anosov diffeomorphisms on simply connected four dimensional manifolds. Dimension four is the least dimension where the classification problem is open. It is expected that simply connected 4-manifolds do not support Anosov diffeomorphisms.<br/><br/>The project lies in the area of hyperbolic dynamics and aims at a fine understanding of hyperbolic dynamical systems. A dynamical system is called hyperbolic if the ambient space exhibits a lot of stretching in one direction and contraction in another direction. The behavior one observes in hyperbolic systems is usually referred to as deterministic chaos. One of the first appearances of such systems was in the work of Cartwright and Littlewood who studied certain differential equations of second order with periodic forcing. This work arose from war-related studies involving radio waves. Since then hyperbolic dynamics has been an important tool in natural sciences. The results of the proposed research will be disseminated through seminar and conference talks, online preprint servers as well as journal publications. Also, the PI plans to deliver expository talks in his area with the purpose of introducing undergraduate and graduate students to the exciting area of hyperbolic dynamics."
