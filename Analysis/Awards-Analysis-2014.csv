Such functions can be used to encode information about simple physical systems that accept input data and release output data, such as signal processors. They are also closely related to problems in robust control theory; here, the driving question is how to design systems that perform desired tasks while maintaining internal stability. The project's motivation is this: classic results by mathematicians such as Beurling and Herglotz show that nice functions of one variable can be represented using different and enlightening formulas. Different formulas are useful in different situations, and the collection serves as a robust toolbox for studying properties of complex functions and related objects. Recent results show that several essential one-variable formulas have two-variable analogues. The goals of this project include extending these known results, developing new formulas for functions of several variables, and investigating applications. While pursing this research, the principal investigator will continue to mentor students interested in science and mathematics through her teaching and outreach activities.<br/><br/>The specific focus of this project is the study of holomorphic functions on the polydisc and multivariate analogues of classic representation formulas for such functions. The formulas of interest include transfer function realizations for Schur-Agler functions and weak factorizations of Hardy spaces. Specific topics of interest include canonical constructions, generalizations to other function spaces and domains, and applications. The study of transfer function realizations is closely related to both reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and the ""state space"" methods of systems engineering. The proposed generalizations and refinements will use properties of related Hilbert spaces of functions and techniques that arise in the context of multidimensional input/state/output systems and scattering systems. The construction and study of weak Hardy space factorizations will require tools from multiparameter harmonic analysis, including atomic decompositions of product Hardy spaces and technical geometric results.  Many properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces can also be described with functions called generalized Bergman metrics. Within this context, the principal investigator plans a further study of functions on polydiscs, with an emphasis on boundary behavior. Such questions have applications to Cowen-Douglas operators, and the techniques suggest a method of generalizing results on polydiscs to classes of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces."

This project concerns convergence of Fourier series along `thin' sub-sequences of partial sums, as motivated by a conjecture of Konyagin; extensions of classical and non-classical estimates related to Fourier series to weighted settings, with motivations coming from work of  Germain-Masmoudi-Shatah in partial differential equations; a new approach to Plancherel-Rotach asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials with rough varying weights, motivated by applications in spectral study of unitary random matrices and by applications in other non-commutative examples of the Fourier transform; and sharp estimates for lower-order terms in long-time asymptotics of Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur integrable equations, with additional motivations coming from studies of perturbation of integrable equations.<br/>    <br/>This mathematics research project is in the area of harmonic analysis, in which data  is analyzed by breaking  it into more manageable components. An important tool is the Fourier transform, which provides methods to decompose complicated signals into basic waves. These decompositions and related techniques have a number of useful applications in engineering and other applied sciences. For example, in image processing, harmonic analysis is useful in de-noising images and analyzing image structures. More generally, harmonic analysis could be used in signal processing to compress and decompress data, allowing for very large amounts of information to be effectively transmitted with manageable errors.  Other variants of the Fourier transform also appear in statistics and mathematical physics. One such variant occurs in the study of energy levels of random physical systems. This research project seeks to improve the understanding of the above studies by investigating fundamental properties of the new variants of the Fourier transform."

Problems both in smooth and fractal geometry, as well as questions arising in partial differential equations, fit under this umbrella. Along these lines, one of the projects the principal investigator studies concerns an energy minimization problem, where noise is taken into account. This provides a more realistic model for natural phenomena. The behavior one expects to verify is that, up to first order approximation, energy minimizers in the noisy setting behave exactly the same way as those in the noise-free environment.  <br/><br/>This project illustrates the idea that mathematical objects that can be well approximated by more regular ones inherit some of their regularity properties. Several applications of this principle are presented. Four main question are addressed in the project. The first concerns the regularity of almost minimizers associated with free-boundary variational problems involving Holder continuous Riemannian metrics, and the aim of studying th question is to understand the structure of the corresponding free boundary. New results concerning the free-boundary regularity for the minimizing problems with free boundary that were studied earlier by Alt-Caffarelli and Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman are expected. In this case the ""good approximating objects"" are solutions to the Laplacian in the corresponding Riemannian metric. The second question deals with the regularity of measures that are well approximated by flat measures (i.e., constant multiples of Lebesgue measure on planes) in the Wasserstein distance. Two distinct types of problems are considered, one geometric in nature, another that ties in very closely to the theory of weights in harmonic analysis. The third question concerns the existence of good parameterizations for two different types of subsets of Euclidean space. The fourth question ties in with an important branch of the principal investigator's research, namely, the regularity of elliptic measures associated with divergence-form elliptic operators on nonsmooth domains. The cross-pollination between harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory is one of the pillars of the proposed research."

In situations where even an ""almost"" local-global statement seems out of reach of current technology, the PI will develop new exponential sum bounds to improve the number of R-almost primes which can be produced from an Affine Sieve.

For example, physical phenomena can often be modeled with differential equations, and certain of these equations are best understood using techniques issuing from the study of complex numbers. Another example is provided by string theory in theoretical physics. Aspects of this model of high energy physics require a deep understanding of the geometry of complex numbers. This project is focussed on the geometry of spaces where complex and real variables interact.  The spaces studied with this geometry have a certain complexity that is not yet well understood but is of great interest in the mathematical community.  The PI will study this complexity and work towards building proper foundations for the field.<br/><br/>The PI will study the CR complexity of holomorphic mappings and real submanifolds or real singular subvarieties.  The key method is to study the Hermitian matrix of coefficients of the defining equations.  This approach links the complexity of a real submanifold to a CR mapping to a hyperquadric, that is a hypersurface defined by a Hermitian form.  Hyperquadrics are the model submanifolds in CR geometry.  The greater the complexity of a submanifold, the greater the dimension that the target hyperquadric must live in, and the greater the complexity of the CR mapping involved. In particular the PI is interested in further refining the results on the singular set of Levi-flat hypersurfaces, that is sets which have in some sense the smallest CR complexity.  The proposed method is to refine the Segre variety approach that was successfully used in the PI's previous work on the subject.  To study the complexity of the set of the mappings involved, it is necessary to also understand the complexity of mappings between hyperquadrics themselves.  The PI will work to refine the quantitative results in previous work by applying a mix of techniques from commutative algebra and analysis that has proved successful before.  This work will then be applied to more general domains."

The major goal of the project is the development of new techniques to achieve breakthroughs in our understanding of fluid dynamics phenomena. The project research will address fundamental properties of the classical equations of fluid dynamics, qualitative properties of solutions, and modeling applications. The project focuses on three main directions. The first set of problems concerns global regularity vs finite time blow up that will be investigated for a range of fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. Axi-symmetric solutions for 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes will be considered, new potentially singular scenarios will be studied and new regularity criteria will be sought. Active scalars, such as surface quasi-geostrophic equation coming from atmospheric science, will also be analyzed -- here the effort will concentrate on studying properties of solutions, search for new Lyapunov functionals and novel regularity estimates. In the second direction, we will seek more detailed information on long time dynamics. This will include research on some long-open conjectures for 2D Euler equation, including possible mechanisms of inverse energy cascade, mixing and small scales formation. We will also work on passive scalar models and mixing properties of flows in this context. Biomixing by chemotaxis will be investigated as well, with an eye towards applications in ecology and marine biology. The third direction focuses on complex fluid models. In many applications - for instance, in studies of particle suspensions or solutions - the microscopic structure of   particles in the fluid becomes important. The shape and interactions between the particles can be taken into account by adding kinetic equations to the fluid dynamics systems and introducing physically natural couplings. Analysis of solutions to such systems, their regularity and qualitative properties will be a part of the project work.<br/><br/>Fluids are ubiquitous in nature, science and engineering. Diverse phenomena involving fluids appear in atmospheric and ocean science, astrophysics, chemistry and biology, and are described by partial differential equations of fluid mechanics. These equations are some of  <br/>the most difficult partial differential equations to analyze. They   describe a wide range of complex phenomena, are nonlinear, and usually   nonlocal. Due to their complexity, even the classical equations such   as 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes are far from well understood. The   proposed research lies at the interface of several central areas of mathematics - partial differential equations, dynamical systems, functional analysis and Fourier analysis. This FRG project   brings together several researchers that have been at the forefront of recent developments in mathematical fluid mechanics. Different   participants bring different strengths to the project. It is expected that intensive collaboration within FRG framework will lead to   development of new ideas and approaches and result in a burst of activity in mathematics of fluids. New techniques and tools developed   are likely to have an impact in neighboring areas of mathematics,  biology, and atmospheric science. An important part of the FRG   activity will be training of junior researchers.  Mathematics of fluid  mechanics covers a broad range of effective techniques, which are   applicable beyond fluids. The training activities will include a   summer school, two workshops, group meetings, course development,   research seminars and research projects for advanced undergraduate   students. The principal investigators will advertise all training   activities broadly, and strive to recruit talented, motivated, and   diverse trainees. Special attention will be paid to recruitment of   groups under represented in mathematics."

The PI will use rigorous analytical tools to tackle the problems. Through involving graduate students and post doctors, the project will provide a training ground for a younger generation of researchers. <br/><br/><br/> The mathematical problem of water waves concerns the motion of the interface separating an inviscid, incompressible, irrotational fluid, under the influence of  gravity, from a region of zero density in two and three space dimensions, neglecting surface tension. In prior funding periods, the PI showed that the Taylor sign condition always holds, and obtained the local well-posedness of the two and three dimensional water wave problems for arbitrary (smooth) data. And the PI showed that the nature of the nonlinearity of the  water wave problems are of cubic or higher orders, and obtained the almost global well-posedness for the two dimensional and global well-posedness for the three dimensional water wave problems for small and smooth initial data.  Furthermore,  to understand singular behaviors in the water wave motion, the PI constructed a class of self-similar solutions for the two dimensional water wave equation in the regime where convection is in dominance. The PI proposes to continue her study of singularities as well as the long time behaviors of the water wave motion. Particular problems include the stability of the self-similar solution she constructed  and the long time evolution for a broader class of initial data. <br/>The objective is to achieve good understanding of a basic type of waves--waves with angled crests, and its role in the long time water wave motion, and to obtain better understanding of dispersion and the structure of the water wave equations."

There are, however, certain interesting mathematical contexts in which the notion of instantaneous speed cannot be taken for granted. That notion needs to be developed in an intrinsic fashion as to retain the natural properties and interpretations we are used to. Some of those properties can be expressed in the form of the so-called Sobolev or variational inequalities which relate position and speed at different scales. The pursue of natural notions of instantaneous speed in various mathematical contexts, as well as their variational inequalities and applications, stands as an increasingly active and exciting area of research in Analysis.<br/><br/>Geometric and measure-theoretic objects can be associated to convex functions. The interplay between properties of these objects models the behavior of solutions to certain elliptic and parabolic PDEs as well as quasi-conformality of mappings with convex potentials, geometric features of some quasi-metric spaces, associated potential theory, etc. The research activities supported by this grant aim at developing such topics by means of a first-order calculus based on variational inequalities for the Monge-Ampere quasi-metric structure."

These equations arise naturally from geometry, fluid dynamics, physics, chemistry, and biology. One is about the global stability of solutions with reasonable datum to the three dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The Navier-Stokes system of equations is the guiding system for the dynamics of the incompressible flows. This global stability problem is closely related to the `millennium' open question of whether the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations can develop a finite time singularity from reasonable initial data. Many physical phenomena are heavily involved with fluid flows. The understanding of the incompressible fluid flows is certainly the first and the fundamental step. The other is the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev type which arises in geometric analysis, functional analysis, and in quantum physical problems.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to work on fluid flows which are axisymmetric and to derive certain asymptotic estimate of the solutions. This is a possible way to show that for an axisymmetric smooth initial data with compact support the corresponding solution is globally well-posed (and thus develops no singularity). This project also explores other ways of studying the local and global structures of axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations as well as the full Navier-Stokes equations and seek applications in related research fields. For the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev type systems, classification of solutions leads to discoveries of new structures of well-known nonlinear partial differential and integral equations arising from the mathematical and physical sciences. Liouville type theorems, with the Lane-Emden conjecture as a special case, are widely used for establishing various forms of a priori estimates for solutions. This is the core of nonlinear analysis of differential and integral equations or systems. The essential uniqueness are closely related to certain physical bound states and their quantization. Deriving new and intrinsic estimates point-wise or in integral forms, and getting asymptotic estimates of some key integral play central rules in this project. On both problems, the PI emphasizes on finding new and intrinsic connections of seemingly independent phenomena and on providing some new angles to the problems. The proposed research projects also actively involve graduate students and young mathematicians. And it provides a solid training for them in mathematical analysis, physical modeling and numerical simulation. The ongoing informal seminar `analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations' that meets weekly to train the graduate students and junior faculty members is also an important part of the project."

These equations express well-known physical laws in the context of fluids and describe how quantities characterizing the flow, such as the velocity and the pressure will change in time and space.  It turns out the equations are difficult to solve, even with the help of large computers.  One reason for the difficulties comes from the highly non-trivial behavior exhibited by the solutions, which includes the emergence of complicated small-scale structures and fast oscillations in time.  This is a result of the non-linearity in the equations,  which can transfer energy between various scales. The fluid motion can be complicated, but the practical questions are in some sense simple: will a tornado form? At which speed will a plane stall? Open theoretical questions about the equations can also be formulated in a relatively simple language: do the equations give a self-consistent description of the fluid evolution, in the sense that they can uniquely predict the future state of the fluid based on a known current state?  This is one of the well-known open mathematical problems  surrounding the equations, closely related to the possible development of singularities in the solutions. Our mathematical understanding of the equations is currently incomplete. The research at both theoretical and practical aspects of the equation has ultimately the same goal: to find some relatively simple set of parameters which control the solutions. One hopes that by identifying the right quantities, one will be able to give a good description of the flow and sufficiently characterize its important features. The main effort of this research project is aimed at several open mathematical problems surrounding these issues.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the proposed topics include:<br/>1. Well-posedness, ill-posedness and uniqueness for the Navier-Stokes equation and related equations, questions such as: Is the Navier-Stokes equation well-posed in the natural energy space? Based on recent work concerning scale-invariant solutions, the PI expects that the answer to this questions is negative, but significant work is still needed to confirm this. (The question is also related to the open problem of uniqueness of the Leray-Hopf weak solutions with initial date of finite energy, but not necessarily smooth.) The proposed methods should also work for the surface quasi-geostrophic equation, where similar questions are open. The Euler equation also presents a number of open problem concerning well-posedness and stability, some of which will be addressed. Many issues are not clear even at the linearized level. These are in some sense more subtle than in the Navier-Stokes case (due to the strong role of continuous spectra), but should provide valuable insights into low-viscosity flows.<br/>2. Singularities and possible non-uniqueness for the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. This equation has the same energy estimates and the same scaling symmetry as the Navier-Stokes equation. There is strong evidence that solution can develop singularities even when starting from smooth initial conditions. One can develop a theory of global weak solutions, but it remains open whether these uniquely predict the behavior of the system. The question of uniqueness is important for assessing the predictive power of the equation.<br/>3. Long-time behavior of solutions for the 2d Euler equation and PDE problems associated with models used in that connection. The long-time behavior of 2d flows (relevant for example for modelling of meteorological phenomena and making predictions concerning climate) exhibits some striking features whose mathematical understanding remains incomplete. There are strong connections to Statistical Mechanics and other infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian PDEs. The research will address some of the open PDE problems arising in this context, such as the properties of invariant measures in flows with stochastic forcing and properties of steady-states arising from statistical theories. Other Hamiltonian PDEs which can serve as good models for these questions will also be studied."

Similar shapes can be observed in various real-life situations, as the models aim to describe natural phenomena. Whereas self-similar sets such as snowflakes  look exactly the same at different scales, the random sets the PI studies look only roughly the same at different scales, with their appearance being described by some probabilistic law. While these sets are easy to observe and not hard to simulate, they are difficult to treat mathematically. The last decade has seen dramatic progress in the understanding of such random shapes, but many fundamental questions are still open. The PI's work aims towards resolutions of some of these questions, and tries to provide tools to investigate the shapes of random sets.<br/><br/><br/>The aforementioned progress is largely based on conformal invariance properties of the scaling limits, connecting it to the Schramm-Loewner evolution SLE. For instance, by work of Smirnov and others, interfaces of the Ising model at criticality are forms of SLE(3), and the scaling limit of the collection of outer loops is the Conformal Loop Ensemble CLE(3). The PI investigates conformal representations of CLE's using tools from circles packings, aiming at an analog of Bonk's uniformization theorem for(deterministic) Sierpinski carpets. The PI also studies conformal representations of planar graphs using uniformizations of flat surfaces with cone singularities, as well as their representations as Shabat polynomials or Belyi functions. A main goal is to establish the existence of a distributional limit of the conformally natural embedding of random trees as the number of edges tends to infinity. A key tool is the conformal welding of laminations of the disc."

Mathematical fractals are sets and measures which exhibit intricate and complicated structure at infinitely many scales - often with some form of self-similarity, and whose ""dimension,"" appropriately defined, can be any number, not just an integer.  They are widely used in mathematics, physical sciences, and engineering to model random and deterministic objects of complex nature.  The mathematics of fractals uses geometric measure theory, dynamical systems theory, and other fields with the goal of understanding their fine structure in a rigorous way.  Ergodic theory is a branch of dynamical systems theory which studies measure-preserving transformations.  Such transformations can be visualized, for example, as the process of kneading dough, or mixing an incompressible fluid. It is closely related to many other fields, among them statistical physics, probability, number theory, and combinatorics. In this project, the PI will investigate, in particular, the fractal characteristics of certain classes of dynamical systems that are of great current interest. <br/><br/>This award supports the PI's research on self-similar sets and measures and their non-linear analogs, especially in cases of strong overlaps.  These include infinite Bernoulli convolutions, which have been studied for almost eighty years, random continued fractions, and Furstenberg stationary measures. The investigator intends to build on the recent progress by M. Hochman and P. Shmerkin and apply the techniques and methods of additive combinatorics and Fourier analysis in order to obtain sharp results on dimension, absolute continuity, and properties of the density.  Another research direction is concerned with spectral properties of substitution dynamical systems and suspension flows over them, with an emphasis on systems with continuous or mixed spectrum. The PI will study when the spectral measures are purely singular, and investigate their quantitative properties, in particular, dimensions and Hoelder exponents. Recent collaboration with A. Bufetov revealed unexpected connections of these problems with the theory of Bernoulli convolutions.  An important goal of this project is to extend the spectral study of substitutions to other systems of current interest, in particular, to interval exchange transformations and translation flows on surfaces of genus greater than one."

For example, the derivative of position is velocity, and in economics, the code word for derivative is marginal. The derivative is a foundational concept in mathematics and the basis for much of the application of mathematics to physics and the other sciences, economics, and statistics. In applications, equations often contain functions and their derivatives. Such equations are called differential equations, and they describe the world: Newton's Laws of Motion, Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic radiation, Schrodinger's equations in quantum mechanics are all examples of differential equations. The derivative has a straight forward generalization to complex valued functions, and it is called the complex derivative in this situation. In order for the complex derivative of a complex valued function to exist, however, the function must satisfy a particular differential equation. In other words, complex differentiable functions have extra structure, and this extra structure provides far-reaching applications to a wide variety of subjects, including every areas of mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, and economics.  This proposal investigates complex differentiable functions of several variables. Adding in additional variables creates significant new challenges, but the applications to mathematics and science are numerous and varied, and, as the PI believes, profound.<br/><br/><br/>In several complex variables, understanding the dbar-Neumann and Kohn Laplacians is a major driver of research questions. The PI and his collaborators will examine questions in the both the pseudoconvex and nonpseudoconvex categories. Together with Phillip Harrington of the University of Arkansas, the PI will prove existence and regularity results for the dbar-Neumann and complex Green operators on nonpseudoconvex and/or unbounded domains.  These questions are beyond the scope and tools in the bounded pseudoconvex case for technical reasons, and the PI will develop new approaches to tackle these questions. In the pseudoconvex case, solvability is well-understood, and the questions instead focus on the relationship between the type of the boundary and the regularity of solutions. In the finite type case, the PI and Albert Boggess of the University of Arizona have an ongoing collaboration to establish pointwise estimates for the complex heat kernel on quadric submanifolds. There are few examples which are accessible to direct computation, and quadric submanifolds provide a large such class, including examples of higher codimension, all of which have a formulas that can be exploited. Quadric submanifolds have a very regular curvature structure, and the PI is also interested in the regularity of solutions to the (tangential) Cauchy-Riemann equations in the exponentially flat case. He has an ongoing collaboration with Khanh Tran of the National University of Singapore to establish L^p and Holder bounds for the Bergman and Szego kernels as well as the dbar-Neumann and complex Green operators."

The development of mathematical tools to understand important issues such as existence and uniqueness of solutions, as well the behavior of the corresponding evolutions on a qualitative and quantitative level, is therefore an issue of fundamental scientific importance.  As a particular example, several of the questions to be investigated in this research involve studying long-time properties of solutions to the nonlinear Schrodinger and nonlinear wave equations evolving from ""generic"" randomly chosen initial data.  In addition to being of substantial mathematical interest, investigation into these questions addresses the broader scientific issue of whether possible singularities arising in the mathematical formulation can occur in physically relevant settings.  Moreover, the topics to be studied are closely connected to a wide range of issues in partial differential equations, probability, and harmonic analysis, and the ideas and techniques developed will provide important contributions to the availability of mathematical tools for future research on related questions.<br/><br/>The particular scope of this research project is to investigate several problems concerning local and global well-posedness properties for nonlinear dispersive and wave equations, focusing on the nonlinear Schrodinger, nonlinear wave, and Korteweg-de Vries equations.  The research encompasses four broad directions, which are often interrelated, and which each contribute to the wider theme of understanding the precise dynamical behavior of solutions both locally and globally in time.  The first two directions of interest concern global in time existence of solutions, in particular focusing first on the development of global well-posedness results adapted to the energy-supercritical setting, and second on important issues surrounding probabilistic global well-posedness results in endpoint and limiting situations (in this probabilistic framework, initial data for the problem is chosen as a random Fourier series, and results are obtained by excluding sets occurring with small probability).  The third direction of interest turns to the study of local in time stability properties of solutions, focusing in particular on initial data of low-regularity.  The fourth direction of study investigates dispersive models with higher-order nonlocal terms, in which a key ingredient will be the adaptation of recent developments in the study of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations with similar nonlocal features.  In each of these settings, the PI and collaborators will incorporate techniques from harmonic analysis, probability, and spectral theory to analyze the dynamical features involved in the evolution."

Certain important structures in physics arise from an integration of complex analysis with partial differential equations. Partial differential equations and several complex variables are also used in String and Twister mathematical physical theories that try to unify different physical force fields. For all these applications, foundational questions concerning the solution of such partial differential equations under certain geometric constraints are still not fully understood and they form some of the most challenging problems in mathematics. The current study is not only important for the development in mathematics, but it may lead to new understanding of physical phenomena with potential applications in other sciences and technology. <br/><br/>This research will focus on some of the most important equations in several complex variables, including the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the induced tangential Cauchy- Riemann equations.

Understanding the geometric aspects of these equations under the curvature conditions and their relations with function theory in complex manifolds is one of the most challenging and important problems in complex analysis and geometry. New approaches have been introduced to study these problems which connect the topology of domains in complex manifolds with the topology of Dolbeault cohomology groups. Regularity of the solutions to the Cauchy-Riemann equations are related to the foliation theory on the boundary. The study of several complex variables in a geometric setting has provided interesting new questions with fresh insight to problems in topology, foliation theory, complex dynamics, algebraic and complex geometry. The solution of these questions will advance our knowledge in all the aforementioned areas. Complex geometric theory has only just begun to develop and more efforts will be directed in this direction. Geometric measure theory and harmonic analysis will also be applied to study several com- plex variables on non-smooth domains.

Many global properties of a dynamical system with sufficiently strong hyperbolic behavior can be deduced from studying the linearized approximation system along its orbits. The study of this phenomena originated in seminal works of Smale, Anosov and Sinai. Such systems possess a high level of unpredictability and exhibit strong chaotic behavior. In the proposal the PI considers the weakest (hence, most general) form of hyperbolicity known as non-uniform hyperbolicity.

The goal of the proposed research is to develop a set of analytic tools for the subject and to construct some natural invariant measures with rich statistical properties. <br/><br/>There are several main topics in the proposal: 1) Thermodynamic formalism for non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems -- that is to establish existence and uniqueness of equilibrium measures and study phase transitions for systems with nonzero Lyapunov exponents; 2) Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measures for non-uniformly hyperbolic systems -  that is to construct ""physically natural"" classes of invariant measures for dissipative systems with nonzero Lyapunov exponents; 3) Gibbs and equilibrium measures for non-uniformly hyperbolic systems constructed via a new approach that does not rely on symbolic representation of the system; 4) Essential coexistence of hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic behavior -- that is to complement the famous Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory by constructing particular examples of systems with coexistence of areas with nonzero Lyapunov exponents and areas with zero topological entropy."

This research aims to investigate rigidity of these systems, a phenomenon characterized by the scarcity of invariant objects under the action. The main goal is to shed light on how higher-rank, hyperbolicity and irreducibility, the three typical conditions required in order for an action to enjoy rigidity, balance among themselves and quantitatively a ffect rigidity properties.<br/><br/>The field of dynamical system studies long-term trajectories of points evolving over time according to certain given rules.

The proposed research will focus on dynamical systems of arithmetic nature. In other words, the rules of evolution can be characterized by a set of integers and rational numbers. By studying dynamical behaviors of such systems, one expects to discover number-theoretical properties. This work also seeks to strengthen the connections between ergodic theory, number theory, Lie groups, Fourier analysis and additive combinatorics by combining methods from these mathematical branches.

They are fundamental objects for much of modern mathematics and its applications to the other sciences, where they model physical space as well as many important data sets.  The principal investigator is planning to study properties of higher dimensional manifolds. Here ""higher dimensional"" means that at least five variables are needed to parametrize the manifold (think of a data set depending on five or more variables). The extra flexibility inherent in a larger number of variables means that many more tools can be brought to bear on problems. The geometry of the expanding networks that are important in communications theory and the theory of dynamical systems (i.e.,change under symmetries of a system) are particularly important tools for the project. Throughout the period of the project the principal investigator intends to mentor young scientists through their involvement in the research, and to continue to work on structural improvements to mathematical education and research in Hawaii.<br/><br/>One of the most important invariants of a manifold is its fundamental group, which governs the way loops can be formed inside the manifold. Associated to fundamental groups are algebraic group rings and analytic group operator algebras. The theory of linear algebra over group rings and group operator algebras is organized by their K-theory, and  understanding the associated K-groups is a difficult problem that is fundamental to the understanding of higher dimensional manifolds via such problems as the Novikov and Borel conjectures in topological classification and the Gromov-Lawson conjecture in differential geometry. The Baum-Connes and Farrell-Jones conjectures postulate techniques for computing K-theory and anchor the current approach to the problems in manifold theory mentioned earlier. The principal investigator intends to use techniques from index theory of elliptic differential operators, operator algebras, topological dynamical systems, metric geometry of expanding networks, and representation theory to study these conjectures and related issues."

At the forefront of modern technology, matter structured at the nanometer and atomic levels increasingly reveals its wavelike nature. In recent years, cutting-edge experiments with ultracold atoms, pushing the limits of fundamental physics, have created new states of matter and offered the possibility of controlling quantum entanglement, with major potential applications in cryptography and in quantum computing. The electronic waves confined in quantum wells have yielded high-efficiency, light-emitting diodes that are about to revolutionize the energetics of lighting. At these scales, even the slightest disorder or irregularity can trigger one of the most puzzling and poorly understood phenomena, wave localization. Its dramatic impact has been observed and confirmed by experiments. At the same time, it has been acknowledged that at the present time the design of the most promising light sources (and, more generally, the investigation and exploitation of wave localization) rests on ill-defined concepts, for we still lack the tools necessary to relate disorder to the wave properties in an accurate manner. The present project offers a new approach to wave localization. Its main objective is to combine state-of-the-art techniques and results from harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory with achievements of atomic physics so as to enable one to predict (and then manipulate) localization properties of mechanical, electromagnetic, and matter waves in precise and quantifiable mathematical terms. The project addresses mathematical problems involving the eigenfunctions and behavior of solutions to irregular partial differential equations seamlessly integrated with the latest research in systems of cold atoms, and ultimately aims to give to scientists and engineers a unique opportunity to produce desired wave localization properties on demand, at predetermined frequencies and at specific locations, and at the submillimeter or even atomic scales.<br/> <br/>What is wave localization? It is an astonishing ability of physical systems to maintain vibrations in small portions of their original domains of activity, preventing extended propagation. One should not, in this context, think solely in terms of mechanical vibrations. Light is a particular example of an electromagnetic wave, wifi is delivered by waves, sound is a pressure wave, and, from the vantage point of quantum physics, even matter can be perceived as a type of wave. Whether wanted or unwanted, known or ignored, exploited or only sustained, localization of such waves plays a paramount role in our everyday life and will play an even greater one in the science and technology of the future. However, the intricate nature of this phenomenon and the perplexing rules of confinement that govern it remain largely a mystery. The goal of the present project is to establish the right mathematical tools with which to describe and manipulate it, to design and control localization behavior, in contrast to the current situation where researchers have to resort to limited experiments and costly trial-and-error runs. The project's aim is to unveil the fundamental laws of localization and eventually open the way to master vibrations (i.e., redirect, amplify, dampen, focus, and drive them) in all of their manifestations. The results of the research will bring novel methods to bear in analysis, probability, applied mathematics, condensed matter physics, mechanical engineering, acoustics, optics, and quantum physics, to name just a few areas of potential application. In addition, the project will become a platform for a unique interdisciplinary program of training for postdocs and students, with a line-up of activities specifically targeted to involve women and other STEM minorities in scientific research."

This is one of the very few forums for mathematicians, theoretical physicists, experimental physicists, engineers and biologists to interact on symmetry-related problems of mutual interest.  Symmetry is arguably the most important concept that guides science in its exploration of nature. Mathematics enables one to exploit the symmetries inherent in modern physical theories. Physics draws heavily on symmetry ideas to provide structure in these theories, including such newer fields as quantum information theory and quantum computation.

Complex numbers and functions of complex variables have become, since the nineteenth century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and its application to other areas of science and engineering. The solutions of many problems in the applied sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in these complex analytic tools and a deeper understanding of their basic properties. For example, in materials science the standard method for treating multidirectional stresses in a uniform way is to represent them as complex numbers or, in more complicated situations, as complex functions. It then turns out that, among other things, the direction of the propagation of cracks in materials is related to the properties of certain equations associated with these complex numbers or functions. Results of the research to be carried out in this project may lead to the discovery of new properties of solutions of these equations.

Such solutions and their stability can be studied on long time scales in relation to small scale models for light in optical media in nonlinear Schrodinger and Dirac models, surface waves on a surface tension scale in the gravity-capillary equations, or molecular dynamics in terms of both large scale nonlinear diffusions of crystals through thermodynamic fluctuations as well as Lagrangian mechanics for smaller systems of electrons trapped in various nuclear potentials.  They can also be studied in macroscopic systems such as interaction of surface waves and internal waves in coupled fluids models, vortex formation in fluid flow around biological objects in the Navier-Stokes equations with boundary, and dark matter formation in models from general relativity using Einstein-Scalar Field equations and their reductions as Schrdinger-Poisson models.  In applications that include large systems, complicated nonlinearities, and/or interesting geometric settings, the analysis and numerics can become increasingly difficult.  The quest to understand complexity in partial differential equation models has led to the development of dramatically new analytic and computational techniques to explore questions of symmetry, phase transitions, uniqueness for the attractive states, as well as generalizations of Fourier transform methods using scattering theory, spectral theory and microlocal analysis to understand their stability.  These techniques can be applied for instance on spaces with curvature, boundary, metric singularities or other difficult features such as noise in a sample or trapping due to external potential wells.  <br/><br/><br/>This proposal will involve research in partial differential equations directly related to optics and electronic structure with relevant boundary conditions and potentials, as well as other equations from fluid dynamics, general relativity and thermodynamic fluctuations on crystal surfaces.  The PI will also work with postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates on integrated research into models, computation and experiment, especially though collaboration with members of the UNC Fluids Lab and International Mathematics Climate Network.  An important aspect of that training will be to develop graduate courses and undergraduate courses in dynamics and computation to prepare trainees for a variety of careers in science.  From a human resources standpoint, models like those in this proposal provide a large pool of problems that give a strong background in computation and geometry, as well as some applied statistics, which can be used for training purposes in work with researchers of all levels, from undergraduate to postdoctoral, then applied in many scientific fields. In addition, the PI will continue to support the mathematics department role in the University of North Carolina Science Expo to work towards broader outreach goals of making mathematical sciences more accessible to the public."

It is critically important to understand the formation of instabilities of solutions for these systems. One of the goals of this proposal is to study dynamics of nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems, systems whose solutions can be approximated by explicit formulas, as well as their instabilities. This study will provide significant modern advances in understanding the classical problems, with many current applications, especially to astrophysics.

The latter is a weak form of quasi-ergodic hypothesis.  Another direction of our research is to prove stochastic and diffusive behavior for nearly integrable systems, where randomness is with respect to initial conditions.

Einstein's Equations connect the curvature of spacetime to its mass/energy content. In local coordinates they can be written as the system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. Due to their complexity, most studies have focused on exact solutions, obtained by imposing additional symmetries, which include Schwarzschild (non-rotating black holes) and Kerr (rotating black holes) spacetimes. A natural and highly nontrivial problem is whether these particular solutions are stable under small perturbations. In other words, assuming that at a moment in time the curvature of a given spacetime is very close to the curvature of a Kerr spacetime, it is expected that after evolving for a long time it will eventually approach a (potentially different) Kerr spacetime. The main goal of this project is understanding the behavior of solutions to equations and systems of equations that model Einstein's Equations, but are simpler. The study of these toy problems is necessary in order to tackle the much harder nonlinear stability problem mentioned above. <br/><br/>There has recently been a flurry of activity with regard to understanding the decay for the linear wave equations on Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, which is the simplest possible model to study. Even this problem is quite difficult, since the complicated background geometry affects the dispersion properties in nontrivial ways. In compact regions one must deal with high frequency wave packets that linger along trapped geodesics for a long time, while at infinity the non-Euclidean character of the metric affects the pointwise rates of decay. The very delicate (and unstable) nature of the trapped set in particular requires tools coming from harmonic analysis, differential equations, and differential geometry. Nevertheless, robust ways of measuring decay (e.g. local energy estimates and Strichartz estimates) have now been established. These estimates can in turn be used to tackle nonlinear problems like global well-posedness (existence and uniqueness of solutions, and continuous dependence of initial data). One example of such nonlinear problems is the semilinear wave equation with power nonlinearities for both small and large initial data. Another example, which is a good model of Einstein's Equations in harmonic coordinates, is the wave equation for a metric that itself depends on the solution. These techniques can also be used to settle the problem of optimal decay of solutions to the Maxwell Equations, the linear system which describes the evolution of an electromagnetic field on Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds. Finally, there is interest in the study of higher dimensional black holes coming from string theory, which at low energies can be described by higher-dimensional theories of gravity. Understanding the relevant decay properties for the wave equation on these backgrounds would also be quite interesting."

If we study some system that evolves in time according to known rules, what predictions can we make based on observing the present state of the system?  It is by now well-understood that even relatively simple systems can display chaotic behavior, in which our ability to make exact predictions decays quite quickly as we look further ahead.  In this case one may hope to treat the system as a random process and make statistical predictions using tools from probability theory.  This approach has been successfully carried out for uniformly hyperbolic systems, the most strongly chaotic.  However, most physically realistic examples fall outside of this class, including important models from meteorology (the Lorenz system), population dynamics (the logistic map), and others.  This motivates the study of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, where the present state of knowledge is much less complete.  There has been progress towards understanding certain classes of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, but many open problems remain, both for systems that have been studied and for broader classes of systems.  This research project will give new results for several important classes of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, and is an important step in developing a more complete understanding of physically relevant systems displaying chaotic behavior.<br/><br/>Key elements of the uniformly hyperbolic theory include existence and uniqueness results for equilibrium states and SRB measures, together with statistical properties for these measures, such as the central limit theorem governing long-term fluctuations of observations around an expected average, and large deviations principles describing the probability of outcomes far from that average.  Some of these results, but not all, are known for classes of one-dimensional maps and their perturbations (strongly dissipative maps), partially hyperbolic systems, and geodesic flows.  The PI will extend these results to weakly dissipative maps and more general geodesic flows, and will strengthen existing results in all three categories.  The key innovation making these extensions possible is the introduction by the PI and his co-authors of new tools for non-uniform hyperbolicity: a notion of ""effective hyperbolicity"" for the construction of SRB measures, and a notion of ""thermodynamic specification"" for uniqueness and statistical properties of equilibrium states.  These tools have already yielded a number of new results and have clear applicability to broader classes of systems."

Partial Differential Equations (PDE) are ubiquitous throughout science and engineering, since they express relationships between rates of change of quantities of interest.  Linear PDE such as Laplace, heat, wave, and Schrdinger equations are central to many phenomena in physics.  Nonlinear PDE arise in fields such as general relativity, condensed matter physics and optics, gauge field theory, and fluid dynamics. Nonlinear PDE are also employed to tackle mathematical problems in the area of geometric analysis.  This meeting brings together experts from across these fields to exchange information about recent research results and to foster collaborative research.<br/><br/>This award provides partial support for the 73rd edition of the Midwest PDE Seminar, to be held at Northwestern University on the weekend of May 10-11, 2014.  Study of the Laplace, heat, wave, and Schrdinger equations remains a lively and rich subject; for instance the study of Laplace eigenfunctions and eigenvalues in both compact and noncompact settings (spectral and scattering theory) is of considerable current interest.  Moreover, nonlinear PDE such as arise in general relativity (Einstein equations), condensed matter physics and optics (nonlinear Schrdinger equation), gauge field theory (Yang-Mills equations), and fluids (Navier-Stokes and Euler equations) remain rich in mysteries.  On the side of geometry, the study of Riemannian manifolds endowed with special metrics has seen astounding advances in recent years.  Work involving Hamilton's Ricci flow and breaking developments in the theory of Khler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds have involved profound new tools from PDE. These theories are tied to a nonlinear degenerate parabolic equation (Ricci flow) and an elliptic equation (complex Monge-Ampre) respectively.  Discussions in this seminar will address these and other topics.

Roughly speaking, this field keeps track of the position and frequency, or momentum, of waves (or more generally, functions) simultaneously. The planned applications are to wave propagation and other related phenomena, as well as inverse problems for determining a function from integrals along curves (X-ray transform) and related problems for determining the structure of a material from boundary measurements. Although the proposal concerns their mathematical theory, these problems are closely connected to the physical world. Wave propagation is ubiquitous in nature, with electromagnetic waves, such as light, being one of the most prevalent examples; the theory of general relativity being another important physical example. Scattering theory of quantum particles (such as protons and electrons) is another subject governed by microlocal analysis: these aspects enter both into the description of quantum waves at large distances, and into semiclassical phenomena, i.e. when Planck's constant can be regarded as small, which happens often in chemistry. The inverse problems under study are also of broad significance: an application of the theory developed here is the determination of an unknown variable sound speed in an object via the measurement of travel times of waves, which for instance is relevant to imaging to interior of Earth using the travel times of earthquake waves.<br/><br/>Some of the proposed projects describe the long-time or far field behavior of waves on curved space-times. Physically these arise in general relativity, including electromagnetic waves on a curved background. However, there are also examples of purely mathematical origin, such as asymptotically complex hyperbolic (ACH) space and asymptotically Anti de Sitter spaces (AdS); the latter does have a different connection with physics via string theory. The microlocal approach to analysis on these spaces has made breakthroughs possible in the author's work on linear problems asymptotically (real) hyperbolic (AH) spaces as well as Kerr-de Sitter space. The projects here aim to extend these tools to the ACH, AdS-type spaces, improve the understanding of Lorentzian scattering spaces (which include asymptotically Minkowski spaces), as well as to quasilinear PDE. Other projects concern the behavior of waves at edges, concretely the diffraction of the Rayleigh (surface) waves of elasticity and a refined, second-microlocal, description of diffraction of scalar or electromagnetic waves. Yet another main area is inverse problems, where the author, together with Uhlmann, has introduced new tools for spatially localized inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform. The projects aim to extend this to tensors, and to investigate boundary rigidity, i.e. recovering a Riemannian metric from its boundary distance function."

Imaging problems from medicine, including CT, SPECT, and NMR, as well as RADAR and SONAR applications, all depend on a deep understanding of the Radon transform. Optical-acoustic tomography, scattering theory, and even motion-detection algorithms also rely heavily on the mathematics that will be further developed as a part of this project.

The first is to develop geometric and combinatorial methods useful for proving uniform estimates for a class of linear and multilinear operators generalizing Radon-like transforms, sublevel set operators, and oscillatory integral operators.  The approaches to be developed trace their roots to work of Bourgain, Wolf, Christ, and many other mathematicians. The problems to be studied here and related generalizations are connected to some of the most important conjectures in modern mathematical analysis, including the Kakeya conjecture, the Bochner-Riesz conjecture, the Restriction conjecture, and Sogge's local smoothing conjecture.  The second major objective is the application of these ideas and results to important open questions in the field of partial differential equations. Such applications have already made significant contributions to the study of the Boltzmann equation and the Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy, and during this project, such work will be continued and expanded to include new mathematical understandings of the scattering theory of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur hierarchy and oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert problems. Each of these problems can benefit greatly from the tools to be developed in this project, which will replace traditional Fourier methods with more robust, geometric tools and ideas."

These equations describe the variations of certain physical observables, such as energy, momentum, etc. with respect to more basic variables like space and time. A particularly important feature of PDE-based descriptions is that problems with rather diverse scientific backgrounds can often be described by mathematically similar equations. Many insights about the underlying scientific problem can thus be gained by studying the PDEs themselves using analytical and/or numerical techniques. The current project studies a certain class of nonlinear partial differential equations that arise in the description of collective phenomena in quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is one of the two fundamental building blocks in modern physics (the other one being Einstein's theory of general relativity) and it concerns the study of mechanical systems whose dimensions are close to, or even smaller than, the atomic scale. The mathematical formulation pioneered by Erwin Schrdinger, Paul Dirac, and especially John von Neumann is to a large extent based on PDEs for so-called wave functions, which describe the state of the quantum particles in a probabilistic interpretation. It is not surprising that more than 100 years after its discovery, quantum theory has reached a stage of enormous complexity. Modern experimental techniques have made it possible to design, manipulate, and closely monitor quantum mechanical systems involving thousands of particles interacting with each other. In order to obtain a better understanding of these highly complicated systems, it is necessary to clearly separate the slow and fast degrees of freedom intrinsically present within such systems. The main objective of the current project is to develop a mathematical theory which allows to do so by means of several different analytical techniques. Its outcome will be a much simpler mathematical description in which the fast degrees of freedom have been taken into account through their total cummulative effects only. The effective model equation thereby obtained becomes accessible for a more detailed mathematical study and for accurate numerical simulations using the current state of computing power. All of the equations studied arise as important physical models in the description of various quantum mechanical phenomena. Answers to the questions raised will therefore have a strong impact as proven statements in a wide range of theoretical physics, as well as in the analysis of PDEs. In addition, the PI proposes an integrated plan of educational activities related to the proposed research: A series of mini-courses and workshops for advanced graduate students and recent PhDs will be held. They will bring together students with renowned specialists from different fields of mathematics. Furthermore, the PI will organize and support a weekly student seminar for graduate and strong undergraduate students interested in applied analysis and related fields. Finally, the PI has proposed new graduate courses on topics at the juncture of nonlinear dispersive equations, mathematical physics and asymptotic analysis.<br/><br/>Separation of scales plays a fundamental role in the understanding of the dynamical behavior of complex systems in physics and other natural sciences. By identifying the slow and fast degrees of freedom, it is often possible to derive simple laws for certain slow variables, which in turn serve as an approximate description of the full multi-scale dynamics of the problem. A particular example is the classical adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics, going back to M. Born and V. Fock in 1928, which can be loosely stated as follows: A quantum mechanical system subjected to slowly changing external conditions retains its basic form (at least approximately). For quantum systems described by linear Schrdinger equations there is a wealth of mathematical results which give a rigorous meaning to this basic idea. The current project is devoted to the development of a rigorous adiabatic theory for partial differential equations of nonlinear Schrdinger type (and related models). The intellectual relevance of the proposed research stems from the importance of nonlinear Schrdinger equations as mean-field models of complex many-body quantum systems. Applications can be found in the mathematical description of Bose-Einstein condensates, quantum wave guides, and semiconductor graphene layers. All of these applications are at the forefront of modern experimental and theoretical physics. The mathematical theory to be developed will provide a qualitative description of the solutions to the respective model equation in physically relevant multi-scale regimes, and in addition establish deep connections to other areas, such as semiclassical analysis, homogenization theory, and to the study of dispersive equations on manifolds."

A very challenging task is to sift through a large collection of  data in order to find meaningful information.  One would like to organize the data, or at least part of it, in such a way that it is easy to use.  Imagine the data as being all images on the internet, and the ""organization"" that you seek is being able to map out which images are those of a specific person of your choosing, subordered according to the activities in which he or she is engaged.  Organizing large amounts of information in a useful way, or sorting through it and finding pieces you care about, are tasks that can be transformed, or related to, mathematical questions.  This proposal attempts to address some of these questions.  Basic questions are mathematical analogues of the following: What kind of structure can I hope to get after organizing the data?  How much of my data can I expect to organize in a useful way? Do answers change if I am willing to ""lose"" some information in the process? Will I know the amount data lost? And, last but not least, can I, in a practical way, access the organized data or a significant part of it?<br/><br/>In many applications one is given a large data set represented as a subset of a metric space, such as a high-dimensional Euclidean space, and one seeks to ""faithfully"" represent a ""large"" portion of this data set as a subset of a low-dimensional Euclidean space. ""Faithfully"" means in this context that one can still perform the same data mining tasks on the image of the data portion that one could on the original data set.  This task has thus far received much attention from computer scientists and applied mathematicians using a wide range of approaches. The framework of dimensionality reduction also includes data compression and data approximation. These have applications in many areas of science.  Geometric measure theory and geometric function theory are tools whose use in this matter has not been fully exploited. A key point is that often the given data set has some additional geometric structure, for example, has small Hausdorff dimension (a discrete analogue) or is close to being a union of low-dimensional manifolds. This allows one to use harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory to organize the data.  This project will study mathematical questions motivated by this observation. Two basic questions the project will attempt to answer can be phrased as follows: When is part of a metric measure space composed of Lipschitz images of ""standard"" pieces and how does one find these pieces? When is a collection of points best described as one-dimensional?"

Three of them  are  concerned with the interaction between geometry and analysis, the study of functions and the properties of operators, which are transformations that turn functions into new functions. The operators studied in this project arise either when trying to understand how waves propagate (for example, acoustic waves in the Earth), or in basic mathematical tools that are used to study wave propagation, or in the study of geometric properties of large sets of points. Waves can be idealized as traveling along rays, such as light rays, and when the rays concentrate in a small region, new methods need to be developed to obtain accurate descriptions of the waves. Two parts of this project will continue the principal investigator's study of various operators and how their properties can be predicted from the structure of rays or more general underlying geometry. Possible applications include improved understanding of artifacts in seismic imaging. A third part concerns multilinear operators, which act on several functions at a time. These arise in the study of how two or more waves interact and also in the study of point clouds in discrete geometry. The fourth part is a new approach to the design of resonant devices, such as antennas. Recent progress in materials science, physics, and mathematics has led to rapid advances in the design of devices constructed from structured composite materials, also called metamaterials, which have radical effects on wave propagation. One particularly successful approach is based on transformation optics. The principal investigator will investigate a new, non-transformation optics design methodology. <br/><br/>Two of the proposed projects concern developing new tools for dealing with degeneracies or singularities of smooth or real-analytic  functions. In one, composition of degenerate Fourier integral operators with smooth phases leads to operators that have wave-front relations that are not smooth, and understanding how to associate Fourier-integral-operator-like operators to these geometries will expand the reach of microlocal analysis and help analyze certain inverse problems. In another, new techniques will need to be found to deal with oscillatory integral operators with real-analytic phases  in one plus two or two plus two dimensions. The difficulties include understanding to what extent two or more functions can have their zero varieties simultaneously resolved. Some of the same techniques will also be applied  to try to find an algorithmic description of jumping numbers, which are the subject of current interest in singularity theory and algebraic geometry. Doing so will strengthen the connection between analysis and these fields.  Progress on the third part of the project will not only further develop the theory of multilinear operators within harmonic analysis, but it will also have immediate applications to geometric measure theory and discrete geometry.  The final component will show how established ideas from linear partial differential equations can be useful in designing and rigorously verifying the properties of resonant structures such as antennas and will help contribute a new design methodology to the rapidly developing area of metamaterials."

For example, waves in the ocean can organize themselves into ""trains"" transporting energy, and analogous trains are also observed in laser beams propagating in optical fibers;  statistical fluctuations in nuclear experiments led to a new type of universality that subsequently has been observed in a wide variety of situations modeled with randomness, as far-flung as the statistics of spacings between parked cars!  This research project involves the detailed rigorous analysis of canonical models for a wide variety of physical settings whose singular behavior is a guide for the understanding of some complicated phenomena in nature.  The project aims to develop methods to understand, predict, and control system behavior.  The potential long-term impacts of this research program stem from the emergence of universality as a new paradigm in science: probing its range of applicability is fundamental in emerging areas as well as established ones.<br/><br/>This research project concerns the development of new methods for the asymptotic analysis of Riemann-Hilbert problems and d-bar problems and application of these techniques to problems in a range of fields including random matrix theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, orthogonal polynomials, and asymptotic combinatorics.  In each of these areas, the overarching goal is to provide a complete description of the system (be it the eigenvalues of a random matrix, or the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation).  Two examples under study are: (1) Eigenvalue statistics in the normal matrix model. The quest for universal behavior when the eigenvalues are accumulating in a two-dimensional region is in its infancy; this project aims to create connections between rigorous mathematical analysis and physical intuition developed over the last 20 years. (2) The asymptotic behavior of the partition function in the two-cut regime, for which ideas and conjectural formulae have existed for some time."

While the models are specific, they show certain general properties and the methods that need to be developed will be relevant beyond the context of these concrete cases.<br/><br/>More specifically, the PI intends to quantify dispersive properties of a Fermi gas by novel forms of so-called Strichartz inequalities, via exploring their connection with the restriction problem in harmonic analysis. It is intended to rigorously derive the macroscopic Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity from the microscopic BCS theory with particular emphasis on the Meisner effect. Mathematical tools include semi-classical analysis and a non-commutative calculus of variations. Ground states of non-linear, non-local equations and their stationary and dynamical role will be studied, in particular, their global and local uniqueness properties will be analyzed.In addition, an attempt will be made to find the sharp form of two functional inequalities which display conformal invariance and have both physical and geometric content."

Given the current state of the system, can one predict the future state?  How does this evolution of the state of the system depend on the parameters of the system?  Many such dynamical systems are far too complicated for a rigorous study, so one resorts to simpler models, which are hoped to indicate the types of behavior that one should expect experimentally.  One venue for such simpler models is the iteration of holomorphic maps, the topic of this project.  Completing these projects will provide a deeper understanding of fundamental properties of dynamical systems in several complex variables and it will build connections with other areas of mathematics.  The broader impacts of this project are largely educational, focusing on both high school students and Ph.D. students. Funding for this project will help to develop an interest and talent in mathematics among high school students, both local and throughout Indiana.  It will help to train at least one supported Ph.D. student at Indiana University-Purdue University and also to train Ph.D. students from all over the United States by means of two workshops on holomorphic dynamics in several variables.<br/><br/>The main research goal of this project is to explore several examples where the iteration of a holomorphic self-map of a complex manifold has a connection with another area of mathematics or mathematical physics.  Not only does the connection allow for applications in the other area, but the context coming from that area usually gives the mapping extra structure, allowing for a significantly deeper study. Four projects are proposed relating dynamics in several complex variables to Thurston theory, the Ising model from statistical physics, the spectra of certain operators arising from self-similar group actions, and complex time ordinary differential equations (the Painleve equations). The proposed research projects are designed around three principles: (1) exploring connections between two or more different areas of mathematics can lead to surprising new results, (2) dynamical systems having an additional context from another field can be studied significantly more deeply, and (3) a study of concrete examples often leads to statements and proofs of more general theorems.  Partnered with the main research goals are several educational goals: (1) leading local high school students on specially tailored research projects, (2) helping to run and improve the Indiana University-Purdue University High School Math Contest, (3) leading Ph.D. students on the main research projects mentioned above, and (4) organizing two workshops on dynamics in several complex variables which have a training component for Ph.D. students."

First, the PI will study solutions to stochastic differential equations which undergo rare, random transitions between two or more regions of the state space.  The goal of this work is to understand the statistics of these transitions, especially in the small-noise regime: what are the typical pathways by which the transitions occur? what is the typical time required for a transition?  These issues are very relevant to problems in chemistry and molecular dynamics, as well as many other physical systems exhibiting metastable behavior. The second type of stochastic dynamics which the PI will study has to do with stochastic interacting particle systems.  Specific systems to be studied involve random motion, growth, and selection, as in models of evolution, population genetics, adaptive dynamics. The PI will study continuum limits and large-time limits for such systems. In particular, this will illuminate new relations between interacting particle systems and continuum free boundary problems.<br/><br/><br/>When viewed at a certain scale, many physical and biological systems seem to behave randomly or are influenced by small random fluctuations. Mathematical models of such systems involve probability theory.  Nevertheless, it is very difficult to use these mathematical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over a long period of time or over a large spatial region.  Therefore, a fundamental scientific and mathematical problem is to understand how random dynamics or interactions at one spatial or temporal scale influence a system at another spatial or temporal scale. This research project develops mathematical tools for predicting and describing the macroscopic behavior of certain systems which behave randomly at a microscopic level.  The specific systems to be studied are motivated by problems in chemistry and by models of biological evolution. One common feature in these systems is the appearance of random, perhaps rare, transitions: a chemical reaction occurs or a cell produces a mutation. The educational component of the project includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students at the intersection of probability, analysis, and applications, preparing them for careers in STEM-related disciplines."

This proposal considers a broad class of questions in number theory and harmonic analysis involving objects with curvature.<br/><br/>The PI will develop methodological advances for the circle method, character sums, and sieves, leading to applications to a wide array of number theoretic questions that can be interpreted as counting solutions to systems of Diophantine equations. In addition, the PI will investigate polynomial Carleson operators of Radon type, for which the presence of curvature introduces both new difficulties and beautiful new structure. Finally, the PI will apply number theoretic and analytic methods to prove operator bounds for discrete arithmetic operators involving curvature.

An early discovery of modern physics was that this situation is very much different at the subatomic level. For example, the famous Uncertainty Principle of Werner Heisenberg asserts that it is impossible to measure simultaneously the position and momentum of a quantum particle such as an electron orbiting the nucleus of an atom.  In 1926, von Neumann laid the precise mathematical foundation for what it is that can actually be measured in the case of a subatomic particle. This seminal breakthrough involved the use of ""operators,"" linear transformations acting on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Operator theory, the branch of modern mathematics that studies operators, has grown over the last eighty-eight years to become a far-reaching area of research in mathematics that has had a major impact on many areas of mathematics, physics, and engineering. This project involves the development of new techniques within operator theory, as well as the application of established techniques, to attack a number of problems within mathematics. Though it is not the major focus of the project, the research has many possible applications to both mathematical physics and control theory. <br/><br/>A pillar of modern operator theory is the Sz.-Nagy Dilation Theorem, which models a contraction acting on Hilbert space by extending it to a co-isometry acting on a larger space. This theorem and its numerous refinements open the door to studying analytic functions in one and several variables through the use of operator-theoretic methods. The principal investigator will study a variety of problems in several complex variables and other areas of analysis using these operator-theoretic methods. In particular, he will use operator-theoretic methods to study the following: interpolation problems of Nevanlinna-Pick and Cartheodory-Fejer type; the boundary behavior of analytic functions defined on polydiscs and polyhalfplanes; the derivation and descriptive theory of extremal holomorphic mappings arising from the Caratheodory and Kobayashi extremal problems; and the canonical derivation of representation formulas for analytic functions  in specific classes such as the Shur, Herglotz, Pick, Loewner, Bessmertnii, and Stieljes classes. A related focus of the research is to apply the commutative modeling methods to develop the theory of analytic functions in several noncommuting variables."

Apart from being fascinating mathematical problems that require new ideas and methods, their study is also of great importance for a deeper understanding of the physical phenomena themselves. For instance, understanding the best way to crumple a paper is a natural problem in elasticity which has several applications in material sciences, while nonlocal interaction energies appear in physics and chemistry as a way to describe the energy of nuclei. Our mathematical research will shed new light on the range of energies under which nuclei are stable.  The project will also have important impact on human resource development. We propose a system of personnel exchanges between our home institutions, designed to provide a rich training experience to students and postdocs. We propose to coordinate our activities and to have an emphasis month every year in one of the home universities of the PIs. We also propose summer schools designed to bring members of the group together (including graduate students and postdocs) to stimulate scientific progress, while exposing the fruits of our research to a broader audience and helping to educate and attract a new generation of researchers to this exciting area of emerging mathematical challenges and ideas.<br/><br/>The goals of this project include developing new general methods to study variational problems both in a vectorial setting and in the case of non-local interaction energies.

We focus on central issues in the calculus of variations, such as proving existence of minimizers of energy functionals and understanding their (possible) uniqueness and regularity. While much is known in the scalar case, very few results are available in the vectorial setting (both in the static and evolutionary cases) and for geometric problems involving non-local energies. Through a common effort, bringing together the investigators and collaborators for this Focused Research Group Grant, we expect some general methods to emerge, allowing us to obtain new substantial results.

However there are two important assumptions that play a crucial role in their usefulness that do not always hold.  First, calculus can only be used when, like the surface of the earth, the quantities of interest ""appear to be flat"" from up close. In addition, many properties in algebra use the fact that when multiplying numbers, changing the order of the factors does not affect their product.  Unfortunately there many real-world situations that cannot be modeled adequately under these assumptions. For example, when an online merchant recommends a particular product based on previous purchases, the information that is relevant consists of quantities whose variations can be more accurately described as ""jumps"": whether or not we buy a particular product causes a sudden change in quantity sold. In quantum physics, or physics at nanoscopic scales, the order in which factors are multiplied can affect the product. The PI proposes in this project to develop modern versions of existing mathematical tools in the absence of those seemingly simple assumptions. The particular tools that will be considered are relevant for computer science and quantum physics.<br/><br/>The PI will carry on a program that studies the counterparts of various aspects of Banach space theory (mainly related to study of ideals of operators and approximation properties) in the context of metric spaces and operator spaces. This will be done by combining methods and techniques from the local theory of Banach spaces with modern nonlinear and noncommutative approaches. The nonlinear aspects include using Lipschitz-free spaces to investigate whether or not certain approximation properties for Banach spaces are invariant under Lipschitz isomorphisms; and also answering quantitative questions about embedding finite metric spaces into Hilbert spaces. On the noncommutative side, the project aims at proving composition theorems for certain classes of mappings acting between operator spaces, constructing almost Euclidean subspaces of finite-dimensional spaces of trace-class operators, and defining a Radon-Nikodym property for operator spaces."

The topics of this conference are those where the underlying space is fractal, and the subjects studied include the analogs of differential equations, random processes and models of physical interactions taking place on these fractal spaces. Due to the pioneering work of Barlow, Perkins, Bass, Kusuoka, Zhou and Kigami there is a well-established, rigorous mathematical framework for discussing such problems.<br/><br/>The conference will contribute to the study of processes in disordered media (fractals), which have many applications in physics, chemistry, biological sciences and engineering. Diffusion processes in percolation clusters, vibrations of fractal objects, signal propagation in channels with random obstacles, electro-magnetic waves in fractal antennae, Rossby waves in oceanography, models of financial markets, neural structures are just a few of many examples of such processes. There are many important scientific questions involving modeling physical systems on fractal spaces. Participation of theoretical physicists helps foster the growing interactions between the mathematics and physics communities with interests in these areas. This conference will help inform the physics community of the infrastructure being developed by mathematicians, and will give mathematicians interesting feedback on the interests and questions of other scientists. These Cornell conferences have been held every three years starting in 2002. The previous four conferences in this series have had a major impact in the development of these areas by bringing together leading contributors, young researchers and mathematicians in related disciplines to learn about recent work and plan joint projects. The fifth conference is expected to continue in this tradition. The five day meeting will be structured in three parts: half-hour talks in the mornings by leading researchers in the field to describe recent important advances; mini-courses in the early afternoons to enable advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers from related fields to learn some of the foundations of the area and discuss important open problems; and twenty minute talks in parallel sessions in the late afternoons to allow all attendees to present their research. A significant part of the conference is the mini-courses, which are directed primarily at the training of future mathematicians. A large number of junior researchers, including minorities, members of underrepresented groups and undergraduate students from both the Cornell and University of Connecticut REU programs, are expected to benefit from these courses."

The class of amenable groups was introduced and studied by von Neumann in 1929, and he explained why a paradox appeared only in dimensions greater or equal to three. In the 1940s the amenability theory shifted into the field of functional analysis.  Currently amenability theory appears in many fields of mathematics, most notably in operator algebras, functional analysis, ergodic theory, probability theory, and harmonic analysis.<br/><br/>The core part of the project is based on the recent technique used by PI to prove that certain groups are amenable. PI plans to develop this technique in a more conceptual way using random walks on Schreier graphs. There are several classes of groups to which the technique can potentially be applied. They include Thompson group F, interval exchange transformation group, topological full group of abelian groups. The expected impact of the project is to give deeper understanding of analytic properties of the group actions and relate them to other fields. One of the central impact of this proposal is through its educational goals, in particular, in organizing of several summer schools and workshops.

The principal investigator plans to develop an algebraic approach to CEP that she started in several recent papers. This approach is based on certain algebraic properties of noncommutative polynomials over unitary variables. One of the rapidly developing areas in group theory is a study of approximations of discrete groups by finite groups, in particular, so-called sofic approximations. Several long-standing conjectures are known to be true for sofic groups. Among them are CEP for group von Neumann algebras, Gottschalk's conjecture, the determinant conjecture, and Kaplansky's direct finiteness conjecture. Moreover, there are currently no known examples of nonsofic groups. One of the aims of the project is to study properties of sofic approximations for several classes of groups in the hope of shedding greater light on this state of affairs.<br/><br/>Groups and operator algebras arise naturally in all areas of mathematics and also in certain parts of physics and chemistry.

Even the simplest families of examples exhibit complicated dynamical behavior;  the most famous is the family of complex quadratic polynomials, where the Mandelbrot set continues to baffle researchers.  The primary goal of this project is to explore the dynamical moduli spaces of polynomials and rational functions.  The projects proposed (both the questions and the proposed solution strategies) combine ingredients from complex analysis and arithmetic or algebraic geometry.  In one direction, the PI aims to study the distribution of postcritically-finite rational maps within the moduli space.  In joint work with Matthew Baker, the PI has formulated a dynamical analogue to the Andre-Oort conjecture in arithmetic geometry. Questions of this type are not only analogies:  for example, the PI  aims to use dynamical techniques to recover a result by Masser and Zannier about torsion points in families of elliptic curves.  The main tools are recent developments in analysis and dynamics on a Berkovich analyticspace.  In a slightly different direction, the PI is studying bifurcation sets and bifurcation measures in distinguished subvarieties within the moduli space.  Here the techniques are predominantly analytic.  New questions have stemmed from experimental work, using the new computer program Dynamics Explorer developed by Boyd & Boyd.  The PI is also interested in classical problems about the existence and classification of symmetries of rational functions.  <br/><br/><br/>In the last five or ten years, ""algebraic dynamics"" has become an extremely active area of research; the questions have become more refined as senior researchers enter the subject with very different backgrounds and we uncover connections to many areas of mathematics.  Roughly speaking, algebraic dynamics is the study of dynamical systems that preserve an underlying algebraicstructure.  Such systems arise naturally in applications (for example, the one-dimensional logistic family is algebraic), and they play a role in the analysis of arithmetic objects studied by number theorists (for example, in defining height functions associated to arithmetic varieties).  The PI is actively involved in the exchange of mathematical ideas between number theorists and dynamicists.   On one hand, her questions are about the fundamental stability of dynamical systems:  under what conditions is a system insensitive to small perturbations?  On the other hand, the special class of dynamical systems she studies exhibits a rich algebraic structure, bringing dynamical features into a long history of arithmetic geometry.  Finally, the project has an experimental component that works very well with students and junior researchers; the PI is actively involved in research projects and training programs for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers."

A proper way to understand metric spaces is to consider their transformations that shrink or stretch the distance on the space by a bounded amount. These are called bi-Lipschitz transformations, and they are at the focus of the proposed investigation. As an example of an application of such transformations, one can mention that accurate representations of a given, possibly quite irregular, metric space within a Euclidean space is an essential aspect of  data visualization and analysis.<br/><br/>Normed linear spaces provide a convenient model to which less regular metric spaces can be compared. Thus, it is of interest to know when a given metric space is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to a normed space, or can be embedded into one. This is one of the principal problems addresses in the proposal. Even for two-dimensional spaces (metric planes) our understanding of bi-Lipschitz equivalence is far from complete. One approach to this problem is to introduce and study numeric invariants of metric spaces, such as dimension-type concepts which capture the size or degree of connectivity within the space. A different, but related approach involves analytic properties of functions supported on the space: Poincare inequality and various extension properties (Sobolev, Lipschitz, etc). The proposal involves both of these approaches. In particular, the quantitative aspects of the bi-Lipschitz extension problem will be investigated."

These problems share the features of computational complexity and delicate interactions between processes occurring at multiple length and time scales, along with the fact that they concern fundamental and frequently occurring physical phenomena, have been much studied over a period of several decades, and yet at a rigorous mathematical level remain unresolved. It is important to note that this is an instance where mathematics is not just verifying logically already-observed physically or experimentally principles, but finding order in settings that current numerics and experiment are not adequate to resolve.  Several of the planned subprojects involve numerically assisted proof using scientific computation with guaranteed error bounds.  An integral part of the project is the simultaneous development of a user-friendly numerical platform, STABLAB, for numerical stability investigation, and the systematic exploration with this platform of physical behavior in gas and fluid dynamics in the delicate situations of reacting or ionized flow.  Most of the proposed computations, particularly those involving multiple dimensions and viscous effects simultaneously, have never before been successfully carried out- hence there is a substantial numerical/computational component to this program as well.<br/><br/>The problems addressed involve interesting and nonstandard issues in turning point theory, spectral theory of nonselfadjoint operators, nonlinear partial differential equations, and pattern formation. The problems considered are long-standing ones of basic physical interest, whose solutions will require significantly new tools. In particular, development of rigorous numerical stability verification algorithms; treatment of analytic-coefficient turning point problems on unbounded domains, and especially with turning points at infinity; and the investigation of startling effects of viscosity in combination with high activation energy appear likely to be transformational in the study of stability and bifurcation of fluid- and gas-dynamical flow. Each of these problems involve the technical difficulties of multiples scales (stiffness) and absence of spectral gap; their successful analysis involves accounting of delicate cancellation both at the linear level, through stationary phase and related complex analytic methods, and at the nonlinear level, through phase extraction/modulation techniques developed by the PI and collaborators. The goals of rigorous analytic WKB theory, viscous detonation theory, and rigorous numerical stability verification (proof) in particular have the potential to be transformative.  At the same time, the production of quantitative data for models where none was available (e.g., viscous effects on detonation stability) should be of immediate practical use."

Infinite matriceal structures such as operator algebras are able to depict and model the interactions of elementary particles and the symmetries underlying quantum physics. The present project is part of a concerted effort to extend fundamental ideas and techniques of analysis and geometry to the noncommutative context of operator (matrix) algebras. The project will investigate the existence of finite-dimensional approximations of operator algebras that are sufficiently rich to capture key features of the initial data. Passing to finite-dimensional models is important since it gives access to concrete numerical invariants. Inevitably, the structure of the finite-dimensional models will be somewhat less symmetric than their infinite-dimensional counterparts. The loss of exact symmetries is an essential feature of the approximant finite models.  It reflects subtle topological properties that the principal investigator aims to quantify in numerical form. The resulting invariants are related to those arising in the mathematics underpinning the physics of novel materials, such as topological insulators with crystalline symmetry.<br/><br/>The research concerns two projects in operators algebras that have analytical and topological aspects. The first project is devoted to groups, C*-algebras, and their approximations by finite-dimensional matrix models. It will examine the existence of deformations of discrete groups and group C*-algebras into matrix algebras, the invariants that arise from these deformations, and potential topological obstructions encountered in the process. One underlying goal of the investigation is to develop a better understanding of the topological nature of quasidiagonality, a finite-dimensional approximation property that plays a central role in the structure theory of C*-algebras. The second project concerns the theory of continuous fields of C*-algebras and their generalizations to C*-algebras over general spaces. While the primitive spectrum of a C*-algebra is a fundamental invariant, it has one important limitation. It gives only a low-level description of how the ideals are glued together. A first goal of the project is to develop computable invariants that capture K-theoretical interactions between ideals and local quotients. A second goal is to further develop the generalized Dixmier-Douady theory of continuous fields of strongly self-absorbing C*-algebras due to Ulrich Pennig and the principal investigator."

This workshop will  bring together leading researchers, young post-docs, and graduate students from the Gulf region, Brazil, the US, and Europe. A website has been set up for this workshop at http://science.qatar.tamu.edu/Conferences/Pages/Upcoming-Conferences.aspx. The purpose of the workshop is twofold. First, to generate long term collaborations between mathematicians from the different regions. Second, to afford the younger participants an opportunity to interact with leaders in their field, as well as with each other. The subject matter, several complex variables, enjoys a central position in mathematics because it draws from, and contributes to, various other subareas of mathematics. But while it is amply motivated within mathematics proper, it also arises in various other contexts. For example, causality, one of the fundamental laws of nature, when transcribed via a mathematical device called Fourier transform, immediately leads to analytic functions of several (in this case four) complex variables.<br/><br/>While the Sobolev theory of the Cauchy-Riemann equation(s) is well developed, the theory for the analogue on CR submanifolds, the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equation(s), is at a comparable stage only for submanifolds of hypersurface type. But even in these cases, fundamental questions concerning compactness, global regularity, etc., remain open. It has become clear that in order to address these questions, and to extend the theory to CR submanifolds that are not of hypersurface type, techniques of modern CR geometry will be crucial. CR functions and CR mappings arise naturally form the tangential Cauchy-Riemann operator, as functions in the kernel and as mappings that respect the CR structures (the basic object), respectively. A number of classical questions remain open in this very active area of research as well. By bringing together experts from these areas, the proposed workshop aims to initiate collaborations that will lead to substantial progress on these issues. <br/>In addition, a short course on complex Brunn-Minkowski theory will provide an introduction to an exciting new perspective on some of the ""classical"" techniques."

Roughly speaking, in harmonic analysis one investigates properties of functions and ""operators"" (i.e., mappings that transform one function into another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces, which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the pieces.  The name itself arose by analogy with the decomposition of a musical sound into its various frequency components (""harmonics""). Geometric measure theory involves the study of the relationship between geometric properties of sets, and their ""measures"" (the latter are generalizations of the notions of length, area, and volume). Partial differential equations and systems of elliptic type describe a wide variety of phenoma in the real world, including electrostatics, steady-state temperature distributions, and elastic deformations. A particular focus of the present project is to explore further the relationship between geometry and the behavior of solutions to these differential equations that arise in the physical world.<br/><br/>The project has two main areas of focus. First, the principal investigator plans to characterize quantitative rectifiability properties of a closed set E, of codimension one in d-dimensional Euclidean space, in terms of the  behavior of harmonic functions (and of solutions of linear and quasi-linear elliptic equations more generally) in the complement of E. In particular, a primary goal of the proposal is to prove theorems  of F. and M. Riesz type, and converses, without imposing any connectivity assumptions on either the set E or its complement. In the classical F. and M. Riesz Theorem, and its modern descendants, one obtains existence of, and in some cases quantitative estimates for, the Poisson kernel (i.e., the Radon-Nykodym derivative of harmonic measure for a domain D, with respect to arclength or surface measure on the boundary of D), as a consequence of rectifiability properties of the boundary. In the presence of suitable connectivity hypotheses, say when the set E is the boundary of a domain D enjoying an appropriate quantitative version of path connectedness, the geometry of E can be characterized in terms of the behavior of the Poisson kernel associated to D. On the other hand, a counterexample of Bishop and Jones precludes such results in the absence of connectivity. Thus, to prove theorems of F. and M. Riesz type without connectivity hypotheses will entail finding estimates for solutions of elliptic equations, estimates that serve as appropriate substitutes for Poisson kernel regularity. In the second area of focus of this project, the principal investigator plans to continue to investigate solvability of elliptic boundary value problems, in particular, the Neumann problem, for divergence form, second-order elliptic equations with ""radially""-independent coefficients in the half-space, without assuming self-adjointness of the coefficient matrix. Previous work of the principal investigaor and his coauthors has treated the Dirichlet and regularity problems in this setting."

For practical purposes it is extremely important to understand the behavior of the solutions of such equations. Even though it is often impossible to compute these solutions explicitly, a great deal of information can be garnered from quantitative estimates on their size, usually by means of inequalities. The purpose of this research is to obtain many new optimal inequalities related to fundamental equations in mathematics, physics, and geometry: from equations describing the curvature of a surface, to mean-field equations arising in vortex models for turbulent flows, and more. The estimates to be obtained are sharp (i.e., they cannot be improved), and they incorporate deep information about the underlying geometric and physical models. <br/><br/>In this project, the principal investigator seeks to find best constants  in several Adams, Moser-Trudinger, and Onofri inequalities in various settings, sharp asymptotics for fundamental solutions of differential and pseudodifferential operators, and optimal embeddings of Sobolev spaces in rearrangement invariant spaces.  On the Cauchy-Riemann sphere, sharp inequalities are to be obtained for rather general spectrally defined pseudodifferential operators, featuring best constants that depend explicitly on the eigenvalues. The method includes a new asymptotic analysis of the fundamental solutions of such operators. On Euclidean spaces, sharp inequalities will be obtained on domains of infinite measure, filling a twenty-five-year-old gap that was left since Adams's seminal work. The methods are new, and they are powerful enough to allow extensions to other noncompact settings such as the Heisenberg group and spaces endowed with hyperbolic metrics. Sharp Brezis-Merle-type inequalities and optimal embeddings are to be obtained on reduced Sobolev spaces of barely integrable functions. The method is based on a new theory of Adams-  and Orlicz-type inequalities on general measure spaces, for integral operators with slowly varying kernels."

Subfactors have numbers associated with them that can be used to parametrize possible physical theories. One such parameter is known as the ""statistical dimension."" It measures the complexity of what happens when particles in a system are changed amongst one another. If space-time is low dimensional this particle exchange is very subtle because particles have no room to go around each other. This causes the numbers associated to subfactors to be useful, as well, in the description of space-time itself. Such ideas are thought to provide possible architectures for quantum computing.<br/><br/>The project will focus on the following three main areas, all related to subfactors:<br/>(1) Advancing research in planar algebras. Bigelow's jellyfish technique is a close cousin of the Yang-Baxter equation. Generaliztions of this technique should allow one to push the classification of low-index subfactors to index 6 and possibly beyond.<br/>(2) Low-dimensional quantum field theory. Wassermann showed that the fusion operation in WZW conformal field theory can be interpreted as the Connes fusion of bimodules over algebras of local observables. This work will be extended most importantly by establishing the existence of a manifestly unitary version of Segal conformal field theory. <br/>(3) Continuum limits for arbitrary planar algebras. The principal investigator will study the question: Do all subfactors come from conformal field theories? He proposes a first naive approach to this question using the planar algebra picture. Letting the boundary points on the circle become dense is the continuum limit process in statistical mechanics."

First, the effect of domain geometry is investigated in terms of a relation between the volume growth of the underlying manifold and the decay of linear solutions. The implications of this relation for the nonlinear problem are then explored in certain tractable geometries, namely quotients of Euclidean spaces. Second, the question of small-data scattering (asymptotically linear behavior) for some weakly nonlinear dispersive equations is considered. These are equations where the nonlinearity is not of high enough degree for classical methods to succeed. One focus is on inhomogeneities represented by a potential term, and how this can affect the asymptotic behavior. Finally, the so-called weakly turbulent regime is investigated by studying the long-time behavior of the cubic NLS equation on a compact domain. In this context, a new continuum equation is derived for the envelope of the discrete Fourier modes by taking a suitable large-box limit in the spirit of weak turbulence theory. This equation turns out to enjoy remarkable symmetries and even explicit solutions, and can be used (via rigorous approximation results) to better understand the long-time frequency dynamics of the original NLS system.<br/><br/>The nonlinear dispersive equations considered in this project arise naturally in several areas of physics (plasma physics, nonlinear optics, general relativity, etc.) where they often serve as simplified effective models. In order for these models to be useful for engineering purposes as well, one has to understand the effect of inhomogeneities (usually modeled by a non-Euclidean domain geometry or a potential term) in making connections with the real world. Such a study would help set the parameters and limitations of not only the validity of the existing simplified models, but also the faithfulness of computer simulations (based on those models) in predicting experimental phenomena. On a more theoretical note, starting a mathematically rigorous study of the all-important physical theory of weak turbulence, as suggested in the proposal, represents a cross-disciplinary collaboration between pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and physics, with rewarding applications in plasma and fluid engineering, as well as ocean and atmospheric science."

This project is laying the groundwork both for the determination of these hidden structures and for analyzing specific situations arising in several applications. Among these is the embryonic development of the wing of a fruit fly and its newly discovered relation to current through potassium channels in the cell membrane.  Part of this project is to develop and use sophisticated mathematical techniques to understand that ionic current.  The fruit fly model has implications for mammalian development and may lead to an understanding of the cause of some serious birth defects. Applications of the abstract mathematical investigations also include understanding of other dynamical systems subject to random perturbations, including the density distribution in highly excited plasmas or the fine structure of an alloy and how defects are distributed and evolve in time.  <br/><br/>This project builds upon the past work of the principal investigators and others to establish the existence of coherent structures embedded in the phase space of complex dynamical systems, both finite- and infinite-dimensional and both deterministic or subject to random forcing.  The fundamental and abstract theory to be developed during the course of the project lies behind concrete and observed phenomena in the physical and biological sciences, particularly at the molecular, microscopic, or nano-scale.  Infinite-dimensional dynamical systems are required to represent the temporal and spatial fluctuations of quantities subject to physical laws or biochemical processes, such as the distribution of bone morphogenic protein in a developing embryonic fly wing, the current through an ion channel in a cell membrane, the density of a relativistic plasma, or the motion of microscopic defects in an alloy, to name just a few of the systems considered in this project.  Furthermore, as complex as these may be, stochastic perturbations must be considered due to thermal or other fluctuations in the environment and imprecise measurement of quantities at small scales.  While one cannot hope to give exact representations of all states subject to complex spatial and temporal interaction, one can sometimes glean information due to the presence of robust, but possibly hidden, structures such as invariant manifolds and their invariant foliations whose existence is implied by the laws governing the processes under investigation.  The goals of this project are to discover the conditions under which such structures exist, even when stochastically forced, and to examine the implications in the particular physical and biological systems underlying the equations."

These include the study of certain energy-conserving flows, in the plane or on a curved surface such as a sphere, that contain vortices-points on the surface around which the flow rotates.  A second project involves a model for nematic liquid crystals. These are rod-like molecules that behave in part like a liquid and in other ways like solid crystals. Recently there has been much activity in the materials science community aimed at designing liquid crystals to take on desirable material properties when deposited on a curved surface and the PI will explore how to adapt the known models for nematics to this relatively unexplored setting of liquid crystals on surfaces.  A final project concerns a geometric problem that stands as a paradigm for periodic pattern formation, that is for physical systems where one expects two different states of matter to be separated by interfaces that on the one hand tend to minimize interfacial surface area (like a soap bubble does) and on the other hand tend to develop patterns that replicate themselves on a small scale throughout a large sample.<br/><br/>This proposal concerns the study of nonlinear partial differential equations and variational problems drawn from continuum mechanics and related fields. These include the Gross-Pitaevskii system, the Landau-deGennes model for nematic liquid crystals and a nonlocal variant of the classic isoperimetric problem related to models for diblock co-polymers. The goal in these investigations is to describe the behavior of solutions to these systems in terms of lower-dimensional objects--vortices, defects or phase boundaries within appropriate asymptotic regimes for the parameters arising in the models. A major theme is to analyze how solutions to some of these models behave when posed on curved surfaces. These objects--vortices, defects or phase boundaries--largely characterize the state of the overall system. For the project on Gross-Pitaevskii, an additional purpose is to draw a deeper connection between this important nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the very well-studied point-vortex problem. The point-vortex problem is more commonly associated with incompressible Euler flow in the context of fluid mechanics but here, focusing on periodic solutions, we intend to strengthen a bridge to a setting in quantum mechanics. For the problem of nematics on surfaces, we hope to give rigorous mathematical support to the growing body of work by materials scientists studying liquid crystals deposited on curved surfaces. For the nonlocal isoperimetric problem our goal is in part to illuminate how fine scale periodic structures emerge as the strength of the nonlocality grows.  The methods to be employed in this program include a combination of constrained minimization techniques, Gamma-convergence and geometric measure theory. The educational component will include the involvement of doctoral students on many of the projects."

However, passing from the understanding of microscopic objects to moderately complex configurations remains a challenging problem. This projects aims at understanding simple but basic questions for slightly complicated systems, focusing on situations and models related to macroscopic plasma physics.  A plasma is a collection of many charged particles that, because of their long range interactions exhibit a collective macroscopic behavior which is complex and remains poorly understood. This in turns limits some potential major applications, controlled fusion being perhaps the most well-known. Thus, furthering the understanding of this ""small scale to large scale"" cascade of information can have major possible applications. The emphasis of this proposal is on large-time questions such as ""can a plasma macroscopically at rest spontaneously develop dramatic behavior such as high concentration or velocities, or spontaneously form a vacuum?"". Another related question is to find possible scenarios for the large-time behavior of a plasma that remains away from the quiet neutral equilibrium. Investigating these questions involve a fine study of the deep mechanisms of transfer of energy inside different parts of the plasma as a result of collective elementary simple interactions.<br/><br/>This projects aims at developing the study of two fundamental equations from physics. First we consider stability issues for the 2-fluid Euler-Maxwell equation in two dimensions. This is a fundamental equation modeling the dynamical properties of a plasma. The goal is to prove that under certain conditions, small perturbations of an equilibrium will not develop shocks and that actually, the plasma will get back to equilibrium, even in the absence of dissipation. Such a result would be of great physical and mathematical importance as it is known to be false for the compressible Euler equation in the absence of a self-consistent electromagnetic field. In a second part, we study the Schroedinger equation on a curved background.  This equation is a universal model appearing in many time reversible equations, notably in some plasma models. When this equation is posed on a nonconstant background, many classical tools from the Euclidian theory break down and one expects the appearance of various new phenomena due to the influence of the geometry. We study in particular the effect of the growth of the volume on the global behavior of the solutions and on the possibility to obtain asymptotic dynamics different from scattering. A unifying theme is to understand the asymptotic dynamics of solutions in a context where the dispersion is limited. Another unifying theme is to try to find simpler limit equations and understand their significance for the full model. A last unifying theme concerns the specificity and relevance of dispersive systems. Some tools we plan to use and develop are concentration compactness methods, study of the space and time resonances, study of dispersive systems and pseudo-products estimates with singular multipliers."

Black holes loom large in the imagination as mysterious regions of space in which the force of gravity is so enormous that nothing, including light, can escape. However, black holes are mathematical constructs, first discovered as explicit solutions of the Einstein field equations that lie at the foundation of General Relativity. The best known family of such solutions, discovered by the applied mathematician R. Kerr, depends on two parameters. It was only later that physicists were able to relate some remarkable astrophysical objects, such as quasars, to these remarkable Kerr solutions. Yet, by definition, black holes cannot be detected by direct observation, and the claim that quasars are associated with massive black holes is based on indirect observations deemed consistent with the specific mathematical properties of the black hole solutions. This project investigates three fundamental questions concerning the mathematical theory of black holes, intimately tied to the issue of whether black holes can be real physical objects. They are the questions of rigidity, stability, and collapse. Stability, for example, concerns the question whether small perturbations of the Kerr solutions can grow arbitrarily large. If this were the case it would follow that the Kerr solutions are mathematical artifacts, with no physical reality. It has been conjectured that the Kerr solutions are stable, but despite some very important advances made recently by mathematicians using innovative partial differential equation methods, the problem remains wide open. The rigidity conjecture asserts that the Kerr family of solutions exhausts all possible stationary solutions of the Einstein field equations in vacuum, while the problem of collapse refers to the question of whether black holes can form in time, naturally, from configurations free of such objects. <br/><br/>The project focuses on some of the most important nonlinear hyperbolic equations of mathematical physics. Its main part concerns three related problems in General Relativity at the heart of the theory of black holes: Uniqueness and stability of the Kerr solutions, and formation of black holes. It provides a specific strategy for making progress on the problem of non-linear stability for axially symmetric perturbations of Kerr spacetimes with small angular momentum. In addition, building on recent work on the resolution of the ""Bounded Curvature Conjecture"", the PI intends to continue the search for a scale invariant criterion for well-posedness, i.e., a scale invariant criterion that insures local existence and uniqueness of solutions. This is an important goal not just within General Relativity but for any of the basic hyperbolic equations, in fluids, elasticity, or relativity. The problems under study require new geometric and analytic ideas as well as the development of new techniques."

The first major objective to be addressed is to resolve the question of whether the simplest examples of black holes are indeed stable objects as observed from the outside. If they are not, then much of our astrophysical world-picture will need to be revised. The second major objective concerns understanding what generic black holes look like from the inside. It has long been expected that observers entering black hole regions eventually encounter ""ferocious singularities"", where the very structure of spacetime breaks down. The project will strive to show, based in part on previous work of the proposer, that a portion of this singularity is not as ""ferocious"" as previously thought. Both the above objectives can be formulated as conjectures in pure mathematics concerning the governing equations of general relativity, the celebrated Einstein equations, and thus can be addressed by modern techniques of mathematical analysis. This project will thus contribute to this long tradition of rigorous mathematics making fundamental statements about our physical world. The subject of black holes and spacetime singularities has inspired the popular imagination well beyond the confines of the scientific community, and work on this proposal will strengthen the ties between scientific research and the general public.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the first objective of the proposal concerns the dynamic stability of the Kerr metrics, a two parameter family of explicit solutions to the celebrated Einstein equations that represent the simplest black hole solutions. A series of projects is outlined, of increasing difficulty, culminating in a complete resolution of the Kerr stability conjecture in the fully nonlinear setting, the statement that small perturbations of Kerr initial states stay close to the Kerr family in the black hole exterior and asymptote back to it as time goes to infinity. The second major objective of this proposal concerns the analysis of black hole interiors. The original expectation was that generic black holes would terminate in a spacelike singular boundary where the geometry of spacetime is completely destroyed. Previous work of the proposer in a spherically symmetric toy problem, itself based on previous numerical work in the physics literature, showed that singularities do indeed occur, but that (at least) a portion of the singular boundary is null, not spacelike, and far less ""singular"" than expected. Through a series of projects of increasing complexity, this proposal aims to definitively resolve this question, now not for a toy model, but for the vacuum Einstein equations themselves, without any symmetry assumptions. In addition to resolving well-known fundamental conjectures about this venerable set of equations, this project strives to introduce new techniques of mathematical analysis which have the potential to influence more general developments in the hyperbolic partial differential equations governing classical physics."

For instance, one might find the optimal configuration of robots in a factory by studying the ""space"" of all such configurations of robots, as the geometry of the latter can lend insight as to which particular configurations are problematic in a given situation (such as when robotic arms might jam or interfere with each other).  Such ""spaces"" of geometric structures are called moduli spaces. The investigator's project is dedicated to a study of moduli spaces of surfaces, a key feature of the work being the interaction of geometry and algebra in the study of moduli. Some of this work will be conducted with the assistance of graduate students. The investigator will develop a graduate topics course in moduli spaces to stimulate interaction between students working in geometry and topology and those working in algebra. The investigator will also run biennial workshops designed to foster the upward professional development of graduate and undergraduate students working in fields related to moduli as well as to stimulate interaction across barriers between these disciplines.<br/><br/>The investigator will study the moduli of Riemann surfaces.  The proposed research naturally falls into three projects.  The first is concerned with profinite aspects of mapping class groups of surfaces. In particular, the investigator will further develop profinite Teichmueller theory as initiated by Boggi, and will also pursue a study of centralizers in profinite completions of mapping class groups.  The second project concerns the geometry of surface bundles and their relation to topology and algebra.  In particular, the investigator will study distinctions between a number of geometric properties of subgroups of mapping class groups in analogy with more classical work in Kleinian groups, and will also continue a search for atoroidal surfaces bundles over surfaces.  The third portion of the proposed work is dedicated to a study of the deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  In particular, the investigator will continue study of certain analytic functions between Teichmuller spaces introduced by Thurston in his approach to his Geometrization conjecture, which come to bear on problems related to making Geometrization effective, as well as toward understanding certain pathology in the study of general deformation spaces of 3-manifolds."

The work on this project involves mathematics from apparently disparate mathematical disciplines, such as combinatorics and probability. More specifically, it engages various newer probabilistic concepts that are appropriate for a noncommutative setting. The principal investigator will involve both graduate and undergraduate students in this research. Indeed, some of the combinatorial problems can be formulated in a sufficiently elementary manner as to be accessible without too much technical background. (Previous work with undergraduate students did result in published material.)<br/><br/>The concrete problems in this proposal fall into several categories. The first one concerns the Littlewood-Richardson rule from combinatorics and representation theory. It is hoped that appropriate formulations of this rule will be found that apply to the study of sums and products of compact operators and elements of finite von Neumann algebras. The second category is connected with the free probability theory introduced by Voiculescu. Here the problems revolve around the addition problem for collections of free random variables and its applications to random matrices (e.g., the study of outlying eigenvalues resulting from perturbations). The third category consists of several somewhat loosely connected problems from single operator theory or the closely related non-selfadjoint algebras they generate. The problems range from structure theory for commuting isometries to questions about hyper-reflexivity, invariant subspaces, and numerical ranges. (As far as applications are concerned, the second category of problems has connections to communications theory, while single operator theory is a valuable tool in control theory. These applications are not the focus of the proposed research, but earlier work of the principal investigator has had impact in applied areas.)"

A non-smooth domain refers to a domain with either isolated singularities or a Lipschitz domain. While elliptic boundary value problems for the Laplacian have been well understood for over twenty years, the theory for second order elliptic systems and higher order elliptic equations is incomplete. Another generalization of the classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems that is not yet fully understood is the mixed boundary value problem. This project addresses open problems that are categorized by the following research themes:  boundary value problems for higher order elliptic operators; the spectral radius conjecture on Besov spaces; well-posedness of the mixed problem in Lipschitz domains. <br/><br/> <br/>This mathematics research project is motivated by problems that naturally arise in mathematical physics and engineering. In this regard, the non-smooth setting in which the problems are posed is fundamental since most realistic physical models involve irregular domains. For example, boundary value problems for higher order elliptic operators have applications to engineering in the context of modeling shallow shells, beam bending, and clamped plates. Mixed boundary value problems model the behavior of several physical quantities such as the temperature in a metallurgical melting process, the thermo-elastic potential of an elastic solid punched or stamped by a heated object, or the seepage through a porous material. This mathematics research project will contribute to the aforementioned disciplines as well as produce new mathematical techniques.  While pursuing the research directions outlined above, Ott will initiate activities aimed at increasing the participation of women and other under-represented groups in mathematics. These activities will include outreach activities with local middle and high schools, and research and networking opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students."

Often these waves exhibit resonant interactions, i.e., interactions of waves that oscillate at the same frequency.   Resonant interactions are of paramount importance in the long-time behavior of the waves present in the relevant physical system.  Resonances can cause the wave amplitude to grow or can lead to  genuine nonlinear behavior of solutions. It quantifies   the long-time effects of the nonlinearities present in the problem. In addition to resonance, dispersion (waves moving into different parts of space) plays a central role in the long-time behavior of solutions.  Dispersion often tames the effects of resonances by pushing resonant waves into different regions in space. It provides a mechanism to control the amplitude of resonant waves.  Thus, together with dispersion, resonances form the backbone of the analytical tools which have been developed to study stability of nonlinear waves. The development of the space-time resonance method is a corner stone in such an endeavor. It brings existing methods together in a new setting that extends their applicability far beyond what was previously possible. This method is still in development and has been extended far beyond its initial inception. Nevertheless, there is lots of progress that needs to be made.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with the study of propagation, interaction, and asymptotic behavior of small amplitude nonlinear waves.   The PI proposes  to study  the asymptotic behavior of  small solutions of  four  dispersive and hyperbolic problems.  The aim of the research is to develop new methods to determine the asymptotic behavior of such solutions.  The PI, in collaboration with others,  plans to consider problems when either  the energy or decay estimates are weak, i.e., non-integrable, or when  the nonlinearity is resonant. One should note here that  there are techniques  which  have  already  been developed to deal with resonant nonlinearity, and  although these techniques should prove to be very useful for the proposed research,  new methods  need to  be  developed to deal with additional difficulties.  The problems that the PI will investigate are 1)  the   Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system; 2) Gravity-Capillary Surface Waves; 3)  the asymptotic behavior of solutions to systems where the nonlinearities cause long-range effects. In addition to these projects, the PI will investigate  resonant dynamics and infinite volume approximation, where the final goal is to  derive a reduced system of equations for the effective dynamics of gravity waves in a 2-dimensional fluid on a large domain of size. The question that the PI wants  to address can be roughly stated as follows:  Given a system whose domain is a large box of size and with periodic boundary conditions, is there a simple system of equations that describe the dynamics of small solutions for a very long time? The time is, of course, assumed to be longer than what it takes for  a wave packet  to reach the boundary of the box. Solutions to  the proposed problems will require the development of new methods and techniques and the refinement of existing ones."

The research plan is as follows: 1) Construct  q-hypergeometric solutions of the equivariant quantum differential equation for the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety. 2) Identify the quantum cohomology algebra of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with the algebra of functions on the critical set of the associated hypergeometric (or q-hypergeometric) master function. Identify the elliptic Bethe algebra with the algebra of functions on the critical set of the corresponding elliptic master function; develop relations with an elliptic Schubert calculus. Identify the XXX Bethe algebra with the algebra of functions on the intersection of suitably deformed Schubert varieties. 3) Find a potential for a KZ-type connection and a Frobenius-like structure on the base of the KZ-type connection. 4) Develop a relation between the critical set of master functions associated with an affine Lie algebra and classical integrable hierarchies associated with that Lie algebra. Develop a correspondence between populations of critical points of master functions associated with a tensor product of irreducible modules over a simple Lie algebra and the decomposition of the tensor product into irreducibles. 5) In terms of discriminantal arrangements develop a geometric realization of the BGG resolution of an irreducible module over a simple Lie algebra."

The main goal is to discover new underlying principles and generic methods to understand the properties of  solutions of these nonlinear PDEs. One of the main objects of this proposed research is a class of non convex Hamilton--Jacobi equations, which are  the fundamental equations for  two-person, zero-sum differential games. Achieving deeper properties of their solutions (singular structures of the gradients, large time average, and so forth) will help a lot  in the design of fast numerical methods to approximate the solutions accurately and in the design of optimal strategies for the players in the games.<br/><br/>The proposed projects are to (i) continue developing a new approach to obtain large time behavior of solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations and related problems, (ii) discover game theory interpretation and dynamical properties of solutions of some weakly coupled systems, (iii) study homogenization of some Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and (iv) obtain a PDE approach to study asymptotic limit for the Langevin equation with vanishing friction coefficient. The topics consist of widely different nonlinear problems but they all satisfy maximum principle and hence admit viscosity solutions. The Crandall-Lions theory of viscosity solutions has been developed extensively in the last thirty years including the existence, uniqueness, stability of the solutions as well as some connections to differential games, front propagations, homogenization theory, optimal control, and weak KAM theory. However, many interesting properties of viscosity solutions, such as regularity, dynamical properties, gradient shock structure, and game theory interpretation of solutions, are still far from being well understood. The PI proposes to develop some new approaches to study (i)-(iv), which are expected to bring new perspective and insights to the field of viscosity solutions. The mathematical tools to be used for (i)-(iv) are composed by techniques from the nonlinear adjoint method (duality method), dynamical system, level set method, optimal control theory, and game theory."

Hyperbolic dynamical systems are those which display chaotic, unpredictable features at every point;  they are both naturally occurring and well-studied.  There are other dynamical systems called KAM systems (named after Kolomogorov, Arnold, and Moser), which have stable regions of regular motion.  Partially hyperbolic systems provide a more general class of dynamical systems than either, and include systems that combine hyperbolicity in some directions with KAM behavior in other directions.  Partially hyperbolic systems occur widely in dynamical systems arising in physics; for example planetary motion usually contains partially hyperbolic subdynamics, and the effective construction of particle accelerators (used in biological imaging, as well as theoretical physics) requires a detailed understanding of both KAM and partially hyperbolic dynamics. The PI has a well-developed research plan of over 15 years studying partially hyperbolic systems and is poised to raise the theory of these systems to a new level of generality and applicability. The impacts of this research will be seen in future applications to systems  in biology, physics and engineering.  The PI is currently collaborating with the particle accelerator group at Fermilab to explore some of these potential applications.<br/><br/><br/>The research supported by this grant is guided by the far-reaching goal of developing a general theory of partially hyperbolic systems along the lines of the hyperbolic theory developed in the past 40 years. In particular the PI proposes to study: ergodic properties of conservative partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms; physical measures for (dissipative) partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms; rigidity phenomena connected to partially hyperbolic group actions; and ergodicty of singular partially hyperbolic systems.  These research goals will be carried out through a variety of modalities, including published papers in peer-reviewed journals, supervising Ph.D. students, and public speaking, both at research conferences and to the general public."

A variety of measures involving members of the analysis group is intended to attract students on all levels to mathematics and possibly to the area of analysis. The goal is to secure a ""pipeline""  of suitable candidates who want to learn advanced mathematical concepts and help them to be successful with this quest.

It has led to many spectacular applications in science and engineering. By now analytic tools are ubiquitous in all areas of investigation based on quantitative reasoning. Many of the more prominent recent advances within mathematics itself rely heavily on sophisticated analytic methods. Examples are Perelman's solution of Thurston's geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds, the work by Lawler-Schramm-Werner on the stochastic Loewner equation and its applications for random processes, or the investigations by Tao-Vu on universality laws in random matrix theory. Today analysis is a vibrant area of mathematical investigation with a wide range of applications. The analysis group in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA includes many distinguished researchers and has a high standing in comparative rankings. Its members have a broad range of research interests including operator algebras, partial differential equations, complex analysis, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, probability, and analytic number theory. In addition to the strength of its researchers,  the analysis group has a long and successful history of training mathematicians.

Evolution by mean curvature has been studied for decades as a natural model for evolving surface interfaces.  Ricci flow describes an evolving geometry, and was used in Perelman's solution of the Poincare conjecture.  The primary objective of the proposed research on these equations is to study singularities and show that they have a very special form.  Another component of the research program is an investigation of spaces which have a self-similar or fractal character, using analytic tools that have been developed in the last few years.  Here one of the goals is to deform the space into an optimal form, if possible, in order to reveal hidden symmetries,  and otherwise show that no hidden symmetries exist.  This is very useful for understanding the asymptotic shape of infinite groups, and is part of confluence of several research trends over the last 10-15 years.  Another application of similar ideas is to  embedding problems in theoretical computer science: Cheeger, Naor,  and the PI were able to substantially improve the previous best known results on the embedding of spaces of negative type, in connection with the quantitative version of the Goemans-Linial conjecture.<br/><br/>The proposed research is in geometric evolution equations, embedding problems, analysis on metric spaces, and geometric group theory.  The evolution equations in the proposal are mean curvature flow and Ricci flow.  The proposed research in analysis on metric spaces clusters in three areas: (1) bilipschitz embedding problems and related issues, (2) the structure of spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, (3) the structure of boundaries of Gromov hyperbolic spaces.  Common themes in all three areas are spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, and rescaling arguments leading to singular limit spaces."

Fundamental physical laws are often expressed through the principle that a system minimizes or maximizes (that is, extremizes) some quantity. Light rays, for instance, follow paths that minimize travel time through media with varying indices of refraction. Systems minimize various actions or energies. Other physical laws are encoded in partial differential equations. Mathematical analysis provides tools that can be used to understand both such differential equations, and the extremization of many types of functionals. This project is concerned with development of techniques for the analysis of functions and sets that extremize, or nearly extremize, inequalities that are closely tied to the underlying algebraic and geometric structures of classical (nonrelativistic) physical space. Characterization of near-extremizers provides a more robust understanding of exact extremizers, which takes into account small imperfections and perturbations. Among the inequalities to be studied are some of the most fundamental and widely used inequalities of mathematical analysis, including inequalities governing the Fourier transform, convolutions, and sums of sets in Euclidean space. Each of these inequalities is multilinear, involving products or other pairwise interactions, or has underlying multilinear aspects. Multilinear functionals lie on the frontier between linear and fully nonlinear phenomena. Other multilinear inequalities will also be investigated as part of this project, including variants of the Fourier transform. <br/><br/>Fundamental multilinear inequalities in Lebesgue space and related norms will be investigated. Prototypes include inequalities of Riesz-Sobolev (concerning integrals over symmetrizations of sets), Brunn-Minkowski (concerning sums of sets), Hausdorff-Young (concerning the Fourier transform) and Young (concerning convolutions).  In a major part of the project, attention will focus on the nature and quantitative properties of  functions and sets that nearly, but not exactly, extremize such inequalities. This will establish more robust versions of existing characterizations of exact extremizers. Methodology for establishing compactness for extremizing sequences, based on additive combinatorial considerations rather than on concentration, will be developed. These tools include characterizations of sets with small sumsets, of sets with sumsets of moderately large but controlled size, and of sets with large additive energies. Refined inequalities will be formulated and established,  incorporating second terms measuring structure, rather than size.  Arithmetic progressions, intervals, ellipsoids, convex sets, and Gaussian functions will provide the context for such measurement. An improved understanding of the interplay between approximate group structure and near extremality in affine-invariant multilinear inequalities is a primary goal. The principal investigator will also apply discrete multilinear inequalities to computer science.  Rigorous lower bounds for  communication between elements of memory hierarchies will be proved, and methods for computing  these bounds will be devised.  Other research problems to be investigated include an inverse problem concerning the off-diagonal behavior of Bergman kernels associated to high powers of positive complex line bundles,inequalities for multilinear oscillatory integral operators related to the Hausdorff-Young inequality,and a possible characterization of equality in a class of multilinear inequalities previously analyzed by Holder, Rogers, Riesz, Sobolev, and Brascamp-Lieb-Luttinger."

It is both an area of pure mathematics and a subject that lies at the crossroads of multiple scientific disciplines. As an area of pure mathematics, it seeks to develop rigorous theories and techniques that are applicable to general processes, addressing foundational issues of stability and chaos. As a partner with the sciences, it offers qualitative theories and viewpoints, and can be a powerful tool when used in conjunction with numerical computations. While both aspects of dynamical systems are worthy in their own right, there often is a gap that lies between theory and applications. The proposed research has both purely theoretical and application oriented components, one of its goals being the cross-fertilization of ideas. This research will: (1) lead to significant broadening of the scope of dynamical systems theory, (2) strengthen connections between dynamical systems and other areas of mathematics, such as probability and partial differential equations, and (3) build connections between mathematics and statistical physics and theoretical neuroscience. <br/><br/>In this proposal there are four specific research projects are presented. One proposes to extend hyperbolic theory (or the theory of chaotic dynamical systems) from finite to infinite dimensions, so that an enlarged theory will be applicable not just to ordinary differential equations but also to large classes of partial differential equations. A second project proposes to extend current techniques for analyzing chaotic dynamics, which often exhibit Gaussian type fluctuations, to systems that produce heavy-tailed statistics. Though well recognized as  a hallmark of complex processes, few analytical studies of such dynamical processes have been carried out. A third project seeks to provide rigorous justification for certain fundamental phenomenology in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, such as the idea of local thermal equilibrium in steady states dynamics. The fourth and final project proposes numerical and analytical studies of phenomena identified in previous computational models of neuroscience, specifically in models of visual cortex. Providing scientific training for young researchers is a very important part of the proposed activity.

In these settings, it is possible to phrase the questions addressed by this project using the language of probability theory, but the methods required are of a different nature and vary according to the application, coming from the theory of dynamical systems. The PI has already successfully achieved several results on these topics, and has been active in the fast-advancing interplay between dynamics and number theory.<br/><br/><br/>The PI plans to study the statistical properties of deterministic processes of number theoretical origin such as Weyl exponential sums, multiplicative arithmetic functions, and continued fraction expansions.

It should be stressed that sometimes the limiting distributions agree with the classical ones of probability theory (which means that the deterministic phenomenon of interest is a good stochastic proxy); on the other hand, often one gets non-standard distributions. This means that the classical probabilistic methods cannot be applied and the theory requires new ideas and tools. The main methods in this project are of dynamical nature, such as equidistribution of one-parameter flows in homogeneous spaces, Ratner theory, and spectral methods. The PI has already successfully achieved several results on the topics, and has been active in the fast-advancing interplay between dynamics and number theory.

On the one hand, the physical relevance and the validity of these ideal models are established through the comparison between the results from theoretical analysis and the experimental observations. On the other hand, once the meaningfulness of a mathematical model is supported by available experimental data to certain extent, the theoretical studies on these ideal models can provide properties of the original physical problems that are hard to be obtained through experiments. For physical systems involving temporal evolution, of particular interests are those structural and asymptotic properties. These include some special structures, such as steady states, periodic and quasi-periodic orbits, chaotic orbits etc, and their qualitative properties like stability etc. In general, on the one hand, only stable states are physically observable in a system, while the ideal, but unstable, states are hardly observed due to their extremely sensitive dependence on the parameters. On the other hand, unstable states are also very important, partly due to the fact that they and some of their associated structures serve as the boundaries separating different collections of stable states in a system. In this project, the PI plans to focus on the local dynamics near steady states in several classical nonlinear partial differential equation systems, which all belong to the general category of nonlinear waves. The lack of a priori damping and the complicated nonlinearity pose most of the challenges in their mathematical analysis. <br/><br/>More specifically, the PI proposes to study rigorously the local dynamics of the following partial differential equation systems. The first one is the incompressible Euler equation, which models non-viscous and incompressible fluids like water. The proposed problems include fluids in rigid containers and fluids with free surfaces like ocean waves. The second partial differential equation in the proposal is the Vlasov-Poisson system that models the collisionless plasma, which consists of particles with both velocity and electrical charge. The third one is the quasi-linear waves equation. Even though there have been extensive research on these systems and many important progresses have been made in recent year, due to their very nonlinear nature, many issues including some fundamental ones are still not well understood after years of efforts. The PI plans to focus on their local dynamic structures near equillibria, including stability/instability, local invariant manifolds, special solutions and bifurcations. While these aspects are standard notions in the theory of smooth dynamical systems, due to the highly nonlinear nature of these partial differential equations, their solution maps often do not have sufficient smoothness in phase spaces for the classical theory to apply directly. In contrast to ordinary differential equations, the relationship between the qualitative structures and the regularity analysis of these nonlinear partial differential equations is an essential analytical aspect of nonlinear partial differential equation dynamics. Solving and understanding these problems, expected to be largely based on their specific mechanical and geometric structures, would result in substantial theoretical advances in these areas and possibly lead to the discovery of new physical and mathematical phenomena in the corresponding systems."

Realizing this, the PI  has recently begun teaching what is called Advanced Engineering Mathematics. Teaching this material shows in a precise sense how the proposed research develops higher dimensional analogues of fundamental mathematics currently used throughout physics and engineering. In addition to the mathematical research, the PI will also work with the Engineering College at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on fine-tuning the curriculum in Advanced Engineering Mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>Hermitian analysis has its roots in 19th century mathematics. The subject began, two centuries ago,  with the work of Fourier on heat diffusion.It has developed using the theory of Hilbert spaces, by its applications to quantum mechanics, and via its role in signal processing. Modern Hermitian analysis both relies upon and informs complex analysis and CR geometry, the PI's primary research areas. The modern point of view emphasizes the tools of orthonormal expansion and orthogonal projection. The PI has introduced an algebraic technique called orthogonal homogenization which connects these ideas to the geometry of proper mappings between balls. The PI has reformulated one of his older results, on volumes of proper images of balls, as a variational problem, thereby extending the results to considerably more general situations.  The PI's work on proper mappings between balls in different dimensional complex spaces has also uncovered unexpected connections to representation theory and algebraic combinatorics. The primary purposes of this research are to extend the ideas of orthogonal homogenization to the rational case, to establish additional variational inequalities, to study homotopy for proper holomorphic mappings of positive codimension,  and to further develop the subject of CR complexity. In the process the PI will continue to mentor young mathematicians in these topics and to organize and attend conferences."

Integro-differential equations are equations which involve both integrals and derivatives. They arise from models such as in diffusion with long range interactions in physics, future options in mathematical finance, and population dynamics in social science. They also appear intrinsically in geometry. One main goal of the proposal is to study fine analysis of a particular family of integro-differential equations, which will be applied to understand a number of scientific phenomena in geometry and physics. Another main goal is to develop general mathematical theories on integro-differential equations for their wide usage in future. Other than its applications, the analysis itself for those equations is of independent interest. It not only extends the current theories of partial differential equations, but also gives new insights and creates new methods of establishing them.<br/> <br/><br/>This proposal focuses on regularity and singularity of solutions of nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. The PI proposes to develop a unified approach to study existence and compactness of solutions to a family of prescribed fractional order curvature problems in conformal geometry. The investigation of their singular solutions will not only develop further the fractional singular Yamabe problem, but also lead naturally to boundary reaction-diffusion equations which appear as models of dislocations in crystals and soft thin films in micromagnetism. The study on regularity of fully nonlinear integro-differential equations, which usually arise from stochastic control problems with purely jump Levy process, will enrich the existing general regularity theory. The proposed research on Monge-Ampere equations is motivated by Monge-Ampere metrics on affine manifolds with singularities. Its goal is to address the regularity and analyze the behavior of solutions of such equations with singularities, and to understand their connections to differential geometry."

The study of C*-algebras is a study of some special algebraic systems. These algebraic systems are systems of square matrices, possibly of infinite size. C*-algebras have a strong presence in many diverse fields of science and mathematics such as dynamical systems, noncommutative geometry, and quantum mechanics, to name just a few. C*-algebras are very complicated mathematical objects that usually exist in infinitely many dimensions. What ""classification"" does is to allow one to learn the identity and structure of a C*-algebra from relatively small amounts of fairly simple numerical data, analogous to the way in which fingerprints are used to identify an individual. In applications, C*-algebras arise in many areas and often appear in disguise, so it is of great advantage to use limited numerical data to determine their structure. The present project aims to classify the largest class of C*-algebras considered thus far, including algebras that are particularly important in many applications.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to obtain a broad classification result for amenable C*-algebras. Part of the strategy is to create new technical tools to facilitate the interaction between the C*-algebra and its invariants. One of these tools is an enhancement of the Basic Homotopy Lemma and another is a K-theoretic characterization of asymptotic unitary equivalence.  Another important objective is to verify that certain commonly appearing C*-algebras actually do belong to our classifiable class. This research will therefore greatly simplify the way in which the theory of C*-algebras is applied. It is worth noting one application, namely, to noncommutative homotopy theory and the study of dynamical systems. The principal investigator will use this broad classification theory to study a new relation among minimal homeomorphisms on a compact metric space, a relation known as asymptotic conjugacy, and to characterize it by means of K-theoretical data."

The field of quantum information (QI) explores the theoretical, experimental, and technological areas covering the use and implications of quantum mechanics for communication and computation purposes.  While conceptually all of the diverse aspects that QI encompasses arise from the seemingly simple appreciation of information as a physical resource, its consequences have the potential to revolutionize computation, communication, and ideas about complexity. In particular, QI promises exponentially more efficient quantum algorithms for solving hard combinatorial problems and for simulating the behavior of complex quantum systems, along with unprecedented opportunities for secure communication and new perspectives to tackle a range of problems in physics, biology, applied mathematics, engineering, and computer sciences. As a result, QI is currently a thriving and naturally interdisciplinary research area, and one of critical strategic relevance to 21st century's science and technology. <br/><br/>As the QI field is entering a new stage of maturity, further progress is increasingly relying on the use of diverse advanced mathematical techniques. In turn, new areas of mathematics are being identified, which offer the potential for major future advances in the field. This award supports a one-and-a-half-day conference that brings together leading researchers working across a broad spectrum of problems in QI theory, with the goals of (i) highlighting the centrality and importance of mathematical tools; and (ii) assessing outstanding mathematical challenges and formulating a vision for the future. A distinguished group of speakers will highlight the latest research developments and open problems in topics, including quantum channels and quantum error correction theory, quantum marginals, random quantum states and dynamics, many-body quantum systems, and quantum control. Panel discussions and breakout sessions are intended to identify new promising directions for investigations. The expected broad impacts of the proposed conference are twofold. On the one hand, the conference facilitates collaborative exploration between academic and federal agency scientists of the short- to mid-term mathematical challenges in advancing the field of QI -- with a written report being anticipated as an output of the conference. On the other hand, the conference serves as a vehicle to enlist mathematically-oriented scientists to bring their ideas to bear on accessible fundamental problems in QI, and to educate the next generation of scientists working in this very important field."

Random matrices have since become a major research area with connections to mathematical physics, probability theory, number theory, numerical analysis, and orthogonal polynomials. Indeed, there is a well known anecdote about an interaction in the early 1970's between the physicist Freeman Dyson, and number theorist Hugh Montgomery, at Princeton, where their discussions led to the realization that there is a link between random matrices and the Riemann Zeta function of number theory. The PI's focus is on ""universal"" behavior of these random matrices: certain features seem to be independent of almost any underlying assumption, and consequently hold very generally. This has been known for a long time, and has been explored by both mathematical physicists and pure mathematicians. The techniques that have been developed to study this ""universality"" have been useful in many other areas of mathematics. This proposal will develop appropriate tools from orthogonal polynomials and classical analysis, and use these to establish ""universal"" features in as great a generality as possible. There will be also be an educational component to the project, involving  collaboration with other researchers, organization of conferences, editorial duties, and supervision of undergraduate and/or graduate students.<br/><br/>The specific goals of the project include investigating the ramifications and generalizations of a variational property recently established by the PI. It is hoped that this will enable one to establish universality limits for Hermitian ensembles under minimal conditions on measures with compact support, and also for varying measures. Monotonicity in the measure, and techniques of orthogonal polynomials are key tools in this approach. Somewhat more ambitious is the goal of extending the variational principle to beta-ensembles. This will include  asymptotics of generalized Christoffel functions involving alternating polynomials in several variables. Discrete analogues will also be studied. Another major goal is developing the theory of Dirichlet orthogonal polynomials, and investigating their application to the Lindelof hypothesis for the Riemann Zeta function. Additional goals include investigating biorthogonal polynomials, and related numerical quadratures; orthogonal polynomials on curves in the plane, and Pade approximations."

The settings for these problems involve geometric manifolds of dimension two or more.  Associated to a given manifold are fundamental objects called eigenfunctions.  These are the fundamental modes of vibration of the manifold, and they are the higher dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions for the circle.  Designers of musical instruments are well aware that the shape of, say, a drum or the soundboard of stringed instrument affects the basic tones that it omits.  Similar phenomena arise for manifolds, and we wish to study precisely how their shapes, such as how they are curved, affect the resulting eigenfunctions.  Just as in music, one particularly expects different shapes and geometries to become more apparent in the behavior of the fundamental modes of vibration as the frequency becomes larger and larger.  These eigenfunctions are solutions of a differential equation that is similar to the wave equation, and the project will also study similar problems involving it.  The general theme is to study how solutions of wave equations are affected by their physical backgrounds, such as whether or not black holes are present or whether the background becomes very close to a vacuum near infinity.<br/><br/>Among the specific problems in the project, the principal investigator desires to obtain improved estimates for the nodal sets (zero sets) of eigenfunctions.  There is a conjecture of Yau asserting that the size of this codimension-one set should be comparable to its frequency.  Although it has been fully settled in the real analytic setting, less is known for smooth manifolds.  The principal investigator has already shown that there are connections between this problem and Lebesgue space estimates for eigenfunctions that can detect certain types of  concentration.   Several problems in the project involve developing this active field.  The principal investigator would also like to obtain improved bounds for so-called period integrals of eigenfunctions under the assumption of negative curvature.  This assumption is known to be necessary, and the problem measures the random cancellation of eigenfunctions along geodesics.  There are connections with this problem and analytic number theory, but to date the results that the principal investigator has recently obtained using harmonic analysis are the best known.  He would like to combine them with number theory techniques to try to obtain improved bounds.  There are connections between these problems and other problems that the project will study involving estimates for wave equations (""Strichartz estimates"") and microlocal analysis, especially propagation of singularities."

The purpose of mathematical modeling is to study admittedly simpler versions of what one sees in nature and extract exact results which could help explain, and sometimes predict, events in the real world. There are ""nonequlibrium processes"", in which the system is evolving, and ""equlibrium processes""  which model the behavior of the system after it has settled down. This project studies one of each, the ""Ising model"" (an equlibrium process) and the ""asymmetric simple exclusion process"" (a nonequlibrium process). The first is the simplest (although still quite complicated) description of ferromagnetism. It is the two-dimensional model that is studied, in particular its thermodynamic properties (in which the number of particles gets infinitely large). Magnetism and magnetic materials are pervasive throughout technology, so it is important to achieve exact mathematical results for them.  The asymmetric simple exclusion process is the simplest model of phenomena in which particles interact with each other. Precisely, no two can occupy the same site at the same time. The model has far-ranging applications in nonequilibrium statistical physics, engineering, and biological systems. The one-dimensional case is what is studied (think of electrons flowing in a wire). Theoretical results of the principal investigator and collaborator have been confirmed by recent experiment. This project will result in a deeper understanding of this process and related random models in statistical physics.<br/><br/>The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is one of the simplest, nontrivial stochastic models in which to study transport phenomena as it models processes far from equilibrium. ASEP is closely related, in a certain scaling limit, to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation that is expected to describe a large class of stochastically growing interfaces. Recent work by Sasamoto, Spohn, Amir, Corwin and Quastel, using results of Tracy and the PI, have rigorously established this link between ASEP and the KPZ equation. This project builds on the work of Tracy and the PI and involves: (i) the rigorous operator-theoretic underpinnings of asymptotic results for ASEP with an open boundary; (ii) the study of a discrete time version of ASEP; and (iii) the role of Weyl groups in classifying interacting particle systems solvable by a Bethe Ansatz."

For instance, understanding the best way to crumple a paper is a natural problem in elasticity which has several applications in material sciences, while nonlocal interaction energies appear in physics and chemistry as a way to describe the energy of nuclei. Our mathematical research will shed new light on the range of energies under which nuclei are stable.  The project will also have important impact on human resource development. We propose a system of personnel exchanges between our home institutions, designed to provide a rich training experience to students and postdocs. We propose to coordinate our activities and to have an emphasis month every year in one of the home universities of the PIs. We also propose summer schools designed to bring members of the group together (including graduate students and postdocs) to stimulate scientific progress, while exposing the fruits of our research to a broader audience and helping to educate and attract a new generation of researchers to this exciting area of emerging mathematical challenges and ideas.<br/><br/>The goals of this project include developing new general methods to study variational problems both in a vectorial setting and in the case of non-local interaction energies.

We focus on central issues in the calculus of variations, such as proving existence of minimizers of energy functionals and understanding their (possible) uniqueness and regularity. While much is known in the scalar case, very few results are available in the vectorial setting (both in the static and evolutionary cases) and for geometric problems involving non-local energies.

Other examples of non-equilbrium dynamics include systems in which mass or energy is allowed to escape, and large-scale systems of smaller interacting components which exchange mass or energy.  Such systems have been used in theoretical physics and chemical engineering to model atom traps, explore mechanisms for heat conduction in solids and investigate metastability in molecular processes.

This grant also supports the involvement of undergraduates in mathematics research.  Using the highly visual nature and physical motivation of the problems outlined above, the author will recruit undergraduate students to work on these topics during each summer funded by the grant.  Special emphasis will be given to recruiting students from underrepresented groups in research mathematics. Students will disseminate results of their research at poster sessions and through publication in undergraduate or research journals, as appropriate.  By stimulating interest in research careers in mathematics and creating a peer community supportive of that interest, the grant will contribute to the important goal of integrating research and education.<br/><br/>Much research in dynamical systems focuses on closed systems in which the dynamics are self-contained.  In many modeling situations, however, such a global view is not possible and it becomes necessary to study local systems that are influenced by other unknown systems, possibly on different scales. Such considerations motivate many of the systems to be studied during the course of this grant: systems in which mass or energy may enter or exit through deterministic or random mechanisms.  The grant is organized around three specific projects:  The first project investigates the statistical properties of both classical and non-equilibrium particle systems, which constitute an important class of models from statistical mechanics as described above; the second concerns open systems, which are inspired by physical models in which mass or energy is allowed to escape; the third project investigates the behavior of dynamical systems which are comprised of (possibly infinitely many) smaller components linked together, with orbits or energy allowed to pass between them. When focused on one component at a time, such systems generalize the discussion of open systems in a natural way by allowing both entry and escape.  The intellectual merit of the research activity funded by the grant stems from the depth of the analytical tools to be developed as well as the complexity and variety of the systems under consideration. Using his recent work concerning the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator for dispersing particle systems, the author will investigate both equilibrium and non-equilibrium models from statistical mechanics.  This approach is expected to resolve a longstanding conjecture by Bowen and Ruelle regarding the continuous time flow and to provide rigorous analysis of physically important quantities such as entropy production.  A second tool the author will use is the construction of Markov extensions (a generalization of finite and countable Markov partitions), which make no Markovian assumptions on the dynamics and are widely applicable to nonuniformly hyperbolic systems, including Hnon maps and a wide variety of particle systems. The application of such tools to systems out of equilibrium, open coupled map lattices and extended systems will represent significant advances in the study of such systems. Efforts to understand these tools in one context strengthens them and aids in their application to other areas of mathematics.  Their intellectual interest is enhanced by the application of these ideas to resolve problems posed and approached formally in the physics literature."

There is a concept of distance between vectors which is analogous to the familiar notion of  distance between the points in the three-dimensional world which we inhabit. Mathematicians have found that Banach spaces provide the correct framework in which to formulate major areas of mathematics such as Functional Analysis and Partial Differential Equations. Banach spaces are also used by scientists and engineers to model problems in applied areas such as fluid mechanics, signals processing, and finance. There are an infinite variety of Banach spaces which can be distinguished from each other by geometrical properties such as smoothness and convexity. An individual vector belonging to a Banach space is identified by an infinite string of numbers called coefficients. An important problem in data compression is to find a procedure, sometimes called a greedy algorithm, for selecting the most significant coefficients so that the resulting finite string vector is a short distance from, and hence a good approximation to, the original vector.<br/><br/> This project will investigate fundamental problems in Banach space theory and  applications to other areas. The methods employed will be those of Functional Analysis together with new insights  specific to each particular problem. These problems include the Banach Rotation Problem which asks whether Hilbert space is the only separable infinite-dimensional Banach space with a transitive isometry group. The new notion of asymptotic midpoint convexity will also be investigated. An open question to be solved is whether the isomorphic version of this property is equivalent to the known concept of asymptotic uniform convexity. Another problem to be solved in the area of nonlinear Banach space theory is whether $p$-convexity is preserved under uniform quotient mappings. Applications to other areas to be investigated include open questions on the convergence of greedy algorithms in Banach spaces, including the important case of Lebesgue spaces, and  related open questions on unconditionality and greedy convergence,  including the open problems of the existence of quasi-greedy sequences in arbitrary Banach spaces and of the boundedness of the Elton constants. Other applications include improved  explicit constructions of matrices with the Restricted Isometry Property, and  coefficient quantization properties for bases and redundant systems."

The timeliness and importance of the conference is particularly manifest this year, 2014, since two of the confirmed invited speakers have very recently been awarded the Fields Medal, the most prestigious distinction in mathematics. This conference provides an opportunity for a large audience of young students, researchers and specialists to get familiar with recent mathematical achievements, to obtain new ideas, to interact with each other and forge new collaborations. The conference has been further very successful in hosting the participants in the Boston mathematics community; allowing them to further their careers, get to know experts in their fields and foster new collaborations in an informal atmosphere. The conference provides the participants with a broader research overview, which should be of significance for their own mathematical work. <br/><br/>The conference is advertised widely so that many students and young researchers can attend it. The format of the conference has been very successful. The speakers are usually asked to divide their lectures into two parts, one of which is intended to be accessible to a broader audience and giving a general idea of the recent work and the other part containing more details. This endeavor is a challenge that the speakers have mastered very well in the past. In a time where research in mathematics and other fields becomes more and more specialized it is of great importance to make the effort to maintain an overview of the grand scheme of things. The conference can be thus regarded as an intensive two-day colloquium style overview of many exciting developments. The results presented at the conference are collected in manuscripts beforehand and are distributed to the participants during the conference. The proceedings are later published.

These important objects are known as singular integrals. This project proposes to study several related kinds of singular integrals. A unifying aspect of the proposed questions is that they are all intimately connected to a geometry, and this project will study how this underlying geometry can be used to develop the correct notions of singular integrals. The questions proposed have many applications.  They include direct applications to medical imaging, electrical impedance tomography, geophysical prospection, the rate at which fluids mix in certain situations, new directions in several complex variables, and new directions for multilinear operators that have underlying singular integrals.  Furthermore, given the wide range of applications that singular integrals have found in the past, it is possible that the ideas developed for this project may have many other applications in physics and mathematics beyond those mentioned above.<br/><br/>There are five main, interrelated questions in this project. The first is to study open questions from several complex variables using ideas recently developed by the principal investigator on multiparameter singular integrals. In many special cases, operators from several complex variables are Calderon-Zygmund singular integral operators and are well understood. However, in many more general cases, the operators are some sort of singular integral that is not of Calderon-Zygmund type. These operators often have an underlying multiparameter Carnot-Caratheodory geometry, which was recently developed in a quantitative way by the principal investigator. The next topic concerns new directions in oscillatory integrals, which also have two underlying Carnot-Caratheodory geometries and are amenable to the prinicipal investigator's methods concerning these geometries.  The third direction concerns a generalization of multilinear singular integrals due to Christ and Journe, which was motivated by Bressan's Mixing Conjecture. Here a main technique will be to use the geometry of projective space to determine the right class of operators. The fourth direction involves new kinds of multilinear singular integrals where the key tool will be to use actions of semisimple Lie groups to study their boundedness properties. The fifth direction lies in a slightly different line, and introduces a new kind of differential equation that is motivated by questions from pseudodifferential operators and inverse problems. The prinicipal investigator offers a conjecture as to the uniqueness properties of this differential equation."

The first part of this project deals with the Ericksen-Leslie system modeling hydrodynamic flow of nematic liquid crystals, which is a strongly nonlinear-coupled system between the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation of the underlying fluid velocity field and the transported heat flow of harmonic maps for the orientation director field of the nematic liquid crystal molecules. The objective is to establish existence and partial regularity for Leray-Hopf type weak solutions in dimension three. The second project investigates the energy asymptotic of a singularly perturbed functional in the sense of Gamma-convergence and resolve the Keller-Rubinstein-Sternberg problem on the dynamics in terms of harmonic map heat flow under new boundary conditions and mean curvature flow of the sharp interface. The third project is to establish the local well-posedness of such a conserved mean curvature flow for generic initial surfaces. The fourth project is to study the uniqueness of general Aronsson's equations for Hamiltonian functions with spatial dependence and the regularity of infinity harmonic functions and Aronsson's equations corresponding to uniformly convex Hamiltonians.<br/><br/>The proposed problems in these areas are not only very challenging mathematically but also have strong connections and profound applications to other fields such as biology, chemical engineering, physics, fluid mechanics and material sciences. Mathematically, the nonlinear partial differential equations or systems involved in the project either are either highly degenerate elliptic problems or equations with super-critical nonlinearities whose resolutions will definitely contribute new ideas and techniques that will be useful in a variety of contexts.  The hydrodynamic flow of nematic liquid crystals is among the most fundamental equations describing the dynamics of viscoelastic fluids and has its origination in LCD design and engineering. The conserved geometric motion has close connection with the Bose condensate physics. The L-infinity variational problems has found its applications in the optimal control,  the image recovery engineering arise, the determination of optimal radiation treatments in chemotherapy, and the design of winning strategies for random game theories. Rigorous analysis of both the existence and the regularity of various solutions to such a system can predict the formation of singularities, allow researchers to gain insight into turbulent phenomena, and justify both computational and experimental studies made by applied scientists and engineers. This project will result in the publication of monographs and lecture notes from international summer schools for both researchers and graduate students, involve active training of advanced PhD students, and include the organization of specific conferences such as Ohio River Analysis Meetings, AMS and SIAM special sessions, and AIM or BIRS workshops."

It is concerned with the set of problems in harmonic analysis that fall under the heading of the Uncertainty Principle, a relative of the principle of the same name that arises in quantum mechanics. Stemming from the work of Norbert Wiener in mathematics and Werner Heisenberg in physics, the area of the Uncertainty Principle still presents many mathematical challenges, and the field has numerous applications to adjacent fields. Several classical problems associated with the Uncertainty Principle, problems posed decades ago by such prominent mathematicians as Norman Levinson, Andrei Kolmogorov, and Norbert Wiener, remain open. Certain of those problems will be studied in this project. Modern methods of complex and harmonic analysis that appeared in the last thirty years suggest new approaches to the classical challenges of the Uncertainty Principle. Two such problems, the so-called gap and type problems, have recently been solved by the principal investigator. These problems have a number of important applications in approximation theory, prediction theory, spectral theory of differential operators, and mathematical physics.  <br/><br/>A new approach in the area of the Uncertainty Principle was developed in recent papers of Nikolai Makarov and the principal investigator. One of the main ingredients of the new approach is the use of Toeplitz operators, which explains the title of the project. Indeed, the next stage of the application of the Toeplitz approach in harmonic analysis and spectral theory is the focal point of this project. It contains several classical open problems. Among the  topics of research to be pursued are the following: general completeness problems, which will expand the results on the ""type"" problem mentioned earlier; spectral problems for Schroedinger and Dirac operators; and a Toeplitz operator version of the so-called Krein-de Branges theory, which was designed to connect complex and spectral analysis. Successful completion of this research will create a new and systematic view of the large variety of problems in the area of the Uncertainty Principle. A part of this project will be done in collaboration with the principal investigator's graduate students at Texas A&M University. Several mini-courses on the Toeplitz approach to the Uncertainty Principle were recently given by the principal investigator at U.S. and international research centers. All of the courses are oriented towards young researchers and graduate students. Together with Nikolai Makarov and Mikhail Sodin, the principal investigator is working on a book that will contain a modern account of the Krein-de Branges theory and other topics related to the Uncertainty Principle."

The latter, topology, is the study of properties of a space which are invariant under continuous stretching or bendings of a space, while the former, geometry, involves understanding distances and is more rigid. For example, the surface of our planet is a sphere, and one measures distances on it by computing arclengths of great circles (the Earth is actually an oblate spheroid, but it is very close to being perfectly spherical). One can imagine deforming the Earth by pushing in or pulling on small or large regions to warp the geometry. Such a deformation is less appealing than the familiar round Earth, and there are many ways to make this notion very precise in terms of minimizing some sort of total energy measurement. This is directly related to physical principles which say that the state of a physical system will tend towards a final configuration which minimizes the total energy. This idea can be generalized to higher-dimensional objects called manifolds, which are generalized versions of the surface of our planet. For example, the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and if one includes time, we are in a four-dimensional universe. In order to understand these types of higher-dimensional objects, one attempts to find the best way to measure distances on them which use the least amount of energy, and maximize the symmetries of the space. The projects in this proposal are to define appropriate energies on such spaces, and to seek out the important optimal geometries which minimize the total energy.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the research of the PI is, broadly speaking, to use solutions of partial differential equations which are geometric in origin to study properties of differentiable manifolds. The main areas of concentration of the PI's research are the existence of critical metrics generalizing the Einstein condition, the study of quadratic curvature functionals on Riemannian manifolds, the study of critical ALE metrics and orbifolds, and properties of moduli spaces of critical metrics. In joint work with Matt Gursky, the PI has proved existence of critical metrics on various four-manifolds. The proposed research is to further study the properties of the moduli space of such solutions. This is related to orbifold compactness theorems previously studied by Tian-Viaclovsky. The PI has previously demonstrated non-solvability of the Yamabe problem on certain compact orbifolds, which showed that the orbifold Yamabe problem is more subtle than in the case of smooth manifolds. The PI proposes further exploration of this phenomenon, and of connections with the notion of mass of ALE spaces. There has been a considerable amount of research on the existence of anti-self-dual metrics on compact manifolds; they have been shown to exist in abundance. Another goal of the proposal is therefore to understand global properties of the moduli space in certain cases; especially for orbifold-cone anti-self-dual metrics. Finally, the PI is committed to integrating research and education and cultivating intellectual development on many levels. The PI has been active in outreach and organization of conferences in the mathematics community."

Free boundaries correspond to sharp changes in the variables describing the problem. Significant progress has been made during last several decades in the study of free boundary problems. However in the case of nonlinear partial differential equations and especially equations of mixed type many important questions are yet to be studied. Better understanding of properties of free boundaries, such as stability, regularity and geometric structure, makes possible to study complex phenomena in models and applications. First area of this project is the study of shock reflection problem in gas dynamics, one of the most fundamental multidimensional shock wave problems. This study involves several challenging difficulties in analysis of free boundary problems for nonlinear partial differential equations. Another area of project is semigeostrophic system, a model of rotation-dominated atmospheric/ocean flows. It exhibits a rich mathematical structure based on Monge-Kantorovich mass transport theory. We plan to study physically realistic case of variable Coriolis parameter in semigeostrophic model. Broader impact resulting from the project will be achieved since the project addresses fundamental mathematical models in engineering and atmospheric sciences. Closer interaction with engineering and meteorological communities is one of the priorities of the project. Graduate students will be involved in the project.<br/><br/>The project consists of two main topics: (1) Free boundary problems in shock analysis. The PI will continue his work on self-similar shock reflection for potential flow and for full and isentropic Euler system. Shock reflection problems arise in many physical situations. Moreover, such problems are important in the mathematical theory of multidimensional conservation laws since their solutions are building blocks and asymptotic attractors of general solutions to the multidimensional Euler equations for compressible fluids. Self-similar equations of compressible fluid dynamics are of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type. Shocks correspond to discontinuities in the solution for Euler system, and in the gradient of the solution for potential flow equation. Type of equation may change from hyperbolic to elliptic across the shock. Shock reflection problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem in which unknown are the elliptic (subsonic) region and solution in the elliptic region. The PI will continue his work on existence, stability and regularity of global solutions of the regular reflection, to extend the global existence results to the case of compressible Euler system, which is a fundamental model of gas dynamics. Further study includes uniqueness and stability for regular reflection problem. (2) Another area of the proposed research is semigeostrophic system.  The PI will study semigeostrophic system with variable Coriolis parameter on a Riemannian manifold. Such model arises from  taking into account the curvature of the Earth. The PI also plans study solutions with low regularity, which come from modeling of  flows with neutrally stable regions. These projects involve study of Monge-Kantorovich mass transport problems, and Lagrangian solutions of transport equations with vector fields of low regularity."

Time series is a term for a sequence of ""random"" data, such as stock market prices or the positions of a jet being tracked.  Harmonic analysis, which can loosely be described as a set of techniques for breaking up a ""signal,"" such as a sound, into fundamental ""tones,"" provided a natural set of tools for solving time series prediction problems.  Operator theory and analytic function theory in one variable have had similar success in related engineering ""control"" problems involving feedback, for example, designing a thermostat or an automatic pilot.   These problems all involve ""one-dimensional"" data in a certain sense, and operator theory, harmonic analysis, and analytic function theory bring an impressive toolbox of related techniques to bear on them.  Multivariate versions of these theories exist to address multidimensional problems (e.g., image or video processing), but the connections between the different theories are weaker and less well understood.  It is the goal of this project to expand some known and particularly strong interactions of these fundamental subjects to build a more robust toolbox for addressing fundamentally multidimensional problems.<br/><br/>The specific topics this project will develop further are (1) characterizations of when a positive trigonometric polynomial can be factored as a single square, (2) weak factorization of Hardy spaces on the polydisk, and (3) operator theoretic models for bounded analytic functions.  Success in topic (1) will deepen our understanding of multivariate moment problems, multivariable polynomials, sums of squares decompositions and determinantal representations, and multivariate operator theory related to von Neumann's inequality. Success in topic (2) will bridge a gap between harmonic analysis and function theory in several variables and could lead to applications in Dirichlet series.  This project will use recent innovations in item (3) to study spaces of entire functions in several variables and their connections with Fourier analysis, which could have profound implications in old and difficult completeness problems in Fourier analysis."

From the freak waves forming in the middle of a calm ocean, to the singularities of a black hole, to a signal which passes through fiber optics cables, to Bose-Einstein Condensates, wave phenomena arise in many distinct physical settings. Clearly being able to accurately predict wave phenomena by knowing only few measurements would impact our world in many ways: from evacuation plans, to the understanding of our deep universe, from better and clear communication tools to the understanding of the micro-cosmo. The fundamental difficulty in obtaining accurate predictions for wave phenomena lies in the fact that they are expressed via mathematical identities that are too complex for us to study using classical tools. It has been the PI's long time research goal to investigate these complicated analytic structure in order to isolate the fundamental parts than can then be used for computer modeling. An example of the great advances that have been made in recent years in this direction is the ever more accurate weather predictions that we have been enjoying in the last decade.<br/><br/>The PI's research is focused on the discovery and invention of new abstract mathematical tools that can be effectively used in several aspects of the study of wave phenomena. Most notably, to study the longtime behavior of certain wave system, to control the error of certain numerical approximations and to determine that probabilistically, a particular outcome is the only observable expression of a wave phenomenon. In recent years, it has become clear that in order to conduct a successful mathematical analysis for complex problems involving waves, one has to be ready to use tools from several areas of mathematics. Based on this principle, the PI has conducted research with an  ""interdisciplinary"" approach. The classical harmonic and Fourier analysis techniques, in which the PI was trained and that subsequently refined and sharpened over the years, are of fundamental necessity for understanding complex wave interactions. Recently, however, the PI has complemented this analysis with ideas from classical probability, geometry, number theory  and  dynamical systems in order to capture more subtle aspects of the problem at hand. It is fair to say that in the last twenty years, thanks to this interdisciplinary approach, which many researchers have adopted, the subject of dispersive and wave equations has experienced an unprecedented level of research activity. Increasingly, the gap between empirical observations and abstract mathematical descriptions is being narrowed."

Regidity results are usually interdisciplinary and can be relevant to many areas of mathematics, with applications to computer science, complexity theory, design of computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes. The principal investigator's work in recent years has to do with the study of rigidity in so-called von Neumann algebras. These are algebras of infinite matrices in which the product of two elements (A times B, say) may be different from the product in reverse order (B times A), a fact that reflects Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in the quantum mechanics of particle physics. They are related to group theory and ergodic theory, since actions of groups on spaces give rise to a class of von Neumann algebras, now known as ""factors."" Rigidity in this context occurs when the group of transformations can be recognized by merely knowing its associated factor. During the period 2001-2010, the principal investigator developed a series of techniques to study such phenomena (namely, deformation-rigidity theory) to which  he recently added a powerful approximation technique.  In this project, he intends to combine all these tools to study rigidity in factors and to tackle the two most famous problems in the area: the Connes approximate embedding conjecture and the free group factor problem. The Connes conjecture predicts that factors can be ""simulated on a computer"" and has an interesting reformulation in quantum information theory.  The project should contribute to the cross-pollination of several areas of mathematics (e.g., free probability, random matrices, group theory, logic) and lead to progress in each of them. The principal investigator's research in rigidity theory has already had considerable impact on these areas, with a large number of research articles and Ph.D. theses sprouting directly from his work. He expects his techniques to have an even broader impact in the future, leading to new developments and solutions to problems in a variety of subjects, with direct and indirect impact in applied mathematics and the aforememtioned areas of computer science. <br/><br/>In this project, the principal investigator intends to further the development of deformation-rigidity theory by incorporating into it a new approximation technology known as incremental patching. Using this array of tools, he will continue to work on the classification of algebras arising from groups and their actions on spaces, as well as on the study of rigidity properties of these objects and the calculation of their symmetries. In particular, the principal investigator will attempt new approaches to two famous problems in two-one factors: the Connes approximate embedding conjecture and the free group factor problem. The problems studied in this project are important to both von Neumann algebra theory and the adjacent areas of group theory, ergodic theory, logic (descriptive set theory), free probability, and subfactor theory. Together with his students and collaborators, the principal investigator will make efforts to broaden the scope of deformation-rigidity theory, strengthening its interactions with all these (and possibly other) areas, an activity that should lead to further surprising results of an interdisciplinary character. Also, the principal investigator intends to continue to disseminate his new techniques through summer programs, mini-courses, textbooks, and expository articles, as well as through conferences that he will conduct and organize."

The first part of the project concerns the question of determining the internal properties of a medium by making electromagnetic (EM) measurements at the boundary. Challenging questions include recovering the shape information of electromagnetic inclusions and obstacles from boundary data, full reconstruction of EM parameters for an isotropic medium with incomplete boundary data, and the inverse problem for anisotropic media, where the unique reconstruction is possible only up to a change of variables. Such loss of uniqueness in the latter case leads to the second major topic of the project, namely, transformation-optics-based invisibility. The proposed study covers the regularized approximate electromagnetic cloaking scheme, whose limiting behavior provides important physical and mathematical implications for the singular structure required in an ideal cloaking design. The last part of the proposed project considers thermo-acoustic tomography (TAT), a hybrid medical imaging modality that combines low frequency electromagnetic waves with acoustic waves through the physical ""photo-acoustic' effect. In particular, the principal investigator plans to address the problem of reconstructing the electrical parameters and refractive indices of the medium from the internal absorbed radiation map. <br/><br/>The fundamental task of science is to probe the world around us. The most powerful tool to do this is to use waves (e.g., electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves, elastic waves), because waves can interact with different media in nonintrusive ways. Such nonintrusive investigation is greatly appreciated in many areas of science and technology, including medical imaging, geophysics, nondestructive testing, remote sensing, and so on. The fundamental mathematical theory behind such enhancement of ""visibility"" is the main topic of inverse problems, while another aspect is to hide an object from detection by waves, that is, to make it ""invisible."" The proposed project concerns both aspects, visibility and invisibility, for electromagnetic waves. For visibility, the proposer plans to develop mathematical techniques to address some of the challenging questions in inverse problems that will undoubtedly have real world applications in the future. For instance, the thermo-acoustic tomography (TAT) medical imaging modality has the potential to detect breast cancer cells at a much earlier stage than what is currently feasible. The development of mathematical theory of TAT will also shed light on a larger class of inverse problems with internal data such as PAT (photo-acoustic tomography), TE (transient elastography), UMT (ultrasound modulated electrical and optical impedance tomography), as well as other similar hybrid imaging modalities. The simultaneous improvement in contrast and resolution is the subject of intensive mathematical study and also of this project. As for invisibility, the development of ""meta-materials"" that have electromagnetic or acoustic properties not found in nature has inspired the transformation-optics based blueprint of the invisible cloak. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that invisibility is no longer just science fiction. This theoretical study seeks to understand and confront the difficulties under a realistic approximate scheme, which will benefit experimental endeavors. It provides an effective way to bridge the gap between reality and imagination that is still vast for current technology."

For instance, understanding the best way to crumple a paper is a natural problem in elasticity which has several applications in material sciences, while nonlocal interaction energies appear in physics and chemistry as a way to describe the energy of nuclei. Our mathematical research will shed new light on the range of energies under which nuclei are stable.  The project will also have important impact on human resource development. We propose a system of personnel exchanges between our home institutions, designed to provide a rich training experience to students and postdocs. We propose to coordinate our activities and to have an emphasis month every year in one of the home universities of the PIs. We also propose summer schools designed to bring members of the group together (including graduate students and postdocs) to stimulate scientific progress, while exposing the fruits of our research to a broader audience and helping to educate and attract a new generation of researchers to this exciting area of emerging mathematical challenges and ideas.<br/><br/>The goals of this project include developing new general methods to study variational problems both in a vectorial setting and in the case of non-local interaction energies. The problems we plan to study include: variational problems in nonlinear elasticity related to crumpling; existence of gradient flows for quasiconvex energy functionals and variational problems involving surface tension and nonlocal energies.  We focus on central issues in the calculus of variations, such as proving existence of minimizers of energy functionals and understanding their (possible) uniqueness and regularity. While much is known in the scalar case, very few results are available in the vectorial setting (both in the static and evolutionary cases) and for geometric problems involving non-local energies. Through a common effort, bringing together the investigators and collaborators for this Focused Research Group Grant, we expect some general methods to emerge, allowing us to obtain new substantial results.

A given matrix inequality is most useful in applications if it can be converted, through algebraic means, to a new matrix inequality whose solution set has a particularly simple form called ""convex."" The process of converting a matrix inequality to a convex matrix inequality is currently done on a case-by-case basis, and there is an extensive engineering literature on this subject with successes in particular examples. Continuing work of the principal investigator and his collaborators, a goal of this project is the development of a theory (so-called free real algebraic geometry) to identify exactly those matrix inequalities that can be reduced to obtain convexity and to automate this process when it is possible.  A further goal of this project is the development of tools and techniques in the mathematical and scientific fields that underlie the study of free real algebraic geometry. These include semidefinite programming and linear matrix inequalities, subjects that find use in many branches of science and engineering, as well as a branch of mathematics called dilation theory.  <br/><br/>A goal of this project is the development of a free (freely noncommutative) analog of semialgebraic geometry with an emphasis on convexity. Semialgebraic geometry is the study of polynomial inequalities.  Its free version studies matrix inequalities of the type that arise in engineering systems problems governed by a signal flow diagram. The Riccati inequality is a ubiquitous example. A desired long-term outcome of the project is a practical description of matrix inequalities with, up to polynomial or rational change of variable, convex solution sets. Many of the methods employed are of a functional analytic nature, involving ideas and techniques from operator systems and spaces, specifically. Techniques and results from classical semialgebraic geometry, convex optimization, semidefinite programming, as well as several complex variables, are also used.   A further objective of this project is the development, from the perspective of non-self-adjoint operator algebras, of tools and techniques useful in the study of function algebras. The Hardy space of bounded analytic functions on the unit disc is an example. In particular, an outcome will be a deeper understanding of the representations and contractive matrix-valued functions of such algebras. The techniques and methods employed are a blend of function theory, harmonic analysis, Riemann surface theory, operator theory, and the theory of operator algebras."

The choice of problems of the theory of analytic functions in this proposal is motivated by their intrinsic mathematical interest, rather than specific applications. The problems chosen for this proposal are old and difficult, and the PI proposes to study them using a variety of new methods recently developed by him and his collaborators, as well as by the other research groups. Most of these problems arise in the previous research of the PI funded by NSF. This previous research led to several significant results relevant to applications of mathematics in control theory, physics and material science. They also had impact on education: advanced mathematical courses on graduate level, PhD theses supervised by the PI and training of postdoctoral  scholars. The present proposal is expected to have a similar impact.<br/><br/>The main topic of this proposal is the geometric problem of classification of spherical polygons, and more generally, of metrics of constant positive curvature with conical singularities. This is closely related to the study of analytic functions defined by the Heun equation, the linear second order differential equation with four regular singularities. These functions lie on the boundary of the set of Special functions of Mathematical physics, but much less is known about them in comparison with classical special functions which are defined by equations with at most three singularities. The goal of this research is to classify spherical quadrilaterals up to isometry. The methods proposed are those used in the recent research of PI, A. Gabrielov, E. Mukhin, V. Tarasov and A. Varchenko on the Shapiro conjecture in real algebraic geometry.The second subject of proposed research is value distribution of holomorphic curves in projective spaces, especially of Brody curves, and curves defined by higher order linear differential equations. One specific goal is to prove a recent conjecture of Duval and da Costa on the Second Main theorem for Brody curves. The PI plans to use potential-theoretic methods developed in his previous work. The third topic is investigation of a class of extremal problems of new type for holomorphic functions in the unit disc that are inspired by questions in Control theory, namely the question of stabilizability of several systems by single output feedback control device. The proposed methods are those employed in the previous research on this problem by PI, jointly with W. Bergweiler."

Einstein's Equations connect the curvature of spacetime to its mass/energy content. In local coordinates they can be written as the system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. Due to their complexity, most studies have focused on exact solutions, obtained by imposing additional symmetries, which include Schwarzschild (non-rotating black holes) and Kerr (rotating black holes) spacetimes. A natural and highly nontrivial problem is whether these particular solutions are stable under small perturbations. In other words, assuming that at a moment in time the curvature of a given spacetime is very close to the curvature of a Kerr spacetime, it is expected that after evolving for a long time it will eventually approach a (potentially different) Kerr spacetime. The main goal of this project is understanding the behavior of solutions to equations and systems of equations that model Einstein's Equations, but are simpler. The study of these toy problems is necessary in order to tackle the much harder nonlinear stability problem mentioned above. <br/><br/>There has recently been a flurry of activity with regard to understanding the decay for the linear wave equations on Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, which is the simplest possible model to study. Even this problem is quite difficult, since the complicated background geometry affects the dispersion properties in nontrivial ways. In compact regions one must deal with high frequency wave packets that linger along trapped geodesics for a long time, while at infinity the non-Euclidean character of the metric affects the pointwise rates of decay. The very delicate (and unstable) nature of the trapped set in particular requires tools coming from harmonic analysis, differential equations, and differential geometry. Nevertheless, robust ways of measuring decay (e.g. local energy estimates and Strichartz estimates) have now been established. These estimates can in turn be used to tackle nonlinear problems like global well-posedness (existence and uniqueness of solutions, and continuous dependence of initial data). One example of such nonlinear problems is the semilinear wave equation with power nonlinearities for both small and large initial data. Another example, which is a good model of Einstein's Equations in harmonic coordinates, is the wave equation for a metric that itself depends on the solution. These techniques can also be used to settle the problem of optimal decay of solutions to the Maxwell Equations, the linear system which describes the evolution of an electromagnetic field on Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds. Finally, there is interest in the study of higher dimensional black holes coming from string theory, which at low energies can be described by higher-dimensional theories of gravity. Understanding the relevant decay properties for the wave equation on these backgrounds would also be quite interesting."

In terms of the mathematics, most of these problems consist of classical field equations from physics (e.g., fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, elasticity, kinetic theory) and exhibit at least one of two  important characteristics. First, they  might involve a ""free boundary,"" namely, an unknown submanifold (interface) along which the  field in question has a pointwise constraint (for instance, the temperature across along the interface of a metal might depend on the curvature). These submanifolds have as much physical interest as the other quantities, and their dynamics are strongly coupled to that of the fields. The second characteristic these equations might display is nonlocality, which  arises when particles or ""agents"" interact at large (noninfinitesimal) scales, for example, in the Boltzmann equation or the quasigeostrophic equation. This always leads to equations involving integro-differential operators, such as fractional powers of the Laplacian. The specific models studied in this project present challenging analytical problems that are especially attractive in that they highlight the limits of our understanding of nonlinear partial differential equations. In particular, they pinpoint difficulties such as the following: obtaining useful pointwise bounds for solutions (without using comparison principles, or when equations are supercritical); deriving a priori regularity estimates for equations that are both nonlinear and nonlocal; understanding the physical validity of solutions (well-posedness and breakdown); handling nonlinear effects that dominate diffusion or dispersion (again supercriticality); analyzing multiscales and disordered media (homogenization).<br/><br/>Nonlinear partial differential equations are ubiquitous in the natural sciences, as is well known. For this specific project, the richness of nonlocal equations and free boundary problems cover very diverse natural phenomena, for instance nucleation of phases, surface tension effects in fluids, crystal formation in metallurgy, droplet spreading, ocean-atmosphere interaction, and nonlocal electrostatics. All of these phenomena are relevant to science and engineering, for instance in materials science (composite design, dislocations), nanotechnology (microfluids, droplets), bioengineering (martensite or materials with memory), and biochemistry (nonlocal electrostatics, with great potential in medicine). A sound mathematical understanding of the respective equations would be highly beneficial to the development of these technologies."
