"2055771","NSF-BSF: Dynamics and Operator Algebras beyond the Elliott Classification Program","DMS","ANALYSIS PROGRAM","08/01/2021","07/22/2021","N Phillips","OR","University of Oregon Eugene","Standard Grant","Marian Bocea","07/31/2024","$279,210.00","","ncp@uoregon.edu","1585 E 13TH AVE","EUGENE","OR","974031657","5413465131","MPS","1281","","$0.00","This project links two mathematical fields, dynamics and operator algebras. An elementary example of a dynamical system is the system whose state at any given time is the instantaneous positions and velocities of the sun, planets, moons, asteroids, and other astronomical bodies in the solar system. Given the state at any time, physical laws determine the state at any later moment. For a discrete example, consider the states of a computer governed by a program. The program is a rule for using the current state to determine the state one time step later, and, by repetition, any number of steps in the future. To suitable dynamical systems, one can associate an operator algebra, a kind of algebraic structure which encodes some of the structure of the dynamical system. A discrete dynamical system has a numerical invariant, its mean dimension, which describes one aspect of its complexity. An operator algebra has a numerical invariant, its radius of comparison, which was defined without consideration of dynamics. A central aim of the project is to seek new ways to relate these, thus connecting two different areas of mathematics in an unexpected way. The project will also contribute US workforce development through the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>More precisely, the dynamical systems under consideration are free minimal actions of amenable groups on compact metric spaces. Mean dimension was invented in dynamics, with no thought of operator algebras. Roughly, it measures the increase of the dimension of the part of the space one sees with each iteration of the dynamics. The associated operator algebra is a functional analyst's version of the skew group ring in algebra, using the group action on the algebra of continuous functions on the space. The radius of comparison is a numerical measure of how badly a condition needed if the Elliott classification program fails. The algebras to which it was first applied were not related to dynamics. The conjecture is that the radius of comparison is half the mean dimension. The project is aimed at the inequality for which less is known: that the radius of comparison is at least half the mean dimension.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to analyze, use and store them it is necessary to understand their ?Structure?, in mathematical language this means to understand their ?Geometry?. For example this means, to embed them into  better structured spaces with a coordinate system. Banach spaces, are the conceptual  framework to accomplish that. A main focus of this project is finding embeddings of  metric spaces, used in Computer Science, into certain Banach spaces. Examples for such metric spaces are Lamplighter Graphs, which model the traveling salesman problem, and the Transportation Cost Metric Space, which models the optimal distribution of  products. On the other hand, from the embeddability, or non-embeddability of certain metric spaces into a given Banach space, one can deduce important geometric properties of that Banach space. This award will support the principal investigator's research on these topics and also contribute to US workforce development through the training of graduate students. <br/><br/>The first part of the project is concerned with the question whether or not certain metric spaces, like the Lamplighter space and Transportation Cost space, can be  coarsely, uniform or bi-Lipschitzly embedded in the Banach space of integrable functions, and estimate the distortion of these embeddings. In the second part, the investigator seeks to find metric characterizations of several isomorphic properties of Banach spaces via the embeddabilty, or non embeddability, of certain metric graphs. The research will concentrate on finite asymptotic properties with the goal of establishing an asymptotic version of the in recent years successful Ribe Program on metric characterizations of local properties. The investigator will also continue his investigation on the metric interpretations of reflexivity, with the hope of finding metric test spaces which characterize  reflexivity. A central part of studying Banach spaces and their geometry is the study of (linear and bounded) operators on them. Very recently it was discovered that for a large class of separable  Banach spaces, the cardinality of closed subideals of the space of operators is the cardinality of the collection of subsets of the continuum. This is, by simple set theoretic considerations, the maximal possible. The PI will investigate the closed ideals of spaces of operators of more classes of Banach spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many applications. In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the flow of air past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering (for instance: signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for instance: image processing and quantum computation). Complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. In this project, the PI will further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. This project also has a substantial educational component: The PI will develop a research experience in data science for first year undergraduate students at Louisiana State University (LSU). This program will prepare participants for a career in STEM, solidify their knowledge of basic mathematics, and give them an opportunity to learn about data science. <br/><br/>In the research part of this project, the PI will study bounded domains in complex Euclidean space and relate intrinsic geometric conditions (e.g. the geometry of the Kaehler-Einstein metric) to extrinsic geometric conditions (e.g. the CR-geometry of the boundary). Many classical results in the subject consider bounded domains in complex Euclidean space, assume that the boundary is smooth, and make assumptions about the CR-geometry of the boundary. For domains with non-smooth boundary, the PI will prove new variants of classical results by assuming geometric conditions on the Kaehler-Einstein metric instead of conditions on the boundary.  Using this approach, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory where metric space techniques applied to group theory not only lead to progress on old problems, but also many new and interesting examples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, the first partial differential equations naturally arose in physics when trying to describe the propagation of heat, the propagation of waves as well as electromagnetism. Many problems in engineering also rely on the theory of PDEs, as well as the ability to approximate their solutions. The scientific part of this project is concerned with the study of specific families of PDEs that model various physical phenomena. These include the melting of ice, combustion, chemical diffusions, liquid crystals, and image processing. One of the main scientific goals of the project is to develop new mathematical tools that can be used to better understand the physical phenomena being modeled. This will create new avenues to analyze them and enhance their comprehension. The investigator will also organize a week-long workshop focused on first-generation undergraduate students who are interested in mathematics. The students will participate in minicourses, attend research talks, and have informal conversations with mathematicians who work in different sectors. The workshop will contribute to the development of a mathematically well-versed and diverse workforce.  <br/>  <br/>This project is driven by questions arising in free boundary problems and geometric measure theory. In the applied sciences one often encounters free boundaries, which arise when the solution to a problem consists of a function (often satisfying a partial differential equation) and a set where this function has a specific behavior. The investigator will study a variety of problems that are motivated by the study of the regularity of the function and the geometry of the associated set. These are central questions that are ubiquitous in both theoretical and applied mathematics and can be directly used to model various physical phenomena. The project?s main goal is to contribute to a better understanding of problems involving nonlocal equations, almost minimizers with free boundaries, and minimizers for anisotropic energies. The first class of problems to be investigated involves PDE of fundamental importance for mathematical modeling. In particular, numerous applied phenomena give rise to nonlocal equations, such as nonlocal image processing and liquid crystals. The study of almost minimizers with free boundaries has an outstanding potential to treat a new group of physically motivated problems, as the almost minimizing property can be understood as a minimizing problem with noise. Finally, minimizers for anisotropic energies lead to non-uniformly elliptic PDE, generating new, challenging questions in geometric PDE. The investigator will develop new tools which will address related questions at the interface of free boundary problems and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many modeling situations, however, such a global view is not possible and it becomes necessary to study systems that are influenced by other unknown systems, possibly on different scales. This project will investigate properties of chaotic dynamical systems that are out of equilibrium, either due to the application of external forces or because mass or energy is allowed to escape.  Systems to be studied during the course of this project include systems in which mass or energy may enter or exit through deterministic or random mechanisms, and large-scale systems of smaller interacting components that exchange mass or energy.  These problems are strongly motivated by connections with statistical mechanics and seek to advance our understanding of fundamental questions related to energy transport and diffusion.  This project will also support the involvement of undergraduate students in mathematics research.  The highly visual nature and physical motivation of the problems outlined above will enable the principal investigator to recruit undergraduate students to participate in related research projects during the course of the project.  Special emphasis will be given to recruiting students from underrepresented groups in research mathematics.  Students will disseminate results of their research via poster sessions, conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.  By stimulating interest in research careers in mathematics and creating a peer community supportive of that interest, the grant will contribute to the important goal of integrating research and education.<br/><br/>Motivated by the problems outlined above, this project is organized around three specific projects:  The first project investigates the statistical and thermodynamic properties of both classical and non-equilibrium particle systems with collision interactions, an important class of models from statistical mechanics; the second concerns open systems, which relate on the one hand to physical systems in which mass or energy is allowed to escape, and on the other to the study of metastable states; the third project generalizes open systems to include linked and extended dynamical systems comprised of two or more components that exchange mass or energy through deterministic or random mechanisms.  Important examples include the aperiodic Lorentz gas and mechanical models of heat conduction.  The investigator will bring to bear several analytical techniques that he has been instrumental in developing for these classes of systems, including his recent work concerning the spectral decomposition of transfer operators for dispersing particle systems, contractions in projective cones due to Birkhoff, and the construction of adapted Markov extensions (a generalization of Markov partitions).  None of these techniques require Markovian assumptions on the dynamics, making them widely applicable to a wide variety of nonuniformly hyperbolic and physically important systems.  The application of these techniques to central models from equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics will represent significant advances in the study of such systems.  Efforts to understand these tools in one context strengthens them and aids in their application to other areas of mathematics.  Their intellectual interest is enhanced by the application of these ideas to resolve problems posed and approached formally in the physics literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What the relation is between the discrete and continuous ""worlds"", how one impacts the other, and what laws they obey are the fundamental questions that the PI intends to investigate. This project focuses on the Hamming cube, the simplest discrete object that consists of binary strings of given length and that can encode any complex information. As the complexity of the information increases, the lengths of the encoded strings increase exponentially. The goal of the project is to develop mathematics on the Hamming cube that would allow us to encode the structures of the continuous world into the discrete world, and vice versa. The new techniques developed could have surprising applications in complexity theory as well as classical and quantum algorithms. Many of these problems are accessible to students and this project aims to continue the PI's work with undergraduate and graduate students in this area.<br/> <br/>This project will consider a series of problems in the Gauss space and, most importantly, in its discrete counterpart, the Hamming cube. Unlike the classical case of the unit circle, many fundamental questions of Fourier analytic type are still open for the Hamming cube due to its unique discrete geometric structure. The first and main direction of the proposal is to resolve Weissler's conjecture, an old open problem in complex hypercontractivity theory on the Boolean cube that gives necessary and sufficient conditions for boundedness of the Hermite operator with complex time. Weissler's conjecture has important implications in several areas of mathematics including combinatorics, computer science, probability, isoperimetry, and approximation theory. The new techniques will be based on developing ""two-point"" inequalities. The second  direction of this research is to develop methods of harmonic analysis to find good estimates on the norms of various linear operators acting on a class of functions on the Hamming cube whose Fourier spectra belong to given prescribed sets. The basic examples include Bernstein-Markov type inequalities and their reverse forms for functions on the Hamming cube that live on the low and high frequencies respectively. The third direction is to understand the universality phenomena of the Gaussian measure. In particular, the goal is to investigate uniqueness of the functional Ehrhard inequality, which is the sharp analog of Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the Gaussian measure. The analysis will be based on Monge-Ampere type partial differential equations and semigroup methods. The fourth direction is to develop the duality between martingale inequalities related to sharp dyadic square function estimates and the problems of isoperimetric type; that is, gradient estimates for functions on the Hamming cube. Our methods will use heat envelopes, ""four-point"" inequalities, and ""inf-sup"" Legendre transform. The fifth direction aims to obtain sharp forms of the classical triangle inequalities in the Lp spaces using the theory of developable surfaces and minimal concave functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This field is concerns functions with Fourier transform (frequencies) supported (non-zero at most) on some curved objects such as a sphere or a cone. Such functions appear naturally in several areas of science and mathematics: in the study of Schrödinger equations, wave equations and number theory. For instance, a solution to the linear wave equation can be represented as a function with Fourier transform supported on a cone. Investigating these functions allows one to understand how waves evolve in time. In number theory, one can count the number of integer solutions to some Diophantine equations (polynomial equations with integer coefficients) by estimating such functions. Namely, if the corresponding functions are concentrated, then one expects the Diophantine equation to have many integer solutions. And an upper bound on the number of solutions can be given in terms of how spread out the functions are. This project will be focused on how the curvature of the Fourier support prevents the functions from being concentrated.<br/><br/>The work will be concentrated on oscillatory integrals and related to Falconer's conjecture. The latter is an unsolved question concerning the sets of Euclidean distances between points in compact d-dimensional spaces. The projects on oscillatory integrals concern the restriction conjecture, the Hormander operator, and decoupling questions. For the restriction conjecture, Stein's restriction conjecture will be studied in higher dimensions and in dimension three. For the Hörmander operator the Bochner-Riesz conjecture will be investigated by considering it as a Hörmander operator not satisfying Bourgain's ""generic failure"" condition.

Examples of signals are sound, images, time series and weather data. Such signals are analyzed via the overlaying (superposition) of basic harmonics of well-specified duration, intensity and frequency. These basic harmonics are functions called wavelets. Image or audio denoising, compression, or pattern recognition are accomplished by filter processing, which refers to a suitable superposition of each wavelet after the action of the filter on it. This is also known as the time-frequency method. A particular concrete example of a re-construction process is used in tomographic imaging, where the shape of a solid body is re-composed from samples of the body along one or two-dimensional rays of penetrating waves, which can be mathematically described as lines or planes in three dimensional space. One component of this mathematics research project focuses on a new family of methods for the wavelet description of the class of singular integral operators, arising for instance in the time-frequency analysis of highly oscillatory signals. Another component of this research project is concerned with the mathematical properties of sampling solid objects along lines or planes. The integrated broader impact activities focus on strengthening the pool of socioeconomically disadvantaged, ethnical minority students (underrepresented groups) in graduate degrees in mathematics and improving retention. Activities connected to training and mentoring of graduate students in Analysis and topical dissemination of knowledge will also be carried out. <br/> <br/>The broad aim of the first circle of questions is to produce representation formulas for classes of singular integrals in terms of so-called model operators conserving the same invariance structure. This paradigm applies to Zygmund-type operators and modulation invariant operators akin to the bilinear Hilbert transform, both of which are out of reach for dyadic-probabilistic methods. Concrete applications come from elliptic and dispersive PDE, operator theory and quasi-conformal mappings. The second related family of questions is motivated by pointwise convergence of bilinear ergodic averages for Banach-valued functions, a celebrated theorem by Bourgain in the scalar case. The approach is based on Banach-valued variational estimates for the truncated bilinear Hilbert transform. The central item in a further set of questions concerning directional singular integrals is a version of the Kakeya maximal estimate where tubular averages are replaced with averages over singular line segments, and more generally, n-dimensional subspaces. One source of motivation is the connection with Fourier restriction in higher codimensions.

Over the last decade the PI has developed a new set of mathematical tools called decouplings to measure this extent of interaction. While these tools were initially intended for certain questions about differential equations, they have also led to important breakthroughs in number theory. More precisely, Diophantine equations are systems of polynomial equations involving whole numbers with potentially complicated solutions. Mathematicians are interested in counting the number of solutions to such systems.  Unlike waves, numbers do not oscillate, at least not in an obvious manner, but one can think of numbers as frequencies, and thus associate them to waves.  In this way, questions related to counting the number of solutions to Diophantine systems can be rephrased in the language of quantifying wave interferences. The project will further extend the scope of decouplings towards the resolution of fundamental problems in harmonic analysis and number theory. New tools will be developed that will be accessible and useful to a large part of the mathematical community. In addition, the Principal Investigator will organize summer schools and workshops that will educate both young researchers and experts from other areas of mathematics about the applicability of decouplings.<br/><br/>Decouplings have proved successful in addressing a wide range of problems in such diverse areas as number theory, partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. Through the project a further expansion is planned of the applicability of these methods in new directions. One important circle of questions that remain to be addressed concerns the decoupling inequalities for curves on small spatial balls. An investigation of a new phenomenon called large cap decoupling will further be sought after. Large cap decoupling is concerned with square root cancellation for coarser partitions of manifolds.

The overarching goal of this research program is to understand how properties of these functions depend upon the underlying geometry of the space being studied. The project includes two main educational efforts. The first is the creation of working groups for incoming graduate students; its goal is to prepare the students to develop a strong set of skills to apply for grants and to prepare them for teaching. The second is the development of online materials for a course on semiclassical analysis that will be available for students to use whenever the in-person version of the course is not offered.  <br/><br/>Understanding the behavior of Laplace eigenfunctions is of fundamental importance in mathematical physics and has been studied since the 1700s. In particular, the challenging study of concentration properties of high energy eigenfunctions has been the subject of extensive work, and the tools developed for studying Laplace eigenfunctions have had a profound impact on nearly every area of spectral theory and geometric analysis. This project concerns a framework developed by the investigator to extract information on the structure of eigenfunctions from their concentration and propagation behavior in phase space via the use of semiclassical analysis. The current research aims to adapt and develop these methods to reach a deeper understanding of eigenfunction behavior by studying their pointwise growth, L^p-norms, associated two-point Weyl Laws, and applications to random waves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harmonic analysis is a subject about the Fourier transform, which decomposes a function into its constituent frequencies. In other words, by taking the Fourier transform we effectively write a function as a superposition of monochromatic waves (waves with only one frequency). Of particular interest are the following restriction type problems: How large can a function be, in the pointwise sense or in some averaged sense, if its frequency lives in a particular restricted set? People have found that if the restricted frequency set is ""curved"", for example being the unit sphere, very nontrivial estimates about the function can be obtained/expected. This is useful in understanding physics phenomena dictated by certain natural partial differential equations such as the Schrodinger equation or the wave equation. Moreover, restriction type problems also turn out to be the key to the understanding of certain behaviors of natural numbers. It turns out that, for example, once people understand well on properties on waves whose frequencies are perfect 10-th powers, they can consequently answer a variety of questions on representing a natural number as a sum of a few perfect 10-th powers.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI proposes to study restriction type problems: If we have a subset M (usually a curved submanifold or a fractal set) in the frequency space and some measure in the physical space, we want to bound some norm of a function with respect of the given measure whenever the frequency support of that function is in the given M. One proposed direction is Stein's Restriction Conjecture, where the measure is just the Lebesgue measure and the manifold is the unit paraboloid. The PI is also interested in the situations when the measure is a fractal measure, or when M is a moment manifold or a fractal set. For most questions of this type, the optimal estimates are far from being well understood. The goal of this research would be to obtain new estimates (i.e. estimates with improved exponents) in the above setting. In particular, it is anticipated that improvements on Stein's conjecture can be obtained when this project develops. For the proposed approach, the PI anticipates a subset of analytic (induction on scales, decoupling and refined Strichartz type reasoning), algebraic (the polynomial method, differential geometry and real algebraic geometry), combinatorial (Multilinear Kakeya, sum-product theory, etc.) and geometric measure theoretic (radial projection theory, etc.) tools can come into play.

Examples of such systems exist in celestial mechanics (planetary orbits), biology (population dynamics), solid state physics (quasicrystals), mathematical physics (quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators, or, more generally, time-dependent dynamics in systems with localization), and partial differential equations (non-linear Schrodinger and wave equations with periodic coefficients). The analysis of such problems requires dealing with small denominators; in other words, understanding how often and in what pattern would the system return to a state that is very close to the initial state. Traditionally, these problems have been approached by Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM)-type techniques. In the setting of quasiperiodic operators, the main limitations of KAM methods is that they are very difficult to apply to truly multi-dimensional systems, due to the complicated structure of resonances. Alternative approaches (methods based on estimates of Green's functions) do not have these dimensional restrictions. Until recently, those methods have not been as flexible as KAM in the direction of parameter removal. However, this is currently changing largely due to the recent works of the principal investigators (PIs) of this project. The project involves research and training activities towards developing and refining these new methods and applying them to the study of problems involving quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators and nonlinear partial differential equations, obtaining previously inaccessible multi-dimensional and arithmetic results. These have potential applications in all the fields mentioned above.<br/><br/>The technical heart of the proposal is the development of non-perturbative methods for Green?s function estimates for lattice quasiperiodic operators, assuming that the frequency parameter is restricted to a submanifold of a torus. Such problems appear naturally in the analysis of multi-particle quasiperiodic operators as well as nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) and nonlinear wave (NLW) equations, and have been inaccessible until the work of Bourgain?Kachkovskiy which, however, is only the first step since it significantly relies on the two-dimensional setting. These methods will be applied to constructing new classes of spacetime quasiperiodic solutions of the NLS and NLW equations, by lifting the current dimensional and arithmetic restrictions of the Craig?Wayne?Bourgain approach. It is also expected that these methods will allow to construct full-dimensional KAM tori. Recent advances by the PIs from multiple directions also allow, for the first time, to consider arithmetic localization results for multi-dimensional quasiperiodic operators, motivated by recent sharp results obtained by Jitomirskaya and Liu.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The origin of dynamical systems may be traced back to Newtonian mechanics. Examples of mathematical models of dynamical systems include the study of fluid dynamics, airflow dynamics, and many others. Consider, for instance, gas particles moving in a space according to a certain rule. One is interested in understanding various states of the system over long-time intervals. A curious phenomenon is the following: if one assumes that initially all gas particles are in one half of the space, then infinitely often in the future, the gas molecules will collect in the initial portion of the space. This conclusion, which is predicted by mathematical aspects of the system, seems paradoxical. However, the mystery may be revealed if one observes that the number of the degree of freedom in this system is very large, thus in order to return to the original state, one needs to observe the system for very long (practically impossible) time intervals. This proposal aims at the study of finitary aspects of dynamical systems where one is interested in approximating various states of the system within an error. This project also include the training of a graduate student.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator seeks extensions and strengthening of certain rigidity results in dynamics and their applications in number theory and geometry. Special attention will be given to finitary and effective aspects of the analysis. The following will be the main objectives: (i) Dynamical systems have become a major player in modern mathematics. However, arguments relying on techniques from ergodic theory and dynamics are often non-quantitative. Providing finitary versions of these arguments are challenging and much sought after, especially in view of various applications. The principal investigator seeks results in this direction with two main goals in mind: provide finitary arguments which yield polynomial rates for strong rigidity results in homogeneous dynamics in some specific examples with interesting applications to number theory and geometry; provide finitary versions of these celebrated results in great generality, even though one may not obtain a polynomial rate in general. (ii) Geodesic planes in hyperbolic 3-manifolds have been studied from different angles. These investigations have made it clear that the behavior of geodesic planes is intimately related to the geometric, topological, and arithmetic properties of the ambient manifold.

These systems depend on a variety of parameters, and as these parameters change, the corresponding system is affected. Understanding how dynamical systems change with different parameters is a very complicated and delicate question that is not even completely understood in the simplest of mathematical models. However, there is one shining success story in this regard: that is, the parameter space, or ""moduli space"", of complex quadratic polynomials. This space contains the famous Mandelbrot Set, which has been thoroughly studied over the last 40 years. The research outlined in this proposal explores different parameter spaces associated to particular dynamical systems, with a view toward understanding them to the same extent that the mathematical community understands the space where the Mandelbrot set lives. This proposal also contains a significant outreach component to support the Math Corps at U(M), a free math Summer Camp for middle school students and high school mentors.<br/><br/>A major goal in the field of complex dynamics is to understand dynamical moduli spaces. The most successful endeavor in this regard has been the study of the moduli space of quadratic polynomials where the Mandelbrot Set lives, a fundamental object in the subject. Ultimately, we strive to understand the moduli space of rational maps of arbitrary degree to the same extent that we understand the moduli space of quadratic polynomials. Many tools from complex analysis that pave the way for key breakthroughs in the one-dimensional setting do not carry over to higher dimensions. So instead of considering the whole moduli space, PI follows an approach initiated by William Thurston and investigate sub-varieties of moduli space. The most natural sub-varieties to study are those that come from dynamical conditions, like imposing combinatorial constraints on the forward orbits of critical points. One may view Thurston?s Topological Characterization of Rational Maps as a first step. It provides a way to understand zero-dimensional dynamical sub-varieties; that is, those that consist of postcritically finite parameters. Following Epstein, the PI will adapt Thurston?s ideas and constructions and shall develop a setting in which to study higher-dimensional dynamical sub-varieties of moduli spaces. PI will explore this theory by working with one-dimensional dynamical sub-varieties in the moduli space of quadratic rational maps, and one-dimensional dynamical sub-varieties in the moduli space of cubic polynomials, where there are already very challenging and fundamental problems concerning their topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has long been believed that the inner workings of turbulence may be understood in terms of the differential equations that are being used to model fluid motion, including the Euler equations. However, the analysis of these equations has proved so difficult that much of the relationship between turbulence and solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics remains conjectural and unresolved. Recently, a new approach has been developed to analyze solutions to fluid equations that have rapid fluctuations comparable to what is seen in turbulence.

This branch of convex geometry is called geometric tomography. One of the examples is x-ray tomography, which has numerous applications in science, medicine and engineering. The PI recently discovered that important problems of geometric tomography can be solved using the most popular tool of harmonic analysis, the Fourier transform. This tool allows one to decompose the data into a simple combination of harmonics, functions with periodically repeating values, and, by doing this, one can reduce geometric problems to computations related to the harmonics, the theory of which is well developed. This approach has led to solutions of the 1956 Busemann-Petty problem on sections of convex bodies, the 1938 Schoenberg's problem on positive definite functions, the slicing problem for arbitrary functions. The PI plans to further develop the Fourier approach and apply it to a range of problems at the interface between convex geometry, functional analysis, probability theory and algebra. For example, can one find an algebraic equation whose solutions are sections of a given solid? Can one estimate the volume of a solid from data involving areas of certain sets of sections or projections of this solid? Which random variables are stable, that is, have the property that the sums of several copies of these variables always reproduce the same variable up to a constant? An important part of the project is the involvement and training of graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The problems considered connect several areas of mathematics - convex geometry, functional analysis, probability and algebra. However, the strategy of solution is common for most of the results - the question is translated into the language of the Fourier transform and then treated as a problem from harmonic analysis. The PI plans to develop further connections between convex geometry and algebra by considering the problem of Arnold, going back to Lemma 28 from Newton's ""Principia."" The problem is to characterize those convex domains whose cut-off area is an algebraic function of the parameters of the cutting plane. The classical slicing problem of Bourgain asks whether every symmetric convex body of volume one has a hyperplane section with area greater than an absolute constant. The PI plans to study the lower-dimensional and non-symmetric versions of the Busemann-Petty problem asking whether a convex body with uniformly smaller areas of plane sections necessarily has smaller volume. Another direction is to study the general properties of the Radon transform associated with volumetric results about convex bodies. A connection with functional analysis is the study of distances between convex bodies, embedding and duality problems. The question about positive definite functions and embeddings in Lebesgue spaces is related to an old problem in probability theory asking for a characterization of stable random vectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of the geometric properties of such maps has led to the development of Geometric Function Theory and has proven over the years to be of fundamental importance to a wide variety of problems in analysis, geometry, probability, physics, and engineering. More recently, much attention has been devoted to the study of maps, or functions, that are a generalization of conformal maps, called of quasiconformal maps, where a controlled amount of angle distortion is allowed. Quasiconformal mappings possess subtle properties, making them very useful in a wide variety of settings. In many of these applications, one must deal with maps that are (quasi)conformal in a given planar region except possibly for some ?exceptional set? of points inside the region. The question whether the exceptional set is negligible and small enough to be ignored leads to the notion of conformal removability, central to this research project and closely related to fundamental questions in complex analysis and other areas. The principal investigator has no doubt that many more fruitful connections should come to light as progress is made toward a better understanding of removability.

One of the main research areas targeted by this project is in fluid dynamics, more precisely water waves, as well as a broader class of free boundary problems. This has been an area of intense interest in recent years, not in the least because of its great potential for applications, ranging from oceanography to medical science and to stellar dynamics. But the most interesting problems are still unresolved, and their study is bringing forth an array of extremely difficult questions. Another goal is the study of completely integrable systems, which often arise as models for more difficult nonlinear problems in fluid dynamics in general, and water waves in particular. The main objective is to gain a sufficiently accurate understanding  of the long time dynamics, which combine solitons, dispersive shocks and nonlinear scattering in a complex pattern. The study of geometric nonlinear wave equations is a third objective of this project. After the recent proof of the Threshold Conjecture for Wave Maps and Yang-Mills systems, the current work is directed toward a full classification of blow-up solutions and of non-scattering solutions, as predicted by the Soliton Resolution Conjecture. Finally, quasilinear wave and Schrodinger evolutions bring forth some of the most challenging problems in nonlinear partial differential equations, and understanding both their short and long time dynamics is another major goal of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Models involving nonlocal differential equations play a role in natural sciences such as physics (e.g., turbulence formation) and organic chemistry and biology (e.g., DNA and protein knotting). In recent years, refined techniques have been developed to treat nonlocal differential aspects, and it is the aim of the investigator to further develop and implement these techniques for geometric-topological aspects. The fundamental issues the project aims to understand are optimal shapes under such nonlocal equations, and the controllability of geometry and topology via nonlocal models.

A particular approach is to develop, together with undergraduate students, virtual reality visualizations of the deep geometric and topological effects that this project is investigating, to be used in training and public outreach.<br/><br/>The project aims at further developing the analysis of fractional Sobolev spaces and fractional variational problems, especially problems with a geometric background. The methods, in particular from harmonic analysis, provide bridges between different areas of analysis, geometry, and topology, and the underlying goal is to find and further study these links. A large part of this project is concerned with applications of fractional harmonic analysis in geometric partial differential equations and the geometric calculus of variations. Problems include nonlocal self-repulsive knot and curvature energies (existence and regularity), the half-wave map equation motivated from physics (well-posedness), and analysis of the free boundary of variational problems with geometric constraints (regularity). A second part is concerned with application of harmonic analysis in quantitative topology for problems with maps that have less than one derivative (i.e., Hölder maps, maps in fractional Sobolev spaces): sharp estimates of the topological degree and the topological-analytical study of the Heisenberg group are treated.

It could be as simple as when we look at a rainbow: dispersion causes the spatial separation of white light into different colors. Or when we look at the ripples that form when we throw a pebble in the lake: the expanding ring is called a ?wave-packet? and we note that waves travel at different speeds, the longest going fastest and the shortest ones slowest. But wave phenomena also arise in quantum mechanics, plasmas, fiber optics, ferromagnetism, atmospheric and water waves and many other settings. Because waves in nature interact in a nonlinear fashion as they propagate and have different properties such as amplitude, length, oscillation, speed, and position over time, it is important to understand how they may behave under certain noisy conditions or when taking measurements in certain media where small errors are unavoidable. Understanding the most efficient way to send a signal through a fiber optic cable or being able to anticipate the properties of a gas when the temperature approaches absolute zero (a Bose-Einstein condensate) are two very different phenomena in nature but are both aspects of solutions to the same nonlinear model. Being able to understand and describe the dynamical behavior of solutions to such models given an initial statistical ensemble and have a precise description of how the inherent randomness built in these models propagates is fundamental to accurately predict wave phenomena when studying the natural world. This project is aimed at answering several central questions about long-time dynamics and the propagation of randomness in the context of nonlinear dispersive and wave phenomena. At the same time, the work of the project is designed to foster the training of graduate students and junior researchers in the U.S.<br/><br/>The synergy between deterministic and probabilistic approaches in the study of nonlinear evolution equations in the last few years has furthered our understanding of the dynamics of solutions in fundamental ways and opened the door to new paradigms that have moved research forward in various directions. To address important challenges at the cutting edge of current research, aimed at a quantitative understanding of the dynamical properties of generic wave phenomena, the principal investigator (PI) adopts an innovative approach based on the integration of methods and ideas from analysis, probability, statistical mechanics, dynamical systems, combinatorics and analytic number theory coupled with the impetus of recent new methods that were inspired by the spectacular advances in singular stochastic parabolic equations. As part of this project, the PI will explore several exciting directions in three areas of research at the forefront of nonlinear evolution equations, where the interplay of deterministic and probabilistic approaches is the key to make progress. The problems aim at studying the long-time dynamics of dispersive flows from a probabilistic viewpoint, the invariance of Gibbs measures for the nonlinear Hartree equation - arising from the mean field limit for the N-body Schrödinger equation - and for the nonlinear wave and Schrödinger equations on tori; and at the development of a new probabilistic quasilinear hyperbolic theory. The problems to be studied have the advantage that they are graded at different levels of difficulty, each leading to independent partial progress and deeper understanding.

The first part of the project concerns basic questions in the analysis of partial differential equations in Mathematical Biology. The second part of this project concerns the study of partial differential equations from kinetic theory in the presence of the physical kinetic boundary conditions. This project will involve training in research and teaching of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students from the University of Pennsylvania and other Universities. The project will also involve outreach to undergraduate students through the University of Pennsylvania Center for Undergraduate Research & Fellowships program. The principal investigator (PI) is fully committed to facilitating the training and education of these students through teaching courses, regular direct mentoring, and running regular research seminars. The PI is actively working to develop new innovative mathematics courses at the University of Pennsylvania in order to further the goal of developing a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce and to improve STEM education at the collegiate level. The PI is engaging in outreach activities to groups that are traditionally underrepresented in mathematics, and these activities will continue over the course of this project. The PI is further consistently working to increase the scientific knowledge of the community by giving national and international research presentations. The results of this project will be further disseminated through publication in journal articles and they will be posted on the PI's website. <br/> <br/>Problems in which an elastic structure interacts with the surrounding fluid, called Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems, are plentiful in science and engineering. These problems have many applications in Physics, Biology, and the Medical Sciences. Such FSI problems include the mathematical modeling of the flying of birds, the swimming of fish, and blood flow through the heart and blood vessels. FSI models have been intensively studied using computational methods. Many numerical algorithms have been developed for such problems, and the scientific computing of FSI problems continues to be a very active area of research. Despite their importance, these computational methods are poorly understood from an analytical standpoint. A major impediment for numerical analysis has been the lack of analytical understanding of the underlying nonlinear partial differential equations. A better theoretical understanding of the analytical aspects of these PDE should lead to improved computational algorithms for FSI problems. The PI seeks to address these issues by focusing on a set of canonical analytical FSI problems in the Stokes flow. The second part of this project is in kinetic theory. The Landau equation with Coulomb potential and the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation for the long-range interaction potentials are two fundamental mathematical models in collisional kinetic theory which describe the dynamics of a non-equilibrium rarefied gas and a dilute hot plasma. Plasmas appear in fundamental physical problems from Astrophysics, Nuclear fusion, and Tokamaks. The Boltzmann equation has been used as a mathematical model in a wide variety of places, for instance in high atmosphere aerodynamics, where the air is a very rarefied gas and fluid equations are probably not sufficient. Further, the study of boundary effects for these kinetic equations is physically very important because they describe the interaction, in the form of drag and heat transfer, between gas or plasma and a solid body. The objective of this research in both parts of the project is to fully understand the local-in-time well-posedness for large initial data, and the global-in-time well-posedness in a close to equilibrium setting, for several different fundamental physical models in nonlinear PDE. We expect that the techniques developed as part of this project will be useful for future mathematical and physical developments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems play an important role in mathematics, as well as having numerous applications in physics, biology, computer science and other sciences. Their range of application is growing, and will continue to grow given the widespread use of mathematical models by scientists and engineers.  A modern view of dynamical systems contains three classes, called elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic, depending on the increasing sensitivity to initial conditions of the system. The principal investigator will study this classification, with particular interest paid to the interconnections between the three classes and their interactions with various areas of mathematics and other sciences. The large span of the project provides rich training opportunities for graduate students. In addition, there are likely to be successful transfers of methodologies from one field to another in the theory of dynamical systems. <br/><br/>Elliptic dynamics often refers to recurrent behavior in dynamical systems that is at the other end of the spectrum from chaotic dynamics. The systems with stable asymptotic behavior that are best represented by quasi-periodic motions on tori, and which appear for example in KAM theory, are within elliptic dynamics. But instability is also possible in elliptic dynamics, due to the so-called Liouville phenomena, where the existence of fast periodic approximations may be the source of very complex ergodic behavior. Since chaotic dynamics, that is best represented by hyperbolic dynamical systems, is associated with exponential growth of orbit complexity, one may consider slow growth of various characteristics of such complexity as a hallmark of elliptic dynamics. In between the elliptic and the hyperbolic world lie the so-called parabolic dynamical systems, that are best represented by unipotent actions on homogeneous spaces. The polynomial shear or rate of separation between orbits of these flows makes their ergodic theory very special. The goal of this project is to push forward the study of these three paradigms, as well as to explore the interconnections between them. Some main directions are: KAM stability results beyond the classical theory; robust  unstable behavior in analytic Hamiltonian dynamics; approximation by the conjugation method  beyond its usual limits; extension of Ratner theory to non-algebraic parabolic flows; developing a KAM rigidity theory for higher rank parabolic actions; developing limit laws for higher rank hyperbolic actions and exploiting them in a systematic approach to Diophantine approximation theory; counting problems from a statistical point of view.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the major advances of modern physics has been the revelation that groups are not sufficient to capture the symmetries of a quantum system.

In condensed matter physics quantum systems equipped with a time evolution or Hamiltonian are often presented using lattice models: these are simplified models of a material at low temperature. When the energy gap of a quantum system is non-zero, some properties are robust to deformations of the system, leading to the notion of equivalence classes of systems known as gapped phases of matter. Some gapped phases, called invertible, are believed to be well approximated by topological quantum field theories, although this connection is not understood rigorously. However, Kitaev has proposed a more fundamental connection between topology and condensed matter physics, suggesting that invertible gapped phases are classified by a loop-spectrum in the sense of homotopy theory. The project team will make this precise by introducing  a cohomology theory of invertible gapped phases.

Complex analysis is concerned with functions involving complex numbers, which have broad use in mathematics, physics, and engineering applications. Complex analysis is often used when systems (such as a circuit) are encoded into a function which is studied as a means of understanding the system.  A common approach in the analysis of functions is to transform them into more readily accessible objects. In classical analysis, this transformation is often an integral transform, such as the Fourier transform, where members of the same family of functions are transformed into a form with a common structure (called a kernel) and a geometric object that encodes individual behavior (called a measure). Another approach to studying families of functions representing systems common in engineering is called realization, which turns a system into a simple form involving matrices that represent properties of the system being studied. For functions with more than one input, both approaches are enveloped by operator theory, which arose from the mathematical foundation of quantum physics. This project will use operators to study representations of more general families of functions and apply them to questions in several complex variables. There are many questions in this project that will be explored by groups of student researchers.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project is concerned with representations of functions that are bounded on certain domains as expressions of operators acting on associated Hilbert spaces and how the behavior of these functions at the boundary of their domains is encoded in the representations. Examples include the Pick functions, which play an important role in interpolation, probability, and engineering, and which possess well-known and useful representations in one variable (such as the Nevanlinna representation). One goal of the project is to extend methods of operator realizations into more general settings, including understanding concrete formulas for the operators in realizations and detailing the interplay between operator components and function regularity (in parallel with boundary measures in the classical theory) for functions that take matrix inputs. A second topic of the project is boundary problems in two or more variables, such as analogues of the Denjoy-Wolff problem on iteration of bounded functions on the complex disk.  The connected goals of this project are motivated by the important historical and continuing interplay between the representation of functions bounded on special domains and the study of boundary properties. This research has potential applications in several complex variables and free analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, the study of <br/>physical laws has led to the development of a refined mathematical framework where elaborate <br/>geometric structures are able to depict and model the interactions of elementary particles and the <br/>symmetries underlying quantum physics. Another example comes from networks, which are ubiquitous in modern society. From the <br/>World Wide Web and its powerful search engines to social networks, from telecommunication networks <br/>to economic systems, networks represent a wide range of real world systems. A network can naturally <br/>be seen as a geometric object by considering the number of edges of the shortest path connecting two <br/>nodes in the network as a quantity measuring their proximity. The shortest path distance on a graph is a <br/>fundamental example of an abstract mathematical object called ""metric"". The notion of a metric space is <br/>an overarching concept that is pivotal in mathematical models of optimization problems in networks, <br/>and in a vast range of application areas, including computer vision, computational biology, machine <br/>learning, statistics, and mathematical psychology, to name a few. This extremely useful abstract concept <br/>generalizes the classical notion of a Euclidean space, where the distance from point A to point B is <br/>computed as the length of a straight line connecting them. In numerous practical problems, <br/>the heart of the matter boils down to understanding whether we can find a<br/>representation of a given metric space, in particular a graph equipped with its shortest path distance, <br/>inside some other geometric object that we understand much better and that carries <br/>additional structure. Our ability to perform such a task in a <br/>quantitatively efficient way has tremendous applications. The project will provide opportunities for <br/>undergraduate students to develop a global mindset and superior communication skills, and graduate <br/>students to acquire the algorithmic and programming skills that are crucially needed in the modern <br/>workplace. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI proposes to implement in several instances the geometric approach, which is a <br/>strategy that consists in understanding and solving problems of seemingly non-geometric nature via the <br/>uncovering of a hidden metric structure that allows the application of a wealth of powerful metric <br/>techniques. Due to its versatility, the geometric approach has permeated virtually all fields of <br/>mathematics. Creating datasets with billions of entries has become a routine and ubiquitous task. <br/>Optimization, search, and data mining problems on these huge datasets are computationally extremely <br/>hard to solve. Graphs are natural mathematical models for many datasets, and a central computer <br/>science task is the design of efficient and fast approximation algorithms for optimization and search <br/>problems on various graphs. A graph is a combinatorial object of seemingly non-geometric nature. <br/>However, once equipped with a shortest path metric a graph becomes a metric space and the collection <br/>of all metrics supported on the graph carries geometric information that can be used to understand and <br/>study the combinatorial structure of the graph. After its rise in the mid-90's, there are by now numerous <br/>situations where availing to geometric embeddings of graphs, most notably embeddings into tree-<br/>metrics or into the classical Lebesgue sequence spaces, provides elegant, very often optimal, and on <br/>some occasions the only approximation algorithms for computationally intractable problems.  The first <br/>goal of this proposal is to advance significantly our understanding of the general problem of <br/>embeddability of finite metrics. In particular, we will investigate the connection between <br/>lamplighter metrics and Wasserstein metrics from an algorithmic perspective, and the geometry of thin <br/>Laakso structures in relation to the Metric Kadec-Pelczynski Problem. The second goal, which is <br/>motivated by the geometric approach to the Novikov conjecture in topology and to Gromov's positive <br/>scalar curvature conjecture in Riemannian geometry, is to advance significantly our understanding of the <br/>coarse geometry of Banach spaces and the asymptotic behavior of Banach spaces, most notably the <br/>relationship between concentration inequalities on non-locally finite graphs and the Szlenk index.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematicians call those tables matrices, and try to find hidden structure within them.  One such hidden signature is a list of numbers called eigenvalues that describes some of the properties of the larger matrix of numbers.  Eigenvalues not only summarize the information in a large array; they can reveal information that was hidden from plain view, through ubiquitous tools like principal component analysis that statisticians have used to great effect for decades.  The main purpose of this proposal is to explore promising new computational tools to understand the behavior of eigenvalues of very large matrices lacking any overall symmetry.  The PI and his team have discovered new and surprising connections between several different mathematical fields of study that can be used to compute the large-scale behavior of the eigenvalues of such symmetry-free matrices, opening the door to solve problems that have remained inaccessible for decades.  As a new methodology, there is much to explore including low-hanging fruit that is perfectly suited to research by Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers.

Since many objects in nature can be modeled by such spaces, functional analysis is frequently used by scientists from different backgrounds. Topics in functional analysis under the optics of large-scale geometry will be of particular interest. In a nutshell, large-scale geometry is the study of the global structure of certain mathematical objects (think of geometric behavior measured by an observer far away from the object of interest). This subject is motivated by computer science. Indeed, when working with large data sets, such methods aid the understanding of global behavior. Moreover, this framework provides the appropriate tools to study the relation between different data sets through large-scale geometric embeddings and equivalences between those objects. The PI will continue his engagement with undergraduate and graduate students, and seminar/conference organization.<br/> <br/>This project will improve our understanding of certain linear objects (for instance, operator algebras, Banach spaces, operator spaces, etc.), given some nonlinear information about them. It is divided into three main parts: (1) Roe algebras. The goal is to understand how much of the large-scale geometry of a uniformly locally finite metric space (or more generally, of a uniformly locally finite coarse space) is encoded in their uniform Roe algebras and Roe algebras. The questions in this area are often referred to as ?rigidity problems? for Roe algebras. Embeddings and isomorphisms between those algebras and how their existence affects the geometry of the metric spaces will be studied. (2) Quantization. The quantization of classic mathematical objects allows one to interpret structures connected to Hilbert spaces as ""noncommutative"" or ""quantum"" versions of their classical counterparts. In collaborative work, the PI has recently proposed a quantization of coarse spaces and uniform Roe algebras. Further developments in the quantization of large-scale geometric properties and their relation with uniform Roe algebras will be investigated. (3) Operator spaces. Although the nonlinear geometry of Banach spaces has been receiving attention, especially in the last two decades, its natural noncommutative counterpart (that is, the nonlinear theory of operator spaces) has been waiting to be developed. The plan is to understand how much of the commutative theory holds for operator spaces and apply those results to the strictly noncommutative scenario.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address important challenges in studying these equations, the PIs adopt an innovative approach combining deterministic and probabilistic perspectives.

Harmonic Analysis is a central area in today's Mathematics, with far-reaching connections to other fields of Science, from Number Theory to Physics. The meeting will focus on new developments in Harmonic Analysis that bring together the methods and perspectives of Noncommutative Geometry with those of Representation Theory. Both have seen spectacular advances over the past decades, leading them to become vast and vibrant areas of research, yet they remain mostly separated. The meeting will bring together experts in both fields to foster exchanges and incorporate new connections in the training of a new generation of researchers in Harmonic Analysis. In order to acquaint researchers in the two areas, especially early career researchers, with the perspectives from both sides, it will feature two mini-courses specifically aimed at graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and delivered by prominent mathematicians. Other activities will include research talks, discussion sessions and a poster session, giving participants many opportunities for meaningful interactions. Early career researchers will have the possibility to interact with established experts in a context particularly conducive to the formation of long-lasting mentoring relations. The organizers will strive to encourage participation of a diverse audience, including women and individuals from groups, organizations, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>At the foundation of Harmonic Analysis are the well-known principles that a geometric space may be studied through its space of functions, and that the analysis of these functions is simplified by taking into account the symmetries of the space. The decomposition of periodic functions into Fourier series is an elementary manifestation of this idea, which has been at the core of the pioneering work of Gelfand, Mackey, Dixmier and many others since the 1940s. In that regard, the Representation Theory and Noncommutative Geometry are both deeply rooted in Harmonic Analysis. Indeed, the study of tempered representations  generated an immense amount of activity in the second half of the twentieth century, culminating in Harish-Chandra's Plancherel theorem, the  realization of the discrete series and the classification of tempered irreducible representations by Knapp and Zuckerman. More recently, further efforts following Vogan's algebraic approach have led to a nearly complete computer-assisted description of all unitary representations of real algebraic groups. Now that classification questions have been given nearly complete answers, problems of different natures are receiving more attention. The analysis of functions on homogeneous spaces in terms of unitary representations leads to fundamental questions for which new conceptual tools are necessary. At the same time, recent results in Noncommutative Geometry clearly indicate that current investigations related to Index Theory and the topological approach to the tempered dual via the Connes-Kasparov isomorphism and the Mackey-Higson bijection provide original insight and new organizing principles in Representation Theory. The meeting will focus on extending the current methods beyond the group case to that of homogeneous spaces through joint effort of specialists from the two communities.

The plan for complex and real Monge-Ampère equations is to demonstrate the triviality of any global solution to complex Monge-Ampère equations including self-shrinking equations for the Kähler-Ricci flow with certain necessary restrictions and to derive regularity of solutions to the real Monge-Ampère equations under a noncollapsing condition. For the case of maximal surface systems the goal is to study the Bernstein problems for exterior solutions and regularity for solutions under a noncollapsing condition. The project will also take on Hamiltonian stationary equations, where it aims to establish existence of the solutions to the second boundary value problem and rigidity for the Hamiltonian stationary equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a powerful approach to answering combinatorial questions, often leading to exact and explicit enumerative formulas that are not obtainable from first principles. Asymptotic algebraic combinatorics deals with discrete structures whose defining parameters are extremely large, far exceeding the numerical range of everyday physical experience. In this setting, exact formulas become unwieldy and unusable; asymptotic algebraic combinatorics leverages algebraic methods to obtain useful approximations that are typically not accessible. The algebraic approach to asymptotic combinatorics is especially pertinent in the age of big data, where discrete structures loom large over the information landscape, but the tools to handle them are in short supply.

On the probabilistic side, the PI will build a theory of asymptotic Fourier analysis for large random matrices using recent analysis of large rank orbital integrals as a foundation. One of the main goals of this endeavor is to provide a toolbox that can be uniformly applied to both large random matrices and their quantized counterparts, random representations of large Lie groups. On the mathematical physics side, the PI plans to use the algebraic techniques underlying recent analysis of large rank link integrals to undertake a rigorous study of Yang-Mills partition functions, first revisiting the two-dimensional case and then moving to higher dimensions via link integrals.

Like a bell sounding its last notes, these problems all share a common feature: they exhibit oscillations with exponentially decaying amplitudes around an equilibrium state. A famous theoretical example concerns gravitational waves, recently detected by the LIGO detector. In technological settings, the ratio between the oscillation and decay rates to equilibrium is called the quality factor. Minimizing this ratio improves the stability and rigidity properties of the materials involved. Such technological applications include engineering graphene-like insulators; conception of waveguides and optic fibers; and design of high-quality microelectrical systems. <br/><br/>The mathematical study of such phenomena relies on a unified framework called resonance theory. It investigates natural  generalizations of time-harmonic states in situations where the energy may escape or decay. Generalized energies of such states form a discrete set of complex numbers called quantum resonances (in quantum scattering), quasinormal modes (in general relativity) or Pollicott--Ruelle resonances (in dynamical systems). Their imaginary parts describe the typical frequency of the associated resonant states while the real parts describe their decay or growth outside bounded regions. Mathematically, they are the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the Hamiltonian resolvent. Much of the theoretical work consists in studying their stability and asymptotic distributions; and how they affect time evolution. This project specifically deals with the emergence of resonances under symmetry-breaking perturbations in periodic structures; the exponential convergence of Hawking radiation in black-hole spacetimes; and the relation between topology and Pollicott--Ruelle resonances in dynamical systems.

One of the most famous distance questions is called the Erdös distinct distance problem, which asks for the least number of distinct distances generated by a given set of points. Another example is the unit distance problem, concerning the maximum number of times that a fixed distance can occur among a given set of points. These questions have motivated development of tools and ideas that have wide applications in disciplines beyond mathematics, such as computer sciences, physics, and engineering. Fourier restriction concerns the Fourier transform, which decomposes a function into pieces with different frequencies of oscillation. Fourier restriction studies a fundamental question about Fourier transform: the relation between the size of a function and the geometry of its Fourier transform. This relation has important applications in partial differential equations, number theory, and other areas. This research project aims to further the understanding of the interplay between distance questions and Fourier restriction, as well as to develop modern tools with applications in various areas of mathematics, including harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and partial differential equations.<br/><br/>One of the main directions in the project is driven by Falconer's conjecture, a continuous analogue of the distinct distance problem. It is conjectured that the distance set of a compact set E must have positive measure if the Hausdorff dimension of E exceeds a certain threshold. Recent results towards resolving the conjecture were obtained via new ideas from Fourier restriction theory: incidence geometry and geometric measure theory. This project will continue investigation of these approaches and apply them to other related distance questions such as general geometric configurations, multiparameter distances, and projections of fractal measures. The work aims to further the study of weighted Fourier restriction estimates and decoupling and to apply them to distance questions. The project is expected to reveal deeper connections between the discrete and continuous setting. An investigation of Fourier restriction for the cone in high dimensions will be continued using algebraic tools in connection with polynomial methods. In addition, the project will explore further applications of Fourier restriction in dispersive partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studied within the framework of this project will be optimal point configurations and measures through the prism of harmonic analysis. The project will also study fundamental questions regarding uniform distribution of energy minimizers; determination of optimal distributions; discrete clustering phenomena; the interplay between geometry and uniform distribution; connections between discrepancy and energy minimization. In addition, the project will study related questions in applied harmonic analysis, compressed sensing, and frame theory. The results and topics of this project will be disseminated through publications and presentations, and young mathematicians will actively be mentored. <br/><br/>The quality of a point distribution may be expressed or measured in a variety of different ways depending on the problem at hand. Examples include lattices, cubature formulas, codes, packings, and random point processes. This project is focused on two central inter-connected concepts, both of which quantify the uniformity of distributions: discrepancy and energy minimization.  The former compares a given distribution with the uniform measure by looking at the errors on a certain class of test sets or test functions. The latter interprets points as ?particles?, which interact according to a certain potential. While progress in these subjects often relies on methods and ideas of harmonic analysis, many of these connections have only been discovered recently. This leads to natural cross-fertilization: analysis provides the necessary tools, and at the same time it is enriched with new questions.

Modern society relies extensively on engineering applications involving transmission of waves. Cell phone communications, satellite data transmissions and information on the internet - all sent along thousands of miles of glass fiber cables - are controlled by mathematics describing the motion of waves. A striking feature of the wave propagation, and the topic of this project, is its universality. In fact, waves propagating on astronomical scales such as the gravitational waves detected by LIGO, as well as waves on a microscopic scale such as those emitted by atoms in the form of electromagnetic radiation in a laser, are governed by exactly the same mathematical theories. It is therefore of the utmost strategic importance for the well-being and safety of the society at large to train young specialists in the PI?s area of research; this is also one of the goals of this project. Experience shows that this broader impact can only be achieved by scientists who are actively working at the frontier of knowledge. <br/><br/>The PI recently completed a perturbative analysis of equivariant critical wave maps into the 2-sphere, without any symmetry assumptions on the perturbations. This nonlinear analysis is based on the semi-classical representations of wave functions for Bessel-type potentials which the PI developed more than a decade ago in the context of the Price law in general relativity. Application of this new technique is planned to other nonlinear evolution equations, which admit separation of variables and a reduction to an infinite system of coupled semi-classical wave equations. The role of the semi-classical parameter h is typically played by the reciprocal of the angular momentum. Another area in which spectral theory is now coming to the fore is the rapidly developing field of asymptotic stability of topological solitons, specifically of kink solutions for one-dimensional scalar fields. Jointly with others, the PI recently demonstrated how to treat Klein-Gordon equations with a nongeneric potential and long-range nonlinearities. The basic scalar field equations each exhibit a nongeneric potential with a threshold resonance and are therefore of the type to be considered in this project. The PI's work on quasi-periodic localization and its ramifications will be continued. A particularly challenging novel perspective will be offered by nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems, where there are strong indications that it is possible to bring Anderson localization techniques to bear.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Von Neumann algebras were introduced by John von Neumann in his mathematical account of quantum mechanics and consist of infinite-sized matrices closed under various natural operations.  Quantum complexity theory considers the difficulty of solving or verifying solutions to decision problems using the quantum model of computation, that is to say, computers that run according to the laws of quantum physics as opposed to classical physics.  Recently, a landmark result in quantum complexity theory showed that classically unsolvable decision problems could be reliably verified by a quantum computer.  This quantum complexity result established a negative solution to a famous problem in operator algebras, the so-called Connes Embedding Problem, posed in 1976, which asks whether or not every von Neumann algebra can be approximated by a simple von Neumann algebra known as the hyperfinite II_1 factor.  Using techniques from model theory, a branch of mathematical logic that studies classes of structures by examining what is expressible about them using first-order logic, the PI and a collaborator greatly simplified and elucidated the connection between the quantum complexity result and the solution to the Connes Embedding Problem.  This project plans to deepen the connection between these three areas by isolating the exact model-theoretic content behind the quantum complexity result and deducing further von Neumann algebraic consequences. <br/><br/>More specifically, the PI plans on extending the model-theoretic analysis of the quantum complexity result to understand the complexity of the full first-order theory of the hyperfinite II_1 factor; the PI's work with Hart established this connection for the one-quantifier theory.  In addition, the PI plans to pursue proofs of the failure of the Connes Embedding Problem which avoid the use of the quantum complexity result by using the model-theoretic notions of existentially closed models and Robinson forcing; due to the difficulty in proving the quantum complexity result, a new proof along these lines would serve as a great simplification of the resolution of the Connes Embedding Problem.  The project will also study other uses of model theory in von Neumann algebra theory, including furthering progress on Popa's embedding problem, which asks about the existence of certain kinds of ergodic embeddings of II_1 factors into ultrapowers.  The PI also plans on making progress on the C*-algebra version of the Connes Embedding Problem known as the Kirchberg Embedding Problem, which asks if every C*-algebra is approximated by the Cuntz algebra, an algebra of extreme importance in the classification program for nuclear C*-algebras.  Finally, while the majority of the model-theoretic study of von Neumann algebras has focused on so-called finite algebras, the PI plans on studying the model-theoretic properties of arbitrary von Neumann algebras through the lens of W*-probability spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The answers to such questions as ""How fast can this process go?"" and ""How rapidly can information be communicated through this channel?"" often turn on the discovery of new mathematical inequalities, which are the central theme of much of the project. The problems to be investigated are of significant interest within pure mathematics as well. But because they are motivated by problems arising in other fields, especially physics and quantum information theory, their solution will have impact and applications outside of pure mathematics. Students will be involved in the project, contributing to training of the next generation of researchers.<br/><br/>The connection between mathematical inequalities and physical processes runs both ways. So, in trying to prove a particular inequality, one may try to relate it to a simple and well understood evolution equation. This area of research has been fruitful not only in producing results that are of interest to a wider scientific community, but also in engaging the interest of Ph.D. students. The project places particular emphasis on proving functional inequalities in sharp form. This means to completely solve the following variational problem: find the minimum value of some functional and determine the full set of equality cases. Some of the questions go further and seek stability results for such sharp inequalities, i.e., theorems that assert that when a certain function almost yields equality in a functional inequality, then that function is close in some metric to one of the cases of equality. Such stability results have many important implications. Both their proofs and applications will be worked on by the PI and his collaborators.

Free boundaries are regions of rapid variations of conditions between two very different states, such as shock waves in gas dynamics. Mathematically, this rapid transition is simplified as occurring infinitely fast along a surface of discontinuity in the partial differential equation governing the physics. The location of this surface is not known in advance, thus one must solve both for physical states and their boundaries. Significant progress in the study of free boundary problems has been made during the last several decades. However, in the case of nonlinear partial differential equations, and especially equations of mixed type, many important questions are yet to be studied. The principal investigator (PI) plans to apply the techniques of free boundary problems to study some fundamental multidimensional shock waves in gas dynamics, specifically shock reflection patterns. This involves free boundary problems for nonlinear equations and systems having a complex structure, and thus new methods need to be developed to handle such problems. Understanding properties of free boundaries, such as regularity, stability and geometric properties, allows for a better analysis and numerical methods in models and applications. Another area of the project is the semigeostrophic system, a model of rotation-dominated atmospheric/ocean flows. It exhibits a rich mathematical structure based on Monge-Kantorovich mass transport theory. The PI plans to continue the study of the physically realistic case of variable Coriolis parameter in the semigeostrophic model, and also study stability properties of solutions. The project addresses fundamental mathematical models in engineering and atmospheric sciences. Closer interaction with the engineering and meteorological communities is one of the priorities of the project. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The project consists of two main topics: (1) Free boundary problems in shock analysis. The PI will continue work on self-similar shock reflection for potential flow and for the full and isentropic Euler system. Shock reflection problems arise in many physical situations. Moreover, such problems are important in the mathematical theory of multidimensional conservation laws since their solutions are building blocks and asymptotic attractors of general solutions to the multidimensional Euler equations for compressible fluids. Self-similar equations of compressible fluid dynamics are of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type. Shocks correspond to discontinuities in the solution to the Euler system and in the gradient of the solution for potential flow equation. The type of the equation may change from hyperbolic to elliptic across the shock. The shock reflection problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem in which the unknowns are the elliptic region and the solution in that region. The PI will continue work on the existence, stability, and regularity of global solutions to the regular reflection, to extend the global existence results to the case of compressible Euler system and three-dimensional reflection by a cone. Further study includes stability for the regular reflection problem in various classes of solutions. (2) The study of the system of semigeostrophic equations, using methods from Monge-Kantorovich mass transport. The PI will study the semigeostrophic system with variable Coriolis parameter, which is a model that arises from taking into account the curvature of the Earth.

This project aims to extend previous studies of finite time evolution of such systems to a much larger class of systems, which will include some models with practical applications. Another part of this research deals with systems where the motion of a point particle is substituted by a particle of nonzero size. The study of such systems has led to some new findings in quantum chaos and new interpretations of experimental data. The research will extend this theory to dimensions greater than two, which would allow application to interpretations of a much larger class of numerical and experimental data on physical systems. A third topic of the research deals with understanding whether and how probabilistic time-irreversible laws of statistical mechanics could be rigorously derived from deterministic time-reversible laws of classical mechanics.

Namely, it allows the prediction of which events will likely occur first, e. g., which subset of the phase space the orbits will more likely visit. Thus far, this theory has been developed for Bernoulli shifts with equal probabilities of states. Similar results will be proved for Bernoulli shifts with non-equal probabilities and for Markov shifts. The principles for constructing chaotic (hyperbolic) particle-like flows will be reconsidered, and new ones will be created. Physical particles where a finite size hard sphere moves instead of a point particle will be analyzed in dimensions higher than two. A simple model with two discs localized in ""cells"" but allowed to collide with each other and with two pistons will be studied. In the model, each cell is connected to (bounded by) a thermostat, the thermostats have different temperatures, and the pistons do not allow the discs to stop for a long time or move very slowly for a long time. A goal is to prove that on average (in time) the disc in a cell with a higher temperature thermostat will have a higher energy.

One goal of this project is to use tools from von Neumann algebras to provide insights into so-called ?quantum expanders? which have applications to quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.

One objective is to further develop the theory and use of cohomological rigidity techniques in Popa?s deformation/rigidity theory based on techniques developed by the PI jointly with collaborators on the existence and uniqueness of maximal rigid subalgebras of deformations. This could lead to progress towards settling two outstanding conjectures in the field, the Peterson-Thom conjecture and absence of Cartan subalgebras for von Neumann algebras of groups having nontrivial first cohomology with coefficients in the left-regular representation. Techniques from continuous model theory will also be explored as potential avenues to these conjectures by attempting to find noncommutative analogs to Anderson and Keisler?s model theoretic approach to stochastic differential equations.

One of the major advances of modern physics has been the revelation that groups are not sufficient to capture the symmetries of a quantum system.

This behavior is observed in many other partial differential equations that are classified as ""parabolic"". In general, the regularization effect of the equation plays a key role in our understanding of the nature of solutions and in obtaining a priori bounds for them.

When the particles are assumed to repel each other in small scales by a power law potential, the equation exhibits a subtle regularization effect, driven by a nonlinear integro-differential diffusion that acts like an elliptic operator of fractional order.

The principal investigator is also interested in studying more general and abstract fully nonlinear parabolic equations, in order to understand their regularity and possible singularity formation.

Classical examples are the isoperimetric problem (find the solid of minimal perimeter enclosing a given volume) and the Plateau problem (finding the surface of minimal area spanning a given boundary curve). In the last 50 years, geometric variational problems have found a number of surprising applications in both pure and applied mathematics. Their solutions can describe the equilibrium configurations of physical systems in Mathematical Physics, the behavior of black holes in General Relativity, or they can provide preferred representatives in homology and homotopy classes in Differential Topology. For solutions of geometric variational problems, the presence of singularities is unavoidable and it is linked to the physical behavior of the systems they model or to the concentration of topological obstructions in geometric problems. A fine description of the regular and singular set is of fundamental importance in our understanding of the underlying problem. This project aims to enhance our understanding of the qualitative and quantitative behavior of solutions of geometric variational problems by addressing a series of basic questions concerning their regularity and the description of their singularities. The answer to these questions will require the development of new methods and techniques, which will also be valuable in other areas of mathematics. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Despite the great amount of study dedicated to geometric variational problems, several basic questions concerning the regular and singular behavior of their solutions are still poorly understood. This project is intended to address these questions and to develop new tools and techniques to tackle them. The project involves work on four deeply interconnected directions of research: boundary regularity for mass minimizing currents, regularity of critical points of anisotropic surface tensions, regularity of solutions to spectral optimization and free boundary problems, and the structure of PDE constrained measures. Their study will require the interaction of techniques coming from different areas of mathematics, such as Partial Differential Equations (PDE), Geometric Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory, Topology, and Harmonic Analysis, as well as the introduction of new ones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI also seeks physical and spectral interpretations of the peculiar probability measures that arise when one considers limits of certain combinatorial processes.

The connection between discrete geometry (lattices) and operator theory (Toeplitz determinants and frames) has also proven fruitful.

An important fractal set is the Mandelbrot set, which has played a major role in dynamical systems and is one of the most recognizable fractal sets in mathematics. Among central themes of this project is understanding certain self-similarity aspects of the Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set encodes how a quadratic polynomial depends on a parameter. It is a test object for several fundamental problems in dynamics, in particular on how exactly chaos arises, even in simple systems. The proposed activity also covers topics involving higher degree rational maps (i.e., ratios of polynomials).

The projects on fluids and related equations will allow one to make rigorous mathematical predictions about the formation and structure of shock waves (e.g. sonic booms). A key new contribution will be accounting for the presence of swirling motion, a notoriously complex phenomenon that is ubiquitous in nature. The projects in General Relativity will make rigorous predictions about whether a Big Bang occurred in the past, based on assumptions about the present state of the universe. The results will rigorously confirm the dynamic stability of the Big Bang for the full range of situations where it has been expected to occur, thus providing a proof of a conjecture that has its roots in ideas stretching back 50 years. A common theme unifying the projects in fluids and gravity is that they involve wave-like motion. In previous work, the PI developed new tools for the study of waves, shaped by ideas from geometry. In particular, his recent work has shown that the equations of fluid motion have some unexpected, remarkable commonalities with Einstein?s equations. These connections allow the PI to blend insights and techniques from the seemingly separate fields of fluids and gravity, which in turn serves as a driving force behind the projects. The research directions are highly interdisciplinary and are ripe with opportunities for training the next generation of researchers across disciplines. Undergraduates, Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral researchers will be involved in the work of the project. <br/> <br/>In a first line of research, the PI will study stable shock-forming solutions to the compressible Euler equations in three spatial dimensions, with a focus on giving a complete description of the maximal classical development up to the boundary. A key new feature of the research is that the vorticity and entropy can be non-zero, and the behavior of these quantities must be tracked all the way up to the boundary. Because the shape of the boundary is unknown in advance, and because elliptic estimates are needed to control the vorticity and entropy, the analysis requires a multitude of new geometric techniques and insights about fluid flow. In a second line of research, the PI will study the shock development problem for various multiple speed quasilinear hyperbolic PDE systems. This is the problem of describing the transition of initially smooth solutions past their first shock singularity in a manner such that they become unique weak solutions, while simultaneously constructing the shock hypersurface, across which the solution jumps. The shock development problem for multiple speed systems in multiple spatial dimensions is completely open. This research requires new techniques that account for the distinct singularity strengths exhibited by the different solution variables as they transition across the shock hypersurface. In a third line of research, the PI will study stable Big Bang formation (i.e., stable curvature blowup along an entire spacelike hypersurface) in solutions to Einstein's equations. The proposed approach is based on a new gauge that will allow one to prove stable Big Bang formation in the entire regime where it has been conjectured to occur. Due to the character of Big Bang singularities and shock singularities, the methods have deep analytical connections to the problems on shocks. Conversely, the techniques relevant for the problems on shocks have their origins in General Relativity.

To achieve the requisite accuracy, GPS, for example, relies on general relativity, which in turn postulates that gravity is the result of a curved space-time on which waves travel rather than an external force. And in many applications involving nonlinear equations, the governing systems have geometry that depends on the solution but the solution in turn depends on the geometry. Einstein?s equations, which are at the heart of general relativity and determine the evolution of a universe from a given starting state, can be realized as such a system of wave equations in certain coordinate systems. On background geometries, waves flow along special curves called geodesics rather than rays as is more familiar. A phenomenon called trapping occurs when some of these geodesics remain in a bounded set for all time. This occurs, for example, on known black hole space-times where there are indeed regions where light orbits the black hole rather than tending toward infinity. Trapping is a known obstruction to typical measures of dispersion, and a major focus of this project is to precisely quantify its effect in numerous scenarios. The project provides research training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The problems to be examined largely focus on integrated local energy estimates, which are generalizations of the original estimates of Morawetz, and their application to nonlinear equations. Major initiatives include improving our understanding of such estimates in the presence of trapping and on non-stationary backgrounds. The construction of space-times with degenerate trapping provided the first examples where an algebraic loss of regularity is both necessary and sufficient for recovering local energy estimates. Numerous questions related to these examples remain unexplored, including the discovery of space-times with degenerate trapping outside of the highly symmetric warped product setting. Local energy estimates can be used to establish long-time existence for nonlinear equations and have particular benefits in the presence of background geometry.

The multiple-scale method, spectral analysis, application of dispersive estimates, and monotonicity bounds are core methods that will be utilized and extended. Several focus problems are identified in which some classical feature, like scale-invariance or a property of localized influence, have been removed or weakened, providing the stimulus to develop new techniques, while at the same time, provide new descriptions of real physical phenomena.

The first one investigates to what extent one can approximate the minimizers (and their Euler-Lagrange equations) of convex functionals with a convexity constraint by solutions of singular Abreu equations which arise in complex geometry. One of such functionals is the Rochet-Chone model for the monopolist's problem in economics. The second part aims to establish the global solvability of highly singular Abreu equations. These fourth order equations can be rewritten as systems of a Monge-Ampere equation and a linearized Monge-Ampere equation.

Harmonic analysis studies how general functions can be represented by sums of simpler functions, for instance, trigonometric functions. Analytic number theory is a branch of number theory that uses tools from mathematical analysis to answer questions concerning the integers. Recently, tools in harmonic analysis have proven to be very efficient in answering questions originating from analytic number theory. This project continues the investigation in the intersection of these two fields, in the hope of creating a dictionary between them that would allow researchers in one field to translate their tools to the other. The project also provides undergraduate students access to the forefront of current research. The PI plans to organize summer schools to attract more undergraduate and early graduate students to carry out interdisciplinary research in harmonic analysis and analytic number theory.<br/><br/>The project involves work in decoupling theory, oscillatory integral theory, and their applications in analytic number theory and combinatorics. One goal in the development of decoupling theory is to obtain sharp decoupling inequalities for all polynomial surfaces that are translation-dilation invariant (TDI in short). This would imply sharp bounds on the number of integral solutions to all TDI systems of Diophantine equations. As a first step towards this goal, the PI will study two particularly important systems: TDI systems of monomials and TDI systems generated by one polynomial. In oscillatory integral theory, the PI also will study two problems. The first problem asks for the optimal Sobolev regularity estimates for an averaging operator along moment curves. The second problem asks for sharp Lebesgue estimates for maximal averaging operators along moment curves. It is expected that local smoothing estimates for linear wave equations and related decoupling inequalities will play key roles in the study of these two problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to understand these objects by decomposing them into simpler pieces, embedding them into classical geometries, or approximating them by linear objects. Non-smooth analysis and geometry are important in many areas of pure and applied mathematics and computer science, since non-smooth problems arise in studying large data sets, in computational questions, and as limiting cases of smooth problems.

Building on his recent collaborative work, the principal investigator will study when Lipschitz mappings into metric spaces can be decomposed into or well-approximated by simpler mappings, like linear maps or maps that factor through trees. The principal investigator then plans to apply these techniques to provide new structural results on geometric objects defined through Lipschitz maps, like distance spheres or medial axes. The principal investigator will also investigate similar questions related to curves in metric spaces, continuing work on extensions of the so-called ?Analyst?s Traveling Salesman Theorem? that links lengths of curves to quantitative flatness conditions.

The term ""nonlinear"" refers to a property of size-dependent response and the term ""dispersive"" refers to how the fluctuations of the wave influence the speed and direction of motion. At the mathematical level, one studies the behavior of general solutions and special types of solutions to these equations and seeks to provide quantitative descriptions of phenomena observed in the physical setting. In this project, the investigators explore how coherent waves travel - whether they retain their shape despite encountering obstacles, break apart and dissolve, or collapse into a singularity. Each of these possibilities hinges on both the nonlinear and the dispersive character of the equations; over the past several decades, mathematical techniques have been developed to model and measure these properties. The project aims to improve existing methods and apply the methods in new directions. The project contains educational efforts at various levels of mathematical learning. These include advising undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars, with special emphasis on attracting underrepresented minorities. <br/> <br/>The main objective of the research will be to provide analytical descriptions of the behavior of solutions to certain classes of nonlinear dispersive equations. The two main categories of equations considered are the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) family and the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) family. Both classes of equations satisfy powerful dispersive estimates called local virial estimates, and the KdV family in addition satisfies a monotonicity property that controls the movement of mass. The multiple-scale method, spectral analysis, application of dispersive estimates, and monotonicity bounds are core methods that will be utilized and extended. Several focus problems are identified in which some classical feature, like scale-invariance or a property of localized influence, have been removed or weakened, providing the stimulus to develop new techniques, while at the same time, provide new descriptions of real physical phenomena. The phenomena of primary interest are the dynamics of coherent structures like solitary waves and line solitons as they interact with each other and their environment, and the description of how singular collapsing solutions arise and their asymptotic description.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As quantum physics can be described via applied operator theory the two special sessions on quantum physics and on super-oscillations are at the forefront of one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century: quantum computing. The theory of stochastic processes and operator theory have numerous intersections, which require deep tools of operator theory to explore. Stochastic processes and their derivatives (usually generalized stochastic processes) may be studied using the theory of Gelfand triples, obtained by applying the Bochner-Minlos theorem to a positive definite function on a Frechet nuclear space. Replacing the Fock space by the free Fock space, one arrives at the non-commutative setting. In a similar vein, replacing the complex numbers by the Grassmann algebra or by a ternary algebra one gets new connections with super mathematics and manifolds. Four of the special sessions focus on this circle of ideas. Recent research in bicomplex, ternary, and quaternionic analysis use operator theory techniques to relate the intrinsic analytic structure and the many types of operators that arise and obtain realization formulas in each case. Applicability of some techniques in a more general hypercomplex setting provides even more applications to physics and digital signal processing.
