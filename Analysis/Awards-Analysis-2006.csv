Frames represent a theoretical underpinning of Signal processing. In the context of A/D conversion it is crucial to quantize signals, or, abstractly speaking, the coefficients in a frame-expansion. Using infinite dimensional Banach space theory the author intends to formulate and prove results which provide the theoretical background for such quantizations. He will build on results already proven for basis-expansions. The author intends also to continue his research on the following fundamental questions of Geometrical Functional Analysis: Does there exist a bounded linear operator on any infinite dimensional Banach space which is not a compact perturbation of  a multiple of the identity? The principal investigator proposes to explore several interesting variations on this theme, each with a distinctly structure-theoretical flavor. Secondly, the author proposes to work on several structure theoretical questions in Banach spaces, which concern their co-ordinate systems. These problems can be summarized under the following general question: Given a separable Banach space, how close can we find an other space containing the first one which has a finite dimensional decomposition (or even a basis)?<br/><br/>"

At least to a first approximation, such equations can be taken to be linear and can be profitably viewed as acting on spaces of functions.  These space often possess a notion of length like that in Euclidean space which results in what is called a Hilbert space.  The study of operators or linear transformations on such spaces has led to new insights in our understanding of quantum mechanics in physics and systems theory in electrical engineering.  There are also strong interactions of operator theory with other parts of mathematics including geometry and topology.  In recent years, researchers have turned much of their interest to studying more than one operator at a time, often assuming that they commute.  As one might guess, the mathematical phenomena modeled can be quite intricate and they rest on notions and concepts from algebra and geometry.  Moreover, the questions and results obtained have enriched these fields as well as providing powerful tools to study this multi-variable operator theory.<br/><br/>While the study of self-adjoint multivariate operator theory is many decades old, the current proposal concerns the non-self adjoint case which has strong ties to algebraic and complex geometry.  The basic notion of module from algebra is adapted to the Hilbert space setting.  One considers examples in which holomorphic vector bundles arise naturally and curvature and higher order notions of curvature allow one to mediate results in operator theory.  In the current proposal, the principal focus is on quotient modules and modeling their structure and kernel function using a new jet bundle constructed precisely for this purpose.  The case when the quotient module is determined by a hyper surface is pretty well under control, at least for the ideal of functions vanishing to low order in the normal direction.  Extending this understanding to other ideals determined by varieties with higher co dimension is the next large step and will be at the center of efforts over the next two  years.<br/>"

Recently, there has been great progress in the problem of the existence of invariant subspaces of operators relative to a von Neumann algebra having a finite trace. A von Neumann algebra with a finite trace is an infinite dimensional, noncommutative analogue of a probability space, and many important classes of operators can be found inside von Neumann algebras having finite traces. However, the essential unsolved case and a key class of operators left virtually untouched by this recent progress is the class of quasinilpotent operators in a finite von Neumann algebra. The proposed research seeks to find invariant subspaces for them, relative to their von Neumann algebras. Free probability theory is an analogue of usual probability theory where independence is replaced by freeness, a completely noncommutative notion. Free probability theory and its off spring, free entropy, have been at the heart of much progress over the last decade in understanding certain classes of operators and von Neumann algebras with finite trace, called the free group factors. However, an outstanding open problem on them is whether all free group factors are isomorphic to each other or whether they constitute a diverse family. At the moment, this problem seems intimately bound up with the question of whether free entropy dimension is an invariant for von Neumann algebras having finite trace, or whether it can take different values on different sets of generators of a given von Neumann algebra. A second part of the proposed research will test this invariance question by computing the free entropy dimension of certain recently discovered ""exotic"" generators of free group factors."

A quintessential example of instability in Hamiltonian systems was described by Arnold in 1964: it represents a simple mechanical system, consisting in a pendulum and two rotators with a weak coupling, whose trajectories wander `wildly' and `arbitrarily far' from their points of departure in the phase space. This example gave rise to a conjecture, referred as Arnold instability, stating that such a behavior occurs in rather general systems. The first objective of this project is to investigate this conjecture on some general models and identify various geometric and topological mechanisms of instability. Perturbations of integrable Hamiltonian systems will be considered. Under certain non-degeneracy assumptions, there exist families of KAM tori that posses invariant manifolds; the invariant manifolds give rise to connecting orbits between nearby tori, but separating gaps also appear. The main goal is to find diffusing trajectories that move along the connections that link these tori and also move across the gaps, traveling a uniform distance as the size of the perturbation tends to zero. Some of these trajectories should be able to make chaotic excursions. The methodology of this research will be based on a topological technique of correctly aligned windows, reinforced with geometric approximation theory and variational methods. The main goals of this research are to overcome the large gap problem, obtain optimal estimates on the diffusion time, relax the transversality and non-degeneracy assumptions on the system, and study the existence of diffusion for large perturbations. The second objective of this project is to apply the knowledge gained from the study of Arnold instability to the three-body problem. The goal is to understand the geometric mechanisms that produce chaotic motions and find optimal trajectories with prescribed itineraries. The objectives of this project will be addressed both theoretically and numerically.<br/><br/>The general context of this research is the study of the cumulative effect of small perturbations applied periodically to a stable system. This study originated from a question that goes back to Netwon, Lagrange and Laplace, whether the Solar System in the distant future will keep the same form as it is now, or will undergo a catastrophic change. If in some perturbed systems, like the Solar System, stability is predominant, in some other systems instability is typical.  The Arnold instability can be viewed as a recipe on how to increase the energy of physical systems with small periodic forcing. Arnold instability ideas applied to the three-body problem have potential applications to spacecraft dynamics, in designing fuel efficient space missions exploring various regions of the Solar System. The techniques outlined in this project can also be used in studying the dynamics of planets orbiting systems of binary stars, and of mass transfers in tight binary star systems (e.g. Algol in Betta Persei). Other possible applications include heart pacemaking, plasma confinement, and accelerator physics. Additionally, this project will enhance the knowledge and professional development of students and K-12 educators. It will directly engage students, including members of underrepresented groups, in research activities and mathematics education.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Schramm's <br/>recent discovery of the stochastic Loewner evolution SLE, the <br/>Loewner equation driven by one-dimensional Brownian motion, has <br/>opened up a new area of investigations involving conformal mappings, <br/>probability theory and mathematical physics. It has led to the <br/>discovery of new results in percolation and random walks, for <br/>example, as well as the discovery mathematical proofs of results <br/>known to the theoretical physics community. The Loewner equation is <br/>also related to an algorithm for numerical conformal mapping <br/>discovered by Marshall and K\""uhnau. The Loewner equation has as <br/>input an arbitrary continuous function and produces a continuous <br/>family of conformal mappings. Marshall plans to investigate <br/>properties of the solutions of Loewner's equation under various <br/>assumptions on the smoothness of the driving function, and <br/>conversely to investigate how smoothness of the boundaries of the <br/>associated regions implies smoothness of the driving function. This <br/>is a classical problem where progress has been made only recently. <br/>Marshall will analyze convergence and error-estimates for the <br/>numerical mapping method called ``zipper'', closely related to <br/>Loewner's equation, and improve the speed of convergence using <br/>``generational'' techniques.<br/><br/>The main theme of Marshall's research program is to study conformal <br/>mappings generated by the Loewner differential equation, and related <br/>topics. Conformal mappings have been used as a tool in science and <br/>engineering for many years. They are often used to change <br/>coordinates from a complicated region to a simpler region like a <br/>disc. Physical processes are modeled by partial differential <br/>equations. A partial differential equation on the complicated two <br/>dimensional region can be changed by a conformal map to a similar <br/>equation on the disc, a setting where it is easier to solve. <br/>Classically, this method was used for problems related to Laplace's <br/>equation, such as electrostatics and two dimensional fluid flow. <br/>Numerous non-classical applications have been developed in the last <br/>three decades such as electro-magnetics, vibrating membranes and <br/>acoustics, transverse vibrations and buckling of plates, elasticity, <br/>and heat transfer. Fundamental research in conformal mapping and <br/>conformal field theory are important directions in mathematics and <br/>physics respectively. The fusion of Loewner's differential equation <br/>and probability forms a bridge between these two areas. This project <br/>is likely to increase the understanding of solutions to Loewner's <br/>equation, as foundational work, which should increase its usefulness <br/>in understanding stochastic processes. Broader impacts include the <br/>continued improvement and dissemination of the conformal mapping <br/>computer codes, which have been used by a number of investigators <br/>not in mathematics, as well as mathematicians.

The PI and N. Wickramasekera propose to use tools from <br/>geometric measure theory, which have been very successful in similar <br/>situations in geometric analysis. They have remarked that Weiss' new <br/>monotonicity formulas yield similar information to the one provided by the <br/>monotonicity formulas for energy minimizing harmonic maps and area <br/>minimizing surfaces. The proposed program follows the schemes which have <br/>lead to the successful resolution of these 2 major problems.<br/><br/><br/>Two-phase free boundary regularity problems arise naturally in physics, <br/>chemistry and engineering. In optimal design and optimal control problems <br/>within the context of electrochemical machining with threshold current, <br/>the surface between the anode and the electrolytic solution plays the role <br/>of the free boundary. In the symmetric plane flow model of jets with two <br/>fluids the outer jet is surrounded by air, so the flow region has two free <br/>boundaries: the boundary of the outer fluid and the boundary between the <br/>two fluids. The central problem of characterizing the regularity of the <br/>free boundary has been studied by many authors. Over the last 3 years the <br/>PI and C.

The proposed research provides a different outlet for <br/>geometric measure theory (GMT), a field of Mathematics that has <br/>contributed greatly to the development of the calculus of variations and <br/>geometric analysis. The success of the project would provide a road map <br/>for a new generation interested in applying GMT techniques to more <br/>concrete problems.

The effect is easily observed in abelian groups, thanks to Fourier theory and Pontrjagin duality, but the situation is more involved for nonabelian groups, whose unitary representation theory is too complicated to admit a direct descriptive account.  However the perspective on dual spaces provided by Alain Connes noncommutative geometry makes it possible to formulate instances of this large-scale to small-scale phenomenon for nonabelian groups.  Moreover the tools of algebraic topology, carried over to the noncommutative realm, make it possible to elevate the phenomenon to a conjectural reciprocity (formulated by Baum and Connes) between the global, homotopy theoretic structures of groups and their reduced duals.  The purpose of the research outlined in this proposal is to obtain a more accurate and deeper understanding of the Baum-Connes conjecture in operator K-theory and of the large-to-small scale phenomenon which underlies it.  The proposers will investigate issues related to group boundaries, Sobolev theory on the reduced dual of a group, and Hilbert space embeddings of groups.  The recent discovery of counterexamples to variants of the Baum-Connes conjecture will be analyzed in depth.<br/>Although the tools used to investigate it are rather elaborate, the idea behind large scale-geometry is very simple: ignore the local, small-scale features of a geometric space and concentrate on its large-scale, or long term, structure.  By doing so, trends or qualities may become apparent which are obscured by small-scale irregularities.  The investigators and others have developed tools to distinguish between different sorts of multi-dimensional, large scale behavior in geometry.  Somewhat surprisingly, aside from their intrinsic interest, these tools have found application in ordinary, small-scale geometry and elsewhere.  The present proposal focuses on geometric aspects of group theory which are illuminated by large-scale geometry.<br/>The proposers are actively involved in training the next generation of mathematical scientists.

This represents the Penn State half of the Semi-annual Workshop in Dynamical Systems and Related Topics, cosponsored for the last 15 years by the dynamics groups of Penn State and Maryland; the Maryland half is held each spring.  The conference covers essentially all topics in dynamical systems, with a particular (but not exclusive) area of emphasis in most meetings. In the years 2006, 2007, and 2008 a Geometry session will be added to address growing activity in the borderline between dynamics and geometry. The goals of the conference are to promote the communication of mathematical results; to facilitate interaction and progress in dynamical systems and related fields; to nurture the sense of community and common mission in these fields; and to contribute to the training of graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients and to their integration into the dynamics community. In particular, the conference includes special sessions with about 8 short talks by graduate students who received some interesting new results. Over the years the conference has enjoyed the participation of many prominent mathematicians, as well as (we see now) future leaders. A history of past programs can be found at  <br/>www.math.psu.edu/research/dynsust/dw.html and <br/>www.math.psu.edu/research/dynsust/dw-archive.html. <br/><br/>In general terms, the field of dynamical systems studies the way in which systems change over time, especially, how typical trajectories of a system behave over time, and when properties of interest in a system are stable under perturbations of the system.  Because so many mathematical structures can be considered in terms of how they change over time, dynamical systems uses a broad range of mathematical disciplines (including differential equations, functional analysis, geometry, probability theory and many others). Conversely, the dynamical approach has contributed significantly to progress in some of these fields, at a deep and nonobvious level. A recent example -- in number theory!  is the dynamical influence on the work of Green and Tao which showed that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In addition, various practical problems are fruitfully studied from the viewpoint of dynamical systems, including current applications in weather forecasting and the computation of orbits of space ""voyagers"". Another example is study of ""chaos"": modern methods of rigorous mathematical description of  ""chaos"" are based on Pesin's Theory developed by Ya. Pesin, a member of the Penn State Center for Dynamics and Geometry and on pioneering works of J. Yorke, a member of the Maryland dynamics group. <br/><br/>"

Noncommutative geometry aims to carry over geometrical concepts to a new class of spaces whose algebras of functions are no longer commutative. The central idea goes back to quantum mechanics, where classical observables such as position and momenta no longer commute.  In recent years it has become appreciated that such noncommutative spaces retain a rich topology and geometry expressed first of all in K-theory and K-homology, as well as in finer aspects of the theory. The subject has also been approached from a more algebraic side with the advent of quantum groups and their quantum homogeneous spaces. The subject in its modern form has also been connected with developments in several different fields of both pure mathematics and mathematical physics. In mathematics these include fruitful interactions with analysis, number theory, category theory and representation theory. In mathematical physics, developments include the quantum Hall effect, applications to the standard model in particle physics and to renormalization in quantum field theory, models of spacetimes with noncommuting coordinates. Noncommutative geometry also appears naturally in string/M-theory. The program will be devoted to bringing together these different streams and instances of noncommutative geometry, as well as identifying new emerging directions.  Three main themes of the program will be reflected in workshops in July, September and December of 2006, covering noncommutative geometry and cyclic cohomology, noncommutative geometry and fundamental physics, and new directions in noncommutative geometry respectively.<br/><br/>"

The goal is to a) better understand finite factor representations of certain quasidiagonal C*-algebras, b) study approximation properties of traces and c) work on applications of the previous two topics to various open questions in operator algebras.  At this point, our hope is that this work will shed light on Elliott's classification program and Connes' embedding problem.  However, there may be more as we have recently noticed that these ideas have K-homological implications, can be used to prove a general existence result for the finite section method (from numerical analysis) and we would not be surprised if connections with geometric group theory were soon worked out.  Though these ideas are certainly in their infancy, they have solid historical foundations (e.g. Connes' uniqueness theorem for finite injective factors) and we believe the theory shows promise. <br/><br/>One very successful idea in mathematics is that problems about complicated objects can sometimes be solved using approximations by simpler objects.  For example, in calculus we teach students that to compute the area under a curve one should first approximate by rectangles since the area of a rectangle is easy to compute.  Operator algebras are (usually) infinite dimensional objects which provide the natural framework for many questions in quantum physics.  Moreover, deep and unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics such as geometry, topology and probability were discovered over the years.  As such, a solid understanding of the structure of operator algebras is important.  The general philosophy of using approximations by simpler objects becomes especially relevant here since the objects of interest are infinite dimensional.  The investigator will continue an established tradition of trying to use finite dimensional approximations to better understand some fundamental infinite dimensional objects. <br/>"

The graduate students that Jorgensen has mentored and directed in the past have included a good proportion of women and under-represented minorities, and this is certainly to be continued with this particular project if funded. --Further, the co-PIs will continue to travel to conferences, to organize workshops for their students, and to visit our respective universities. An added element of attraction with the collaboration is the closeness of Rutgers to Princeton. The two co-PIs will be able to benefit from contacts to Ingrid Daubechies's wavelet team in Princeton. Such contacts have already been explored in the PIs' participation in an NSF wavelet FRG, which is just now ending. These contacts in fact have served as preparation for our current research plans.<br/>"

One class of problems concerns how to design a body of prescribed shape and mass, with certain bounds on the density, that has least first eigenvalue. This is related to certain models of composite materials. In earlier work we have proved certain properties of the solutions of this problem and I will continue studies on the properties of the interfaces between the different materials in the solution. These are free boundary problems and the existing regularity theory for such problems does not extend to these systems. Jointly with Carlos Kenig, we intend  to study some examples and analyze these models in considerable detail.  A second problem we are studying is the Plateau problem for constant mean curvature surfaces. This is a joint project with A. Malchiodi and continuation of our earlier work  where the Dirichlet situation was analysed. Now we are trying to understand the conformal situation.<br/><br/>A clear understanding of the composite membrane problem will lead to an understanding and design of useful composite materials with important properties for use in areas such as medicine, aeronautics and wherever light-weight and strong materials are to be used. Our earlier work showed that one sometimes has to build these materials by breaking the natural symmetry of the desired body, for example to build the ubiquitous washer one needs to arrange the composite materials non-symmetrically. The loss of symmetry has a direct bearing on the regularity of the interface of the materials, the free boundary so to say and this will be hopefully revealed in the current research investigation. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

(The fall meeting is held at Penn State.) The conference covers a broad range of topics in dynamical systems, with a particular (but not exclusive) area of emphasis in most meetings. The goals of this conference are to promote the communication of mathematical results; to facilitate interaction and progress in dynamical systems and related fields; to nurture the sense of community and common mission in these fields; and to contribute to the training of graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients and to their integration into the dynamics community. In particular, in the middle of the conference there are typically 3 to 8 short talks by graduate students with good results.<br/>Over the years the conference has enjoyed the participation of many prominent mathematicians, as well as (we see now) future leaders. History of past programs can be found at the conference website<br/>www.math.umd.edu/research/dynamics/conferences .<br/><br/><br/>The field of dynamical systems, roughly speaking, studies the way in which systems change over time: especially, how typical points of a system behave over time, and when properties of interest in a system are stable under perturbation of the system.   Because so many mathematical structures can be considered in terms of how they change over time, dynamical systems uses a broad range of mathematical disciplines (including differential equations, functional analysis, geometry, probability theory and many others). Conversely, the dynamical approach has contributed significantly to progress in some of these fields, at a deep and nontrivial level. A recent example -- in number theory! -- is the dynamical influence on the work of Green and Tao which showed that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In addition, various practical problems are fruitfully studied from the viewpoint of dynamical systems, including current applications in weather forecasting and the computation of orbits of space ""voyagers"". In recent years ""chaos theory"", a part of dynamical systems, has had an impact on scientific practice. Jim Yorke, a member of the Maryland dynamics group, shared the 2003 Japan Prize (with Benoit Mandelbrot) for his contributions in this area.

This guarantees that each number is approximated with a certain accuracy, but if d is very large, then the sum of all the errors could be very large. The newer idea is to imagine sets of d real numbers as vectors, so that they have both a magnitude and a direction. Then instead of treating each real number separately, we will look at how far the vector points in N different directions, which now gives us N real numbers, that we will approximate and store. The problem is to find the optimal such set of directions and to prove estimates that will tell how well these new schemes work compared <br/>to the old methods.<br/><br/>My research on interpolation theory is concerned with constructing <br/>functions of minimum norm or ""energy"" given certain pieces of information  about the function, such as its values at just a few points and some additional side conditions.<br/><br/><br/>"

There are several interrelated topics in the proposal. A top priority is the extension of our understanding of statistical properties, such as the large deviation principle and the almost sure invariance principle for vector valued observables, to non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, in particular those modeled by a Young Tower.<br/>As part of this program, the investigators will study the regularity of group-valued measurable solutions to sub-cohomological equations and the implications of such regularity for optimal periodic orbits (periodic orbits on which Birkhoff averages of an observable are optimized). Geometric methods play an important role in the proposal.<br/>Recently, the investigators obtained results on the Whitney regularity of measurable solutions to cohomological equations on dynamically defined Cantor sets and it is proposed to extend this work to higher dimensions. The theory of equivariant transversality will be extended and applied to Hamiltonian and reversible systems, a setting important for applications. Finally, it is proposed to continue with the development and application of new methods for the analysis of mixing for hyperbolic flows. The investigators have already developed new invariants leading to a proof that every smooth hyperbolic flow can be approximated by a stably (rapid) mixing flow. It is proposed to pursue this investigation to obtain an improved understanding of exponential mixing for hyperbolic flows a topic of considerable significance in physics.<br/><br/><br/>Many physical systems, even those modeled accurately by deterministic differential equations, often behave in an apparently random and unpredictable way -- the phenomenon of deterministic chaos. Examples range from weather systems and fluid turbulence to electronic circuits and animal populations. Chaotic or complex systems of this type are often best understood in terms of the statistical properties of observations on the system. Complex systems may possess extra geometric structure, such as reversing symmetries or energy conservation, which can alter the expected properties of the physical system as well as provide a means for understanding the system. The proposal aims to deepen our understanding of complex systems, by investigating their statistical properties and exploiting new geometric methods to study their behavior. Results of the research will be broadly disseminated in the scientific literature and in lectures. The research will also contribute to the mathematical education of graduate students at the University of Houston, in part by lectures of the investigators, and in part by students working on this and related subjects under their guidance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The former arise in the analysis of satellite data on the surface of the earth and in mathematical finance while the later occur in meaningful structures and descriptions of large data sets for example in imaging  and wireless networks. Regarding (ii), our goal is to study  clustering properties of minimal energy particles which are useful in understanding best packing and in the understanding of the physics of self-assembling materials. We also expect to prove the existence of linear codes which areuseful for the problem of transmitting information effectively and accurately. Regarding (iii), our goal is to understand interpolation operators on manifolds as a means to solving differential equations and supports of minimizers on the circle which are used in random matrix theory in mathematical physics. <br/>"

Problems I and II <br/>are concerned with the proof of universality for orthogonal and <br/>symplectic ensembles of random matrices with varying polynomial weights <br/>on the line, and with polynomial weights on the half-line, respectively. <br/>Problem III deals with the rigorous proof of the asymptotic expansion <br/>for the partition function (free energy) for orthogonal and symplectic <br/>ensembles with varying polynomial weights on the line which has <br/>applications in graph enumeration problems arising in 2D quantum gravity <br/>and string theory. Finally, Problem IV concerns proving various <br/>asymptotic formulae for the entanglement entropy of fermion systems on <br/>the lattice and in the continuum (this problem has connections with <br/>RMT).<br/><br/>Over the past fifty years it has become clear that Random Matrix Theory <br/>(RMT), initially introduced into the theoretical physics community by <br/>Wigner in 1950's as a model for the scattering of neutrons off large <br/>nuclei, has a long and extraordinarily varied list of applications not <br/>only in physics, but also in pure and applied mathematics, and in other <br/>sciences, such as cardiology. More precisely, it turns out that (the <br/>statistical properties of) various seemingly unrelated objects, such as <br/>vibration frequencies of elastic plates, bus arrival times when the <br/>drivers try to optimize the traffic flow, zeros of the Riemann zeta <br/>function, the distribution of phone numbers in a large phone directory, <br/>and heartbeat peaks, for example, are all remarkably well-described by <br/>eigenvalues of a large random matrix (RM). The fundamental question is: <br/>Why does RMT model such a broad variety of phenomena? The answer is that <br/>there should be certain limiting distribution laws for the eigenvalues of <br/>large RM's that are independent of the precise distribution of the matrix <br/>ensembles. This loose statement is known as the Universality Conjecture, <br/>and it can be viewed as an analog of the Central Limit Theorem in <br/>probability theory, but now for certain classes of correlated random <br/>variables (which are the eigenvalues of a RM). Universality questions <br/>arose very early on in RMT, and universality is widely believed to be <br/>true. However, a mathematical proof of universality for the so-called <br/>unitary ensembles was found only in the late 1990's. The PI and Deift <br/>have very recently proved universality in the remaining two cases, viz., <br/>the orthogonal and symplectic ensembles, in great generality. Problems I <br/>and II, which deal with continuation and extension of these results, <br/>will significantly extend our understanding of universality to the <br/>important case where the underlying equilibrium measure consists of more <br/>than one interval. The asymptotic expansion of the partition function <br/>for the three types of RM ensembles has important applications in <br/>mathematics and also in 2D quantum gravity and string theory. Very <br/>recently, in the unitary case, the expansion was rigorously established <br/>by Ercolani and McLaughlin. In Problem III, the PI plans to prove <br/>rigorously the expansion for general orthogonal and symplectic <br/>ensembles. This will have implications in 2D quantum gravity models <br/>which are not covered by the unitary case. In the emerging field of <br/>quantum computation, a subject currently of great interest, one of the <br/>basic quantities of study is the so-called entanglement entropy which <br/>measures the number of maximally entangled pairs that can be extracted <br/>from a given quantum state. In Problem IV, the PI plans to prove various <br/>results concerning asymptotic expansions of the entanglement entropy for <br/>fermions as the size of a subsystem becomes large. These results will <br/>considerably extend the understanding of the entanglement entropy for <br/>the lattice and also continuous fermion systems in higher dimensions.<br/><br/>"

Lempert and the PI (initially working independently) have recently identified a class of analytic sheaves over complex Banach manifolds that is analogous to the class of coherent analytic sheaves over finite dimensional complex manifolds.  They proved very general analogs of Theorems A and B of Cartan-Oka-Serre over pseudoconvex open subsets of, say, Hilbert space, and their closed complex Hilbert<br/>submanifolds.  This proposal aims to find a class of complex Banach manifolds that is analogous to the class of Stein manifolds in finite dimensions in the sense that, say, the above mentioned analogs of Theorems A and B hold, and they holomorphically embed in a complex<br/>Banach space as complex Banach submanifolds the complex tangent spaces to which have direct complements at every point.  The identification of the correct class of complex Banach manifolds that forms an analog of Stein manifolds is important and seems close to indispensable for further work on complex Banach manifolds. The creation of classical Stein theory was one of the early triumphs of several complex variables that in part defined it as a field of study in its own right.  It may be expected that a strong analog of Stein theory for Banach manifolds will prove beneficial for complex analysis on Banach spaces in general.  <br/><br/>Complex analysis on Banach spaces is a natural extension of complex analysis on Euclidean spaces.  Complex manifolds appear naturally and unavoidably when one studies the solution set of holomorphic (e.g., polynomial) equations.  As there are theories in physics that model the universe as finite or infinite dimensional complex manifolds, their investigation is natural and unavoidable. A thorough understanding of complex Banach manifolds is thus potentially very useful in the human quest for knowledge.  Complex analysis is a beautiful chapter of analysis.  Analysis is a major field of mathematics that gave us a large part of the understanding necessary for the technological revolution, e.g., through the Maxwell laws of electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.  In part it also gave us the laser light and methods of data compression that enable us to watch a movie on a DVD.<br/><br/>"

In this project, the PI outlines future goals in three areas of harmonic analysis: (a) Fourier estimates for cones and their applications (section 2), involving a local smoothing estimate of Wolff (b) analysis of linear and monomial polyhedra, and their applications to (i) associated maximal operators and (ii) Bergman kernel estimates for weakly pseudoconvex domains (section 3), and (c) decay properties of oscillatory integral operators with degenerate phases section 4).<br/><br/>Projects 1, 2 and 3 address a class of problems that may be approached<br/>using Wolff's microlocal estimate for light cones (arising in his proof of the local smoothing conjecture), and would answer a variety of questions regarding averaging and Fourier integral operators and partial differential equations.

Roughly speaking, the conjecture asserts that the representation theory of a reductive algebraic group over a local field is dual to a geometric category of equivariant sheaves on an associated dual space.  In this formulation, the Arthur conjectures may be interpreted as suggesting a very precise relationship between local components of automorphic forms and the microlocal geometry of the dual space (codified in the characteristic variety of certain equivariant perverse sheaves).  When the local field is archimedian, the local Langlands conjecture is a theorem, but the Arthur conjectures are ineffective in the sense that they fall well short of providing a conjectural enumeration of the automorphic spectrum.  We propose a project to extend the framework of the local Langlands conjecture to real groups that arise as nonalgebraic metaplectic double covers of the real points of algebraic groups.  Our approach is predicated on an intricate relationship between the algebraic and nonalgebraic theories which may be interpreted as a kind of ramified local Shimura correspondence.  This allows us to pursue some of Arthurs' ideas in the nonalgebraic setting.  Finally in a separate project we propose a series of nontrivial and computationally powerful restrictions on the form that the characteristic variety computations can take.  (These computations are relevant for the Arthur theory for both algebraic and nonalgebraic groups.)  The restrictions we pursue give insight into making the Arthur conjectures effective for real groups.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research deals with understanding the theory of semisimple (real) Lie groups.  These objects arise most naturally as symmetries of finite-dimensional structures; the modifier semisimple means, roughly speaking, that the Lie group cannot be broken into smaller Lie groups.  An example of historical import is the Lie group of rotations in three dimensions (which codifies the symmetry of the spherically symmetric hydrogen atom).  One is often interested in how Lie groups can act on infinite-dimensional linear spaces (like the solution space of the Schroedinger equation for the hydrogen atom).  Such actions are called representations.  In the 1960s, Langlands suggested an astonishing relationship between the representation theory of semisimple Lie groups and a set of data of essentially arithmetic origin.  This is remarkable because it connects two subjects representation theory and number theory which are ostensible unrelated.  Subsequently the arithmetic parameters that Langlands suggested (and much more of Langlands ideas) became understood as a shadow of a deep geometric theory of singular algebraic varieties.  The proposer's research seeks to extend some of the ideas of Langlands, and consequent refinements due to Arthur, to a larger class of nonalgebraic Lie groups than originally considered in the original algebraic setting.  (The distinction is a little too delicate to make precise here, but suffice it to say that the nonalgebraic setting has been demonstrated to be very interesting from many perspectives.) Our research has a representation theoretic part and a geometric part.  Qualitatively the representation theoretic part is predicated on a precise relationship between the nonalgebraic and algebraic theories (revealing new information about each) and the geometric part turns on a latent structure of the parameter set mentioned above.  It is worth mentioning that for particular examples, these latent structures amount to a lovely (and very concrete) combinatoric which is accessible to bright undergraduates; I plan to direct undergraduate research projects based on this combinatorial theory.<br/><br/>"

The multi-scales and complexity of the problems in nature often necessitate the use of random media. In many applications, it is also common to have only ``statistical'' (random) and not ``exact'' (deterministic) information. In addition, the modeling of the fluctuations of the physically relative quantities leads to equations  with ``singular'' (white noise type) dependence on some of the variables. In this context, random homogenization and stochastic partial differential equations become the natural mathematical objects. The randomness is associated with singular dependence on the state variables and lack of compactness, two facts that give rise to challenging mathematical problems. Overcoming them requires the development of new methods and techniques. In biology, recent experiments at the molecular scale have led to new sophisticated mathematical models. Novel tools and ideas are needed to study these problems further and to identify all the relevant regimes/scales of the parameters, which affect  the experimentally observed behavior.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to continue his program to develop methods to study nonlinear deterministic (parabolic/elliptic and hyperbolic) deterministic and stochastic partial differential equations arising in models in areas such as continuum and statistical physics, biology, engineering, etc. The emphasis of the proposal is on the development of theories for <br/>(i) weak (stochastic viscosity) solutions of fully nonlinear, (degenerate) parabolic<br/>stochastic pde, <br/>(ii) the homogenization of nonlinear, parabolic/elliptic and hyperbolic pde in spatio-temporal random  media, <br/>(iii) the study of properties (regularity, error estimates) of viscosity solutions, and (iv) the analysis of some  models in mathematical biology.<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

John von Neumann introduced the concept of a von Neumann algebra in the 1930's to provide a natural framework for the study of noncommutative objects, initially in the context of quantum mechanics. The study of von Neumann algebras is often viewed as the study of ""noncommutative measure spaces"". Over the last seventy years, this has turned out to be a rich and fertile field of study, with a large number of concrete objects, unexpected properties and challenging and central open problems. Noncommutative probability theory (or free probability theory) in the context of noncommutative measure spaces was developed by Dan Voiculescu in the 1980's. Interesting for its sake, it was able to solve several important problems in the area of von Neumann algebras. We wish to further develop free probability theory; with a view to attacking other problems in the area of von Neumann algebras. In particular, we wish to compute the free entropy dimensions of von Neumann algebras by computing their free orbit dimensions; to search for new von Neumann algebras that have no Cartan subalgebras (Dan Voiculescu showed that free group factors have no Cartan subalgebras); to investigate maximal injective subalgebra problems of von Neumann algebras from the point view of free probability theory; and to find full factors that have Kadison's Similarity Property by using G. Pisier's similarity length.<br/> <br/>Main motivation for the introduction of von Neumann algebras is to obtain a more rigorous mathematical formulation of the basics of quantum mechanics. From a probabilistic point view, free probability theory has some surprising applications in the area of von Neumann algebras. Free probability theory gives us deep insights into many other open problems in the area of von Neumann algebras, such as the classification problem of von Neumann algebras, the generator question and decomposability.  Further investigation of the links between these two fields, free probability theory and von Neumann algebras, is both necessary and urgent. This project aims to develop new tools in free probability theory aiming at problems in the area of von Neumann algebras. The solutions to these problems will provide us with new ways to classify von Neumann algebras. The significance of the project lies in the fact that new developments in the theory of free probability and von Neumann algebra have always had profound applications to several fields in mathematics and physics such as statistics and quantum mechanics. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activities: The project is the continuation of principal investigator's prior work in free probability theory, in generator problem of von Neumann algebras and in maximal injective subalgebras of von Neumann algebras. Broader Impact of the Proposed Activities: The project will take place at a location that strengthens the broader impacts of research development in the University of New Hampshire. The research group of Operator Algebra and Operator Theory in the University of New Hampshire consists of several well-established mathematicians. Joint-workshops will be organized to focus on helping graduate students to learn the subjects.<br/>"

It turns out that the category of maps with the same geometric and function theoretic properties of analytic functions are the mappings of bounded distortion, also called quasiregular mappings, or, if injective, quasiconformal mappings. Both kind of mappings solve uniformly elliptic partial differential equations in the plane. Moreover, these mappings preserve the natural Sobolev spaces which arise in the study of function theory and partial differential equations on subdomains of Euclidean n-space.<br/><br/>In recent years there has been another well-known theory of mappings whose ideas have gotten to the core of geometry and analysis, non-linear elasticity theory.  The mappings which naturally occur there<br/>are not always quasiregular, but the governing  partial<br/>differential equations are the same. This forces us to move from the<br/>classical setting of uniformly elliptic partial differential equations to degenerate elliptic equations.   Usually, however, some control of the ellipticity bounds will be necessary to achieve concrete results. These often take the form of integral estimates in some Lebesgue or Sobolev spaces. This is the theory of mappings of finite distortion.<br/><br/>In this proposal we focus mainly on mappings of finite distortion between subsets of the Euclidean n-space. We also emphasize the fundamental role of the Jacobian determinant, which already has led to<br/>a very productive study of mappings of finite distortion. The PI<br/>studies together with  Haj\l asz, Iwaniec and Mal\'y, the Jacobian<br/>determinant  (the pullback of the Riemannian volume forms) of<br/>mappings between Riemannian n-manifolds. This study makes it<br/>possible to discover new phenomena about such mappings. Also in<br/>this proposal, we investigate the Hardy-Littlewood maximal<br/>operators on Sobolev spaces, one of the most important tools in<br/>analysis.<br/><br/><br/>Geometric function theory has been quite a successful theory, with<br/>many diverse applications. The theory of non-linear elasticity for<br/>example was based on practical problems from mathematics and<br/>physics. It is necessary to study non-linear equations to<br/>understand certain physical phenomena such as bifurcation and<br/>phase transition. Our main motivation in the theory of mappings of<br/>finite distortion is to examine degenerate elliptic equations<br/>where important applications lie.<br/><br/>"

This encompasses such apparently distant areas as many-body scattering and the Laplacian on symmetric spaces. Powerful geometric techniques recently adapted from the study of hyperbolic<br/>equations have already played a major role in the detailed study of many-body scattering, which describes how quantum particles interact, e.g. in an accelerator. The proposed project will employ these microlocal techniques to explore new problems in many-body scattering, and to bring<br/>insights to analysis on symmetric spaces. These problems include the detailed study of the behavior of particles at threshold energies, which are energy levels where new configurations of particles become accessible. For many chemical phenomena Planck's constant, h, may be considered small, motivating the study of semiclassical many-body phenomena. A particular example is the spectral shift function, which has been the subject of an ongoing joint project of the PI with Xue Ping Wang. Another area of proposed research, joint with Gunther Uhlmann, is finite energy inverse many-body scattering, i.e. whether one can determine the interaction between particles from the scattering matrices, which are objects describing the outcome of scattering experiments. Perhaps surprisingly, there are very algebraic objects which are analogous to many-body problems, namely higher rank symmetric spaces. The structure<br/>of so-called flats in these spaces is very similar to the structure of the configuration space in many-body scattering, with the walls of the Weyl chambers playing the role of collision planes. In a joint project, Rafe Mazzeo and the PI plan to use the constructive techniques from many-body<br/>scattering to obtain the full asymptotic behavior of various analytic objects on these spaces, showing that many of the phenomena observed there have their counterparts in much greater generality.<br/><br/>Indeed, many people are familiar with the following two descriptions of the propagation of light. First, in geometric optics, light propagates in straight lines, reflecting from surfaces according to Snell's law. That is, the angles of incidence and of reflection are the same, as if light<br/>consisted of little billiard balls. Second, light can be described by the wave equation, its propagation thus being similar to that of water waves.  There is a close relationship between these two viewpoints. Namely, for solutions of the wave equation, the propagation of sharp signals (or `singularities' of signals), which are the signals used to carry information, is precisely described by the simpler geometric optics picture. There is a similar correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics in many-particle interactions. Namely, for quantum particles the<br/>evolution of wave functions `at infinity' is almost described by the classical picture, as was proved previously by the PI. The only divergence between the classical and the quantum pictures is the emergence of bound states. For example, for a system consisting of two protons and two<br/>electrons, one of the protons and one of the electrons can form a hydrogen atom -- which may in turn break up if an electron with high energy hits it. In this proposal the PI will in part use these results, and related tools, for further investigation of many-body phenomena, such as examining the quantum-classical correspondence more precisely for small Planck's constant, and analyzing whether one can determine the interactions between particles from the result of a scattering experiment, and in part to extend such results to more geometric settings. These results are thus related to important questions in physics and chemistry. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

In these cases random constructions turn out to be very effective. It is often possible to define a random section or sample and show that it has the desired property with high probability. This approach combined with advanced probabilistic tools, like measure concentration, led to major discoveries in convex geometry and functional analysis. The PI plans to study the combinatorial dimension of a set of functions. This is a new measure of complexity, which arises from questions in probability and computer science. The PI will also investigate the spectral properties of random matrices and apply the results of this research to construction of effective error-correcting codes. <br/><br/>This research will provide new connections between functional analysis, convex geometry and probability.

Free boundary problems are important in many fields such as material sciences, fluid mechanics, hydrodynamics, thermo-mechanics, magneto-dynamics, solid state physics, geology, chemistry, and the biological and medical sciences. The appropriate numerical and analytical treatment is a major challenge, both to the engineer and to the mathematician. Typically, a free boundary problem consists of one or more partial differential equations which have to be solved in a domain that is a priori unknown and that has to be determined as part of the problem. Free boundary problems are in general harder to solve, both analytically and numerically, than the underlying differential equations would be in a prescribed domain. They have an inherent nonlinear structure, as two separate solutions cannot be superposed.  <br/><br/>In this project, the PI proposes a systematic investigation of various free boundary problems with moving contact lines in the presence of surface tension. Moving contact lines occur in many situations, for example in processes such as the coating of solid surfaces by a viscous fluid, spin coating of micro chips, the displacement of one fluid by another fluid along a solid boundary, the spreading of drops on solid surfaces, the motion of a fluid (or a fluid-liquid system) in a container where the free surface is in contact with the wall of the container.

Part of the project deals with the theory of extensions of Banach spaces and related problems about the existence of extensions of linear operators between Banach spaces.  For example, one central problem concerns identifying those subspaces of the classical Lebesgue space of integrable functions that have the property that every operator into a Hilbert space can be extended to the whole space. This amounts to finding subspaces that verify Grothendieck's theorem and is equivalent to the problem of finding spaces with the property that every extension by a Hilbert space is trivial.  Similar problems for spaces of continuous functions in place of Hilbert space are also of interest.  A second part of the project deals with the nonlinear theory of Banach spaces; a typical open problem here is whether two Lipschitz isomorphic separable Banach spaces are always linearly isomorphic. A third part deals with the study of sectorial operators and possible applications of that study to partial differential equations.<br/><br/><br/>Extensions of Banach spaces have a geometrical interpretation in finite dimensions. If, given a centrally symmetric convex set, one only has information about a slice in some directions and the shadow cast in the perpendicular directions, one cannot reconstruct the origin set.  However, the hope is to reconstruct the body as accurately as possible, even though this information is incomplete. This is a concrete way of looking at many questions in analysis that arise in quite different forms.  The nonlinear theory of Banach spaces and the related Lipschitz structure of metric spaces has potential applications in theoretical computer science in the handling of large data sets. Sectorial operators and semigroups are a basic tool in the study of partial differential equations of evolution type.<br/>"

There are several questions connected to the Corona problem that will be addressed.  First, questions about the Stable Rank of certain Banach algebras will be addressed.  This will have implications in Control Theory as well as Complex Analysis.  Second, questions related to the Operator Corona Theorem will be considered.  Results here will be both important in the one and several complex variable setting.  Additionally, there are hopes to extend some of the techniques to the several complex variable setting, which could shed light on the Corona problem there.  In terms of multi-parameter harmonic analysis, the questions that will be addressed are connected to important issues arising from higher commutators.  In a broad sense, the questions considered are an attempt to extend results from classical harmonic analysis to the multi-parameter setting.  This area of research has only recently opened.<br/><br/>The proposed research project fits into the general framework of understanding problems through the application of harmonic analysis.  In recent years, the full power of modern tools from harmonic analysis has been applied to problems in function theory and operator theory, with excellent results.  The Corona Problem is an abstract mathematical question about the algebraic structure of a function space.  Its answer and the techniques used in the solution have implications in other areas of analysis and applications in the real world.  It has proved to be a fundamental question in operator theory and has played an important role in questions from Control Theory.  Multi-parameter harmonic analysis is a very natural generalization of standard harmonic analysis.  However, this generalization provides a complex structure to many of the spaces and ideas that one finds in harmonic analysis.  Many of the tools of harmonic analysis are unavailable in the multi-parameter setting.  Only recently, questions in these areas have become more accessible due to new technical tools developed.  The full usefulness of these tools has yet to be explored and fully utilized.  These are both very important areas of analysis, with many important questions remaining.  Answers to the questions proposed would be extremely beneficial.  A deeper study of these areas is certainly warranted.  The above research will have broad impact on other areas of mathematics as well as to problems in the real world.  Harmonic analysis is an area inspired by applications.  Commutator estimates arise naturally in physics through the use of Div-Curl Lemmas in the study of electromagnetism via Maxwell's Equations.  Also, tools used in this proposal, in particular smooth wavelet systems, also have applications outside mathematics.  Recently, they have been utilized in National Security to compress biometric data such as fingerprints and have also found applications in medical imaging.<br/><br/>"

The incorporation of even weak but extensive disorder is known to result in delocalization of at least some of the normal modes, and in the creation of pure-point spectral regimes, characterized by a dense collection of eigenvalues corresponding to well separated eigenfunctions.  The focus of the proposed research is on the less understood question of the existence of extended states in the presence of disorder, and the corresponding Lebesgue absolutely continuous spectra. Also to be investigated is a possible relation of the spectral gap statistics of local operators incorporating disorder with the known eigenvalue statistics of random matrix ensembles. As the effects of randomness are dimension dependent, the initial goal is to clarify some of the issues in high dimensions, where loop effects are in general more controllable. In the converse direction, a new -fluctuation based- method is envisioned for the derivation and analysis of localization in low dimensions, where the effect is most drastic.<br/><br/>Disorder effects play a key role in the conduction properties of quantum systems modeled by random operators, and are of direct relevance for quantum networks. The work will capitalize on recent progress made by the PI with collaborators, and on his past work on the Anderson localization and on other effects of fluctuations, such as the rounding of fist-order phase transitions in low dimensions, in what is known as the Imry-Ma effect.  The subject provides the meeting grounds for techniques involving mathematical analysis with ideas drawn from statistical mechanics, where science is made of disorder. The challenge of shedding light on issues of physics enriches also fields of mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>   <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The backbone of finding sparse representations is the concept of m-term approximation of the target function by the elements of a given system of functions (dictionary).  Since the elements of the dictionary used in the m-term approximation are allowed to depend on the function being approximated, this type of approximation, known as nonlinear approximation, is very efficient when the approximants can be found. Nonlinear approximation seeks ways to approximate complicated functions by simple functions using methods that depend nonlinearly on the function being approximated. Recently, a particular kind of nonlinear approximation, namely, greedy approximation attracted a lot of attention in both theoretical and applied settings. Greedy type algorithms proved to be very useful in various applications such as image compression, signal processing, design of neural networks, and the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations. The theory of greedy approximation is emerging now: some convergence results have already been established; many problems remain unsolved. The fundamental question is how to construct good methods (algorithms) of approximation. The purpose of the proposed research is to design and study general nonlinear methods of approximation that are practically realizable. The proposed research will develop algorithms that are provably efficient with respect to convergence and rate of convergence.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to carry out fundamental mathematical and algorithmic study to significantly increase our ability to process (compress, de-noise, etc.) large data sets. The main technique that will be used in achieving this goal is based on nonlinear sparse representations. Understanding how to process large data sets is one of the great scientific challenges of this decade. It is key to designing systems to efficiently analyze data and extract essential information. The scientific discipline, which studies the process of replacing large data by smaller and simpler data, is the approximation theory. It has a myriad of existing and potential applications in both the defense and civilian sectors. For instance, managing large data bases such as security data bases obtained through surveillance requires processing of the data sets in order to speed up extraction of significant features or specific information.  <br/><br/><br/>"

The Principle Investigator will extend results for such operators from the classical setting (i.e., between scalar-valued function spaces) to operator-valued setting (i.e., between Banach space-valued functions spaces). Such extensions have applications in, among others, spectral theory and partial differential equations (e.g., regularity theory). Such extensions will also lead to results in martingale theory, which serves as a bridge between several areas of mathematical analysis, such as: harmonic analysis, stochastic analysis, and the geometry of Banach spaces. In these extensions, the geometry of the underlying Banach spaces (e.g., Fourier type and uniform convexity) will play a key role.  <br/><br/>A Banach space is a space of vectors that has, among other things, a way to measure the distance between two vectors. The most basic example of a Banach space is the three-dimensional space around us.

The properties of such functions modeling these natural phenomena are described by differential equations, which can be viewed as operators between Banach spaces. Recent applications have led the experts to work in Banach space-valued, rather than real-valued, Banach spaces.

The recent solutions by Klyachko of the eigenvalues of a sum of Hermitian matrices problem and by Knutson and Tao of the saturation and Horn conjectures are of particular relevance to this proposal. Both these problems are associated to the group of invertible n by n matrices. The discovery of quantum cohomology and the quantum Schubert calculus led to the solution of analogous problems for the group of unitary n by n matrices. The PIs P.Belkale, T. Haines, M. Kapovich, S. Kumar and J. Millson propose to attack for a general reductive group G the problems previously solved for the groups of invertible unitary n by n matrices. The history of Lie theory has shown that it is of critical importance to understand in the context of general Lie groups results proved initially for the group of invertible n by n matrices.<br/><br/>A large part of mathematics and physics has been involved with the study of eigenvalues, for example determining the modes of vibration of a violin string or the energy levels of an atom amounts to finding eigenvalues of a Hermitian linear operator. A fundamental problem is to determine the possibilities for the eigenvalues of the sum of two operators given the eigenvalues of each one. Another fundamental problem with its roots in physics is the problem of studying the representations of an abstract group as a group of matrices. This problem in turn has been organized into subproblems. One of the most important of these is the problem of decomposing (tensor) products of representations as sums of representations. The point of this proposal is that these two basic problems, the eigenvalue of the sum problem and the decomposing (tensor) products problem are very closely related. The authors propose to pin down this relationship (already well-understood for special cases) for the general case. This FRG grant will play a fundamental role in the further development of a national group of scientists working on the area common to Lie theory, topology, algebraic and symplectic geometry, combinatorics and the theory of buildings. A class of young mathematicians especially graduate students and postdocs in the mid-Atlantic area (including Washington and Chapel Hill) and the greater (San Francisco) bay area (including Davis) will have the opportunity to learn about and work on exciting and fundamental problems through the Meetings and Workshops envisaged by the PIs. This class already includes the nine graduate students presently advised by the PIs. We expect to include other graduate students and postdocs associated to the very strong programs in representation theory and geometry at the University of Maryland, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California at Davis.

The Principal Investigator (PI) aims to study complex dynamical systems in holomorphic families.  The questions are centered on the notions of stability within families, bifurcations, and degenerations. More specifically, the PI will pursue (1) questions about the compactification of the moduli space of rational maps, where it remains open to construct a natural boundary which captures the information of dynamical degeneration, and to describe precisely which stable families are bounded in the moduli space; (2) characterizations of stability for families of higher-dimensional dynamical systems, where the techniques from one-dimensional dynamics do not generalize, but there has been recent progress using pluripotential theory; (3) an investigation of families of polynomials in one variable and the associated space of trees with dynamics, which provides a continuous combinatorial model for polynomials in all degrees, and should model the structure of the escape locus in the moduli space of polynomials; and (4) properties of the transfinite diameter in connection with families of polynomials in all dimensions, where the discussion involves a combination of analytic and arithmetic methods.<br/><br/>A more general overview:<br/><br/>There are many open questions around the long-term effects of perturbations of a dynamical system.

In this project, she aims to answer questions of a global nature:  what is the structure of the stable regime in a complex-analytic family of rational functions? Or, what type of degenerations can take place and what do they tell us about the bifurcation locus?  The motivation for studying these particular families comes from interesting connections with hyperbolic geometry, algebraic and arithmetic geometry, and potential theory.<br/><br/><br/>"

The first problem addresses the computation of the Lebesgue p-norm of the Beurling-Ahlfors operator B. B has an important place in quasi-conformal mapping theory, and this particular problem has a well-known conjecture of Iwaniec, about 25 years old, that the operator norm is p-1, for p greater than or equal to 2. Present techniques, which involve martingale methods due to Burkholder, attain the upper bound of 2(p-1), and recent work (after this proposal was sent) of R. Banuelos and the PI has further reduced this to below 1.58(p-1). The next objective is either to get square root 2 for the outer constant or to prove the conjecture. The second problem is to find the weak-type (p, p) constant (p > 2) for orthogonal harmonic functions. As a special important case, find the best constant C_p so that given any function f on the unit circle with p-norm equal to 1, the measure of the set of points on the circle where the absolute value of the conjugate function of f exceeds any positive t >0 is less than or equal to <br/>(C_p)/(t^p). The PI has recently solved the same problem in the general setting when    1< p<2, extending known results for p=1. The remaining two problems deal with extending weak-type inequalities for well-known operators to general classes of Radon singular measures and finding potential connections to questions in geometric measure theory. The operator, say T, acts on a singular measure v supported on a subset of R^n, for instance a k-dimensional Lipschitz graph L. The resulting function Tv has asymptotic behavior as L is approached that can be calculated and from which a corresponding weak-type (p, p) inequality can be conjectured. In fact, it can be proved except the constant will depend on the Lipschitz constant of L. The problem is to show that this weak-type constant is independent of the Lipschitz constant, which will allow generalizations. Finally, in the last part of the project, the PI proposes to explore certain interesting connections between the harmonic analysis of weak-type inequalities and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>This work has the important intellectual merit that it involves problems that interconnect distinct areas of mathematics. The first two problems have a wonderful history of attracting both analysts and probabilists, resulting in the development and application of new techniques in both areas and strongly suggesting deeper interconnections yet to be found. The second part of the proposal, which deals with the action of operators on singular measures, culminates with fascinating conjectures in the geometric measure theory of fractals. Thus, at the heart of this proposal is the search for Unity behind apparent individualities, which is the universal motivation of science. As for a particular instance of broader impact, consider a fractal, something that naturally arises in physical sciences as well as in mathematics. The PI suggests in the last problem that the volume of a distance tube about a fractal can be understood through analysis of operators in harmonic analysis. Thus if the mathematics of these operators is developed, then the physical understanding of fractals is better understood, and we could potentially apply this understanding to the physical sciences which deal with fractals.<br/>"

The unifying theme is the development and application in this context of effective tools from nonsmooth metric geometry. One series of problems focuses on the geometry of submanifolds with possible application to the celebrated Heisenberg isoperimetry conjecture of Pierre Pansu. Sub-Riemannian analogs of the classical machinery of differential geometry have recently been introduced by Garofalo et al, Pauls, and Franchi et al, among others. In joint work with Capogna and Pauls, the PI will further develop this machinery in order to gain a more intrinsic understanding of the geometry of Carnot-Caratheodory submanifolds. This investigation is currently limited to surfaces given either intrinsically or extrinsically, as level sets of or parameterized by highly regular functions. Dimension jump phenomena and the size of the characteristic set for graphs of weakly regular functions will be investigated by the PI's graduate student John Maki in his thesis.  A second line of research focuses on sub-Riemannian geometric function theory and fractal geometry. This includes the search for effective symmetrization procedures, existence, extension and regularity problems for quasiconformal maps, metric regularity of rough domains (John and uniform domains, domains satisfying a quasihyperbolic growth condition), and the structure of self-affine tilings. Finally (joint with Z. M. Balogh), the nonsmooth first-order calculus of Cheeger-Keith will be investigated in connection with exotic metrics on the Heisenberg group with an eye towards constructing new examples of spaces on which such calculus can be developed.<br/><br/>Sub-Riemannian geometry is the ""geometry of constrained motion""; it provides a mathematical model for any physical situation in which allowable motion is subject to a priori geometric constraints.  Historically, its roots lie in Carnot's work on thermodynamics, but the subject has progressed significantly beyond these motivating questions to a central position in modern nonsmooth geometric analysis, and has recently seen remarkable applications in numerous areas, including robotic path planning, remote control of satellites, digital image reconstruction and computer vision, neurobiology, and the mathematics of finance. There are direct links between one aspect of the proposed research (sub-Riemannian differential geometry of submanifolds and the isoperimetric problem) and emerging models for the function and structure of the mammalian visual cortex. Nonsmooth techniques and methods are essential in geometric analysis in view of the incompleteness of classical spaces of smooth functions and sets; solutions to differential equations and variational problems cannot be guaranteed unless the domain of definition is widened to a suitably large family of (nonsmooth) candidates (although in hindsight, smoothness for such solutions can often be established a posteriori). The proposal includes an outreach component, joint with Capogna and Pauls, involving cross-training of graduate students and postdocs, a series of conferences, workshops and summer schools, expository articles and monographs, and an online forum for researchers in sub-Riemannian geometry aimed at developing a North American presence in this exciting field on par with the established centers of study in Europe and Australia.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>"

One subject of ongoing research is the restriction estimates for the Fourier transform. Recently, the PI has obtained satisfactory results in some cases, which imply new partial results in the direction of Falconer's distance set conjecture -- a long standing open problem in geometric measure theory. These results also imply new Strichartz type estimates for the wave and Schrodinger equations. Another example of ongoing research is the mapping properties of Generalized Radon transforms (GRT) -- a huge class of averaging operators over lower dimensional sub-manifolds of Euclidean spaces. By applying the techniques of Bourgain, Wolff and others developed for Kakeya problems, he obtained (part of it jointly with Christ) interesting results in some cases. In recent years, the PI studied the dynamical properties of Schrodinger evolution (joint with Killip and Schlag). He will continue his investigations on various problems from mathematical physics, and the connections with harmonic analysis.<br/> Harmonic analysis has always found wide applications in natural sciences and engineering. It underlies a powerful and diverse array of tools currently widely used in applications, and offers the promise of further applications in the future. The proposed research deals with foundational issues, which may ultimately help to underpin such future applications. The study of the mapping properties of GRT has various applications in engineering. For example, the X-ray transform (which is a particular GRT) applied to the density function of a patients body is essentially the data obtained by magnetic resonance imaging.  The study of GRT is also an important ingredient in the analysis of sumability of multi-dimensional Fourier series and integrals, of more general oscillatory integrals, and of a wide class of partial differential equations. The proposed research would make a contribution to the general understanding of these problems. The planned research is also related to certain discrete problems of interest in combinatorics and number theory, which in most cases remain wide open.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><br/>"

A conformal map between two surfaces is one that preserves angles at each point. This is a very restrictive assumption, and it is interesting to understand to what extent properties of such maps can be deduced from other topological, combinatorial, algebraic, set-theoretic, or analytic assumptions. An example is determining the conformal type of surfaces, namely, whether a surface is conformally equivalent to to a model surface. In the higher dimensional case, biholomorphic equivalence is used in place of conformal equivalence. Some specific topics that the PI proposes to study are: surfaces whose conformal type is determined by combinatorial properties of the associated net, a question raised by EB Vinberg, and two topics related to questions raised by L. Rubel, namely, maximal growth functions that have finitely many critical and asymptotic values, and the study of complex manifolds whose biholomorphic type can be recovered from the knowledge of associated semigroups of analytic endomorphisms and the semiconjugation of analytic functions.. These questions have possible applications in several branches of Mathematics. <br/><br/>While these questions fall squarely within the framework of Geometric Function Theory. This subject has its roots in applications to the natural sciences and engineering.  Particular examples are Conformal Field Theory and Statistical Mechanics.

This new insight enables us to show a  noncommutative analog the maximal ergodic theorem for completely positive maps and study square function inequalities in this setting (joint work with LeMerdy/Xu).  The formulation and properties are motivated by the theory of Operator Spaces.  On the other hand martingale inequalities are crucial in understanding independent, indiscernable and exchangeable sequences in noncommutative Lp spaces and properties of almost uniform convergence. Martingale inequalities and noncommutative probability are also fundamental  tools in  analyzing the operator space OH and its realization in the predual  of type III von Neumann algebras.  These  techniques are similar to those used by Pisier/Shlyaktenko in proving  the noncommutative version of Grothendieck's inequality.  Surprising the analog of the 'little Grothendieck inequality' in the context of  operator spaces only holds up to a logarithmic factor.<br/><br/>Quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and mathematical models realizing these phenomena changed not only our perception of the world but also the mathematical discipline. Many noncommutative (=quantum) generalizations of classical mathematical theories for example the theory of quantum groups and noncommutative  (=quantum) probability theory. Very interesting new phenomena  and difficulties arise when adopting classical concepts to this noncommutative framework. Noncommutative  measure theory and the theory of von Neumann algebras provide plenty of examples of genuinely new phenoma. Indeed, von Neumann's  motivation for his work on operator algebras (now called von Neumann algebras) was to provide a good mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics.  In this tradition the theory of Operator  Spaces provides the right language for quantizing Banach spaces, a notion developed  to describe the spaces of solutions of differential equations. For example, using this language  it is now possible to talk about the expected exit time for a noncommutative domain although we can never see the ""points"" of this domain. As a long term perspective these mathematical  theories  provide new features which may  be used to understand phenomena in physics and other natural sciences.<br/>"

We are interested in how the geometry, the boundary and the regularity of the metric influence certain basic estimates.  Problems of this kind arise in the study of harmonic analysis on manifolds, the study of local and global solutions of nonlinear wave equations and in the study of eigenfunctions in quantum chaos.  Although these topics are widely separated in their physical and historical origins, the relevant mathematics is closely related.  Techniques and insights in the various areas cross-fertilize each other in a fruitful way.  In particular, a common theme of much current research (and the problems in this proposal) is to try to understand and exploit the mass concentration of eigenfunctions and solutions of linear and nonlinear wave equations. The basic estimates that we have in mind are Lebesgues-space estimates (both linear and bilinear) in space for eigenfunctions and quasi-modes, and (local or global) Strichartz estimates in space-time.  The main questions center around how the geometry and especially the presence of a boundary affects the estimates and the kinds of solutions that saturate them.  The latter issue is closely related to the much studied (but still not well understood) questions of concentration, oscillation and size properties of modes and quasi-modes in spectral asymptotics.  In the non-compact setting it is also closely related to the distribution of resonances and their relations to trapped geodesics.<br/><br/>The above problems arise naturally from interactions between mathematics and areas in physics that include general relativity, quantum mechanics, and quantum chaos.  The techniques employed include stationary phase and the study of propagation of singularities.  There is a very active group of researchers in quantum physics groups at major universities studying high-energy eigenstates, and I am especially interested in making further contributions to this area.<br/><br/>"

Three types of interrelated problems involving perturbations will be investigated: 1) Regular Hamiltonian perturbations of systems with homoclinic orbits to saddle-centers, e.g. perturbations of sine-Gordon breathers. 2) Perturbations containing highest order derivatives. With this type of perturbations to PDEs, the nature of the systems can be changed dramatically, e.g. loss of finite speed propagation and/or disappearance of solutions backward in time. Impact of both dissipative and conservative perturbations on the dynamics will be studied. 3) Hamiltonian motions with fast oscillations. Averaging method and formal multi-scale analysis are applied in deriving the limiting wave or Schroedinger maps. In addition to justifying the convergence on various time scales, the structural stability will be studied, which are in the form of normally elliptic type geometric singular perturbation problems.<br/><br/>Many well-known evolutionary PDEs, as mathematical models, are approximations of real world dynamical systems. In order to have better understanding of the original problems, we need to study not only these PDEs, but their perturbations as well, which may include factors like small viscosity or weak elasticity, etc. On the other hand, while there are some special well-understood ones, it is usually rather difficult to study the qualitative properties and temporal asymptotic behavior of many evolutionary PDEs. Rigorous and formal asymptotic analyses provide effective ways to study the dynamics of systems close to those special ones. This proposal focuses on certain regular and singular perturbation problems related to waves, ferromagnetism, etc., involving rapid oscillations, strong dissipation, strong dispersion etc. In conjunction with this, it is also proposed to incorporate several aspects of this research into curriculum development. This effort will include an application-minded reform of some current courses and the development of a new graduate PDE dynamics course presenting the dynamical system point of view for PDEs. In addition, research and education will be woven together through the development and improvement of seminars and vertically integrated work groups.<br/><br/>"

Very little is known about sampling and interpolation sequences on domains in several complex variables, but the PI, in collaboration with others, has obtained sufficient conditions for hypersurfaces to be sampling or interpolating.

The problem of the interpolation of functions has been a central theme since the early days of complex analysis, while the sampling problem is considerably more recent.  Sampling was popularized by Shannon in the 1940s as a significant portion of his theory of information. Since that time, engineers have been deeply interested in matters of sampling, so much so that the notion of sampling is now in the collective consciousness of everyday society. In a nutshell, sampling a function consists of measuring the value of a function at a certain sufficiently large but discrete set of points.  The measurements should be made often enough so that the function is completely determined by its detected values. The interpolation problem can then be seen as the dual problem of reconstructing the function from this discrete, or ``digital'' data.<br/><br/>An important aspect of this proposal involves undergraduate student projects dealing with open problems in Complex Analysis. One such problem is the question of which polynomials (in several real variables) are factors of harmonic polynomials. Another involves the determination of the best constant in the Bergman space maximum principle. Both of these questions are amenable to experimental work by students to gather evidence for an appropriate conjectured solution.<br/><br/><br/>"

The PI is interested in the free boundary<br/>problems with nonlocal structure, where velocities of the free boundaries<br/>depend on global characteristics of the solutions. The goal is to gain a<br/>better understanding of the following aspects of such problems: the<br/>existence and uniqueness of solutions in global time; asymptotic behavior<br/>of the free boundary as time reaches zero or infinity; waiting time<br/>phenomena; and the regularity properties of the free boundaries. The PI<br/>employs the notion of viscosity solutions to address the behavior of<br/>aformentioned free boundary problems. This approach has been succesfully<br/>used to study nonlinear PDEs and local laws of motions such as 'motion by<br/>mean curvature'. The great advantage of this approach is its seamless<br/>handling of topological transitions such as pinch-off. The key-step of the<br/>theory of viscosity solutions is to establish a comparison principle. This<br/>property leads, in turn, to the existence of solutions and allows for the<br/>further study of their properties. Techniques coming from quantitative<br/>versions of the comparison principle and harmonic analysis are employed to<br/>study further properties of solutions.<br/><br/>The classical Stefan problem of melting ice is an example of the free<br/>boundary problems. In the Stefan problem, one is modeling the evolution of<br/>the polar ice caps, and the question of interest is the location, as a<br/>function of time, of the interface between water and ice. The particular<br/>problems to which the methods of the present proposal apply also include:<br/>the<br/>Hele-Shaw problem which models fluid motion in a narrow cell between<br/>two parallel plates; flame fronts; and the interface between oil and<br/>water in a flow. This is an area where modeling and computation are far<br/>ahead of mathematical analysis. The main obstacle for developing a<br/>well-defined notion for general motion of interfaces is that initially<br/>smooth boundaries moving under smooth velocities may develop singularities<br/>in finite time. The hitting and splitting of interfaces in flame<br/>propagation is an example. It is natural to wonder whether the<br/>continuation of the solutions is uniquely determined after pinch-off, or<br/>whether additional constitutive information might be required at the<br/>singular time. The impact of the singularity to the other part of the free<br/>boundary is another interesting question.  The PI plans to investigate<br/>these questions in local and global perspectives.<br/>"

For this project their main goal will be to extend current knowledge of invariant subspaces, cyclic vectors, and zero sets of Bergman, Dirichlet and related spaces in one variable, as well as of the Drury-Arveson-Hardy space on the unit ball of several complex variables.<br/><br/>The study of spaces of analytic functions has a long and rich history as a meeting ground and source of ideas from a wide range of areas in both Pure and Applied Mathematics such as Complex Analysis, Harmonic Analysis, Operator Theory, Functional Analysis, Control theory, and Partial Differential Equations. Operator theory has its roots in the work on Partial Differential Equations of Fredholm and Hilbert in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The study of spaces of analytic functions has its origins in the work on the classical Hardy spaces by Hardy, Fischer, and the Riesz brothers, among others, in the first half of the twentieth century. The two areas met in the 1940's in the work of A. Beurling on the unilateral shift, which yielded a complete structure theory of an important infinite dimensional operator using Hardy-space techniques. The generalization of Beurling's results to arbitrary multiplicity shifts together with the Sz.Nagy dilation theorem is the basis for a model theory for contraction operators on Hilbert spaces. Thus, up to scaling, every bounded linear operator on a separable Hilbert space can be modeled using a semi-invariant subspace of a vector-valued Hardy space. As many naturally occurring processes can be modeled by use of such linear operators, this has applications that can be felt throughout science. More research is needed and is being done to clarify the model theory. In particular, there has been a large effort devoted to extending the ideas developed in the study of the Hardy spaces to other spaces of analytic functions. The current work of Richter and Sundberg is in this area.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The problems considered may be viewed as far reaching extensions of classical results. At the same time, these problems lead to strong applications of ergodic theory to combinatorics, number theory and algebra which are inaccessible, so far, by conventional methods. The polynomial Szemeredi theorem, the polynomial Hales-Jewett theorem and extensions thereof, obtained by the PIs in recent years, served as an impetus for further developments in the theory of multiple recurrence. These developments provide better understanding of the phenomenon of multiple recurrence along polynomials and bring new vistas of research to light. An interesting and important direction of research opened up by the polynomial results of the PIs is connected to the entrance of nilpotent groups into the picture. Not only are most of the familiar results dealing with commutative groups naturally extendible to the nilpotent setup, but also it turns out that nilpotent dynamics allows one to get new information about convergence/recurrence properties of one parameter groups of measure preserving transformations. The related conjectures formulated in the proposal shed new light on the connections of nilpotent dynamics with important problems of ergodic theory, combinatorics and uniform distribution.<br/><br/>The problems and conjectures that are posed in the proposal connect diverse areas of mathematics (ergodic theory, combinatorics, number theory) and contribute to each. The proposed study aims at better understanding of the regularity of the behavior of dynamical systems sampled at moments of time corresponding to values of polynomial (and more general) functions. While the proposal focuses on strong applications of this phenomenon in combinatorics and number theory, it may be of interest to a physicist as well. For example, one of the corollaries of the theory of multiple recurrence is that measuring the status of a physical system along polynomial (rather than linear) instances of time reveals quite a lot about the system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

These<br/>questions regarding equidistribution can be approached from many<br/>angles. Two theories which have proved to be particularly well-suited<br/>to study such questions are the spectral theory of automorphic forms,<br/>which is closely related to the theory of L-functions, and the theory<br/>of dynamical systems, particularly the study of unipotent and more<br/>general flows on these homogeneous spaces.

One of the goals of the research is to refine our understanding of the distributions of zeros and critical points of polynomials, holomorphic sections of ample line bundles, and entire functions.  The research focuses on asymptotic results for polynomials of increasing degree, holomorphic sections of increasing powers of a line bundle, or in the case of entire functions, on domains of increasing size.  One problem is to find the variance of the number of simultaneous zeros of systems of random polynomials or entire functions in a domain.  Another problem is to estimate ""hole probabilities;"" i.e., the probabilities that a random function has no solutions (or critical points) in fixed domains.  A fundamental ingredient in the study of random sections is the Bergman-Szego kernel, and this project involves an examination of the asymptotics of this kernel.  Shiffman will also study the distribution of zeros of real and complex ""fewnomial"" systems---polynomials of high degree with few terms---and he will investigate similar problems for spherical harmonics.  The research program on critical points has two aspects:  studying how the metric on a positive line bundle on a compact complex manifold affects the distribution of critical points of holomorphic sections, and secondly, how to count the distribution of vacua in string theory.<br/><br/>The distribution of critical points and zeros of random functions is relevant to many areas in physics, signal and image processing, and other areas of engineering.  In the physical sciences it is often necessary to handle disorder, where a certain amount of randomness is inserted into a system.  One then looks for a way to statistically describe a random ""landscape""---the hills and valleys of the graph of a function of several variables.  One aspect of the geometry of the landscape that this project studies is the distribution of the local maxima (peaks), local minima, and saddle points (passes), the totality of which are called ""critical points.""  Random polynomials provide an elementary model for many systems, such as systems of atoms and molecules and their component particles---protons, neutrons, and electrons.  Quantum mechanics describes these particles by wave functions, which are solutions of Schrodinger's equation.  The zeros and local maxima of wave functions give important information on states of atoms and molecules; the zeros are known in quantum chemistry and physics as nodal lines.  Polynomials in several variables correspond to systems with several degrees of freedom, and those polynomials of high degree correspond to wave functions for highly excited states.  Another application of the research is to the ""string theory landscape.""  String theory, which is a framework that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics, postulates that space has 6 hidden dimensions rolled up into a small compact shape, called a Calabi-Yau manifold.  This manifold is described by many parameters, whose possible values are given as critical points of a function.  This project investigates the enumeration and distribution of the critical points corresponding to possible descriptions of our universe.<br/><br/>"

In this proposal the focus is mainly on almost everywhere convergence, and thus inherently on the boundedness of the associated<br/>maximal operators. An important instance of multi-linearity is represented by the combinatorial averages such as Furstenberg's nonstandard averages and the averages on cubes. The convergence of such averages has deep implications for various Ramsey-type problems on integers and even on general abstract groups. A second type of multi-linear operators we plan to investigate is represented by the weighted averages and series, such as the ones appearing in the so-called ``return times theorems''.

Parisi. These models are simple mathematical objects. It is remarkable that they exhibit such a subtle behavior, and that their rigorous study is so challenging. The PI believes that elucidating these models will bring the discovery of an entire new direction in probability theory. He has been trying for 10 years to build new methods to study them. One of the fundamental objectives (the proof of the Parisi formula giving the free energy of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model) has been attained, but this success cannot hide the fact that overall our understanding remains rather limited. In particular, two central questions, (known as the Ultrametricity conjecture and the Chaos problem) seem as hard as ever. They are possibly related to questions of analysis.  The PI plans to work on these very hard questions, but also will strive to make incremental progress on less daunting issues, in particular the study of new mathematically canonical mean field Hamiltonians that exhibit replica symmetric equations of a new type. <br/><br/><br/>     Mathematics and Physics have influenced each other in fundamental ways since at least Galileo, and this mutual influence is stronger than ever. In the seventies, Physicists discovered that certain alloys (called spin glasses) responded in an unconventional way to magnetic simulation. They introduced new models to explain these behaviors. These models are simple and natural mathematical objects. Yet for a long time there existed no mathematical method to study them.  The early work of the physicists uses heuristic methods that need not be completely reliable. The present project it a step in the long range program of eliminating this discrepancy, by developing new tools from mathematics, and in particular probability theory, to completely understand these fundamental models. The long rang outcome of this program could be a new impetus on probability theory, one of the most important branch of mathematics for applications. <br/>"

In our problems, we are in a situation where classical estimates do not provide enough information on the Cauchy-Riemann and Laplace operators to conclude the results we expect. Thus, our approach will be to perturb these two operators suitably, obtain strong estimates on the perturbed operators, and then connect these estimates to the unperturbed operators. The starting point is a twisted version of the Cauchy-Riemann complex which we have previously studied; but I also plan to study more general versions of the twisting idea. The initial twisted complex has already produced some powerful results in<br/>Complex analysis and it is currently being extended to other contexts by several mathematicians, including the proposer. We view its continued development as one of the very fertile ideas presently ongoing in several complex variables.<br/><br/>Our proposed research will make a significant contribution to the broad, general question: by how much may one perturb a system of partial differential equations and still obtain information on the unperturbed system from the perturbed system? The results we expect will have many connections to areas of mathematics outside complex analysis, especially topology (through the connection between square-integrable cohomology and ordinary homology), differential<br/>equations, and algebraic geometry (by deepening our understanding of order of contact between algebraic and analytic varieties). Additionally, however, since partial differential equations are ubiquitous throughout science and engineering, our perturbation methods will be useful outside pure mathematics. We believe that adaptations of our perturbation methods will apply to partial differential equations which arise in parts of current scientific theory and our proposed research will thereby strengthen the ties and establish new connections between complex analysis and other fields of science.<br/><br/>"

We plan to obtain new and precise criteria for discreteness of spectra and strict positivity for the magnetic Schroedinger operators, with general scalar and vector potentials.  We will use a gauge optimization  to reduce many issues to those for a family of the usual Schroedinger operators with a potential.  We wish to establish new and more precise two-sided estimates for the bottom of the spectrum and essential spectrum of (magnetic) Schroedinger operators. We plan to study applications of the spectral theory of one-dimensional Schroedinger operators to KdV and mKdV equations.  In particular the construction of solutions of mKdV in classes of functions which may grow at infinity with respect  to the space variable will be investigated using a first order evolution PDE satisfied by eigenfunctions of the one-dimensional Schroedinger operators whose time-dependent potentials satisfy KdV. We also propose to investigate Arnold's problem of finding the  asymptotic growth rate of the distribution function of the Dirichlet eigenvalues corresponding to a fixed irreducible representation of a finite group G for an elliptic self-adjoint operator A on a compact manifold with boundary and with a G-action commuting with A. This will be done using the method of approximate spectral projection, which should also provide an estimate of remainder in the asymptotic expansion.<br/><br/>The spectrum of a Schroedinger operator has long been interpreted in terms of  the energy levels of a quantum particle in the electric and magnetic fields associated with  the coefficients of the operator.  The results of the proposed research may be interpreted in terms of the localization and stability of the quantum particle at various energy levels.  We plan to study influence of the symmetries of different states on the asymptotic distribution of the corresponding energy levels. The Korteweg - de Vries (KdV) and modified Korteweg - de Vries (mKdV) equations  are important model equations of various phenomena in non-linear dynamics and we expect to obtain new classes of solutions by using  spectral methods.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

In the complex dynamics direction, the aim is to make a connection between some of the ideas behind the recent advances in dynamics of one complex variable and two dimensional dynamics. The PI proposes a scheme for using methods from dynamics in one complex variable and computer tools to construct symbolic codings which could lead to understanding two dimensional diffeomorphisms. He also proposes methods to explore structure in parameter space through the monodromy of Julia sets. The PI also deals with the classical dynamical behavior of  trajectories on rational polygonal tables. The questions involving the dynamics of the billiard flow translate into questions involving an action of the special linear group on the moduli space of translation structures. The problem is to understand and geometrically characterize orbits of this action.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Mathematical models that describe how systems change with time provide essential insights in many areas of science. They are used to describe the rhythms of the heart, the pulsing of lasers and the spread of disease. When the models are nonlinear the long term behavior, or dynamics, of these models can be chaotic and the dependence of the dynamics on the parameters of the model can be extraordinarily delicate. This is true even in very simple models. The potential impact of a deeper understanding of nonlinear dynamics is profound and could be felt in many areas of science. One aim of this proposal is to determine how computational and theoretical methods interact in exploring families of dynamical systems. Answers to such questions could have broad impact as questions about how best to use computers arise in many scientific areas. The study of polygonal billiards ties together some very simple dynamical systems with intuitive appeal with some deep questions about the structure of certain moduli spaces that are the focus of interest from many viewpoints including algebraic geometry algebraic topology and string theory. This link vividly illustrates the connectedness of mathematics and raises the possibility of the cross fertilization between very different fields.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

There are three main areas:<br/><br/>(i) We want to get a better understanding what happens to the return times for mixing maps near periodic orbits. Currently it is known that generic points have in the limit Poisson distributed return times. However near periodic orbits such regular behavior cannot be assumed and we intend to show that the limiting distribution is a compounded Poisson distribution where the compounded part is Bernoulli and determined by an `escape rate' near the periodic orbit.<br/><br/>(ii) The second area of research is to determine the limiting distribution for return times for non-uniformly hyperbolic systems. This would allow us then to classify the long term statistical behavior for a considerably larger class of dynamical systems including some parabolic systems, `billiard type' systems and also higher dimensional maps similar to the Henon map which has been studied extensively and is technically very difficult to approach.<br/><br/>(iii) The third major area in which we propose to do research is related to a famous theorem by Shannon, McMillan and Breiman that uses the decay rate of dynamical neighbourhoods to describe the entropy. We want to prove a Central Limit Theorem for a $\alpha$-mixing systems. This will considerably extend previous results that used very strong mixing or regularity assumptions to obtain distribution results. We want to use new techniques that should allow us to overcome the difficulties that are entailed by weakening the mixing properties.<br/><br/><br/>Let us note that research in this area is of interest to a wide variety of scientists including experimentalists who want to do numerical simulations. Detailed knowledge about the distribution of return times can be used to develop more reliable ways to numerically analyze time series of chaotic dynamical systems. The proposed research can also serve to develop more efficient data compression algorithms."
