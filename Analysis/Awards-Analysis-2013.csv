The second considers the smooth action rigidity for the Cartan action on homogeneous space generated by quaternion groups by geometric method; this  complements the project of  studying smooth rigidity for higher-rank algebraic actions.  Finally, we study the general smooth action rigidity for Cartan action and parabolic action; here we apply the famous Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) method to homogenous function space. <br/> <br/> <br/>Dynamical systems appeared first because of Newton's discovery that the motions of mechanical objects can be described by the solutions of ordinary differential equations. More generally, many other natural and social phenomena,such as radioactive decay, chemical reaction, population growth, or dynamics of prices on the market, maybe be modeled with various dynamical systems. So the subject of dynamical systems hasfound numerous applications not only in other branches of mathematics, such asnumber theory, geometry and representation theory, but also in physics, biology, economics and other sciences.The proposed research focuses on smooth rigidity results of algebraic actions, that is, the stabilityproperties related to change of parameters. The PI proposes to develop new methods and techniques from representation theory andharmonic analysis in the study of dynamical systems. The PI believes that the new tool is powerful in solving problems and inspiring new directions in dynamical systems. The PI intends to work with some graduate students and teach graduate-level course during the period of this award."

Understanding the analytic and algebraic structure of these spaces is quite challenging; one reason is that few of the one-dimensional tools carry over to higher dimensions.

Kulkarni"" will be held at Queens College of the City University of New York, 65-30 Kiseena Blvd, Flushing, NY 11367, on October 25, 26, and 27, 2013.  The subject of Riemann surfaces is one of the most fundamental areas in mathematics. Mathematicians in the 19th century extensively worked on Riemann surfaces from the point of view of algebraic curves, often by concretely representing them as a branched covering of the Riemann sphere, using a meromorphic function. The idea of analytic continuation of germs of holomorphic functions had also led to the study of Riemann surfaces. Riemann's famous 1851 dissertation inaugurated the study of geometrical methods in function theory. Here, one finds the idea of a Riemann surface as a covering surface with a system of local uniformizing parameters. The publication of Weyl's 1913 classic began the formal study of Riemann surfaces, where a Riemann surface was understood to be a connected complex manifold of one complex dimension. At present, the subject of Riemann surfaces is at the heart of many important branches of modern mathematics. It intersects with a broad range of fields, like geometric function theory, hyperbolic manifolds, discontinuous groups, complex dynamics, and more recently, string theory in particle physics.<br/><br/><br/>The main goal of our conference is to bring together leading researchers in conformal geometry, Riemann surfaces, and related fields, who will talk on the present state of research in their specialized areas, and also give a broad overview of how their research is related with other areas of mathematics. An important purpose of this conference is to honor the many fundamental contributions of Ravi Kulkarni to a wide range of mathematical areas closely related to discontinuous groups, conformal geometry, and Riemann surfaces. The aim is to explore some of the key developments in the areas related to, or directly influenced by Kulkarni's broad research contributions. We expect this to be a very stimulating conference, with ample scope for mathematical interactions. All invited speakers are outstanding experts in their fields of expertise. They will give an excellent overview of the many areas that interact with conformal geometry and Riemann surfaces. There will be about 70 participants, who will immensely benefit from the wide range of talks. The City University of New York has a lively and very active group of researchers working in Riemann surfaces and various aspects of conformal geometry. We are especially interested in inviting graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from CUNY Graduate Center, New York University, Columbia University, SUNY at StonyBrook, Rutgers (Newark), and Yale University. In particular, we want to invite recent Ph.Ds and young assistant professors from all CUNY Colleges (Senior and Community Colleges). Many of them are seriously interested to continue research. This conference will give them a very good opportunity to interact with other mathematicians, and get an exposure to some important research problems. We expect this conference to be of great help for young mathematicians who are interested in Riemann surfaces and related topics, and who also aspire to be future specialists."

Four major topics of research are proposed. The first is travel-time tomography in anisotropic media. In mathematical terms this involves the determination of a Riemannian metric (anisotropic sound speed) in the interior of a domain from the lengths of geodesics joining points of the boundary (travel times) and from other kinematic information. The second topic is electric impedance tomography (EIT), also called Calderon's problem. In this inverse method one attempts to determine the conductivity of a medium by making voltage and current measurements at its boundary.  The third topic focuses on coupled-physics or hybrid inverse problems. In this type of inverse problem one attempts to determine the internal properties of a medium by combining two types of waves through a physical principle; namely, one wave that has high resolution (e.g., ultrasound) and another that provides high contrast. Examples are photoacoustic tomography (PAT), thermoacoustic tomography (TAT), and transient elastography (TE). The fourth topic is on invisibility and cloaking: how to make objects invisible to different types of waves.<br/><br/>In inverse boundary problems one attempts to determine the internal properties of a medium by making measurements at the boundary of the medium. In other words, can one ""see"" what is inside by making measurements on the outside? An example is a CT scan, a commonly used medical imaging technique. One measures the response of the body to X-rays and makes an image of what is inside from this information. The project will investigate new proposed medical imaging techniques, such as photoacoustic tomography. This combines the high resolution of one imaging method with the high contrast capabilities of another. One important medical imaging application is breast cancer detection. Ultrasound provides a high (sub-millimeter) resolution, but suffers from low contrast.  On the other hand, many tumors absorb much more energy from electromagnetic waves than do healthy cells. Photoacoustic tomography consists of sending relatively harmless optical radiation into tissues. This causes heating (with increases of the temperature in the millikelvin range), which results in the generation of propagating ultrasound waves (the photo-acoustic effect). Another area that the project will explore is to image the Earth's interior by measuring the time that it takes for seismic waves to traverse it. In this way one attempts a journey through the center of the Earth with the help of information provided by earthquakes. A final major topic of research in the project is the study of cloaking and invisibility. Can one make objects invisible to light, sound, and other types of waves?"

In particular, it is concentrated on problems in perturbation theory. One of the most important problems of the proposal is the problem to estimate functions of perturbed noncommuting pairs of self-adjoint operators. This problem is very important in many applications, in particular, in quantum mechanics. Other important problems in perturbation theory deal with trace formulas for functions of perturbed operators, functional calculus for almost commuting self-adjoint operators, and estimates for operator and commutator moduli of continuity. The project hopes to reveal new connections with Schur multipliers, Hankel operators, and Hankel tensors; comprehend the role of Hankel and Toeplitz operators in noncommutative analysis; develop techniques of Schur multipliers in operator theory and harmonic analysis; find new applications in mathematical physics, control theory, prediction theory, and approximation theory. <br/><br/>The problems of perturbation theory that are the focus of this project are important in applications in quantum mechanics, mathematical physics, electrical engineering, and control theory, and in other fields of science. The importance of perturbation theory in applications stems from the fact that if one is faced with an equation that describes a given situation (say, a physical one), the equation is often very complicated. One can replace it with a simpler (perturbed) equation that is reasonably close to the original equation and solve the new equation.  Then it is time to invoke the latest results of perturbation theory to find out whether the solutions of the perturbed equation are reasonably close to the solutions of the initial equation that is needed for applications. This project considers important problems in perturbation theory that can help in such commonly occurring situations. Other problems described in the proposal are also important in applications such as prediction theory, control theory, and approximation theory."

In situations where even an ""almost"" local-global statement seems out of reach of current technology, the PI will develop new exponential sum bounds to improve the number of R-almost primes which can be produced from an Affine Sieve. The PI will also develop numerical algorithms to explore the Laplace spectrum of infinite volume hyperbolic manifolds, and strive to rigorously certify that numerically observed eigenvalues actually correspond to true spectra.<br/><br/>Integrated with the proposed research projects are numerous educational and outreach components. The PI will continue to advise high school through graduate students, and organize seminars, meetings, and conferences. A new course at Yale will be developed for non-math majors, with the goal of popularizing mathematics to broader audiences, including discussions of recent research activity. The PI will give lectures through the Office of New Haven and State Affairs, and Science Saturdays at Yale, to the general public, specifically geared for middle and high school students in the Pathways to Science program. This proposal will also support the attendance of underprivileged New Haven area middle school students to the MathCounts competition. Through such avenues, the PI will be in a position to bring traditionally under-represented groups into contact with cutting-edge research.<br/><br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Analysis programs."

Nazarov, Treil and Volberg will concentrate their efforts on several well-known hard problems in non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and spectral theory. The common theme among majority of the problems is the so-called ""universality"" phenomenon, i.e. the fact that in many situations the boundedness of one operator (or a small collection of operators) implies that a much wider class of operators is bounded as well. Most of the problems lie in the realm of the non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, where underlying sets and measures are highly irregular. Singular integral operators with respect to singular measures and very irregular sets appear naturally in many problems of analysis. One of the motivations for the one-weight non-homogeneous case was the study of analytic capacity. The more sophisticated two-weight estimates of singular operators appear naturally in spectral theory and in the perturbation theory of self-adjoint operators. These problems are notoriously difficult, but using new techniques  recently developed by Nazarov, Treil and Volberg  and other researchers, they expect to make fundamental progress in the problems.<br/> <br/><br/>This collaborative mathematics research project by Nazarov, Treil and Volberg is focused in the field of harmonic analysis, which is known to have fundamental applications to other disciplines, most notably to the analysis of large data sets, to image processing, and to the study of wave propagation.

The project will provide a good training ground for graduate students as well as for mathematicians at the beginning of their careers.  Nazarov, Treil and Volberg anticipate an active involvement of their graduate students and postdocs in the project."

This is a problem in complex analysis but its solution involves doing analysis on a Berkovich space. Another project is in arithmetic dynamics. Given a discrete-time two-dimensional dynamical system defined by a pair of polynomials with rational coefficients, Jonsson will investigate how the arithmetic complexity grows along orbits of the dynamics.

Similarly, geometry is the basis for many current industrial applications such as 3D printing. This project will enhance the tools available in the aforementioned branches of mathematics. The development of geometry goes back to the ancient Greeks, who laid down axioms, or basic assumptions, from which all other reasonable properties could be logically deduced. The main focus of this project is a detailed study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean Axiom, attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer valid. The resulting mathematics turns out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of the usual, Archimedean, kind."

This research area has important applications to many areas of mathematics and science. Based on methods of Fourier analysis, Koldobsky has recently developed a new approach to the study of sections and projections of convex bodies. The idea is to express certain geometric characteristics of a body in terms of the Fourier transform and then use methods of harmonic analysis to solve geometric problems. This approach has led to several results including  Fourier analytic solutions of the Busemann-Petty and Shephard problems,characterizations of intersection and projection bodies. Koldobsky  will apply the Fourier approach to other open problems in the area, with the emphasis on newly discovered stability and separation properties in volume comparison problems and their applications to the hyperplane conjecture. Another direction is to study the duality between section and projections, in particular to establish isomorphic equivalence of intersection and polar projection bodies. An old problem in probability theory is to characterize all random vectors having the property that all linear combinations of coordinates have the same distribution, up to a constant. The classical examples are stable random vectors. Koldobsky will characterize all random vectors with this property.<br/><br/><br/>While the problems considered in this mathematics research project by Aleksandr Koldobsky are related to three different areas of mathematics (convex geometry, functional analysis and probability) the strategy of solution is common for most of the results - the questions are translated into the language of the Fourier transform and then treated as problems in harmonic analysis. In convex geometry, Koldobsky considers the problem of reconstructing a solid using data about plane sections and projections of this solid. The results and methods extend the classical techniques of x-ray tomography to situations where only special sets of sections or projections are available. In probability, Koldobsky studies stable processes, which are probabilistic laws that inherit the main self-reproductive property of the normal law. The underlying Fourier techniques developed by Koldobsky have led to important applications to other disciplines (e.g., neural networks in image processing; for example, one can find the main frequencies of a signal using only information about the maximal amplitude of this signal on intervals of time of equal lengths). An important part of the project is the involvement and training of graduate students and postdocs."

The two main themes here are (i) boundary value problems and (ii) global in time dispersion  on curved backgrounds.

Another goal is to achieve a good understanding of the dynamics near these obstructions.<br/><br/>The study of short and long term dynamics in quasilinear dispersive equations is another main theme of this proposal.  There are several models of interest, namely nonlinear wave equations (in particular Einstein's equations), nonlinear Schroedinger equations as well as some water wave models.<br/><br/>Although the proposed work is primarily theoretical, many of the problems have their origin in physical theories such as general relativity, many body quantum field theory, surface wave propagation and plasma physics. As such, it is hoped that the results of the research may shed some light on the corresponding physical phenomena. Two good examples in this directions are the black hole stability question in general relativity, as well as the long range propagation of water waves.<br/><br/>On the human resource side, the project involves a  good number of graduate students (six at present), as well as postdocs (five for the first year of the project, including three NSF postdocs). It also involves  many collaborators at various institutions, both domestic and abroad. The  results of this research will be made widely available via publications, web based tools, presentations at conferences and summer schools."

In real life, the order in which certain operations are executed can make a big difference. For example, first boiling water and afterwards adding oil is very different from first boiling oil and then adding water. Noncommutative analysis is about functions and their properties in the realm of noncommuting variables. The most important example is matrix-valued functions. The theory of Fourier analysis or harmonic analysis has a lot to say about functions, and as this project intends to show, also about matrix-valued functions. The project will also make valuable contributions to control theory and signal and image processing, where matrix-valued functions are natural occurences."

The first is to find surface subgroups for certain natural classes of groups: the fundamental group of a negatively curved rank 1 locally symmetric space, or more generally of a closed negatively curved manifold; a hyperbolic group whose Gromov boundary is connected; or the mapping class group of a compact surface. The second project is to count ""virtual immersions"" of a geometrically finite open 3-manifold into a closed hyperbolic 3- or 4-manifold, with an aim toward assembling these virtual immersions into a virtual immersion of a more complex 3-manifold (and inductively counting the number of such immersions). The third project is to develop the theory of degenerate complex structures (with something like measured laminations), and use this theory to prove bounds for renormalization of quadratic-like maps, and to provide a sufficient condition for a finite subdivision rule to be conformally realized, with an eye towards proving the Cannon conjecture. <br/><br/>One of the fundamental jobs of the mathematical researcher is to classify the objects that we have defined. A manifold is a space with some number of dimensions, with no boundaries or edges but which is finite in extent. Examples of two-dimensional manifolds include the surface of the Earth and the surface of an inner tube; the two-dimensional manifolds have been classified since the early twentieth century. Recent results including the work of the proposer have made it possible to classify three-dimensional manifolds as well; this classification is made possible by finding two-dimensional objects within the three-dimensional manifold that divides it in such a way as to elucidate its structure. Our ultimate goal is to arrive at a much deeper understanding of the three-dimensional space that we live in."

The first part of this project deals with the Ericksen-Leslie system modeling hydrodynamic flow of nematic liquid crystals, which is a strongly nonlinear-coupled system between the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation of the underlying fluid velocity field and the transported heat flow of harmonic maps for the orientation director field of the nematic liquid crystal molecules. The objective is to establish existence and partial regularity for Leray-Hopf type weak solutions in dimension three. The second project investigates the energy asymptotic of a singularly perturbed functional in the sense of Gamma-convergence and resolve the Keller-Rubinstein-Sternberg problem on the dynamics in terms of harmonic map heat flow under new boundary conditions and mean curvature flow of the sharp interface. The third project is to establish the local well-posedness of such a conserved mean curvature flow for generic initial surfaces. The fourth project is to study the uniqueness of general Aronsson's equations for Hamiltonian functions with spatial dependence and the regularity of infinity harmonic functions and Aronsson's equations corresponding to uniformly convex Hamiltonians.<br/><br/>The proposed problems in these areas are not only very challenging mathematically but also have strong connections and profound applications to other fields such as biology, chemical engineering, physics, fluid mechanics and material sciences. Mathematically, the nonlinear partial differential equations or systems involved in the project either are either highly degenerate elliptic problems or equations with super-critical nonlinearities whose resolutions will definitely contribute new ideas and techniques that will be useful in a variety of contexts.  The hydrodynamic flow of nematic liquid crystals is among the most fundamental equations describing the dynamics of viscoelastic fluids and has its origination in LCD design and engineering. The conserved geometric motion has close connection with the Bose condensate physics. The L-infinity variational problems has found its applications in the optimal control,  the image recovery engineering arise, the determination of optimal radiation treatments in chemotherapy, and the design of winning strategies for random game theories. Rigorous analysis of both the existence and the regularity of various solutions to such a system can predict the formation of singularities, allow researchers to gain insight into turbulent phenomena, and justify both computational and experimental studies made by applied scientists and engineers. This project will result in the publication of monographs and lecture notes from international summer schools for both researchers and graduate students, involve active training of advanced PhD students, and include the organization of specific conferences such as Ohio River Analysis Meetings, AMS and SIAM special sessions, and AIM or BIRS workshops."

If  p is two  the  p  Laplace equation reduces to  Laplace's equation and the Green's  function for Laplace's equation,  with pole at a fixed point in the domain, gives harmonic measure.  This measure  has had numerous  applications in   Potential  Theory and  applied areas throughout the twentieth century.  In the mid 1980's   mathematicians began to study the Hausdorff  dimension of  harmonic measure.    In an important paper,    Makarov   proved that harmonic measure in simply connected planar domains always has dimension one.  Jones and  Wolf  showed that the dimension of this measure is always  less than or equal to one in any planar domain.  The proposer has  obtained  endpoint type analogues of  Makarov's work  for  p  harmonic  measures, when p is between one  and  infinity.  In this proposal  he discusses possible techniques  for studying p harmonic measures in   arbitrary planar domains  and  also  in  certain  domains in  higher dimensional Euclidean space.<br/><br/><br/>  Laplace's  equation  was  used widely throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to explain physical processes.

The  PI's work with coauthors  gives the p Laplacian strong visibility in an  area  previously  reserved for the Laplacian.The PI and coauthors have  developed a  p harmonic toolbox which  enabled  them to make significant progress on problems previously considered solvable only  for Laplace's equation.     The PI believes that the techniques, results, and  problems discussed in his proposal  will   play an important role in popularizing the p Laplacian and  also  have applications in mathematical modeling. These  problems - techniques  involve a nice mixture of  harmonic analysis,  complex function theory, and partial differential equations, so should be attractive to researchers and  graduate students in  a  wide  area of  mathematical and  applied analysis."

Recent developments in the area of sharp geometric inequalities include best constants for Moser-Trudinger inequalities on the entire Heisenberg group and more general Carnot groups and Adams inequalities on high order Sobolev spaces on unbounded domains in Euclidean spaces. These are circumstances where symmetrization properties do not hold. The PI, in collaboration with his PhD students, have very recently succeeded in developing a rearrangement-free argument. This new method suggests that such sharp geometric inequalities can be established in more general scenarios including Riemannian and sub-Riemannian manifolds.  Moreover, the PI will investigate the existence of extremal functions for these sharp geometric inequalities where many challenging problems still remain open.  Another main direction of research is to develop multiparameter harmonic analysis function space theory in several complicated but important multiparameter settings. The PI, in collaboration with others, has developed a satisfactory theory of discrete Littlewood-Paley square functions in a number of multiparameter scenarios. However,  there are still many other important multiparameter settings where such a discrete Littlewood-Paley theory is yet to be established. <br/><br/>Multi parameter Harmonic analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations are central areas of modern mathematics. Findings and new tools discovered in this project may lead to new development in the area of classical harmonic analysis, partial differential equations as well as other branches of mathematics. They have many applications in sciences and engineering. The solution to the proposed project will have impact on many other disciplines, including mechanics engineering (such as vibration and noise reduction for vehicles), imaging processing and pattern recognitions in medical sciences, stochastic control and optimization, game theory, chemical combustion, human vision and other topics in the life and medical sciences. Moreover, this project has a substantial training and educational component. It finely integrates research together with education. Many graduate students will actively participate in this project by receiving research training under the supervision of the principal investigator."

The specific models to be studied are discrete Schrodinger operators with Sturmian potentials, the square (or cubic) Fibonacci Hamiltonian, the Fibonacci quantum Ising model, quantum walks for quasicrystals, and the labyrinth model. We intend to study the deep relations between these models and hyperbolic dynamical systems that allow us to confirm rigorously a series of previous heuristic and experimental observations regarding quasicrystals made by physicists. In particular, for discrete Schrodinger operators with Sturmian potentials we expect to show that the Hausdorff dimension of the spectrum is the same for almost every frequency. For square and cubic Fibonacci Hamiltonians we intend to provide an understanding of the transition of the spectrum from an interval to a Cantor set with the change of the coupling constant, and establish absolute continuity of the density of states measure in the small coupling regime. Also, we hope to prove that the square continuum Fibonacci Hamiltonian with large couplings has density of states measure of a mixed (a.c. and singular continuous) type, providing the first example of an ergodic family of Schrodinger operators with this property.<br/><br/>The problems in this project are related to mathematical models of quasicrystals. The properties of quasicrystals were heavily studied by physicists and chemists, and it is important to give an explanation of the observed experimental and numerical results based on a rigorous mathematical analysis. Potentially this will not only explain the behavior of existing models but will also help to predict the behavior of new ones. The tools that we intend to develop will undoubtedly find applications in other parts of mathematics as well. For example, in order to prove absolute continuity of density of states measures for some models, we are studying the questions on absolute continuity of convolutions of singular measures. These questions appear frequently in number theory, analysis, dynamics, probability, and geometric measure theory. In additin, the relations between different parts of mathematics (in this case, between spectral theory and dynamical systems) give beautiful evidence of the unity of mathematics. Various problems closely related to the project will be suggested to graduate and undergraduate students at UC-Irvine, thereby initiating them into, or increasing their involvement in, scientific activities. The principal investigator considers such educational and training aspects to be very essential."

In the widely accepted picture, in three or more dimensions there exists a transition from an insulator region, characterized by localized states, to a very different metallic region, characterized by extended states, while in one or two dimensions there are only localized states. This proposal aims to further the mathematical understanding of this picture and of related topics. Arguably the most important open question is the existence of delocalization in three or more dimensions.  Since localization has only been proved by a multiscale analysis (or by the fractional moment method, if applicable), in practice the region of localization is the spectral region where the multiscale analysis can be performed.  We propose to make progress on delocalization by proving the existence of a spectral region where the multiscale analysis breaks down, i.e., some consequence of the multiscale analysis is violated, and by showing delocalization properties (e.g., transport) in this region. We will continue our study of the ac-conductivity in linear response theory for the Anderson model to obtain insight on localization and delocalization. We will investigate the continuity of the density of states for Schrdinger operators in four or more dimensions, and for Schrdinger operators with a magnetic field in two or more dimensions.  We will extend the bootstrap multiscale analysis to the multi-particle continuous Anderson Hamiltonian, an interacting multi-particle random Schrdinger operator, obtaining Anderson localization with finite multiplicity of eigenvalues, dynamical localization, decay of eigenfunction correlations, etc.  We will also investigate localization for multi-particle continuous Anderson Hamiltonians with no assumptions on the single site probability distribution except for compact support, allowing for Bernoulli and other singular single site probability distributions. We will investigate localization for the (discrete) Anderson model in two or more dimensions when the single-site potential is a Bernoulli random variable, a longstanding open problem.<br/><br/>Random Schrdinger operators describe an electron moving in a medium with random impurities.  In the presence of impurities, a material that normally acts like a metal (i.e., it conducts electric current) will exhibit localization and behave like an insulator for electric currents. The impurities create a metal-insulator transition with important practical consequences. This research will contribute to the understanding of electronic phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as Anderson localization and the quantum Hall effect.  Some of the topics of research are suitable for PhD theses, and will be used for the training of future researchers."

Due to the seminal contributions of Kolmogorov, Arnold, Moser, and many others, this subject is experiencing a revival. Recently, new powerful method for working with integrable systems have been developed based on a deep interplay between different branches of mathematics and physics: complex analysis, symplectic geometry, Lie theory,  representation theory, theory of cluster algebras, discrete differential geometry, and computer algebra. As a result, new integrable systems have been discovered, new applications of integrable systems in physics and geometry were unveiled, and many questions explicitly asked in the classical period have been answered.<br/><br/>Non-linear ordinary and partial differential  equations  describe a large number of physical phenomena, ranging from mechanics, fluid mechanics, optics, magnetism to general relativity, and also many natural and interesting geometrical problems.

The systematic study of statistical properties began in the early 60's with the works of Sinai and Ruelle, and later of Bowen, who laid the foundations of thermodynamics. Though the methods they developed were of rather general nature, their applications were restricted mostly to uniformly hyperbolic systems. Much wider horizons were opened after the development of non-uniform hyperbolicity theory that is also known as ""Pesin's theory"". The main activities in dynamics these days are concentrated around studying non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, hyperbolic systems with singularities, and more generally, systems which posses some kind of hyperbolicity however do not belong to the previously mentioned categories. The main aim of the program is to bring together leading experts and young researchers working on statistical properties of dynamical systems and their applications in statistical mechanics, and mathematical physics as well as to foster scholarly exchange and collaboration. The workshops are intended to provide a focus of activities and a meeting place for mathematicians from various countries working in dynamical systems and related topics.

New methods and insights have  been introduced  by the PI and his collaborators  over the past years.

Directions in the proposed program include extension of the arithmeticity  program to  broader classes of  actions with the rank not related to dimension,  applications of measure rigidity  to Zimmer program,  further development of the entropy theory and entropy rigidity for  higher rank abelian actions, completing the program of differentiable rigidity of  partially hyperbolic  algebraic actions of higher rank abelian groups, the study of rigidity phenomena for  totally non- hyperbolic, unipotent actions that present a striking contrast for the classical case,  non-standard KAM-types invariant curve theorem and further investigation of the smooth realization problem.<br/><br/><br/>Dynamical systems serve as mathematical models of time evolution of   various process across the areas of natural and social sciences. It also has a  surprisingly broad range of applications within  core mathematical disciplines,  most particularly  to  various areas of geometry and number theory. Within many of these contexts the ""time""  is not necessarily the usual  one-dimensional time  but it can be multi-dimensional or, of even more general nature that is  described by the key mathematical concept of group.  There is a crucial difference between the classical case of one-dimensional time and that of multi-dimensional time:  while in the former case  various  complexity and chaotic phenomena may appear gradually and  chaotic   behavior can and usually does coexists with ordered one within the same systems (e.g. ordered  planetary motions vs. chaotic behavior of  some asteroids and smaller objects in the solar system), in the latter  as was established by the PI and his collaborators) complexity is often global  and in fact chaos appears in a highly structured way and with high albeit  calculable levels of complexity as measured by a proper version of the fundamental notion of entropy."

Two important settings for nonlinear problems are global warming and communication systems. The ``2nd International Workshop on Nonlinear and Modern Mathematical Physics"" aims to make progress in the understanding and solution of nonlinear problems by promoting new synergies among researchers in different fields. The workshop will feature multidisciplinary lectures on emerging topics and arising challenges of broad scope, from classical mathematical physics to contemporary mathematical physics. Emphasis will be placed in involving junior faculty and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, women and minorities. The workshop will provide significant opportunities for education and public outreach to a broad audience from various branches of mathematics, physics and engineering sciences."

A common unifying theme is the appearance of harmonic measures in various problems to be investigated, as well as the use of fast decreasing (Dirac-delta-like) polynomials to merge local approximants so as to create global ones. The applications include universality results in random matrix theory, various polynomial inequalities, and a domain reconstruction procedure based on Christoffel functions.  Other parts of the project are related to nonclassical orthogonal polynomials/Christoffel functions, to polynomial approximation in several variables, and to developing new tools (based on fast decreasing polynomials) for their study.  The intellectual merit lies in achieving a better understanding of the role of harmonic measures in approximation theory and orthogonal polynomials, as well as in the manifestation of the usefulness of fast decreasing polynomials in various areas of mathematics somewhat remote from the main topic of the project. For example, upon successful completion of the project the Principal Investigator will have a characterization (in terms of smoothness) of the rate of polynomial approximation on general convex domains, which will close a classical line of research going back more than half a century. The techniques to be applied will include systematic usage of harmonic analysis in approximation theory, thereby offering new tools in the latter field. <br/> <br/>The proposed research will have broader impact beyond approximation theory and orthogonal polynomials, for the results are relevant to other branches of mathematics, physics, and engineering. For example, various forms of the so-called universality conjecture have originated from studies in theoretical and statistical physics, studies that showed a certain universal local behavior that was independent of the original quantities describing the given system. In some form the mathematical formulation translates into a fine local behavior of orthogonal polynomials, and the proposal offers a tool to study this fine behavior and to prove rigorously universality under general conditions. Another area where the proposed research on orthogonal polynomials has broader impact is domain/shape reconstruction from scanned data (MRI-type scans).  A recent method is based on area-generated orthogonal polynomials, but that method assumed that the domain to be reconstructed was without holes/cavities (information that may not be true or may not be known in advance). The present proposal lays the theoretical foundation for a modification of the method applying to domains that may have holes. By a relatively simple iteration, the algorithm will not only reconstruct the outer boundary of the domain (the original goal), but it will actually allow the reconstruction of the inner holes as well. Broader impacts of the research also include stimulating interest in undergraduates and mathematics majors and enhancing the research environment for them. Graduate and Ph.D. students will have the opportunity to learn the basic results and techniques of several different disciplines, as well as their interrelations. Special emphasis will be made in outreach to the general public. This will be achieved by publishing educational articles connected with the research, thereby offering understanding and appreciation for science. Relevant lectures will be held at different levels from undergraduate societies to professionals meetings."

The participants will be prominent scientists, young researchers and students from the US, Canada, the European Union, Eastern Europe and Asia. Recently, techniques from complex analysis (e.g., the concepts of Schwarz function, quadrature domains, complex harmonic maps) have given new lines of attack on some long standing problems in physics, e.g., Hele-Shaw flows, gravitational lensing, Laplacian growth, etc. The presentations at the conference range from plenary lectures describing recent breakthrough results in Complex Analysis, Dynamical Systems and Mathematical Physics, in a form accessible to advanced graduate students and young researchers, to more specialized talks on more focused research topics. Each of the past conferences attracted a significant number of US Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers. The proposal's main goals are to build on the development of collaborations between mathematicians and mathematical physicists from all over the world, young and experienced.  The project strives to increase the existing momentum and bring in another group of young US researchers and graduate students into collaboration with colleagues worldwide,  initiate US young researchers and graduate students into an active research scene worldwide and introduce them to most of the active researchers in complex analysis from all over the world.   <br/> <br/>Supporting the travel of young researchers and graduate students to such a conference where scientists from North and South America, Europe and Asia, old and young, prominent and just beginning, are spending all their waking hours together in an inspiring and congenial environment will inspire many beginning researchers.

Finally, we study the general smooth action rigidity for Cartan action and parabolic action; here we apply the famous Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) method to homogenous function space. <br/> <br/> <br/>Dynamical systems appeared first because of Newton's discovery that the motions of mechanical objects can be described by the solutions of ordinary differential equations.

So the subject of dynamical systems hasfound numerous applications not only in other branches of mathematics, such asnumber theory, geometry and representation theory, but also in physics, biology, economics and other sciences.The proposed research focuses on smooth rigidity results of algebraic actions, that is, the stabilityproperties related to change of parameters.

There will also be emphasis on logarithm laws for unipotent flows and applications of homogeneous dynamics to metric theory of Diophantine approximation. It is also proposed to continue the work on discrete groups of affine transformations in two directions: (a) Auslander conjecture and classification problems related to it; (2) the boundary of the set of proper affine transformations of Fuchsian groups.<br/><br/>The theory of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups is one if the central areas in mathematics. During the last few decades, it was realized that some aspects of the theory can be applied to solve longstanding problems in number theory, quantum chaos and related topics, which could not be tackled by other methods. The proposal is related to rigidity theory that studies phenomena when rather weak data about geometric and mathematical objects determines completely or almost completely the structure of those objects. The proposal should establish new connections between theory of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups, number theory, geometry, dynamical systems and ergodic theory, probability theory, theoretical computer science, mathematical physics, and in general between discrete and continuous in mathematics."

Special focus will be on extensions in Sobolev spaces, which are ubiquitous and indispensable spaces in modern analysis and the understanding of which holds the promise of deepening our knowledge of their structures.

Data fitting is essential in many areas of science and technology, as the proper arrangement of large amounts of data has led to new discoveries in many disciplines.  Nowadays, data fitting is being carried out almost exclusively in the regime of smooth functions. A well-established theory in interpolation by more general functions, as carried out in this project, will undoubtedly advance the state of art in data analysis and will lead to new and subtle, fundamental discoveries that cannot be detected by current data fitting models. Many of the problems proposed in the project have a strong interdisciplinary flavor, and they will help bring together researchers with common interests but different backgrounds."

Noncommutative geometry is the study of geometry when the associated algebra is noncommutative. Far from being just a generalization of conventional geometry for its own sake, noncommutative geometry is in fact forced on us by the basic principles of quantum mechanics, which require physically observable quantities to correspond to noncommuting operators on a Hilbert space.

We plan to develop new techniques to settle the fundamental question of whether flat or Lipschitz free boundaries are smooth. We also propose to investigate similar issues in the context of free boundary problems in the Heisenberg group, which cannot be treated within the classical framework.  Appropriate strategies will be developed to take into account the subtle geometric features of the problem. Another problem under investigation is the regularity of the moving free boundary originating in a non-homogeneous evolution problem of Stefan-type. Finally, we propose to complete the analysis of thin one phase free boundaries by investigating the question of their higher regularity (analyticity).<br/><br/>The free boundary problems under investigation arise in different areas of mathematics and science in general: shape optimization, combustion theory, probability and statistics among others. Typical examples of two-phase free boundary problems with distributed sources are the Prandtl-Bachelor model in fluid dynamics or the eigenvalue problem in magneto hydrodynamics. Stefan-type evolution problems describe the melting (or solidification) of a material with a solid-liquid interphase. Finally, thin free boundaries are relevant in classical physical models in mediums where long range (non-local) interactions are present, as in the propagation of surfaces of discontinuities, like planar crack expansion.

One might use transform methods, especially the Fourier transform to determine the role of frequency in the problem.

Interestingly, the algorithm forges connections with other mathematical ideas outside of real groups (for example, twisted Lusztig-Vogan polynomials and the study of mixed Hodge modules on flag varieties). The new theoretical developments that led to the algorithm suggest many exciting new directions, both in conceptualizing the answer that the algorithm provides, as well as pushing the ideas in new settings (for example by studying functorial relationships with representations of reductive groups over p-adic fields).  The projects undertaken under the support of this grant are devoted to investigating those directions.  In particular, the PI plans to investigate the behavior of the algorithm on representations predicted to be automorphic.  He also plans to adapt aspects of the algorithm to the setting of graded affine Hecke, and therefore obtain information about unitary representations of p-adic groups.<br/><br/>Lie groups (named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie) are at the center of much of the mathematics developed in the twentieth century.  They are the language in which physicists encode symmetry, and thus have been studied intensely for their applications to physical problems exhibiting symmetry.  Particular examples have led to significant advances in signal processing.  In a completely different direction, Robert Langlands used Lie groups as the language to attack problems in number theory, aspects of which have led to applications in modern cryptography.  The projects undertaken under the support of this grant place limitations on how Lie groups can appear as symmetries of physical problems, on one hand, and limitations on how they can appear as symmetries of number theory problems, on the other.  These limitation, therefore, rule out candidate solutions in both contexts, and thus provide powerful insight into the actual solutions and the important applications mentioned above."

This project seeks to connect these related and different phenomena to prove results about the straight line flow on these surfaces.   <br/><br/>Ergodic theory is interested in describing the long term behavior of orbits of dynamical systems. The questions this project is interested come from statistical mechanics, number theory and ergodic theory. Here are some sample questions: if there are two point masses on a flat surface and one is sent out in a random direction, how quickly does it get close to the other? If one fires the point masses in different directions will the trajectories be related? When is it possible for them to be related? This project hopes to attack these problems through tools coming from geometry, homogeneous dynamics and ergodic theory. The hope is to better understand what typical behavior is and what untypical behavior can occur."

Ebenfelt will consider questions regarding existence, uniqueness, and regularity of CR maps, as well as related questions that arise in connection with this study. Ebenfelt will consider CR maps of a Levi nondegenerate hypersurface into  a nondegenerate hyperquadric of higher dimension. This study will enhance our understanding of the CR submanifold structure of the hyperquadrics, which themselves constitute the flat models in the theory of Levi nondegenerate hypersurfaces. The work should also provide insight into how the local CR geometry of such hypersurfaces (in principle completely encoded in the CR curvature tensor) affects properties, such as e.g. various notions of nondegeneracy and rigidity, of their CR maps. There are highly interesting and nontrivial problems even in the special case where both the source and target manifolds are hyperquadrics (e.g. the Gap Conjecture).  Ebenfelt will continue his study of CR maps between generic submanifolds of infinite (commutator) type by investigating the prolongation of the system defining CR maps to a singular Pfaffian system on the jet bundle. The PI will, in particular, focus on a conjecture in this context regarding finite jet determination of local automorphisms. The study is expected to shed new light on the nature of CR maps between infinite type manifolds, and lead to a better understanding of the Pfaffian systems arising in this context. Ebenfelt will continue his work on normal forms for infinite type hypersurfaces in complex 2-space.; results in this direction will yield results on the finite jet determination problem and, possibly, on the problem of convergence of formal mappings in this context.  Ebenfelt  will also study CR maps between more general CR manifolds: one topic of interest is that of transversality, and he will try to improve recent transversality results (joint with with Duong and Baouendi--Rothschild) for CR maps into a higher dimensional space. Current conditions for transversality in this context involve eigenvalues of the Levi form.  Ebenfelt believes that ""deeper"" invariants of the CR structures are actually involved, as in the equidimensional case. This study will likely require development of substantially new methods, which in turn will benefit the theory of CR maps into higher dimensional spaces. <br/><br/>The study of real submanifolds in complex manifolds is central to complex analysis and to other areas of mathematics and physics. In this mathematics research project, tools from a wide range of areas such as real and complex analysis, partial differential equations, and algebraic geometry are used and further developed. The investigations carried out in this project will benefit research in adjacent areas of mathematics as well as in areas of theoretical physics. The methods and techniques developed will be useful in other areas of mathematics, and likely also in physics (e.g., string theory) and engineering (e.g., control theory; systems engineering).  Ebenfelt expects that the project will provide interesting research topics for graduate students and postdocs. The seminar activity that results from the project should be stimulating for both students and other researchers."

It will serve as a satellite conference to the first Mathematical Congress of the Americas, which will take place August 5-9 in the city of Guanajuato, Mexico. The conference aims to bring together researchers from different fields who have been studying surfaces of infinite type in order to interact and share the latest advances in their respective fields with the hope of funding an emerging theory tying results in separate fields together. There will be two mini-courses aimed at non-experts and students about recent developments in  at surfaces of infinite type: one from the dynamical perspective and the other from the complex analytic perspective.<br/><br/>Flat surfaces of finite type is a very rich and deep topic and it is a point of intersection for many fields of mathematics such as analysis, geometry, and dynamical systems. By ""finite type"" we mean that such a surface can be described by finitely many parameters. For example, the surfaces of a donut and a pretzel are of finite type; their ""finiteness"" coming from the fact that the first has one hole, while the latter has (usually) three. The rich theory for flat surfaces of finite type is by now well-understood, so there have been recent developments in trying to understand different aspects of flat surfaces of infinite type. This conference and workshop will serve as a cross-disciplinary platform to exchange ideas and engender collaborations among people investigating different properties of flat surfaces of infinite type as well as to introduce young researchers and students to the latest developments of different fields.

These spaces also have a dynamical nature -- they support natural flows or group actions with complicated orbits, or they classify such actions.  This projects aims to investigate moduli spaces from a dynamical perspective.  In the setting of Riemann surfaces we study Teichmueller curves, Jacobians with real multiplication, volumes of complex hyperbolic cone manifolds and representations of the braid group developed by Picard, Deligne-Mostow and Thurston.  We also investigate dynamical systems of low entropy, ranging from pseudo-Anosov maps to automorphism of K3 surfaces, via constructions adapted to small Salem numbers and Coxeter groups.  In the setting of lattices we aim to investigate packing constants of ideals in number fields, and to demonstrate an abundance of bounded orbits for rank one flows, to complement the dearth of such orbits predicted in higher rank by conjectures of Littlewood and Margulis. Finally, in the setting of iterated rational maps in one complex variable, we study the natural bifurcation measure on moduli spaces attached to individual critical points, and aim to show their independence and transversality, with an eye towards arithmetic applications. We also intend to link the theory of Berkovitch spaces to the degeneration of hyperbolic manifolds to trees.<br/><br/>From particle physics to finance, from evolution to climate change, the world is full of dynamical systems.  Simple algebraic transformations already exhibit many of the features of these natural phenomena, such as phase transitions and tipping points that signal the onset of new regimes. These universal patterns may be revealed through the rigorous study of moduli spaces, their compactifications and their stratifications by dynamical invariants.  This project appeals to a broad range of mathematical disciplines to both deepen our understanding of dynamical systems and to sharpen our mathematical and computational methods."

Even the simplest families of examples exhibit complicated dynamical behavior;  the most famous is the family of complex quadratic polynomials, where the Mandelbrot set continues to baffle researchers.  The primary goal of this project is to explore the dynamical moduli spaces of polynomials and rational functions.  The projects proposed (both the questions and the proposed solution strategies) combine ingredients from complex analysis and arithmetic or algebraic geometry.  In one direction, the PI aims to study the distribution of postcritically-finite rational maps within the moduli space.  In joint work with Matthew Baker, the PI has formulated a dynamical analogue to the Andre-Oort conjecture in arithmetic geometry. Questions of this type are not only analogies:  for example, the PI  aims to use dynamical techniques to recover a result by Masser and Zannier about torsion points in families of elliptic curves.  The main tools are recent developments in analysis and dynamics on a Berkovich analyticspace.  In a slightly different direction, the PI is studying bifurcation sets and bifurcation measures in distinguished subvarieties within the moduli space.  Here the techniques are predominantly analytic.  New questions have stemmed from experimental work, using the new computer program Dynamics Explorer developed by Boyd & Boyd.  The PI is also interested in classical problems about the existence and classification of symmetries of rational functions.  <br/><br/><br/>In the last five or ten years, ""algebraic dynamics"" has become an extremely active area of research; the questions have become more refined as senior researchers enter the subject with very different backgrounds and we uncover connections to many areas of mathematics.  Roughly speaking, algebraic dynamics is the study of dynamical systems that preserve an underlying algebraicstructure.  Such systems arise naturally in applications (for example, the one-dimensional logistic family is algebraic), and they play a role in the analysis of arithmetic objects studied by number theorists (for example, in defining height functions associated to arithmetic varieties).  The PI is actively involved in the exchange of mathematical ideas between number theorists and dynamicists.   On one hand, her questions are about the fundamental stability of dynamical systems:  under what conditions is a system insensitive to small perturbations?  On the other hand, the special class of dynamical systems she studies exhibits a rich algebraic structure, bringing dynamical features into a long history of arithmetic geometry.  Finally, the project has an experimental component that works very well with students and junior researchers; the PI is actively involved in research projects and training programs for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers."

A second problem concerns exponential decaying perturbations for elements of the exponential torus of finite gap Jacobi matrices where the need to employ techniques from the theory of Riemann surfaces presents some difficulties in extending the one band results obtained earlier by Damanik and Simon.  A third problem concerns a conjectured dichotomy about the zeros of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle where numeric evidence suggests that either every point on the circle is a limit of zeros or else all the zeros stay away from the unit circle.  Finally, Professor Simon is planning to explore extensions of the results obtained in the past for orthogonal polynomials on the real line and unit circle to the context of more general measures in the complex plane.<br/><br/>The proposed research concerns the spectral and inverse spectral theory of orthogonal polynomials.  Inverse spectral theory is connected with determining the properties of an object from its measured spectral properties.  Practical examples include using x-rays to determine the structure of crystalline matter and medical imaging technology such as CAT scans.  The underlying mathematical theory is the seed corn for further developments in these important applied areas.  The spectral theory of orthogonal polynomials is significant because it is a theory where there is a general explicit set of formulae for solving the inverse problem.  During his career, Professor Simon has made important contributions to developing our scientific infrastructure with over 30 graduate student PhD supervisions and mentoring of almost 50 postdocs and other scientists.  Many of these have gone on to distinguished careers of their own.  He expects this to continue during the new grant period."

Random matrix theory is a recently developed research area that has garnered much attention in the last two decades.  It beautifully combines many fields of mathematics and has important outside applications, for example to multivariate statistics and cellular communication networks.  Using contemporary techniques from stochastic analysis,    the principal investigator Todd  Kemp will explore the behavior of large random matrices,  realized as concrete infinite-dimensional objects. The research uses the tools of free probability: a robust, growing field which incorporates ideas from probability theory, complex analysis, operator algebras, and combinatorics.  The problems to be addressed will give new insight into the fluctuations and deformations of random matrix models in free probability and are designed to yield more complete solutions to important open problems relating to entropy and information in such systems.<br/><br/><br/>This mathematics research project is in the general area of free probability theory and Brownian motions.

Stochastic analysis is the systematic theory of the behavior of  Brownian  motion.  Besides its research value, another, equally central impact of this mathematics research project is through its educational goals, focusing on the creation of a new summer research program, CURE: Collaborative Undergraduate Research Experience.   It is designed to give research experience to groups of primarily local undergraduate students.  The CURE program seeks to introduce novice mathematicians to the community of practice, through situated learning and cooperative engagement in front-line research, based on the more accessible and computational aspects of the research component of  this proposal.  It will also provide mentoring experience to graduate students who will assist in coordinating the research effort; thus the CURE program is vertically integrated across the full spectrum of academic research.  Mathematics has become an increasingly collaborative field; the CURE program will instill the value of research collaboration in its dozens of participants.  By promoting diversity and developing the talent of young mathematicians, this project will increase the profile of free probability, random matrices, and stochastic analysis for the next generation of researchers"

These show that many properties of groups or actions can be recognized by looking at their von Neumann algebras. Ioana will develop new methods to study rigidity for von Neumann algebras. Three specific directions of research will be pursued. Firstly, Ioana will expand the scope of super-rigidity for von Neumann algebras by providing new examples of groups and actions that can be entirely reconstructed from their von Neumann algebras. A second direction concerns  Cartan subalgebras of von Neumann algebras.  Finally, Ioana will investigate the notion of orbit equivalence for group actions.

The focus of this project is to expand our understanding of such groups in two different directions: going from finite covolume to infinite covolume (and beyond); going from characteristic zero to positive characteristic. The PI plans to see in what extent the analytical behavior of the congruence quotients of a finitely generated group is dictated by its Zariski-topology. The PI's second goal is to study homogeneous dynamics over a local field of positive characteristic. The analytical properties of the congruence quotients of linear groups have been showed to be extremely useful in various parts of mathematics and computer science. In the past decade they have been used in affine sieve, variation of Galois representations, hyperbolic geometry and group theory. It is clear that extending these results would have immediate impacts in other branches of mathematics. As the second component of this project, the PI plans to work toward the proof of Raghunathan's conjectures for semisimple groups over a local field of positive characteristic. Many mathematicians worked on these conjectures, e.g. Dani, Margulis, Shah, Tomanov, and finally in a series of papers, Ratner completely proved these conjectures over a local field of characteristic zero. As Ratner's results have been extremely fruitful in various parts of mathematics, it is expected that any partial result toward their positive characteristic analogue would have immediate applications.<br/><br/>One of the main tools to study an object or a structure is to understand its symmetries. That is the intrinsic reason why group theory is in a close connection with other branches of mathematics and physics. For instance the PI's work on linear groups can give us the precise algebraic conditions to construct explicit families of sparse highly connected graphs known as expanders. Expanders are extremely useful in communication, theoretical computer science (e.g. error correcting codes) and various branches of mathematics. The PI studies also the dynamical systems of algebraic nature and their deep and fruitful connections with other branches of mathematics, e.g. number theory."

This research program will achieve significant improvements in the stability theory for geometric inequalities, broadening the reach of the theory to include new and challenging situations, and opening new spaces for further applications to problems of applied interest. Specific stability issues considered in this project arise in the study of minimizing clusters, Plateau's problem, and isoperimetric problems in arbitrary codimension and in Gauss space. The project will also advance the mathematical theory of capillarity problems, by addressing regularity issues related to the validity of Young's law, and by providing a quantitative description of geometric properties of equilibrium configurations. Finally, the project aims to some conclusive developments in symmetrization theory, by characterizing, from a geometric viewpoint, those situations where equality cases in symmetrization inequalities imply symmetry of minimizers. <br/><br/>This project aims to advance the mathematical understanding of geometric variational problems. Geometric variational problems play a fundamental role in the mathematical modeling of Nature, and in particular, in our quantitative and qualitative understanding of equilibrium states of physical systems.

In turn, geometric variational problems play also a pivotal role in various area of Mathematics, including Analysis, Probability Theory, and Geometry. Several important contributions to the stability theory for geometric variational problems has been obtained in recent years by the PI and his collaborators, with applications to the effective description of equilibrium states of physical systems, and with the introduction of new mathematical ideas and techniques.

These include the optimal transport problem, the issue of stability in functional inequalities, and the Mumford-Shah functional. The optimal transport problem consists of finding the least expensive way to transport a distribution of mass from one place to another. In addition to being a natural problem in the calculus of variations, it is also related to partial differential equations, Riemannian geometry, and probability. The issue of stability in functional inequalities consists of understanding whether a minimizer of some inequality is stable in some suitable sense. This is an important issue in order to understand and/or predict the evolution in time of a physical phenomenon. For instance, quantitative stability results are used to quantify the rate of convergence of a given physical system to its steady state, and they can also be used to understand the extent to which the system changes under the influence of external factors (for instance, external forces). The Mumford-Shah functional is a classical model in image segmentation which is used to extract from a blurry image the meaningful discontinuities (which correspond to edges of objects, shadows, and overlapping objects). The regularity properties of minimizers of the Mumford-Shah functional are still far from being understood, and understanding the smoothness of the interfaces and their topological properties is an important and challenging problem.<br/><br/>All the problems investigated in this mathematics research project by Alessio Figalli have important applications in other areas of sciences. For instance, the optimal transport problem is a fundamental problem in economics, with further applications to meteorology, biology, and population dynamics; the Mumford-Shah functional, which is studied in this project, has applications to image processing (it allows to extract good images out of blurry ones).  Some of the problems in this project will be used in the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Several of Figalli's PhD students and postdoctoral fellows will engage in research in these areas, and the results obtained will be widely disseminated via the publication of research papers and lecture notes, as well as through the development of courses and seminars."

The propagation of waves on smoothly varying spaces is well understood in many respects, but the interaction with singularities--which might range from boundaries, to corners or cone points, to large-scale structures ""at infinity""--presents many open problems. The principal investigator will study the asymptotic behavior of waves propagating on certain curved spacetimes such as arise in the theory of general relativity.  The goal is to understand the long-time behavior of the radiation pattern observed far away from a source. Recent work of the principal investigator has yielded results in spacetimes with a compactification similar to that of Minkowski space, and he will continue to pursue such results in a wider range of geometries. The project will also study the decay of waves near their source in different geometric settings.  In particular, in the presence of corners or cone points, diffraction of waves is a potential obstruction to the rapid decay of waves; the principal investigator will continue his ongoing investigations in this area, especially into the question of resonances generated by cone points. Additionally, he will continue to study the behavior of eigenfunctions and quasimodes of the Laplace operator associated to completely integrable systems, in an effort to understand to what degree an eigenfunction can concentrate on a sub-torus of an Arnold-Liouville torus. These techniques should also yield new estimates for solutions to the linear Schrodinger equation in completely integrable settings.<br/><br/>Geometry influences the behavior of solutions to wave equations in many interesting and subtle ways.  Following Newton, we know that light behaves in many regimes as if made of tiny particles; on the other hand, we also know that light can turn corners (""diffract"") and that it tends to disperse. The effect of changes in geometry to changes in propagation of waves (be they light or sound or water or gravity waves, or the wave-functions describing quantum particles) is the central focus of this project. In particular, the principal investigator's work on decay of waves in curved spacetimes is closely related to problems of intense interest in the physics community, for instance as it gives a much simplified model of gravitational waves.  His closely related work on the linear Schrodinger equation is related to applications not just to the physics of nonrelativistic quantum particles, but also to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, which models such disparate phenomena as laser pulses and superconductivity."

Particularly strong connections with combinatorics and number theory have been developed, leading to an explosion of activity. In addition to focusing on recent developments and new open problems, the meeting will bring together mathematicians that use ergodic theory to solve problems in combinatorics and number theory.<br/><br/>This grant will support participation in the conference for mathematicians based in the United States. It is expected that most world experts in ergodic theory with a combinatorial or number theoretic flavor will be present at this conference, as well as numerous more junior Israeli and European participants. As such, it represents a unique opportunity to make new connections and progress in ergodic theory. It will be of substantial benefit to the US participants in terms of stimulating international collaboration and enhancing the advancement of US mathematics.

This conference is sixth in a series of international conferences held since 2001, two of which were held in the US and funded primarily by the NSF. The conference will focus on the global qualitative study (topological and ergodic) of differentiable dynamical systems, especially diffeomorphisms and vector fields, that are not uniformly hyperbolic. Among the main topics to be covered are:<br/>-Beyond Hyperbolicity: Partial hyperbolicity, Nonuniform hyperbolicity, Singular hyperbolicity, Lyapunov exponents, Dimension, Statistical properties.<br/>-Global and Semilocal Properties: The C1-topology, Bifurcations.<br/>-Other Topics: Interval Dynamics, Foliations.<br/><br/><br/>This study of smooth dynamical systems has its origins in early efforts to establish the stability of the solar system.  Early pioneers such as Henri Poincare and George Birkhoff discovered mechnanisms for stability and instability, thus initiating the study of hyperbolic dynamical systems. Around the same time, the geometer Eberhard Hopf used hyperbolic methods to study the long-term behavior of geodesics (straight lines) in negatively curved spaces (such as those modelled on Minkowski space). A century later, the study of hyperbolic dynamical systems has blossomed into a mature field, one of the cornerstones of dynamics.   This conference, one in a series held every few years, brings together a truly international group of experts, representing 5 continents, to explore the latest developments beyond hyperbolicity.  Exposure to this cutting edge work through these workshops has spurred research advances in a previous generation of US graduate students, many of whom will speak at this workshop.  Previous incarnations of this workshop have also led to international collaborative teams, and we anticipate future benefits of a similar nature."

A unifying theme is that the proposed problems focus on plurisubharmonic functions and positive closed currents as objects of investigation or some of the tools to be employed. One direction of research deals with quantization problems on complex manifolds. Given a singular Hermitian holomorphic line bundle on the manifold, there are natural Hilbert spaces of square-integrable holomorphic sections defined using the metric data. Coman, will study the convergence of the sequence of Fubini-Study currents of these Hilbert spaces and the asymptotic distribution of simultaneous zeros of random holomorphic sections of the high tensor powers of the line bundle. Coman will also consider these problems in the more general case of line bundles over complex spaces. This has applications in statistical physics (quantum chaos), as well as in number theory (quantum unique ergodicity for modular forms). A second direction of research will study problems in pluripotential theory on compact complex manifolds, where there are new interesting phenomena, different from the local setting. The main goals are the study of the complex Monge-Ampere operator, the corresponding Green functions and their singularities, and the problem of extension and regularization of (quasi) plurisubharmonic functions on analytic subvarieties of the ambient manifold. A third direction of research deals with problems from pluripotential theory in the complex Euclidean space. The questions to be considered involve geometric properties of positive closed currents and their approximation by analytic varieties, and the behavior of polynomials along transcendental analytic varieties. It is expected that the latter will continue to have applications to transcendental number theory, such as to the study of the algebraic independence of values of entire functions.<br/><br/>This mathematics research project is in the areas of complex analysis and potential theory; these subjects are central areas of mathematics, providing powerful tools for solving important problems from other fields of pure and applied mathematics (e.g., image and signal processing) and physics (e.g., quantum mechanics; statistical physics). Making progress on the research problems in this project will contribute to the advancement of knowledge and understanding in these fields. The project investigates the development and applications of new techniques from complex analysis and potential theory to problems in important areas such as mathematical physics, complex and algebraic geometry, number theory. Thanks to the powerful methods of complex analysis, it has been often the case that progress is made by formulating concrete problems at first in the context of complex numbers. The project will impact the development of human resources through summer funding of two graduate students who will work for their dissertation under the investigator's supervision on topics related to this project. In this way the project effectively integrates research and education."

The ambition is to gain insights into the many new phenomena encountered in the Calculus of Variations, Minimal Surfaces, Nonlinear Elasticity, Material Science, and so forth. Historical example would be the celebrated mathematical structure -Teichmller spaces, where one seeks to minimize the supremum norm of the distortion function. Other examples could be cited.

The program provides such an environment through educational materials (book in progress), Summer/Winter mini-courses, junior-senior seminars.

The proposed problems of geometric nature originated from the Riemann Mapping Theorem; conformal mappings being univalent solutions of the Cauchy-Riemann system. Moving to the second order variational equations and their homeomorphic solutions offers new challenges. The goal is to characterize  energy-functionals whose minimizers exist and resemble conformal maps. In our extremal problems mappings are free on the boundary. In such traction free problems we are concerned with existence and global invertibility of energy-minimal solutions. One needs to combine and develop the ideas of analysis and topology. There is a growing literature on inner variational equations that are weaker than the classical Euler-Lagrange equation. Even in the basic case of the Dirichlet integral there are many new surprising phenomena.<br/><br/>GFT is currently a field of enormous activity where the general framework of NE is extremely fruitful and significant. The proposed variational approach contributes to this interplay and leads to concerted efforts of pure and applied mathematicians to work together. The research topics, and results already in place, have the potential impact on the development of elastic deformations, material science, continuum mechanics, etc.  A thin elastic film tends to assume the shape of a minimal surface. The issue is to identify the optimal shape of a tubular thin film under stretch. This relates to the proposed studies of harmonic maps. There appear to be other applications in modeling cellular structures, foam physics and tissues as well. The PI will continue to host diverse groups of visiting scholars for mutual research."

The project revolves around the following main problems: (1) find new examples of actions of more ""exotic"" groups on probability spaces that can be completely reconstructed from their von Neumann algebras; (2) find additional examples of group actions that lead to von Neumann algebras with unique Cartan subalgebras; (3) obtain new applications to ergodic theory (particularly orbit equivalence and structural properties for equivalence relations) and probability theory (percolation on graphs); and (4) deepen the connections with geometric group theory and representation theory. The principal investigator plans to achieve these goals by further refining his previous techniques and continuing to expand the cohomological and geometric group theory perspective that he and his coauthors have brought to the study of rigidity in von Neumann algebras. He expects these techniques to reveal new aspects of the theory that will enable an even more fruitful interplay between these fields.<br/><br/>The study of von Neumann algebras was initiated in the 1930s by Murray and von Neumann as a tool to study quantum mechanics, and it has progressively morphed into a stand-alone discipline. It also created a basis for the development of  powerful mathematical theories that ultimately brought valuable insight to areas of physics (statistical mechanics), biology (DNA structure), and engineering (cell-phone design). This project, which continues the study of rigidity phenomena in von Neumann algebras, is expected to generate novel applications and to establish new bridges to other active research areas in mathematics (probability, ergodic theory, and geometric aspects in group theory). On a broader scale, the principal investigator anticipates that applications of rigidity phenomena outside the mathematical spectrum will continue to unveil themselves, particularly in engineering and computer science (e.g., error-correcting codes). The project will offer numerous development opportunities for graduate students or young researchers just entering this very active research field. While the topic of the project is focused heavily on advanced trends, it also contains substantial research directions and open problems that can be excellent subjects for Ph.D. theses. The principal investigator is currently teaching a two-semester introductory course on this subject with the purpose of attracting new young talent to the area. He will continue to disseminate his findings from the project through publications, lecture series, and seminar and colloquium talks, and to promote the connections with related areas of mathematics and beyond."

Concerning the first area, the plan is to extend recent work on flat extensions of positive moment matrices and extremal moment problems (joint with L. Fialkow, H.M. Mller and S. Yoo), which has led to a general framework for the study of TMP.  The principal investigator and his collaborators will develop new methods and techniques, and apply them to the case of cubic column relations associated with finite algebraic varieties, and to TMPs with recursively determinate moment matrices.  The second area deals with multiplication operators on functional Hilbert spaces over Reinhardt domains.  This part of the project will extend the study of the spectral picture of subnormal 2-variable weighted shifts to hyponormal ones, by applying previous results (joint with S.H. Lee and J. Yoon) and by employing the groupoid techniques developed in the principal investigator's work with P. Muhly and K. Yan.  The third area deals with a multivariable approach to subnormality of Hilbert space operators, with special emphasis on scalar and block Toeplitz operators.  The approach is to characterize 2-hyponormality, then k-hyponormality, and eventually subnormality.  The principal investigator will develop further the ideas in his previous work with I.B. Jung, S.H. Lee, W.Y. Lee, S.S. Park, and M. Putinar.  As a testing ground, he will search for a model theory for 2-hyponormal operators, a topic that leads to useful connections with J. Agler's abstract model theory.  Using function-theoretic and multivariable operator theory techniques, the principal investigator has recently proved a version of Abrahamse's theorem for block Toeplitz operators (jointly with I.S. Hwang and W.Y. Lee).  He will seek a more general version of this theorem, and the solution of a related subnormal Toeplitz completion problem.<br/><br/>Many problems in physics, mathematics, and engineering can be best described by representing complex physical entities as large arrays of numbers and mathematical symbols, called matrices.  Matrices help us visualize how linear transformations act on vector spaces; determining their structure reveals important properties of the transformations.  Hilbert space operators are infinite-dimensional generalizations of matrices.  The generalization of a vector is often a function, and as a result, operators are frequently modeled as multiplications on spaces of functions.  Part of this project involves finding such models for operators.  Once the models are obtained, many basic structural questions about the operators become natural.  Beginning in the 1950s, the study of subnormal operators has been highly successful, and its theory has made key contributions to areas such as functional analysis, quantum mechanics, and engineering.  Similarly, the classes of scalar and block Toeplitz operators arise in a variety of areas of mathematics and physics.  A separate part of the research deals with inverse problems that occur naturally in statistics, spectral analysis, geophysics, image recognition, global positioning tools, signal detection theory, and economics.  The principal investigator's work on truncated moment problems has been applied in optimization theory, real algebraic geometry, numerical analysis, semidefinite programming, and sensor network localization.  The project aims to resolve some outstanding problems in multivariable operator theory, at the same time creating recruitment and retention opportunities for women and minorities to pursue careers in mathematics and other STEM fields.  Several questions in this project are written to generate research problems accessible to undergraduate and graduate students."

The PI has previously used quasiconformal methods to solve a number of problems in the field and plans to refine these techniques to attack several remaining open problems. The second area  is to use quasiconformal maps and hyperbolic geometry in computational geometry, mostly in problems related to algorithms for meshing planar regions  with optimal complexity and geometry. Obtaining similar results in three dimensions  is one of the most important goals of the field, and the proposal describes some ideas for attacking this problem too. The final part of the proposal describes the dimension distortion properties of quasiconformal maps. This is one of the most interesting problems intrinsic to study of quasiconformal maps, but, as the proposal describes, can also be linked to famous open problems in computational geometry.<br/><br/>The proposed work will investigate how combinatorial and discrete ideas yield new results in analysis  and how ideas from conformal analysis and hyperbolic geometry can prove new theorems about discrete geometry and meshing.  Conformal maps preserve angles; these maps have been intensively studied for over 150 years and are of fundamental importance to a wide variety of problems in analysis, geometry, probability, physics and engineering.  Classically,  conformal maps  have been used in the study of  various differential equations related to fluid flow, heat conduction and wave propagation.  More recently,  conformal maps have been fundamental to the study of statistical mechanics, percolation  and random growth models.  Quasiconformal maps allow a controlled amount of angle distortion. These maps are a flexible and extremely useful generalization of conformal maps  that  help us better understand the special case of conformal mappings, but also introduces many important new problems and techniques.  The PI's previous work has used quasiconformal maps to give the best known algorithm for computing conformal maps onto polygons and the best known algorithms for meshing planar domains into  triangles or quadrilaterals with optimal geometric properties.  Such meshes play an important role in many numerical problems from computer graphs to finite element methods for PDEs and many of these methods work more effectively if the underlying mesh has good geometric properties.  The proposed work will extend and sharpen the results already obtained and will use similar ideas to attack other problems that arise in dynamics and geometry."

These phenomena include heat transfer, expansion of gases, flow of fluids, Newtonian or not, in either homogeneous or composite media, Brownian motions, movement of molecules in cells, etc. In all of them the diffusivity changes as function of the diffusing quantity itself (temperature, gas or fluid density, etc.) and/or its  spacial gradient. If the diffusion coefficient becomes zero at some point, the diffusion stops and the phenomenon is degenerate at that point. If it becomes unbounded, the diffusion is infinitely fast, and the phenomenon is singular at that point. The evolution Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) modeling these phenomena, seldom can be solved explicitly, and exhibit a mathematical behavior, which is not well understood. The project aims at exploring the local and global behavior of solutions of these classes of PDEs.  Issues of continuity, differentiability, sudden vanishing and generation of singularities are investigated by means of measure theoretical techniques, and Harnack-type inequalities. The central idea is that these diffusion processes, evolve with their own intrinsic parabolic geometry, that incorporates the evolving ""gauge"" of its diffusion. Homogenization in PDEs is an essential tool in understanding the local behavior of composite materials with periodic structures, such as alloys. Several diffusion phenomena in biology occur in periodically structured domains exhibiting multiple scales. An example is the diffusion of the second messengers Calcium and cyclic Guanosine Mono Phosphate (cGMP), in rods and cones in the retina of vertebrates. Both rods and cones exhibit a thickly layered structure, where the layers are folded membranes.  Homogenized limits will be computed for the diffusion of the second messengers in cones. The analytical difficulty is that the domain becomes disconnected as the thickness of the layers/folds goes to zero. The homogenized limit permits one to compute pointwise, the concentration of the second messengers Calcium and cGMP. These in turn control, locally, at the boundary of the folds, the current generated by photons of light entering a cone. <br/><br/>While this investigation is theoretical in nature, the Partial Differential Equationss considered, originate from physical models such as immiscible fluids (water-oil), non Newtonian flows (thick fluids), phase transition (water-ice-gas), heat transfer (burning of thermal shields), and some issue in mathematical biology (motion of molecules on the surface of living cells). As such they are interdisciplinary, involving mathematicians, physicists engineers, and biologists. These investigations will contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying physical and/or biological phenomena.  The project aims also at introducing new theoretical/mathematical tools because of the non standard nature of these degenerate/singular diffusion phenomena.  Particles move, by diffusion, on the surface of living cells to effect specific functions. For example a receptor, captures a signal from outside a cell and transmit it to its interior to begin a biochemical process. The space-time location and the speed of diffusion of a receptor affect the intensity of the signal and its transduction inside the cell. In the homogenization of cones, the second messengers Calcium and cGMP are the transducers of the outside signal (photons of light) to regulate the current generated by ionic channels on the surface of the folds.  Alteration of these diffusion processes, causes improper functioning of the visual signaling cascade, leading to pathologies (for example age-related macula degeneration). Cones are very fragile and hard to experiment with, calling for mathematical modeling of their behavior."

The project aims to advance the technique that is used to prove amenability of the full topological group of a Cantor minimal system to other classes. The Connes embedding problem (CEP) concerns a fundamental approximation property of tracial states on von Neumann algebras. The principal investigator plans to develop an algebraic approach to CEP that she started in several recent papers. This approach is based on certain algebraic properties of noncommutative polynomials over unitary variables. One of the rapidly developing areas in group theory is a study of approximations of discrete groups by finite groups, in particular, so-called sofic approximations. Several long-standing conjectures are known to be true for sofic groups. Among them are CEP for group von Neumann algebras, Gottschalk's conjecture, the determinant conjecture, and Kaplansky's direct finiteness conjecture. Moreover, there are currently no known examples of nonsofic groups. One of the aims of the project is to study properties of sofic approximations for several classes of groups in the hope of shedding greater light on this state of affairs.<br/><br/>Groups and operator algebras arise naturally in all areas of mathematics and also in certain parts of physics and chemistry. In particular, the methods of group theory lie at the roots of many parts of algebra. The notion of an ""amenable group"" was introduced by John von Neumann in 1929, and in recent years many famous conjectures have been shown to be true for the class of amenable groups. The core part of the proposed project is to develop recent results of the principal investigator in order to establish that certain classes of groups are amenable or to prove that they exhibit certain weaker forms of this property. In the process, the  project is expected to strengthen the connections between several areas of mathematics. Finally, the principal investigator will seek to attract young researchers to the field and organize conferences and seminars on the subject."

In particular, the PI plans to study (1) phase transitions in two-phase viscous fluid flows with variable surface tension and surface viscosity, (2) phase transitions in two-phase viscous fluid flows with kinetic undercooling, and (3) phase transitions driven by chemical potentials. Additional topics to be investigated are (4) evaporation in the presence of surface tension, and (5) stability and instability of solidifying processes in phase transitions. The dynamics of two-phase flows and the motion of their separating interfaces has been a problem of scientific and industrial interest for centuries. In the absence of phase transitions, which means that the interface is advected with the flow, this problem is fairly well understood. However, if phase transitions are present, the resulting models are fundamentally more complex, as they involve the equations of fluid dynamics in conjunction with those of phase transitions. The results anticipated will on the one hand clarify the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and on the other establish qualitative and asymptotic properties of these solutions. The PI proposes a mathematical approach that is general and flexible, and that will open up the treatment of many more problems.<br/><br/>Over the last decades the subject of free boundary problems has attracted increasing attention, both because of its theoretical interest and because of its numerous applications in the natural and engineering sciences. Typically, a free boundary problem consists of one or more partial differential equations that have to be solved in a domain that is a priori unknown and that has to be determined as part of the problem. Free boundary problems are in general harder to solve, both analytically and numerically, than the underlying differential equations would be in a prescribed domain. They have an inherent nonlinear structure, as two separate solutions cannot be superposed. It is not surprising, then, that the variety of applications and the inherent difficulties of solving free boundary problems have initiated a variety of theoretical methods, and in many cases have determined the direction of the development of these methods. Free boundary problems are important in many fields, such as material sciences, fluid mechanics, hydrodynamics, thermo-mechanics, magneto-dynamics, solid-state physics, plasma physics, geology, chemistry, and the biological and medical sciences. Many manufacturing processes in industry lead to free boundary problems, such as electrochemical machining, viscous sintering, the growth of crystals, injection molding processes, etching processes, solidification processes, casting processes, and chemical vapor deposition processes, to mention a few. The appropriate numerical and analytical treatment is a major challenge, both to the engineer and to the mathematician. The proposed work will have an impact for those real-world problems and applications where surface tension cannot be neglected."

The first group of questions is concerned with the return times phenomenon for measure-preserving systems. Here, one is interested in the convergence of weighted averages along flows in dynamical systems, specifically when the weights are generated by a flow in a second dynamical system.  Two problems of particular interest are to determine the amount of Lp regularity required for convergence, especially when the averages are replaced by singular integrals, and to determine, in terms of variation-norm estimates, how quickly this convergence occurs. These problems should be addressed by proving suitable extensions of the Carleson-Hunt theorem. The second group of questions concerns the bilinear Hilbert transform. One problem of interest here is to find new estimates which are uniform in the parameter which determines the singularity set for the transform. A second problem is to determine the rate of convergence for truncated transforms and the associated maximal operator. Although, at first glance, these two groups of questions may not seem to be related, their resolution is expected to be largely guided by a common set of tools. <br/><br/>The proposed research falls under the broad umbrella of harmonic analysis, a discipline which studies the decomposition of many types of data into combinations of basic waves of varying frequencies. These decompositions have been broadly applied in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and finance. An application which is especially relevant here is data compression, where one seeks to represent a signal, such as a movie or audio track, accurately while using a minimum amount of storage space. Convergence rate estimates, as in the previous paragraph, can in principle be used to characterize how much space is needed to give a ""good"" representation of a signal. The project also makes significant contact with areas of mathematics outside of harmonic analysis, including ergodic theory and additive combinatorics, and can be expected to stimulate many active discussions with faculty and students of the LSU math department, and with collaborators across the country."

As an example, one can mention the obvious fact that in many regions on the Earth the frequency of tornadoes has  strongly increased. Tornadoes are special solutions of equations of fluid dynamics that have strong singularities. A big part of the mathematical efforts detailed in this proposal is connected with the general properties of solutions of equations of fluid dynamics. Several years ago D. Li and I proposed a new approach which allows us to construct solutions which have singularities that in some respects resemble tornadoes. Recently a group of researchers from Italy performed numerical studies and demonstrated solutions that fully confirmed our theory. Another part of the proposal is connected with number theory. One of the main objects in number theory is the so-called Moebius function. P.Sarnak has proposed a wide program on Mobuius functions whose aim was the analysis of statistical properties of the Moebius functions. Some progress was achieved in our joint papers with F.Cellarosi and with M. Avdeeva and Dong Li. A new feature here is the appearance of probability distributions with complex probabilities which certainly is a new phenomenon. The purpose of the proposal is to study in more detail complex probabilities, new limit theorems and find other applications to number theory.<br/><br/>The topics in this proposal center around questions in the fields of ergodic theory and the theory of partial differential equations.  In broad terms, ergodic theory is the study of the asymptotic behavior of the paths of objects in motion.   This field was borne through the study of statistical mechanics, and indeed ergodic theory remains a valuable tool in this important subject of physics.  Another subject in which ergodic theory has found application is in number theory, and in particular in the study of the asymptotic distribution of certain kinds of numbers.  The application of ergodic theory to number theory has itself led to fascinating questions in ergodic theory.  This proposal contains a collection of such questions that we will continue to study.  Partial differential equations are the principal tool by which physical phenomena, such as the flow of air over the wing of an airplane,  the behavior of plasmas in the body of a star, the flow of electrons through a semi-conductor, are modeled.  It is a subject which is intensively studied for its own inherent interest as well as for its usefulness in applications.  We propose the continuation of deep studies in the properties of the equations of fluid dynamics as we described above."

The proposed research revolves in particular around three classes of problems. The first concerns the question of stability of flat interfaces for the irrotational free boundary Euler equations describing the motion of water waves. The second pertains to the study of the asymptotic behavior for nonlinear systems of mixed hyperbolic/dispersive type, such as the Maxwell-Schroedinger, Klein-Gordon-Zakharov, and Wave-Schroedinger systems. The third is related to singular limits over long intervals of time for point wise decaying solutions of some nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs. The PI's general aim is to prove, under certain conditions, global existence of solutions evolving from small Cauchy data. Furthermore, he aims to characterize the behavior of solutions at infinity and, in particular, answer the question of scattering, determining whether the global solutions constructed behave or not like linear ones for large times. A central theme of the proposed research will be the identification of the mechanisms determining at highest order the global regularity of solutions and the stability of certain equilibria. The PI expects some of the questions addressed to have highly non-trivial answers regarding the qualitative behavior of solutions for large times.<br/><br/>The equations under consideration describe a variety of physical phenomena such as fluid flows, quantum mechanics and plasma turbulence. Their relevance is widely recognized and supported by numerical and experimental evidence. Understanding the quantitative and qualitative properties of solutions, and their behavior over long periods of time, would be of importance for several research areas in the theoretical and applied sciences. For example, proving global-in-time stability of water waves models will improve our understanding of the motion of waves, such as those generated offshore on the surface of the deep ocean. It would also be relevant to numerical investigations and experiments aiming to understand how rogue waves are generated from apparently calm waters. Establishing mathematically rigorous stability results in some specific regimes would rule out some of their possible causes. Furthermore, proving that certain specific nonlinear asymptotic behaviors can occur in some of the equations considered, would reveal deeper connections with other fundamental models such as the nonlinear Schroedinger equation, which is ubiquitous in many branches of mathematics, physics, and engineering. The PI believes that solving the proposed problems would require substantial extensions of the current analytical methods, which may result in significant technical improvements of interest for the mathematics community at large.  Finally, beyond pursuing his own projects, the PI will also be actively engaged in the dissemination of his research and will strongly promote collaborations among different groups within the international PDE community and researchers in related areas."

First, stability issues for the 2-fluids Euler-Maxwell equation, which is one of the fundamental equations in plasma physics, are considered. The goal is to prove that, under certain conditions, small perturbations of an equilibrium will not develop shocks, and that, actually, the plasma will get back to equilibrium, even in the absence of dissipation. Such a result would be of great physical and mathematical importance as it is known to be false for the compressible Euler equation in the absence of a self-consistent electromagnetic field. In a second part, a study is made of the Schrodinger equation on a curved background. In this case, many classical tools from the Euclidean theory break down and one expects the appearance of many new phenomena due to the influence of the geometry of the background. In particular, a study will be made of the effect of the growth of the volume on the global existence and global behavior of the solutions to the energy-critical equation. Finally, in a third part, ideas developed before are used to upgrade some known results about the homogeneous fourth-order equation to the more physical inhomogeneous equation. <br/><br/>Understanding how a fluid can be stabilized by a self-consistent electromagnetic field in the absence of any friction represents a cross-disciplinary collaboration between pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and physics, with applications in fluid engineering. More specifically, proving that a plasma at rest is stable under small perturbations would be a major physical discovery and would most certainly greatly enhance our ways to control plasma. This is especially fitting since plasma stability is one of the main factor limiting performances in tokamaks. Finally, beyond industrial applications, plasma represents the state of more than 99% of the matter in the universe and any work providing better understanding of this state would be of great importance. Dispersive equations and equations on curved spaces (manifolds) provide a rich area of interaction between various branches of mathematics as well as between different sciences. The study of equations on curved spaces is of interest to geometers, analysts, and number theorists in mathematics, as well as to theoretical physicists working in quantum chaos and general relativity. Fourth-order equations naturally arise in many different branches of physics and mathematics, especially those linked with elasticity and are critical to understand phenomena as diverse as the movement (and possible oscillations and breakdown) of bridges or the structure of blood vessels and the interaction between their membranes and the biofluids."

Moreover, extremal black holes exhibit very strong trapping which is coupled with the above conservation laws and also the phenomenon of superradiance (i.e. the extraction of energy from the black hole). Satisfactory techniques have been developed to overcome the problem of trapping in the non-extremal case; however, in view of the aforementioned geometric couplings, these methods break down in the extremal case. The PI expects that this project will develop the necessary tools and techniques to provide a rigorous and definitive understanding of evolution equations on such spacetimes. In particular, the PI intends to continue the rigorous study of linear and nonlinear waves and investigate the distribution of quasinormal modes on such backgrounds.

A particularly important class of black holes consists of the so-called extremal black holes, that is black holes with zero temperature. The latter  are  central objects of study in the high-energy physics community.

The first broad area of the proposal centers on the study of singularities in  MCF, including estimates for the size of the singular sets, a compactness theorem for the possible types of singularities, a classification of generic singularities of the flow, and a canonical neighborhoods theorem that describes the flow in a neighborhood of the generic singularities.  These are the most important questions about singularities and the PI and his collaborator have already obtained significant results in this direction.  The second main area of the proposal concerns the structure of Einstein manifolds and, in particular, the question of when an Einstein manifold has a unique asymptotic structure (or tangent cone at infinity).  The main prior result in this direction is due to Cheeger and Tian in 1994, where they showed uniqueness under an integrability assumption that the PI would like to remove.  These sort of uniqueness questions have played an important role in a number of areas of geometric analysis and are extremely important in understanding the structure of the singular set for limits of Einstein manifolds.<br/><br/>This project focuses on several geometric variational problems.  The problems are mathematical, but many of them arose first in science and engineering.  Perhaps the most natural geometrically are minimal surfaces that locally minimize their surface area and, thus, model soap films in perfect equilibrium (so the film does not change other time). These have been studied at least since  Lagrange's 1762 memoir, but recent years have seen breakthroughs on many long-standing problems in the theory of minimal surfaces, with important contributions from many mathematicians.    There is a time-varying analog of this where a surface (which is not in equilibrium) evolves to minimize its surface area as quickly as possible; this is called mean curvature flow or MCF.  Mathematically, this leads to a nonlinear partial differential equation  which is formally similar to the equation that governs the flow of heat in physics.  Clearly, minimal surfaces remain static under the MCF.  MCF and other geometric flows were   developed for their intrinsic beauty as well as their potential applications to other fields to model, for instance, option pricing, motion of grains in annealing metals, and crystal growth.  While key foundational results have been obtained, several of the most basic questions remain unanswered.  In contrast, the Einstein equation is a nonlinear differential equation for the curvature of a space (or a space-time in general relativity).  Hilbert realized a century ago that this comes up variationally as the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Einstein-Hilbert functional."

Complex symmetric operators are a broad class of operators that has not been adequately studied in generality until recently.  The study of truncated Toeplitz operators, a rapidly growing branch of function-theoretic operator theory, has undergone spirited development stemming from a seminal 2007 paper of Sarason.  A recent series of articles by the principal investigator and his growing list of collaborators have unearthed surprising links between these two classes.  Research on this subject has the potential to be transformative, having relevance to a number of fields.  For instance, connections to function theory and matrix analysis have already engaged researchers from both large institutions and small colleges.  Moreover, the study of complex symmetric and truncated Toeplitz operators has already proven to be fertile ground for undergraduate research.<br/><br/>The study of linear operators on Hilbert space has its modern roots in the seminal work of von Neumann, who in the early twentieth century developed a rigorous framework in which to describe quantum mechanics.  Since then, operator theory has found applications in electrical engineering, quantum physics, image processing, and statistics, to name a few areas outside of pure mathematics.  This project will study two novel, but surprisingly ubiquitous, classes of operators, while also considering several specific questions that interface with other researchers in the mathematical sciences.  To do this, the principal investigator will collaborate with colleagues old and new, as well as sponsor undergraduate research.  Indeed, many questions stemming from this project are suitable for undergraduate research and the principal investigator will recruit a diverse array of students to work on them.  These students will be equipped with the skills, expertise, confidence, and passion necessary to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences.  This project will create not only new mathematics, but also the new mathematicians necessary to enhance and enrich the nation's infrastructure for research and education."

Geometric group theory is most often focused on quasi-isometry invariants: measurements that are insensitive to bounded (additive and multiplicative) distortion of distances. This allows us to pass between the study of groups and the spaces they act on geometrically, and between different Cayley graphs for finitely generated groups. A unifying theme for the research projects described here is the pursuit of ""finer"" approaches to asymptotic geometry through the use of more sensitive measurements.  In particular, the PI proposes to study large-scale geometric statistics that are not invariant under quasi-isometry.  This point of view facilitates the study of randomness and asymptotic density in groups, and of properties of ""typical"" geodesics in spaces.<br/><br/>The ideas in play here have already led the PI and her collaborators to new density results in free abelian groups and the Heisenberg group; new invariants used to further the classification program for right-angled Artin groups; and progress in the study of Teichmueller geometry.   Statistical geometry is broadly applicable in a range of settings outside pure mathematics, from computer science to medicine---wherever geometric models are made and long-term probabilistic prediction is required.  In addition to the research program, this proposal describes a collection of educational projects:  principally, the development of an organizational infrastructure for Research Labs engaging faculty and students from a wide variety of institutions.  Each lab will work on a cluster of problems around a coherent mathematical nucleus, with opportunities for mutli-level teaching, learning, exploration, and collaboration.  There will be conferences and journal issues coordinated with these Labs, guided by the principles of combining expository soundness with research value and emphasizing collaboration."

The questions to be investigated for the nonlinear equations include the smoothness and real analyticity of the solutions. The tools that may be used for the nonlinear partial differential equations include a new family of nonlinear Fourier transforms that characterize smoothness and real analyticity and the methods developed in the regularity theory of CR functions.

In addition, the PI hopes to continue to explore the strongly nonlinear effects relating to frequency cascades in Hamiltonian models on compact domains.  The bulk of the project will focus on understanding theoretically the existence and regularity of solutions to strongly nonlinear models, as well as studying local and global dynamics of special solutions within these complex models.  However, a component will also consist of using modern functional analytic techniques to study convergence of numerical methods and to study validity of discrete approximations to these models.  Such analysis can serve as motivation for dynamics, as well as a means of testing asymptotic limits where direct analysis may no longer predict precise dynamics.  In addition, the PI will work to develop a functional analytic framework for studying stability under stochastic perturbations of quasilinear models and computational approximations.<br/> <br/> <br/>Quasilinear partial differential equations arise in models where curvature has a strong influence on the underlying physics.  Hence, surface tension in fluids, surface energy in crystals or relativistic effects in optics can introduce interaction terms that strongly depend upon higher order derivatives of the solution.  It is the aim of this project to shed light on in what sense these models have solutions and in particular understand precise asymptotic descriptions of the solutions when possible.  Capillary waves might be useful for measuring the surface signature of internal water waves, crystal relaxation plays a role in semiconductor fabrication and ultra-short pulse lasers have appeared in many recent physics applications and plasma generation.  From a human resources standpoint, quasilinear problems provide a large pool of problems that can be used for training purposes in work with researchers of all levels, from undergraduate to postdoctoral.  In particular, undergraduates can learn some of the innate difficulties in quasilinear equations by numerically analyzing simple 1,2-dimensional toy-model systems, graduate students can learn the functional analysis framework and develop the techniques through applications to reduced models or critical equations, and postdocs can collaborate on projects to fully explore the models, develop techniques and work towards optimal results in stability theory and phenomenology.  Such approaches give trainees and the PI a broad class of analytic and computational tools to use for solving many interesting problems, allowing them to work towards a full enough understanding to consider complex nonlinear inverse problems and a large set of open nonlinear scattering problems to work on well into their careers."

The analysis of such multi-dimensional wave patterns, and in particular, solutions of the Euler equations which propagate at least one surface of discontinuity, is fundamental to the understanding of basic physical phenomena.  The goal of this research effort is to treat such multi-dimensional discontinuous wave profiles as moving free-boundary problems, and to develop a theory for the well-posedness of hyperbolic and degenerate hyperbolic systems, construct solutions which exhibit finite-time singularities wherein the propagating hypersurfaces collide with one another, study  singular asymptotic limits such as vanishing viscosity limits and limits of zero surface tension, and develop a novel nonlinear stability theory for so-called hyperbolic-parabolic problems which are ubiquitous in models of phase transition.<br/><br/>Multiphase fluid flows with moving interfaces play a central role in a multitude of physical and engineering applications, ranging from the creation of hurricanes due to wind blowing on top of the ocean surface to the atomization of liquid fuel jets in combustion chambers to the motion of astrophysical bodies such as gaseous stars, and to fundamental predictions in atmospheric science and meteorology. The analytical understanding gained in this work may have important ramifications in the understanding of basic physical phenomena, which is heretofore, poorly understood. In addition to basic wave motion and singularities that occurs in the motion of interfaces between water and air, other conventional examples include the interface between air and water, the motion of cloud fronts,  the melting of ice-bergs,  basic  instabilities between two compressed gases, the behavior of a gas bubble in a liquid in a shock wave, and liquid fuels which are usually burned by first atomizing a fuel jet to increase the surface area and hence the evaporation rate.

This project will seek to describe, among other things, spectral properties for very slow decay and the asymptotic behavior of the spectral density at critical points.

First, the effect of domain geometry is investigated in terms of a relation between the volume growth of the underlying manifold and the decay of linear solutions. The implications of this relation for the nonlinear problem are then explored in certain tractable geometries, namely quotients of Euclidean spaces. Second, the question of small-data scattering (asymptotically linear behavior) for some weakly nonlinear dispersive equations is considered. These are equations where the nonlinearity is not of high enough degree for classical methods to succeed. One focus is on inhomogeneities represented by a potential term, and how this can affect the asymptotic behavior. Finally, the so-called weakly turbulent regime is investigated by studying the long-time behavior of the cubic NLS equation on a compact domain. In this context, a new continuum equation is derived for the envelope of the discrete Fourier modes by taking a suitable large-box limit in the spirit of weak turbulence theory. This equation turns out to enjoy remarkable symmetries and even explicit solutions, and can be used (via rigorous approximation results) to better understand the long-time frequency dynamics of the original NLS system.<br/><br/>The nonlinear dispersive equations considered in this project arise naturally in several areas of physics (plasma physics, nonlinear optics, general relativity, etc.) where they often serve as simplified effective models. In order for these models to be useful for engineering purposes as well, one has to understand the effect of inhomogeneities (usually modeled by a non-Euclidean domain geometry or a potential term) in making connections with the real world. Such a study would help set the parameters and limitations of not only the validity of the existing simplified models, but also the faithfulness of computer simulations (based on those models) in predicting experimental phenomena. On a more theoretical note, starting a mathematically rigorous study of the all-important physical theory of weak turbulence, as suggested in the proposal, represents a cross-disciplinary collaboration between pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and physics, with rewarding applications in plasma and fluid engineering, as well as ocean and atmospheric science."

Among the most delicate is to what extent the integers can be replaced by other discrete sets: For which other sets is sampling also well behaved. In the square-integrable case, this is just one instance of the profound two-weight inequality for the Hilbert transform. It asks for a real-variable characterization of those pairs of measures on the real line for which the Hilbert transform is bounded between the Hilbert spaces associated with the pair of measures (weights). Lacey has recently solved this problem, in complete generality. This and a family of related extensions will be under investigation by Lacey.<br/><br/>This mathematics research project by Michael Lacey is in the field of harmonic analysis, which has deep applications to other fields such as engineering, for instance to signal transmission. The hallmark of transmission of information is rapid and regular sampling of a signal, followed by a synthesis of the samples into, for instance, a voice conversation over a cell phone. The system is robust, with small perturbations of the sampling not affecting the synthesis, in part because the most obvious problems with the sampling are all accounted for. The abstraction of this sampling leads to fascinating mathematical problems:  A dramatic oversampling of the signal increases the observed energy. How bad can the oversampling become, while preserving the energy of the signal? Just how degenerate of a sampling is permitted before the signal is lost? Lacey has provided a mathematical solution to the first problem, an advance that will open the door to a range of related questions. These techniques, disseminated across fields of science and engineering, will impact the underlying theories of sampling and information. Some of the problems in this project will be studied by Ph.D. students under Lacey's direction."

Analysis and differential equations are central, deep and rich fields of mathematics. From an applied perspective, differential equations are the most fundamental mathematical models in all of science and engineering. They describe phenomena from quantum mechanics to weather prediction and climate,and generally speaking constitute the basic theoretical tools for much of science and technology. The exponential improvement in the capabilities of modern computers allows for the practical use of increasingly complex systems of differential equations. Although recent results have solved numerous outstanding problems, many still remain open. The understanding of the mathematical properties of these models is essential. The need in both academia and industry for young, well-trained mathematicians in these areas is ever growing.<br/><br/>The PIs believe that there is a severe shortage of US PhDs trained in (applied) analysis and differential equations. The proposed project's central goals are to develop a well-rounded and modern educational program to increase the number of American researcher working in the applied analysis and differential equations, and to improve the quality of training of future mathematical scientists (working in either academia or industry) from undergraduate mathematics majors to postdoctoral researchers. The PIs expect that the several components of this program (curriculum reform, new courses, integrated seminars, outreach activities, undergraduate research experience and four week long summer tutorials/courses) will serve as a model for similar initiatives across the country. The proposed project will not only provide aspiring mathematical scientists with a firm grounding in analysis and differential equations, but also prepare them for possible modern connections among these ever developing areas of mathematics through several planned activities. This diversified training is definitely needed in order to become a successful researcher in applied mathematics in either academia or industry. With the aid of the RTG funding, the PIs and other researchers at the University of Chicago will stimulate the formation and the formation and the development of an environment in which activities that successfully exploit the combined talents of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty members are more prominent features.

For complex phenomena, it is also very often the case that most of the available information is ``statistical'' (random) and not ``exact'' (deterministic). Furthermore incorporating the fluctuations of several physical quantities leads to equationsmwith ``singular'' (white noise type) and ``random'' dependence on some of the variables. In this context, random homogenization and stochastic partial differential equation become the natural mathematical objects. From the mathematical point of view, the randomness is associated with singular dependence on the state variables and lack of compactness both giving rise to challenging mathematical problems. Overcoming them  requires the development of new methods and techniques. In biology, experiments at the molecular scale as well as new theories have led to new sophisticated mathematical models. Novel tools and ideas are needed to study these problems further and to identify all the relevant regimes/scales of the parameters affecting the experimentally observed and theoretically conjectured behavior.<br/>The PI proposes to continue his program to develop methods to study nonlinear deterministic and stochastic partial differential equation arising in continuum and statistical physics, biology, engineering, etc.. The emphasis is on the development of theories for  (i) the homogenization of nonlinear, parabolic/elliptic and hyperbolic partial differential equation in spatio-temporal random media and applications to mean field games and front propagation and (ii) weak (stochastic viscosity) solutions of fully nonlinear, (degenerate) parabolic stochastic partial differential equation, and (iii)  the analysis of models for adaptive dynamics in mathematical biology.<br/><br/>The development of mathematical tools to study complex phenomena in multi-scale environments, especially when very often the only available information/data are statistical (random), is of the out most importance.  Nonlinear, first- and second-order, stochastic partial differential equation and stochastic homogenization arise in models for a wide variety of phenomena and applications including mean field games, turbulence, phase transitions and front propagation in random media, nucleations in physics, macroscopic limits of particle systems, stochastic control theory, stochastic control with partial observations, financial mathematics, etc.. The theory of stochastic viscosity solutions is important. It allows for the study of a completely new class of fully nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation. As the subject develops further, it is expected that it will play a crucial role in applied areas by providing the necessary tools to analyze previously intractable models. There has been a resurgence in interest in homogenization in random media. The novel tools and methods that have already been and are proposed to be developed are expected to become the standard<br/>methodology in the field.  In mathematical biology, the proposed work is expected to enhance the understanding of concrete phenomena in adaptive dynamics. All the proposed areas of work are current, important and very active.

Each year a few speakers from outside the region will be invited to give plenary talks on the theme chosen for the year by the host institution, and regional speakers will also address a broad spectrum of topics in areas of dynamical systems, pure and applied.  The meetings are aimed to attract prominent mathematical scientists in the region, as well as graduate students and junior faculty from higher educational institutions in the Carolinas. <br/><br/><br/>A primary purpose of the Carolina Dynamics Symposium is to allow mathematicians in the broad field of dynamical systems, at all career stages and types of institutions, to come together for several days to strengthen professional relationships and interactions.  We plan to build on a successful format by enlarging participation to include several outside experts while maintaining the open invitation to participate fully to the regional mathematicians.   From its inception participants and speakers in the Carolina Dynamics meetings have included graduate students, junior and senior faculty, as well as undergraduates.  The organizers invite and advertise to a demographically diverse group, and often half the speakers are women.  The meetings are designed to strengthen and invigorate the dynamics community in the southeast.  By working together its members can achieve more than by working alone;  many fruitful collaborations have resulted from past meetings and we expect the activity to increase with this grant.<br/><br/>http://www.devio.us/~ppunosevac/cdynsys/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage"

The focus is on the study of the regularity properties of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, and their connections with the well posedness of such problems; parts of the project concern non local diffusions. The partial differential equations investigated in this project arise from stochastic models dealing with discontinuous processes. A  number of models from finance, physics, population dynamics, chemistry and biology  involve non local diffusions. Another related direction of research concerns the interaction between local or non local diffusion with advection. There are a number of advection-diffusion models from physics that are not currently well understood mathematically. Typical examples of such phenomena arise in the study of equations that model fluids dynamics. The principal investigator Luis Silvestre will study estimates for advection-diffusion equations geared towards an improved understanding of the active scalar equations arising from models in fluid dynamics. Silvestre will also investigate a number of questions related to fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations that occur in the study of zero-sum stochastic games.<br/><br/>This mathematics research projects studies the behavior of so-called non-local equations. Such equations arise in any physical model with long range interactions. They also arise naturally as the equations governing any probabilistic model whose values may take long jumps. A common example is the modeling of stock prices in financial mathematics, which could sporadically take sudden changes. Non local equations appear in myriad of models from physics, finance, social sciences and biology. Their applications may range from the valuation of financial options, to the effective computation of protein docking, which is useful in the design of medicinal drugs, and even in the modeling of the flight of birds. The development of a general theory of non local partial differential equations has seen great progress in recent years, which goes side to side with an increasing number of applications. The equations describing the dynamics of fluids present very difficult mathematical questions. Luis Silvestre (the principal investigator in this project) will also study certain diffusion equations, local and non local, in moving fluids. For the educational part of this proposal, Silvestre will organize summer schools, design an improved partial differential equations class for undergraduates, as well as teaching a graduate class; Silvestre will also organize conferences, and will mentor graduate students and postdoctoral fellows."

Nazarov, Treil and Volberg will concentrate their efforts on several well-known hard problems in non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and spectral theory. The common theme among majority of the problems is the so-called ""universality"" phenomenon, i.e. the fact that in many situations the boundedness of one operator (or a small collection of operators) implies that a much wider class of operators is bounded as well. Most of the problems lie in the realm of the non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, where underlying sets and measures are highly irregular. Singular integral operators with respect to singular measures and very irregular sets appear naturally in many problems of analysis. One of the motivations for the one-weight non-homogeneous case was the study of analytic capacity. The more sophisticated two-weight estimates of singular operators appear naturally in spectral theory and in the perturbation theory of self-adjoint operators. These problems are notoriously difficult, but using new techniques  recently developed by Nazarov, Treil and Volberg  and other researchers, they expect to make fundamental progress in the problems.<br/> <br/><br/>This collaborative mathematics research project by Nazarov, Treil and Volberg is focused in the field of harmonic analysis, which is known to have fundamental applications to other disciplines, most notably to the analysis of large data sets, to image processing, and to the study of wave propagation.  The results and mathematical tools that will be developed through this project could  also have a bearing on other areas of mathematics, such as  mathematical physics, partial differential equations, probability. The project will provide a good training ground for graduate students as well as for mathematicians at the beginning of their careers.  Nazarov, Treil and Volberg anticipate an active involvement of their graduate students and postdocs in the project."

The principal investigator will apply and develop methods of noncommutative geometry to study the index theory of hypoelliptic Fredholm operators associated to various geometric structures (most notably contact structures and foliations). His belief is that the results will pay off in two directions: hypoelliptic operators provide examples of phenomena not exhibited by elliptic operators, yielding new insights that further the development of index theory itself, and, conversely, index formulas of hypoelliptic operators will lead to new results in geometry. A specific aim of the project is to develop new applications of index theory to contact geometry.<br/><br/>In the early 1960s the British mathematician Michael Atiyah and the American mathematician Isodore Singer derived an important formula. The ""Atiyah-Singer index formula"" established a deep connection between two central branches of mathematics: analysis (the modern version of differential and integral calculus) and topology/geometry (the study of higher dimensional curved space). The index formula subsumed several important classical results and has subsequently led to numerous applications and new developments in many areas of mathematics as well as in theoretical physics. The continued relevance of index theory is evidenced, for example, by the very recent proof of the celebrated ""Weinstein conjecture,"" which says that (under certain mild hypotheses) every mechanical arrangement of moving objects (a ""dynamical system"") can be configured in such a way that the collective motion of the system will exactly repeat itself after a finite time-interval. The proof of this theorem makes use, in crucial places, of the formula of Atiyah and Singer. This project extends the applicability of index formulas to a large new class of problems that were not covered by the original theory. Ideas from the emerging area of noncommutative geometry (a recent and radical revision of the foundation concepts of geometry inspired by quantum theory) play a central role in this work. This project establishes substantial new connections between separate branches of pure mathematics, and it opens up a new area of application of the index formula that has been crucial to the development of mathematics for the last fifty years."

A classical approach to studies of chaotic dynamics deals only with the asymptotic in time properties. A new approach to the design of hyperbolic (chaotic) elastic impact systems will be developed which will allow to essentially extend this class. It is based on a new general characterization of absolutely focusing mirrors in terms of continued fractions. A 40-years old problem on smoothening of stadium elastic impact systems will be resolved, which will allow to advance in understanding dynamics of Hamiltonian systems with divided into regular islands and chaotic seas phase spaces. Dynamics of a finite size particles in nonconvex polygons will be shown to be chaotic on contrary to a general view that impact systems with point and finite size particles have similar dynamics. This will be applied to classical Ehrenfest's wind-tree model in statistical mechanics to demonstrate that this model may even surpass the richness of dynamics in the Lorentz gas.

A new approach to study closed systems by making ""holes"" at different places of their spaces of states and observing how position of such ""hole"" influences dynamics has already been taken up by physicists in numerical experiments and will be a useful and easily implemented tool in laboratory experiments as well in physics, chemistry and technology. Simple visual models of systems with impacts proposed by the PI will continue to be built as experimental devices in physics labs all over the world. As clear visual examples they play an important role in teaching nonlinear dynamics and complex systems to students and young scientists in all areas of science and engineering. The proposed research will have impact not only within the theory of dynamical systems but in other areas of Mathematics as well, especially in Mathematical Physics. Analysis of chaotic motion of finite size particles in nonconvex polygons may have applications for transport in nanotubes where particles propagate one after another and do not interact. The proposed research will enhance national and international collaborations with Mexico, Canada, Brasil, UK, Germany and Italy.  Among the PI's collaborators are several females and Hispanics.

Two key tools will play a prominent role in the PI's work: Riemann-Hilbert Problems (RHP) and the non-linear, non-commutative steepest descent method, on the one hand, and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) on the other. RHPs can be viewed as the natural, non-commutative generalization  of the scalar integral representations of the classical special functions, and just as the classical steepest descent method allows one to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the classical functions, so too the non-linear, non-commutative steepest descent method allows one to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of modern integrable systems such as the KdV equation and the Painleve equations, amongst many others. RMT, and in particular, the eigenvalues of random matrices, provide an extremely versatile tool to describe the behavior of a wide variety of stochastic phenomena when the underlying variables are no longer independent. Amongst the problems that the PI will address with these tools are: the asymptotic behavior of the modes of a laser as the Fresnel number goes to infinity; the behavior of random n-band matrices of size N as n,N go to infinity; universality for general orthogonal and symplectic matrix ensembles; the perturbation theory of the focusing Non-Linear Schroedinger Equation on the line.<br/><br/><br/>It is an extraordinary fact that the eigenvalues of random matrices provide a quantitative model for a wide variety of statistical phenomena from physics, pure and applied mathematics, and engineering. Applications of RMT range from the analysis of resonances in nuclear scattering theory, to the analysis of the zeroes of the  Riemann zeta function on the critical line, in analytic number theory.Quite spectacularly, and surprisingly, even the arrival times between buses in the Mexican city of Cuernavaca, have been shown to obey random matrix theory statistics! RMT as a discipline has two components: the development of random matrix theory per se, and the application of the theory to new physical and mathematical problems. The work of the PI will impact both components. In the theory of integrable systems, two of the problems in particular proposed by the PI, arise directly from technology, viz., laser mode asymptotics, and the effect of perturbations on fiber optical transmission systems. The PI and his collaborators are also writing basic texts on RHPs and RMT aimed at the researchers as well as advanced graduate students entering the field."

One area of inquiry is non-equilibrium statistical mechanics with the goal to understand simple aspects of non- equilibrium steady states in simple models, such as a Kac-type model describing the interaction of colliding particles with a thermostat. A second topic is related to symmetry breaking or the absence thereof in a class of non-linear variational problems.  The plan is to find  volution equations that let any function evolve into an optimizing function. This is a concept that has worked in a number of interesting cases already. The third topic concerns problems in quantum mechanics, in particular some problems about random Schroedinger operators with the goal to extend  recent results on the Random Displacement Model to a larger class of geometries.  The fourth topic that will be investigated, is the connection between the geometry of curves and certain special Lieb-Thirring-type inequalities.  While these topics sound quite different, they all can be cast as optimization problems, and can lead to new and unexpected mathematical insights into the calculus of variations.<br/><br/>Mathematics is important because of its universal nature, both as a language and as a toolbox for solving problems in science and engineering.  The aim of this proposal is to understand a range of questions that arise from the physical sciences.   A central problem is how to describe  the evolution of large systems of interacting agents, be it colliding particles, flocking birds or individuals that exchange goods in an economy.  Such systems are usually in an equilibrium but react to external disturbances. It is important to understand whether such a system returns to equilibrium and if so, how fast.   One focus of this grant is on understanding these question in the context of large systems of colliding particles. A second area of inquiry concerns the effect of randomness on the motion of quantum mechanical particles. The goal is to understand in more detail than is presently known how randomly displaced obstacles influence the motion of an electron.  An understanding of this question is important since it yields another way of modeling insulators.  The mathematically fascinating aspect of this line of research is that most of these problems can be formulated as optimization problems,  thus tapping into a large mathematical toolkit while at the same time adding to  it.  <br/>This research area also is an excellent training ground for students because they are forced to see beyond the purely mathematical aspect of a problem."

The goal is to better understand ""stable"" polynomials (those without zeros on a specified domain), because of their frequent appearance in function theory (as in rational inner functions and interpolation problems), mathematical physics, and engineering, as well as to view algebraic varieties as domains on which to study function theory and operator theory.  Function theory on varieties can enrich one variable function theory and while shining light on difficult problems in function theory in several variables.<br/><br/>Much of the work has its intellectual roots in the works of Norbert Wiener, Andrey Kolmogorov, and Arne Beurling (to name just a few) on areas of probability theory and mathematical analysis that formed the mathematical underpinnings of signals analysis (or communications), control theory (as in automatic pilots), and time series analysis (the study of sequential data like stock prices).  This project will continue in this long and fruitful tradition by developing and generalizing the underlying mathematics further (most notably by emphasizing relations to algebraic topics).  The project should have connections to areas of scientific endeavor with multidimensional data (e.g. an image) as opposed to the previous examples that feature primarily one dimensional data (the one dimension being time)."

Nazarov, Treil and Volberg will concentrate their efforts on several well-known hard problems in non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and spectral theory. The common theme among majority of the problems is the so-called universality"" phenomenon, i.e. the fact that in many situations the boundedness of one operator (or a small collection of operators) implies that a much wider class of operators is bounded as well. Most of the problems lie in the realm of the non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, where underlying sets and measures are highly irregular. Singular integral operators with respect to singular measures and very irregular sets appear naturally in many problems of analysis. One of the motivations for the one-weight non-homogeneous case was the study of analytic capacity. The more sophisticated two-weight estimates of singular operators appear naturally in spectral theory and in the perturbation theory of self-adjoint operators. These problems are notoriously difficult, but using new techniques  recently developed by Nazarov, Treil and Volberg  and other researchers, they expect to make fundamental progress in the problems.<br/> <br/><br/>This collaborative mathematics research project by Nazarov, Treil and Volberg is focused in the field of harmonic analysis, which is known to have fundamental applications to other disciplines, most notably to the analysis of large data sets, to image processing, and to the study of wave propagation.

This proposal identifies several classes of interesting such problems: analyzing solutions of nonconvex Hamilton-Jacobi equations (with applications  to dynamical game theory models),  improving  PDE methods for weak KAM theory (to establish connections with classical  dynamics), studying  the regularity of solutions of the  infinity Laplacian equation (a key equation for max-norm variational problems),  and investigating the regularity of solutions to certain strongly nonlinear parabolic systems of PDE.

Related applications apply to so-called mean field game theory, a newly developed subject modeling behavior of large populations of competing players. In addition the design of fast and accurate numerical methods   depends  upon detailed understanding of the underlying nonlinear PDE.

In collaboration with Kari Vilonen, Schmid will complete the proof of their recent conjecture about irreducible unitary representations of reductive Lie Groups. Classifying the irreducible unitary representations of such a group G is known to be equivalent to an algebraic problem: among the irreducible Harish-Chandra modules with an invariant, but possibly indefinite inner product, determine those for which the inner product is positive definite. Vogan and his collaborators on the AIM Atlas project have pointed out that this inner product is directly and explicitly related to a certain indefinite inner product, one that is infinitesimally invariant under a compact real form U of the complexification of G. According to the above-mentioned conjecture, the U-invariant inner product is computable in terms of Morihiko Saito's Hodge filtration on the Beilinson-Bernstein D-module realization of the Harish-Chandra module in question. The conjecture would not explicitly classify the irreducible unitary representations, but would bring the functorial apparatus of Hodge theory to bear on the unitarity problem. Schmid and Vilnoen will prove the conjecture, and also investigate its various implications. The other component of the project is joint with Steve Miller. Schmid and Miller and have developed a new method for proving the functional equations and holomorphy for Langlands L-functions. Compared to the existing methods, it has the advantage of making the Gamma factors directly computable, at least in all the cases we have examined so far. This enables them to exclude all unexpected poles of L-functions that the other methods cannot rule out. In principle, it should apply to all L-functions accessible by the method of integral representations. Miller and Schmid plan to refine their method and extend its range of applicability.<br/><br/><br/>This mathematics research project by Wilfried Schmid is in the general area of representation theory, specifically on the representation of so-called non-compact groups of symmetries.  Symmetry is a familiar phenomenon that occurs in everyday life. The concept of symmetry was formalized by 19th century mathematicians, who introduced the notion of ""group of symmetries""; in this context the group of rotations of three dimensional space is a basic but important example because the laws of classical mechanics do not change under space rotations, and this fact helps to organize, simplify and thus better understand the solution of many practical problems in other disciplines such as relativity theory. While representations of compact groups have been well understood for three quarters of a century, the same is not true for the representations of non-compact groups, which are among the topics studied by this project. In addition to this work, Schmid is involved in several activities pertaining K-12 education, such as serving in advisory panels, and giving public lectures."

One of the main thrusts of the present project is to build on the latest advances in this direction, which led to the uncovering of the nonunimodular character of the conformal geometry of the noncommutative torus. Other themes concern the continuation of the development of new techniques for computing Hopf algebra cyclic cohomology, and applying them to the determination of explicit expressions for the transverse characteristic classes of a large class of noncommutative spaces occurring in geometry and number theory;  the investigation of the invariants called higher indices for manifolds with boundary in order to elucidate their role in detecting geometric and topological properties of these spaces; the exploration of the potential arithmetic implications of the obtained results in connection with several open problems at the interface between noncommutative geometry and number theory.<br/><br/>In noncommutative geometry, the paradigm of space as a manifold formed of points labeled by numerical coordinates is replaced by one of a much more general nature, in which the coordinates are operator-valued and may no longer commute, as in quantum physics.

While the most basic algebraic, topological, and analytical tools for the global treatment of such spaces have been already successfully developed, the local treatment, and even the meaning of locality in the absence of the deeply ingrained spatial conceptualization, is still very much under construction.

Of particular interest here are space-time integrability bounds of Strichartz and local smoothing type for the wave and Schrdinger equations.  The proposal also concerns closely related estimates on eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold.  These problems actually stem from those in classical Fourier analysis, such as the Stein-Tomas restriction theorem, and the relevant techniques involve closely related oscillatory integral estimates.  While basic formulations of these inequalities exist for these equations when they are posed over Euclidean space and even Riemannian manifolds without boundary, less is known about their validity for initial boundary value problems.  Here one considers a domain or more generally a Riemannian manifold with boundary, and the imposition of homogeneous boundary conditions affects the flow of energy in significant ways, sometimes even inhibiting dispersion.  Consequently, the proofs of these estimates typically involve microlocal or phase space analysis, which provide avenues for understanding this phenomena.  For smooth boundaries, Blair and his collaborators have achieved a great deal of success by realizing solutions as a superposition of wave packets, then showing that the resulting oscillatory integrals yield the desired inequalities.  On domains with corners, even less is known about the validity of these estimates, but Blair and his collaborators have been able to obtain some results for polygonal domains.<br/><br/><br/>This mathematics research project by Matthew Blair is in the area of Fourier analysis: this is a branch of mathematics that plays an important role in the development of mathematical and physical theories.  The research pursued in this project provides the mathematical foundation for the study of light and sound waves. Fourier analysis continues to play a significant role in deepening our understanding of the equations which model this behavior.  In particular, these investigations yield further insight as to how the presence of a hard boundary surface influences the development of waves.  For example, if one listens to the symphony in an auditorium, the sounds heard are affected by the manner in which the acoustic waves reflect off the walls.  In this sense, it can be important to understand how the shape of the hall influences its acoustics.  While this is of course a classical problem, there is more to be understood in terms of how these interactions influence dispersive properties.  Moreover, this line of work is important in the analysis of closely related nonlinear equations arising from fiber optics and water waves, where there is much to be done in understanding and limiting the various types of instabilities which can occur."

In the former, the project will investigate when functions of several variables preserve the natural order structure on matrices, and what happens when the size of the matrices becomes infinite (the operator case). Conversely, the Principal Investigator proposes to use tools from operator theory to understand functions of several variables, such as characterizing asymptotic expansions of functions in the Pick class (this is called the Hamburger problem in one variable).

Various studies have shown that these ""information"" images often reveal features that are completely missed by conventional, energy images. This project will study how to improve these images, using various different measures of information-theoretic entropy, both to render them sharper, and to enable their calculation in real time. These techniques will have applications in medical imaging and also in security scanning.

A first line of research has to do with the behavior of eigenfunctions of compact manifolds at high energy, with focus on the ""simplest model"" of the flat tori. In this setting, the eigenfunctions are explicit but nevertheless many of their properties remain conjectural.  Bourgain  intends to explore further the various moment inequalities which these eigenfunctions are supposed to obey and which are essential to issues in the theory of Schrodinger operators for instance, in particular to control theory.  There is by now a large array of methods involved.  In low dimension, number theory plays a key role.  Input from elliptic curve theory (in 2D), distributional properties of lattice points on spheres and Siegel's mass formula led to new insights that deserve further study.  In high dimension, recent progress came jointly with breakthroughs in the theory of oscillatory integral operators.  The challenge is to establish uniform estimates on higher moments of the normalized eigenfunctions and some of Bourgain's recent work comes tentatively close to this.  The interaction with other fields makes this research particularly stimulating.  Spectral theory in Lie groups offers a different problematic and panorama of conjectures.  Bourgain will continue research on spectral gaps, one of the central themes with many applications to number theory, mathematical physics and theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>  This mathematics research project by Jean Bourgan is in the area of harmonic analysis with a focus on the notion of ""spectral gap"": such notion is known to have broad inter-disciplinary significance, ranging from pure mathematics to computer science, evolutionary biology and solid state physics.

Much of Bourgain's past work with various collaborators has to do with elaborating a general framework enabling to prove the existence of spectral gaps.  Bourgain will also investigate wave interactions; this problem lies at the heart of the study of solutions of many differential equations from physics and engineering.  These solutions are roughly speaking obtained by superposition of elementary harmonics which collective effect obey deep mathematical principles.  In many important examples, for instance in the theory of Schrodinger operators, this theory is still far from completely established.  Bourgain will focus on some of the main conjectures on the behavior of eigenstates at high energy and the related aspects.  Striking advances came from other mathematical areas, such as dynamics and number theory, offering new perspective that deserve further exploration. While the advances are undeniable and several conjectural phenomena can now be justified, there remain many challenges in known and less known territory which Bourgain will investigate through this project."

These topics are at the heart of the geometries of Banach spaces and  of metric spaces and make contact with many other areas within mathematics, including operator theory, group theory, geometric analysis, and linear algebra.<br/><br/>Metric spaces, especially Banach spaces, form the conceptual framework in which mathematicians, scientists, and engineers work when investigating problems that involve estimation or approximation.  Discrete metric geometry, including dimensional reduction results which have been established by the PI, is important in the design of algorithms and in compressed sensing. Work on the classification of operators which are commuters was originally motivated by the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics (which, from a mathematical point of view, arises because certain operators do not commute). Non linear phenomena often occurs in nature but is difficult to deal with.  This makes it important to understand when non linearity actually conceals underlying linear structure, and this is central to the non linear study of Banach spaces. Parts of this research project are coordinated with the Workshop in Analysis and Probability Theory at Texas A&M University, which is directed by the PI. The Workshop encourages interactions among researchers and apprentices in different mathematical fields by bringing together graduate students and junior and senior postdoctoral participants in several areas of analysis.  Activities of the Workshop include seminars, Concentration Weeks, introductory lectures, and an annual conference.  The efforts of the principal investigators and other participants in the Workshop are helping to break down barriers between different areas of mathematics and also promote the outreach of pure mathematics to other sciences, especially to computer science."

The domain can be given either a priori (fixed boundary problem), or as a part of the problem (free boundary problem). The problems to be discussed arise in a variety of physical phenomena.  First we propose to study the averaging behavior for solutions of nonlinear PDEs in a domain with oscillatory boundary data. This type of question arises for instance in the narrow escape problem, which concerns diffusion processes in domains with partly insulated boundaries. We also discuss interface homogenization problems where the inhomogeneity is present, for example, in the perforation structure of the domain (percolation) or in the advection vector field (turbulent flames).  Our goal is to understand how the inhomogeneities in the system interact with the geometry of the domain to affect the macroscopic behavior of the solutions. Our second project concerns phase transition phenomena in collective motions, for example the emergence of jammed region in congestion models with a density constraint. We will in particular focus on the characterization of the phase motion law. Lastly we propose to study the evolution of capillary drops on a flat or tilted surface in the quasi-static approximation regime. The aim is to address stability of solutions, classification of possible singularities such as pinning and pinching, and the long-time behavior. For the investigation the tools from probability and PDE theory will be used when they are available.<br/><br/><br/>The presence of lower-dimensional structure is ubiquitous in the physical literature, either as a boundary of a domain or a moving interface created by different types of materials. The proposal addresses some fundamental questions concerning these problems, such as existence and long-time behavior of solutions. This is important, since without a proper mathematical theory it is difficult to develop accurate and trustworthy numerical methods.  A good example is the problem of sliding drops on tilted surface. In this case the shape of the drop can change drastically when the velocity is increased, and a singularity (corner) develops at the rear of the drop when the velocity exceed a certain critical value. At higher speeds the tail of the drop may break into another component (pearling).  Accurate modeling of the motion of drops is therefore an important and highly complex question in fluid mechanics, with many applications in engineering. Another example is in the crowd motion  of individuals or cars in congested areas exiting through part of the boundary of the confining domain (e.g. a room or a highway), where the exit pattern is highly affected by the shape of the domain as well as the location of the exit.  The project aim towards a better understanding of the properties of these problems and provide a framework for developing accurate computer-based numerical simulations.  Finally, the proposal involves collaboration with students and colleagues at all stages. The plan is to create active environments in applied analysis at the PI's institution by organizing seminars, inviting visitors as well as communicating to experts in related fields, and also by traveling to other institutions, for collaboration and presentations."

This work began with the pioneering results Eugene Wigner in the 1950's, in which the energy levels of certain models in nuclear physics were modeled as the ""eigenvalues"" of large random matrices. The beautiful result of Wigner is that the energy levels actually become nonrandom in the limit as the size of the matrices goes to infinity and are described by Wigner's famous semicircular distribution. This result was the first indication that certain complicated calculations actually become simpler as the size of the matrices involved gets larger. This mathematics research project by Brian Hall is in the same spirit. Hall and his collaborator T. Kemp study an important tool in quantum mechanics (the ""Segal--Bargmann transform"") on groups of matrices. Their first results indicate that the transform does indeed simplify substantially in the limit as the size of the matrices goes to infinity, to the point that the calculations can be carried out efficiently on a computer. There are many beautiful results still to investigate, including the problem of determining the appropriate analog of Wigner's semicircular law in this setting. This work has close connections to the two-dimensional version of strong nuclear force. That subject, in turn, has been connected to string theory by the Nobel Prize winner David Gross, since the ""worldsheet"" swept out by a string is a two-dimensional surface.<br/><br/><br/>    This mathematics research project by Brian Hall concerns the mathematical theory of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory describing the behavior of matter at the atomic scale. Quantum mechanics is foundational to many areas of science and engineering, including solid state physics and the design of computer chips. Ideas from quantum mechanics also have had a profound impact in mathematics, as exemplified by the awarding of the Fields Prize (the so-called Nobel Prize for mathematics) to a physicist, Ed Witten, in 1990. A key issue in quantum mechanics concerns its connection with classical mechanics, the theory that governs the behavior of matter on the macroscopic scale. The Segal--Bargmann transform is a mathematical tool that facilitates a comparison between classical and quantum mechanics. Hall's earlier work has extended the range of application of the Segal--Bargmann transform, and has been cited extensively in both the physics and mathematics literature. Hall's ongoing research will expand the scope of the transform still farther, by connecting it to models derived from study of the strong nuclear force and string theory. This work has potential applications in both mathematics itself, with connections to the exciting new field of free probability theory, and in physics, with possible connections to both string theory and loop quantum gravity."

The first project aims to prove the equivalence of three regularity properties for separable simple nuclear C*-algebras:  one topological, one homological, and one algebraic. The proof of this fact, which has recently seen rapid progress toward a solution under some restrictions on traces, would represent a deep generalization of Kirchberg's characterization of purely infinite simple nuclear C*-algebras.  The second project concerns the interplay between descriptive set theory and C*-algebras, and specifically the use of the notion of Borel reducibility to answer, for various classes of functional analytic objects, the question: How complicated is isomorphism? The objects that the principal investigator will consider include nuclear, exact, and locally reflexive C*-algebras, and operator spaces and systems.  The third project examines uniform perturbations of C*-algebras and the degree to which they preserve structure and invariants.  Important questions here include whether or not Z-stability and stability are preserved by such perturbations.<br/><br/>Many fields of scientific inquiry require analyzing infinite-dimensional systems and the ways in which they can be transformed.  Examples include models for quantum physics, signal analysis, and weather patterns.  Infinite-dimensional systems are, of course, complicated.  Understanding them often proceeds by approximating them with simpler finite-dimensional systems.  This project uses this approach in an effort to understand infinite-dimensional systems called C*-algebras.  The finite-dimensional approximating objects are square arrays with complex number entries.  Our aim is to identify conditions under which one can approximate the infinite-dimensional system arbitrarily closely using only a fixed finite number of overlapping arrays.  This last property is known to have powerful consequences for the original system, consequences that reveal a great deal of detail about its structure."

The principle investigator (PI) proposes to establish the best known regularity result for solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations arising in stochastic control theory, where the underlying control processes have sample paths that are singular.  This will allow control theorists to better study a wider class of models as the design of optimal controls in stochastic singular control depends on regularity properties of solutions.  In mathematical finance models involving transaction costs, quantities of interest in the limit of small transaction costs may be characterized via a solution of an eigenvalue problem involving a PDE with gradient constraint.   The PI proposes to deduce various properties of these solutions including providing new minmax formulae for eigenvalues. The PI will also perform a study of infinity ground states, which are solutions of a PDE involving the infinity Laplacian and a gradient constraint. This equation arises as a limit of Euler-Lagrange equations associated with a sequence of constrained variational problems. The PI will develop techniques for resolving a fundamental unresolved uniqueness question: on exactly which domains are infinity ground states unique up to a multiplicative factor?   <br/><br/>The proposed research seeks to address a variety of problems at the intersection of diverse fields of mathematics with applications to industries such as telecommunications and finance. Consequently, this project has the potential to serve a wide audience and to attract students and other researchers looking to forge research connections.  In attempts to increase the participation of underrepresented groups doing research in these areas of science, the PI will attend meetings such as the Conference for African American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences and the Blackwell-Tapia conference.

They include the following: (a) inverse problems in integral geometry of recovery a function or a tensor field from the geodesic ray transform; (b) microlocal inversion of transforms appearing in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging; (c) non-linear boundary and lens rigidity questions in Riemannian geometry; (d) inverse boundary problems for wave equations with variable speed; and (e) inverse problems for the wave equation arising in multiwave medical imaging. In (a), (c), and (d), we assume that there are conjugate points and the goal is to study their effect on the invertibility and its stability. The unifying theme in the project is that the inversion is done in complex geometry. A straightforward inversion in all those cases fails due to the fact that the microlocal Bolker condition does not hold anymore. One often gets artifacts in the reconstruction placed at conjugate pairs or at mirror points in SAR, etc. The fundamental questions that Stefanov will study are whether those artifacts are indeed there; how to remove them, if possible; and, (if not possible) how to characterize them. The long term goal is to understand linear and non-linear inverse problems and their stability for wave phenomena in complex media, where caustics are inevitable and stability might be lost. The work on those problems is based upon, and will further develop, methods in several areas in mathematics: Riemannian and Integral geometry, Inverse Problems, microlocal analysis, including analytic microlocal analysis, as well as classical functional analysis and PDE theory.  <br/><br/>This mathematics research project by Plemen Stefanov  is motivated by problems arising in  Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging (SAR), medical imaging and geophysics. In SAR, Stefanov will study practical questions such as what are the best flight paths that produce the best data for image reconstruction; Stefanov will also develop an approximate reconstruction algorithm for situations where there is no exact answer to this question. The boundary and the lens rigidity problems studied in this project are the mathematical foundation of Seismic Tomography: to recover the inner structure of the Earth (and the Sun) from the travel times of seismic waves; they also occur in the investigation of ultrasound imaging. The geodesic ray transform problems are a special case (linearization) of the latter. The inverse wave equation problems arise in Seismology as well, as an attempt to use more information about the wave -- not just the time of arrival but also the shape of the wave. The multiwave problems are the mathematical foundation of emerging medical imaging methods like Thermoacoustic and Photoacoustic  Tomography; they belong to the new class of multiwave (hybrid) medical imaging methods which combine the high contrast of one wave with the high resolution of another."

In particular, it will investigate regularity for certain classes of Hessian equations, including fourth-order elliptic equations, and also volume-minimizing Lagrangian submanifolds of Euclidean space, Calabi-Yau manifolds, and certain pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Many questions on second-order special Lagrangian equations, including existence and regularity, have witnessed great progress over the last five years.  In this project, the principal investigator intends to study the fourth-order generalization of this equation, which may be even more relevant to physics.  Nonlinear fourth-order partial differential equations represent a young and exciting field, and any progress may be adaptable to other equations and even other physical sciences. Recent and ongoing developments in the theory of optimal transportation show that the structure of the optimal transportation map is related to the geometry of certain maximal calibrated submanifolds of a pseudo-Riemannian space. A goal of the project is to apply the machinery of calibrated manifolds (such as special Lagrangian) to obtain novel results in optimal transport, thereby developing a nice geometric picture.<br/><br/>This project involves research into two exciting areas of mathematics, which appear to be linked together under the surface. The optimal transport problem asks the question of how to transport materials most cost efficiently between two locations. The answers are directly applicable in many areas of science, including economics, medical imaging, fluid mechanics, and meteorology. Development of a strong mathematical theory that emphasizes the crucial elements allows those in industry to implement solutions based on the theory. For example, someone working in logistics may want to know the cheapest way to ship certain goods. Solving the problem by brute force may not be computationally possible, but if a good mathematical theory is available, the solution can be computed efficiently.  Another proposed use of optimal transportation is to create software that assists surgeons in real time.  In order for this to happen, a solid theory is necessary. String theory is an exciting developing branch of physics, which many hope will lead to an understanding of the fundamental interactions of the universe. In the late 1990s, leading mathematical physicists asserted that in order to get a better understanding of string theory, we should try to understand objects called Lagrangian submanifolds. These objects are like minimal surfaces that have special properties and are governed by nonlinear equations. This project attempts to answer questions such as when these surfaces are smooth, when they are flat, and when they are discontinuous. The answers to these questions will impact the study of physics going forward.  Recently, the principal investigator and his collaborators have related the problem of finding the optimal transportation map to the problem of describing a certain type of Lagrangian minimal surface. The smoothness of minimal surfaces has been intensely studied by mathematicians for decades. This project would now like to apply some of the ideas from geometry to the theory of optimal transport."

Firstly, in the area of random matrix theory, we seek to build upon recent progress in understanding the fascinating universality phenomenon for such matrices, by generalising the ensembles for which universality can be established, and looking for the underlying mechanisms causing this universality.  Secondly, in the area of arithmetic combinatorics, we seek to improve our theory of approximate groups and related structures in noncommutative settings, with potential impact on geometric group theory and finite group theory. <br/>Finally, we wish to extend and understand the exciting new connections between algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and incidence combinatorics which have led to remarkable breakthroughs in the latter subject by applying algebraic methods.<br/><br/>Physical systems are often incredibly complicated, being driven by interactions between countless components of those systems.  However, in many cases, a remarkable phenomenon known as universality occurs, in which the macroscopic statistics of the a wide variety of systems are governed by a single universal mathematical law, almost without any regard to how the components of these systems interact with each other at the microscopic level.  For instance, the famous central limit theorem in mathematics asserts that many statistics (e.g. the distribution of heights in a human population) are described by a single curve known as the ""bell curve"" or ""Gaussian distribution"".  While the central limit theorem is now very well understood, there are other universal laws that are still mysterious, such as the Dyson sine law that has been empirically found to govern such diverse statistics as nuclear scattering, arrival times of buses, and the spacing of the zeta function in number theory.  However, we have recently begun to understand this law for a simple class of models known as random matrix models, though even for these models there is still much work to be done.  We plan to work on further understanding the underlying causes of universality for random matrix models and related models, with the hope of shedding insight on the universality phenomenon for other models as well.<br/><br/>The second aspect of the research program concerns the phenomenon of expansion in various networks, most famously manifested by the ""six degrees of separation"" experiment of Milgram, that asserts that any two people in the world are linked by at most six degrees of acquaintance. <br/> For a mathematical model of this phenomenon known as a Cayley graph, the existence of expansion is closely tied to the absence of a certain type of mathematical object known as an approximate group.  There has been a substantial amount of progress in understanding what exactly approximate groups look like, but the control we have on these groups is still not as precise as we would like.  We plan to study the theory of approximate groups further, with an eye towards applications to other areas of mathematics such as understanding the geometry of groups.<br/><br/>Combinatorial incidence geometry is the study of how simple geometric objects such as lines, circles, and points can be arranged together in as efficient a configuration as possible for various purposes (e.g. to try to arrange a given number of points and lines so that as many points lie on as many lines as possible).  Understanding the limits of how efficiently one can design such configurations is a basic mathematical question which also has practical applications (e.g. in designing frequency configurations for cell phones in order to maximize capacity and minimize interference).  Recently, there has been several breakthroughs in the subject by introducing methods from algebra (particularly algebraic geometry and algebraic topology).  This unexpected development is still not well understood; the algebraic methods can solve some problems almost completely, while making no mark on other ostensibly similar problems.  We plan to study these methods further and understand exactly what their strengths and limitations are."

This work will encompass two directions.  One is to prove new, curvature-independent bounds for generalized Radon transforms defined by averages, linear and multilinear, along families of curves in Euclidean space.  Another direction will be to prove new estimates, both linear and bilinear, for the restriction of the Fourier transform to hypersurfaces and apply these and existing estimates to certain dispersive partial differential equations.   The study of curvature-independent bounds for translation-invariant generalized Radon transforms and Fourier restriction operators has been a popular and fruitful line of research during recent years.  Work performed under this proposal will generalize, extend, and sharpen some of these results.  The particular case of averages on curves has been an important model for averages on higher dimensional manifolds, and there is a strong potential that Stovall's work to prove curvature-independent estimates will facilitate future research in these directions.  <br/><br/><br/>This mathematics research project by Betsy Stovall is in the general area of harmonic analysis, with a focus on the study of so-called generalized Radon transforms and Fourier restriction operators, and their relation with the geometric notion of curvature.  Both types of operators have been a significant focus of research in the harmonic analysis community for many years, and their study is part of a broader program to understand the effects of curvature on some operators that arise quite naturally in engineering and physics.  For example, one of the specific classes of operators whose study is proposed, a family of restricted X-ray transforms, is related to the (unrestricted) X-ray transform, which is a fundamental tool used in medical imaging. In recent years, research into Fourier restriction operators has been particularly active.  This activity is due both to intrinsic interest in these operators and because their study has led to important advances in the understanding of equations arising in fields such as quantum mechanics and optics.  The inquiries proposed by Stovall address both of these motivations.  As part of this project, Stovall will make a dedicated effort to increase the participation of students and junior scientists from under-represented groups."

A major theme of the NLS portion of the project is to investigate the effect of obstacles.  This is a concrete and challenging model case for the investigation of NLS in general geometries. Examples of dispersive equations that are scaling-critical but on the very cusp of super-criticality will also be investigated; this is an ideal proving ground for existing energy- and mass-critical techniques. Two classes of physically motivated NLS models with combined attractive and repulsive nonlinearities will be investigated.  These models have already started to reveal interesting and unusual variational and dynamical structures that warrant further investigation. Additionally, the distribution of resonances associated to finite dimensional quantum systems (chosen uniformly at random, respecting time-reversal symmetry) will be investigated.  Related methods will be employed to investigate the fine spectral properties for discrete Dirac equations with decaying random potentials.<br/><br/>The theory of random matrices is driven by empirical data as surely as any physical science: Its roots lie in statistical analysis (specifically, ANOVA) and the analysis of experimental energy-level data. More recently, random matrix statistics have been observed in the vibrations of drums and the behaviour of the prime numbers. The researches of this project are aimed at helping to elucidate and explain the results of these truly mathematical experiments. Although the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is used as a simple effective model for several physical phenomena, the goal of this project is to further our understanding of the behaviour of solutions to this equation principally as a  model for general evolution equations.  As a step towards the vicissitudes of laboratory science/engineering, we will consider evolution in the presence of obstacles and other irregularities as well as incorporating more complicated nonlinear effects that cannot be described by a simple power law.  The training of graduate students as educators and researchers in the mathematical sciences is also a significant portion of the project."
