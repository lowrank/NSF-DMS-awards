One example is the problem of melting ice, where the interface of ice and water is determined dynamically by the distribution of temperature, or solution of the heat equation, in the water region. A particular focus is given on problems where solutions are given with very little regularity.  A good example is the problem of drops sliding on tilted surface. In this case the shape of the drop can change drastically when the velocity is increased, and a singularity (corner) develops at the rear of the drop when the velocity exceed a certain critical value. At higher speeds the tail of the drop may break into another component (pearling). Another example is oil drops moving up towards water in a container when initially water, the heavier fluid, is poured on top of oil. The project aims towards a better understanding of the properties of these problems and provide a framework for developing accurate computer-based numerical simulations. Graduate students will be trained by participating in the research.<br/><br/>The problems to be discussed arise in a variety of physical phenomena, including the motion of capillary drops, crowd motion, tumor growth, and filtration of fluids in porous media. The presence of lower-dimensional structure is ubiquitous in the physical literature, either as a boundary of a domain or a singular part of an evolution. Many nonlinear PDE problems which are otherwise well-understood face significant challenges when they are coupled with a moving interface, even in seemingly simple settings. Besides the nonlinearity of the problem, the difficulty lies in the non-locality of the problem, in the sense that the behavior of solutions depends on the global geometry of the free boundary. Dynamic problems face an additional difficulty coming from the lack of a priori regularity of the free boundaries. By studying proposed problems we aim to develop general methods to deal with such difficulties. In addition to energy and integral estimates, it will be often necessary to introduce geometric methods to understand pointwise behavior of the moving interface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a broader context, the work draws inspiration from the basic scientific question: ""What are the effects of disorder?"" This is a fundamental question relevant to any scientific model, even one in which disorder is not explicitly included. After all, any real world system is subject to a small amount of noise, and experience shows that even weak disorder may have a profound effect on the behavior of the system. The equations studied in this project arise in the theory of disordered materials, but are of general interest because of the fundamental nature of both wave motion and disorder. Progress in understanding the solutions to these equations will improve basic understanding of models of theoretical physics and applied mathematics. In addition, a central goal of the research is pedagogical: to introduce students to a fundamental subject and convey to them that mathematical and theoretical physics are vibrant, growing fields.<br/> <br/>The project will proceed through a program of research on the effects of disorder in physical models. The main focus of the research is in understanding the evolution of quantum systems subject to intrinsic disorder. When disorder is weak, the expectation is that a diffusive evolution of the wave function results. At stronger disorder, it is known that localization of the wave function can occur, although the exact nature of localization in many body and open quantum systems is poorly understood. Two key goals are 1) to analyze the diffusion of waves in a weakly disordered medium over arbitrarily long times, and 2) to clarify the nature of localization in many body models.  In recent years the PI and various post-doc and student collaborators have considered the problem of wave diffusion in time-dependent random media, with the time dependence generated by a Markov process. For such models the diffusive propagation, e.g., for the tight binding Schrodinger equation, can be established by spectral analysis. One aim of the present project is to approach the time independent equation as a perturbation of these time dependent equations, which have the virtue of sharing the expected qualitative behavior. In parallel, we will study disorder induced localization in polaron type models of a interacting systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Systems with noise/disorder are often studied by probabilistic methods and assume that the noise is random. The main scope of the project is to study systems where the noise has additional structure and has deterministic (non-random) nature. In physics, strong random disorder often implies that the system becomes an insulator and prevents electrons in it from moving freely. Would it also be true for some systems with non-random disorder? If yes, which properties make non-random systems behave like random and can it be measured? Are there any additional effects if the disorder is not strong? The main goal of the project is to address these questions on many levels, which will include work with undergraduate and graduate students, development of graduate courses on dynamics and spectral theory, and developing a course for high school students that would illustrate connections between basic linear algebra and physics, providing them skills and motivation for possible further education in STEM.<br/><br/>This project incorporates teaching and research activities on the analysis of a class of models of mathematical quantum physics, including developing abstract techniques of operator theory and establishing rigorous results on more concrete systems. All proposed models involve disorder, however, unlike usual probabilistic view on disordered systems, the main goal will be studying the disorder in a completely deterministic setting, or with a very small number of random/ergodic parameters. An example of such system would be a Schrodinger operator with dynamically-defined potential, where the underlying dynamical system has small dimension and low degree of mixing (for example, irrational rotation). Typically, quantum systems with large random disorder tend to prevent electrons from moving freely (Anderson localization). To answer even basic questions about electron transport in deterministic disordered systems, one must replace usual probabilistic methods by methods of number theory, ergodic theory, semi-algebraic geometry, and other deep areas. The main directions of the project involve analysis of localization/delocalization for systems of interacting quasiperiodic particles and the effect of interaction, perturbative methods for single-particle operators with rough potentials, perturbation properties for spectral bands of periodic operators, and abstract methods of operator theory applied to almost commuting operators and matrices, with applications to quantum systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While much of the theory behind such descriptions are rooted in the physics of the nineteenth century, due to the complexity of the mathematical objects involved in them many aspects are still poorly understood. Two problems are of primary interest in this research project. (1) In theory the mathematical models should determine the future evolution of the fluid when the forces acting on it and its initial status are known; nonetheless a rigorous mathematical proof of this expectation is missing for the simplest and most popular models. In layman terms the reason is that we do not understand ""how and why"" fluid motions which are apparently ""smooth and calm"" evolve into ""chaotic and turbulent"" ones. (2) Even if we expect the complete predictability of the models, nonetheless the computations are often so complex that become practically impossible. For this reason scientists have developed statistical descriptions of the motions, which allow to infer their typical behavior without resorting to heavy computations. The rigorous justification of these statistical descriptions from the primary mathematical models describing the motions is still a big challenge of modern science.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with some of the most popular systems of partial differential equations used in the mathematics of fluid dynamics, the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The three main themes of the project are the following. (A) The convergence of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to the Euler equations when the viscosity of the fluid goes to zero. A primary concern is a tenet of the theory of turbulence that the rate of energy dissipation is, for fluid motions of a fixed macroscopic scale, independent of the viscosity. The recent resolution of a well-known conjecture of Lars Onsager on the energy dissipation for low regularity solutions of Euler could pave the way to a mathematical proof of the existence of such anomalous dissipation.  (B) Regularity and singularity of the solutions. One of the celebrated Millennium prize problems asks whether smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations develop singularities in finite time. The Navier-Stokes equations can be ""embedded"" in a one-parameter family of models where the parameter describes the regularizing strength of the viscous term. While some of the known results concerning the Navier-Stokes equations have been extended to the latter family, there is still quite a few which lack a suitable counterpart. (C) Rigidity and flexibility of the isometric embeddings of Riemannian manifolds. The recent resolution of the Onsager conjecture mentioned at point (A) is based on the discovery of the project leader and Laszlo Szekelyhidi Jr. of unexpected connections with a classical problem in Riemannian geometry, solved by John Nash in the fifties. The counterpart of the Onsager conjecture in the geometric framework is however not yet fully solved.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will also seed the development of a community, with particular emphasis on stimulating the growth of young mathematicians via networking, professional development opportunities, and exposure to state of the art scientific content. The scientific program is organized both to foster communication between mathematicians from a class of underrepresented groups and to bridge divides between adjacent subjects in and around the areas of geometry, topology and dynamics. There are strong ties between low-dimensional topology and both symplectic and hyperbolic geometry. These subjects are in turn tied to Teichmueller theory, dynamics, and algebra, and differential geometry and algebraic topology permeate all of these subfields. There are many deep relationships between these different fields, and the conference aims to explore these ties and create new connections.<br/><br/>The conference is devoted to new developments and interactions between low-dimensional topology, geometry, and dynamics. The program spans geometric and algebraic topology, hyperbolic and symplectic geometry, the geometry and topology of surfaces, Teichmueller theory, geometric group theory, and dynamics. Highlights of topics covered include: the relationship between the hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds and the algebra of their fundamental groups; the relationship between 3- and 4-dimensional geometric topology and the algebra of cobordism and concordance; the influence of combinatorial structures such as the complex of curves on the geometry of Teichmueller space; the foundations and geometry of symplectic manifolds; the interaction of algebra, arithmetic, and analysis in dynamics.

The boundary of this space is the plane together with the point at infinity. Most often the trajectory of a collection of symmetries in this space accumulates on a fractal on the plane, the study of which is related to dynamics of flows on the hyperbolic manifold, given by the quotient of the hyperbolic three space by the symmetry group. One beautiful example of such fractals is the Apollonian gasket which is constructed by a theorem proven by the ancient Greek geometer Apollonius. Fractals are abundant in nature as can be seen in the coastlines, ocean waves, Romanesco cauliflowers, etc.  A drop of oil in soy sauce creates a circle packing akin to the Apollonian gasket. This project is expected to be of value in interpreting the structure of fractals arising in nature.<br/><br/>Whereas most of hyperbolic three manifolds have infinite volume, the dynamical rigidity properties of hyperbolic manifolds have been investigated mostly for finite volume cases. The project concerns with dynamics on infinite volume hyperbolic manifolds, which turn out to be quite a rich theory and has several deep and striking applications.

Both of them have close connections with the physical world around us. Harmonic Analysis is an area of Mathematics that focuses in particular on quantitative properties of functions and operators, entities that are fundamental in almost every mathematical model of a real life phenomena. Harmonic Analysis has deep implications to many other areas such as signal processing, photography, computed tomography, etc. Although of a different flavor, the problems we address here have one common feature: trying to understand structure and means of measure it. Partial Differential Equations is a vast area of mathematics that covers almost all mathematical models coming from Physics, from basic Newtonian mechanics to fluid and atmospheric dynamics to particle interactions. The Differential Equations we propose to study in this project are based on such concrete physical models.<br/><br/>Parts of this project focus on the multilinear restriction estimate and applications. This theory brings together ideas and tools from a mix of fields: Analysis, Combinatorics, Incidence Geometry, Differential Geometry, Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Topology. In turn, the multilinear theory has applications to fundamental problems in Harmonic Analysis, PDE's, Combinatorics and Number Theory. Other parts of this project focus on analyzing the long time dynamics of dispersive Partial Differential Equations (PDE's). The equations considered in this project have a physical background: the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system models most of the elementary particles and their interactions, and the Schroedinger Maps equation is the Heisenberg model in ferro-magnetism. From a mathematical point of view, the PI is proposing open problems for which finding solutions is of broad interest in the PDE community.

Invariant geometries arise in many different areas, such as several complex variables, partial differential equations, and algebraic, complex, and differential geometry. This research project investigates a particular geometry that arises in the study of several complex variables and has deep connections with current topics in mathematical physics, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory, as well as applications in, e.g., systems engineering and control theory. The ideas and techniques needed for this study are drawn from a variety of mathematical areas, including complex analysis and geometry, partial differential equations, and differential geometry; at the same time, the tools developed in this project will inform these areas as well.  The project also provides interesting research topics for graduate students and postdocs. <br/><br/>The goal of this mathematics research project is to study geometric, analytic, and algebraic aspects of generic real submanifolds in complex varieties (more generally, of CR structures) and their mappings. The work will investigate the geometric consequences of global vanishing on a compact CR manifold of a higher order local invariant that arises as the obstruction to smooth extension to the boundary of the Cheng-Yau solution to Fefferman's complex Monge-Ampere equation. In three dimensions, this invariant coincides with the trace on the boundary of the log-term in the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel; hence this problem is also connected with a strong form of the Ramadanov Conjecture. The PI will study the existence of CR umbilical points on compact CR 3-manifolds, especially a revised version of a question by Chern-Moser, which asks if such points always exist on bounded strictly pseudoconvex domains in complex 2-space; although the answer is 'no' in general, the question is still open if the domain is diffeomorphic to the ball. The PI will also consider questions regarding existence, uniqueness, and regularity of CR maps, as well as related questions. He will consider the context of CR maps of a Levi nondegenerate hypersurface into a nondegenerate hyperquadric of higher dimension. This study will enhance our understanding of the CR submanifold structure of the hyperquadrics, which constitute the flat models in the theory of Levi nondegenerate hypersurfaces. The work should also provide insight into how the local CR geometry of such hypersurfaces affects various properties, such as notions of nondegeneracy and rigidity, of their CR maps. The PI will also continue study of CR maps between generic submanifolds of infinite type by investigating the prolongation of the system defining CR maps to a singular Pfaffian system on the jet bundle. He will focus on understanding the recently discovered phenomenon that for infinite type hypersurfaces the biholomorphic, formal, and smooth CR equivalence classifications are different. These investigations are expected to shed new light on the nature of CR maps between infinite type manifolds and lead to a better understanding of the Pfaffian systems arising in this context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the one hand, the validity and the relevance of these ideal models are established through the comparison between the results from theoretical analysis and the experimental data. On the other hand, once the meaningfulness of a mathematical model is supported by available experimental observations to certain degree, the theoretical studies on these ideal models can provide properties and predictions of the original problems that are hard to be obtained through experiments. For systems involving the temporal evolution, of particular interests are those structural and asymptotic properties. These include some special structures, such as steady states, periodic and quasi-periodic solutions, chaotic orbits etc, as well as their qualitative properties like stability etc. In general, on the one hand, only stable states are physically observable in a system, while the ideal, but unstable, states are hardly observed due to their extremely sensitive dependence on the parameters. On the other hand, unstable states are also extremely important, partly due to the fact that they and some of their associated structures serve as the boundaries separating different collections of stable states in a system. In this project, the PI plans to focus on the local dynamics near steady states in several classical nonlinear partial differential equation systems, which all belong to the general category of nonlinear waves. The lack of a priori damping and the complicated nonlinearity pose most of the challenges in their mathematical analysis. <br/><br/>The PI plans to rigorously investigate the local dynamics of the incompressible Euler equation as well as a general class of quasi-linear Hamiltonian partial differential equations. In particular, for the incompressible Euler equation, which models inviscid incompressible fluids such as water, the proposed problems include fluids in rigid containers and fluids with free surfaces like ocean waves. Even though there have been extensive studies on these systems and great progresses have been made in recent year, due to their very complex nature, many issues including some very fundamental ones are still not well understood after years of efforts. The PI plans to focus on their local dynamic structures near equilibria, including stability/instability, local invariant manifolds, special solutions, bifurcations, and singular perturbations. While these aspects are standard notions in the theory of smooth dynamical systems, due to the highly nonlinear nature of these partial differential equations, their solution maps often do not have sufficient smoothness in the infinite dimensional phase spaces for the classical theory to apply directly. In contrast to ordinary differential equations, the relationship between the qualitative structures and the regularity analysis of these nonlinear partial differential equations is an essential analytical aspect of nonlinear partial differential equation dynamics. Understanding and solving these problems, expected to be largely based on their specific mechanical and geometric structures, would result in substantial theoretical advances in these areas and possibly lead to the discovery of new physical and mathematical phenomena in the underlying systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We attempt to make progress on these problems by combining different ideas from different subjects of mathematics. The first problem concerns the motion of the free water surface in the presence of a curved bottom topography. As a first step towards understanding the complex dynamics of waves in the ocean, we will consider small perturbations to the flat water surface and analyze how such perturbations propagate over long time periods. The second problem is about the long-time phenomenon associated with the Schrodinger?s equation in a periodic box.  We intend to demonstrate how the fine number theoretic properties of the shape and the size of the box will affect the long-time behavior of Schrodinger waves. The third problem involves the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, which describes many important plasma systems such as the sun. In particular, in the presence of a strong background magnetic field, we will study the formation of Alfven waves in the vanishing viscosity limit. The fourth and last problem is related to the phenomenon of inviscid damping in fluid dynamics, which is unstable and requires some subtle conditions on the fluid. We extend our previous work on this topic, and intend to study when and how inviscid damping may fail, provided that these conditions are violated.<br/><br/>There are specific difficulties in each of the four problems that require a novel approach. In the first problem, the equation involved is a nonlinear dispersive equation with variable coefficients, so the existing methods which have been successful in treating constant coefficient dispersive equations are no longer applicable. Nevertheless, we plan to combine this method, which is based on Fourier space analysis, with appropriate physical space methods to study this problem. In the second problem we are considering Schrodinger?s equation on non-rectangular tori that lack tensor product structure. For this reason we will bring in more advanced techniques from number theory and harmonic analysis, such as the decoupling methods, and counting formulas for solutions to Diophantine systems. The third problem involves a weakly dissipative system which in the vanishing viscosity limit becomes dispersive, and thus we will need to extend the methods that are suitable for dispersive equations to the dissipative context, which on the Fourier side amounts to combining dissipation decay with stationary phase. In the fourth problem, the main challenge is extending the linear analysis in our previous work to infinite time, which requires a combination of Fourier space and physical space techniques (for example, energy estimates with exponential weights both in Fourier and in physical space).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems (""dynamics,"" for short) is the study of motion, and in particular motion that is dictated by an unchanging set of rules, such as the Newtonian forces controlling mechanical motion.  Well-known experimental phenomena in dynamics such as chaotic trajectories combined with stable motion have been observed experimentally but are far from being fully understood from a theoretical perspective. The research will address the theoretical mechanisms behind chaotic motion in broad classes of dynamical systems, which include systems of both a physical and geometric nature.  Based on previous work of the principal investigator and her collaborators, the interplay between a numerical invariant called entropy and chaotic motion will be further understood. On the flip side, the principal investigator proposes several problems connecting entropy and related invariants with a phenomenon called rigidity.  Rigidity occurs when quantitatively small changes to the rules guiding a system force fundamental qualitative changes in the resulting dynamics. Identifying the rigid systems is a first step toward classification of certain peculiar dynamical behaviors observed in physical and geometric systems. An important aspect of the project is to further interaction between mathematical and adjacent scientific communities, such as physics.  The principal investigator has already collaborated in questions surrounding the design of particle accelerators and is currently collaborating with a physicist studying the quantum dynamics behind the emergence of black holes.  Furthermore, the principal investigator has given several public lectures on dynamics and has written in the popular press about the work of mathematicians. She proposes to expand these activities in the coming years.<br/><br/>Dynamics is the study of systems (for example, a state space for a physical process) that evolve over time according to a deterministic set of rules.  Well-studied classes of such dynamical systems include the so-called hyperbolic systems, which display chaotic, unpredictable features at every point, and KAM systems, which have stable regions of regular motion.  The partially hyperbolic systems are a more general class of dynamical systems than the hyperbolic class and include systems that combine hyperbolicity in some directions with KAM behavior in other directions.  Partially hyperbolic systems occur widely in dynamical systems arising in physics; for example, planetary motion usually contains partially hyperbolic sub-dynamics, and the effective construction of particle accelerators (used in biological imaging, as well as theoretical physics) requires a detailed understanding of both KAM and partially hyperbolic dynamics. The principal investigator has a well-developed research plan of over 15 years studying partially hyperbolic systems and is poised to raise the theory of these systems to a new level of generality and applicability.  The impacts of this research will be seen in future applications to systems of a concrete origin, in biology, physics and engineering.  The principal investigator is currently collaborating with the particle accelerator group at Fermilab to explore some of these potential applications. The research supported by this award is guided by the far-reaching goal of developing a general theory of partially hyperbolic systems along the lines of the hyperbolic theory developed in the past 40 years.  In particular the principal investigator proposes to study: ergodic properties of conservative partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms; actions of large collections of diffeomorphisms and embeddings on manifolds; and rigidity phenomena in actions of groups.  A highlight of the proposed research is to investigate the interaction between hyperbolicity and KAM phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What the relation is between the discrete and continuous ""worlds"", how one impacts the other, and what laws they obey are the fundamental questions that the PI intends to investigate. This project focuses on the Hamming cube, the simplest discrete object that consists of binary strings of given length and that can encode any complex information. As the complexity of the information increases, the lengths of the encoded strings increase exponentially. The goal of the project is to develop mathematics on the Hamming cube that would allow us to encode the structures of the continuous world into the discrete world, and vice versa. The new techniques developed could have surprising applications in complexity theory as well as classical and quantum algorithms. Many of these problems are accessible to students and this project aims to continue the PI's work with undergraduate and graduate students in this area.<br/> <br/>This project will consider a series of problems in the Gauss space and, most importantly, in its discrete counterpart, the Hamming cube. Unlike the classical case of the unit circle, many fundamental questions of Fourier analytic type are still open for the Hamming cube due to its unique discrete geometric structure. The first and main direction of the proposal is to resolve Weissler's conjecture, an old open problem in complex hypercontractivity theory on the Boolean cube that gives necessary and sufficient conditions for boundedness of the Hermite operator with complex time. Weissler's conjecture has important implications in several areas of mathematics including combinatorics, computer science, probability, isoperimetry, and approximation theory. The new techniques will be based on developing ""two-point"" inequalities. The second  direction of this research is to develop methods of harmonic analysis to find good estimates on the norms of various linear operators acting on a class of functions on the Hamming cube whose Fourier spectra belong to given prescribed sets. The basic examples include Bernstein-Markov type inequalities and their reverse forms for functions on the Hamming cube that live on the low and high frequencies respectively. The third direction is to understand the universality phenomena of the Gaussian measure. In particular, the goal is to investigate uniqueness of the functional Ehrhard inequality, which is the sharp analog of Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the Gaussian measure. The analysis will be based on Monge-Ampere type partial differential equations and semigroup methods. The fourth direction is to develop the duality between martingale inequalities related to sharp dyadic square function estimates and the problems of isoperimetric type; that is, gradient estimates for functions on the Hamming cube. Our methods will use heat envelopes, ""four-point"" inequalities, and ""inf-sup"" Legendre transform. The fifth direction aims to obtain sharp forms of the classical triangle inequalities in the Lp spaces using the theory of developable surfaces and minimal concave functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the investigated problems are motivated by the need to develop theories in spaces which are not regular (like fractals or rough metric spaces). Some of those problems are motivated by physics, engineering and mathematical finance. The principal investigator will also continue his synergistic activities including blogging, organizing conferences, giving lectures and mini-courses on recent advances, and mentoring graduate students.<br/><br/>A first and most important part of the research activity evolves around the understanding of curvature bounds in spaces for which such notions have so far been elusive.

Ergodic theory studies abstractly what kinds of randomness are possible in such a process, where two processes are regarded as equivalent if either can be obtained by a suitable encoding of the other.  However, many random phenomena of great importance in modern coding theory, statistics, and data science do not arise in the linear fashion that is dictated by the arrow of time in a stationary process.  Rather, they are structured according to a large underlying network, which may itself be highly disordered.  The current project seeks to adapt methods of ergodic theory to this new setting or understand why they fail and then develop replacements.  For models of randomness governed by underlying disordered networks, some of the main issues to be investigated include: (i) whether the broad statistical features scale in a simple way with the size of the network; (ii) whether the random behavior that is visible at a particular node of the network can be estimated easily from the parameters of the model; (iii) how one can determine effectively whether a given model of network randomness can be re-encoded in some simpler form, such as pure independent noise at each node.  All of these issues arise in the theoretical underpinnings of modern research in computer and data science and could serve as a guide towards new discoveries in those fields.  The pursuit of these questions requires background knowledge from diverse parts of probability and pure mathematics, and so the current project includes plans to develop educational materials and train graduate students in a novel but valuable mix of those disciplines.<br/><br/>The project has two more specific aims. The first is the further development of the methods in the principal investigator's recent proof of the weak Pinsker theorem in ergodic theory. This theorem asserts that any stationary ergodic process may be re-encoded, in the sense of measure-theoretic isomorphism, into a nearly deterministic component and a purely random component.  The methods from the proof apply to the joint distribution of a stationary sequence of random variables, deriving a structural description from some basic information-theoretic parameters of a joint distribution.  Such implications are still in their infancy, and the proposed project would explore a range of related parameters and their consequences. The second aim concerns the broad and important class of joint distributions in combinatorics and statistical physics that are constructed over locally tree-like graphs. These models provide examples of measure-preserving actions of free groups, and conversely methods from free-group ergodic theory help to describe their asymptotic behavior. The physics literature predicts novel and consequential phenomena such as shattering and condensation, but only a few special cases have been established rigorously. The project will explore these phenomena using notions and methods from ergodic theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to achieve this, one needs to understand that, in most systems, the full knowledge of the particle's position and velocity, and even that of the law are not exact. This uncertainty can be modeled by the introduction of some randomness. As a particle moves after a unit of time, the new place is only known up to a random error. In this project this type of systems are studied and the aim is to show that the long run behavior of particles is governed by some distribution in the face space, which has nice geometric and even algebraic properties, thus introducing a purely mathematical and very powerful technology into the study of an otherwise intricate problem. Another important feature of this research is the classification problem. Finding invariants for a system helps its classification and a full set of invariants will give a full classification of the system. This set of invariants will depend a priori on the roughness one wants to classify the system. For chaotic systems it is not uncommon to expect that a set of invariants that is a priori very rough can lead to a finer classification automatically. This project will take advantage of this phenomenon and give some rigidity results.<br/><br/>The geometry of invariant measures for systems displaying some hyperbolicity goes a long way when trying to describe its dynamics. In this project, the PI intends to deepen the knowledge of dynamical systems through the understanding of invariant measures with some nice geometric properties, how to make them appear and when to expect some uniqueness phenomena for them. This uniqueness comes attached with some uniform properties especially on information of equidistribution of orbits and nice statistical properties of the system. When this study gets in connection with the analysis of geometric objects or the actions by groups of larger rank, one often expects nice rigidity properties to show up. The principal investigator intends to develop this philosophy in several different frameworks, but in all cases some hyperbolicity will show up one way or another, sometimes from an intrinsic dynamical property, sometimes it will show up from the group acting, or from the randomness in the case of random dynamics. In all cases the principal investigator attempts to have a description of the relevant invariant measures and use this description to classify the dynamical systems or to get information of the geometry/topology of the support of the measure or to get strong statistical properties of the system. In some cases all these can be achieved.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, von Neumann is often credited with formulating the foundations of operator theory as a language for quantum mechanics, while Nobert Wiener initiated an approach to engineering prediction problems (such as jet tracking) based on ideas from operator theory and harmonic analysis.  In more recent decades, operator theory has been used in H-infinity control theory which has applications in automatic pilot design.  On the other hand, a stable polynomial is not a field per se but a basic concept in mathematics that has become profoundly useful in the study of a diverse range of problems in mathematics: combinatorics (enumeration problems), graph theory (the study of networks), and operator theory.  The purpose of this project is to use operator theory to study stable polynomials and vice versa.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on three problems: (1) the generalized Lax conjecture, (2) a quantitative understanding of linear preservers of stability, and (3) extensions of the theory of stable polynomials to entire functions.  Semi-definite programming is a powerful technique in optimization and the generalized Lax conjecture is a bold assertion about the sets on which this theory can successfully be implemented.  The conjecture claims that these feasibility sets have a geometric description in terms of hyperbolic polynomials (a slight generalization of the concept of a stable polynomial).  Although evidently important in optimization, this would further establish links between stable polynomials and operator theory as the question is closely related to the concept of representing stable polynomials via operator theoretic determinantal representations.  Problem (2) is about taking the highly successful theorems of Borcea-Branden that characterized the linear maps on stable polynomials that preserve stability and making them quantitative.  How exactly do stability preservers modify zero sets?  One approach to this problem is through analyzing how stability preservers affect various sums-of-squares formulas for stable polynomials.  Problem (3) is about a natural extension of stable polynomials to various classes of entire functions (the Polya class, Hermite-Biehler class) and would require developing multivariable theories of Hilbert spaces of entire functions.  This latter endeavor is important in its own right as the successes in one variable Hilbert spaces of entire functions have been profound (i.e. the Poltoratski approach to problems of uncertainty type).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We understand why matter is extended on the basis of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We are able to explain why certain materials change their quality when the temperature is lowered, as for example, when water turns to ice. There are, however, many phenomena that are not understood in a rigorous way.  It is an everyday experience that physical systems tend towards equilibrium:  Hot coffee cools by giving up energy to the environment until the temperatures are the same. Symmetry can be broken; for instance matter that appears to be homogeneous at high temperature tends to loose its homogeneity, that is, it forms clumps when cooled down.  Physical systems try to achieve a state of lowest energy.  Central questions are how to describe this state and how the system makes the transition.  How does hot coffee approach an equilibrium with its environment by cooling down?  How can matter lower its energy by transitioning to a less homogeneous shape? Another example, maybe less obvious, is a heat-conducting rod with one end held at a high temperature and the other at low temperature. This system is not in equilibrium but in a steady state; heat keeps flowing from hot to cold.  Although a very old problem, there is no satisfactory mathematically-rigorous microscopic explanation for this observation.  The aim of this proposal is to study these questions in specific mathematical and physical models.  Some of these are large physical systems with many interacting agents.  Others are, from a superficial perspective, quite simple, such as a single charged particle in a magnet.  Finding answers to these questions requires new mathematical insights.  An important feature of the project is to exploit the interaction of physical insight and mathematical techniques.  This interdisciplinary quality makes it an ideal training ground for students at all levels.<br/><br/>The project interweaves several strands of mathematical physics: non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through classical and quantum mechanical master equations, variational problems involving magnetic fields and more general vector fields as well as charged systems interacting with a classical radiation field.  The investigation has variational inequalities as a common theme.  One endeavor is to carry over recent robust advances concerning approach to equilibrium to other problems, both in the classical and quantum mechanical realm.  Likewise, the gap for Kac type master equations for realistic models is now within reach.  The Kac master equation is ideal for approximating thermostats by finite reservoirs.  The PI will investigate the properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) for a system of two thermostats at different temperatures.  The next step is to study the approximation of such systems by finite reservoirs, in particular determining the various time scales over which these approximations hold.  A wide open area is the calculus of variations involving vector fields.  This project will investigate a class of conformally invariant inequalities that includes the computation of the sharp constants.  The goal is to use these insights to shed some light on systems with magnetic fields where the wave function is complex.  A different but closely related problem is the analysis of the Maxwell-Pauli-Coulomb equations for supercritical charges.

It studies the long run behavior of a system subject to laws of motion. The study of rigidity phenomenon is one of the central themes in dynamical systems, with applications to number theory, geometry, and mathematical physics. Roughly speaking, an action is rigid if various properties of the system are preserved under appropriate modifications. So far, systems with strong chaotic properties have been well understood. In many systems of interest however, only weak chaotic behaviors can be observed. The goal of this project is to develop new tools to study such systems and then apply these results to study other areas of mathematics, such as number theory and representation theory. The research plan is complemented by educational and outreach activities involving the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates, and fostering collaborations among female researchers in different areas.<br/><br/>The proposed research plan consists of several coherent projects, ranging from dynamical systems, harmonic analysis for Lie groups, representation theory and number theory. The principal investigator plans to establish cocycle rigidity and to study (twisted) cohomological equations for a large class of algebraic partially hyperbolic and parabolic actions by using representation theory. The results and techniques from the study of parabolic actions will be applied to number theory for the study of effective equidistribution for certain unipotent flows and maps on some homogenous spaces of semidirect product groups.

Recently, these operators have found application in big data analysis. The classical theory was built by Alberto Calderon and Antoni Zygmund in the early 1950s, and was intrinsically designed to work on smooth objects. However, nature often puzzles us with very irregular medium. Thus, the need arose for a very low regularity Calderon-Zygmund theory, which the three PIs have, in fact, constructed. One possible application of such low regularity theory is that by the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a space of a very high dimension, we can conclude that the set itself is nicely structured and can be analyzed. This is a typical big data problem. Our other recent observation is that well-studied problems for such an operator can be dualized to provide new information for analysis on the hypercube - another widely used model of big data.<br/><br/><br/>This project will consider the following problems, presented here in their simplest by formulation: 1) Sharp end-point weak weighted estimates for the square function operator in the homogeneous setting; 2) What goes wrong in the non-homogeneous case; 3) Matrix A_2 problems for Calderon--Zygmund operators, the square function operator, their sparse operators analogies and their sharp estimates; 4) How to get from end-point estimates of the square function to geometric inequalities on the hypercube and in Gaussian space; 5) The David-Semmes problem for co-dimension higher than one; 6) Harmonic measure estimates on sets of co-dimension bigger than one; and 7) Estimates from below of singular Riesz transforms by positive geometric quantities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These methods, in addition to their intrinsic interest, provide new connections between discrete and continuous mathematics, as well as between theoretical and applied questions.<br/>This expands the range of tools available in all these areas, and facilitates more substantial interactions between disparate groups of mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists. The concrete, geometric, and practical aspects of these problems also make them appealing to students and can form the basis of student research projects. For example, what is the optimal way to decompose a 2 or 3 dimensional region as a union of triangles or tetrahedra? Doing this quickly (e.g., in polynomial time)  with good control of the shapes of the mesh elements  (e.g., no angles too large or too small) is a fundamental first step in most numerical modeling methods, and a good  initial mesh leads to faster, more accurate solutions. Nevertheless, many meshing algorithms used in practice (essentially all used in  three dimensions) are based on heuristics rather than rigorously justified methods. The PI's earlier work on meshing in 2 dimensions is based on exploiting ideas from conformal geometry and dynamics, and uses the PI's  earlier work on optimal algorithms for computing conformal mappings. The PI plans  to continue his work in 2 dimensions to find the optimal meshing algorithms and to seek analogous approaches in 3 dimensions. Conformal maps send one planar region to another in a way that preserves angles. Such maps have been studied for almost two hundred years and are fundamental to many areas including complex analysis, dynamics, fluid flow and probability. The connection with probability arises most strongly through Brownian motion,  the mathematical model of continuous random motion.  Conformal maps send Brownian paths to Brownian paths, and this `conformal invariance' allows probabilistic arguments to be applied in complex analysis and allows complex analysis to be used to study Brownian motion. The  project considers  another well known, but difficult to understand, random process related to conformal maps: diffusion limited aggregation (DLA for short). In DLA  particles wander at random in space until they make contact with a fixed cluster of particles and stick to it. As time progresses the cluster grows and takes a characteristic fractal shape, at least in numerical simulations; very little is known rigorously about the geometry of the resulting random clusters. Based on numerical simulations, the project considers new conjectures on DLA that may be more tractable. The above problems seek to use classical analysis to understand problems that are discrete in nature. Another aspect of the project is to use discrete ideas to attack  problems in continuous analysis. The PI previously introduced a new method, called quasiconformal folding, for constructing holomorphic maps that that emphasizes the discrete and combinatorial structure of holomorphic function. Using this method, the PI and other investigators have constructed examples that answered a number of open problems, including several in the field of holomorphic dynamics. This is the study of stable versus chaotic behavior when a function is  iterated, e.g.,   the Julia set of a map is a fractal set where the sequence of iterates acts chaotically. Determining the possible geometries  of this set is a fundamental problem, and the PI will work on specific conjectures  the case of general holomorphic functions defined on the whole complex plane.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The project consists of problems grouped into five main categories, but all dealing with the interaction of discrete combinatorial structures (usually trees or triangulations) with continuous problems related to complex analysis and conformal geometry (Riemann surfaces, holomorphic dynamics, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, computational geometry and statistical physics). The first part deals  with conformal structures induced by trees and graphs. Grothendieck's theory of ""dessins d'enfants"" shows that a finite graph on a compact topological surface induces a conformal structure on that surface, e.g., makes it into a Riemann surface. Several problems in the  project  seek to understand this connection precisely, e.g., given a finite tree in the plane, what does the tree ""look like"" in the induced conformal structure?  A related problem is to build a Riemann surface by identifying edges of equilateral triangles. It is known that not every compact surface occurs in this way (only countably many can occur), but the PI conjectures that every non-compact surface does occur in this way (joint work with Lasse Rempe-Gillen). The second group of problems deals with transcendental dynamics, i.e., the iteration theory of non-polynomial entire functions. Quasiconformal folding is a method of building entire functions, starting from an infinite planar tree, that gives very good control of the geometry of the function and locations of its critical values. The PI seeks to apply QC folding to various problems, such as the possible Hausdorff and packing dimension of transcendental Julia sets, and the behavior of these dimensions under perturbations of the function. The third part of the  project is to expand on recent work of the PI and Claude LeBrun that constructed examples 4-manifolds where the almost-Kahler structures form a non-empty,  proper open subset in the moduli space of ant-self-dual metric; such examples were not previously known to exist. The proof works by reducing to questions about harmonic measure on certain (very complicated)  hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Can simpler 3-manifolds be used? Are the ""exotic"" examples constructed actually ""common"" in some sense? The fourth part deals with optimal meshing problems in 2 and 3 dimensions. The PI recently proved that any planar domain bounded by a PSLG (planar straight line graph) can be meshed by non-obtuse triangles (maximum angle 90 degrees)  in polynomial time, but the optimal power remains open. The proof uses  a discrete closing lemma for certain flows associated to any triangulation and  perhaps ideas from surface dynamics might help close the gap. The proof uses several estimates from planar geometry, and it would be a very interesting and important to extend the results to triangulated surfaces, a stepping stone to the  important problem of meshing 3-dimension regions by non-obtuse tetrahedra. A key idea in the planar case is to decompose the region into pieces where either Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry is used to generate a mesh.  Can a similar strategy be used in three dimensions, perhaps using the wider variety of fundamental geometries that occur in three dimensions? Finally, the PI will consider diffusion limited aggregation (DLA), a widely studied random growth model.  The basic problem is to determine the almost sure growth rate of the cluster; there is no non-trivial lower bound and no  improvement of Kesten's 1987 upper bound.  The PI plans break the growth rate problem into two sub-problems: estimating upper bounds for the number of vertices on the convex hull boundary of DLA, and turning these into non-trivial lower bounds for the growth rate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory was initiated by Francis J. Murray and John von Neumann in the 1930s, and since then researchers have discovered a vast number of applications to mathematics as well as biology, physics, and engineering. In particular, one of the modern fields that studies von Neumann algebras is free probability, wherein one views the theory of von Neumann algebras as a generalization of probability theory. This perspective yields connections to random matrix theory, allows one to model the statistical behavior of large-scale data sets, and notably has been used to understand the fundamental limits of wireless communications. Furthermore, connections with the mathematical disciplines of complex analysis, dynamical systems, group theory, and harmonic analysis arise from the study of derivations on von Neumann algebras, which are analogues of the derivative in Leibniz and Newton's theory of calculus. The so-called ""non-tracial"" von Neumann algebras admit additional connections to physics: they have an inherit dynamical system that satisfies the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition from quantum statistical mechanics; and they arise naturally in conformal field theory. This project is part of the principal investigator's research efforts to better understand non-tracial von Neumann algebras through the use of free probability and an analysis of derivations.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study the structure of non-tracial (type III) von Neumann algebras through three approaches, which are interconnected via free probabilistic distributions and derivations. The first approach concerns derivations on a von Neumann algebra, which lie within the scope of two major methodologies: Voiculescu's free probability theory, and Popa's deformation/rigidity theory. The former through free Fisher information and non-microstates free entropy, and the latter through deformations arising from the completely positive semigroups associated to closable derivations. The principal investigator seeks to show that derivations on non-tracial von Neumann algebras give rise to completely positive semigroups, and then use free probability and deformation/rigidity to extract structural information in the spirit of Peterson as well as Dabrowski and Ioana. The second approach concerns non-microstates regularity conditions on finite generating sets of von Neumann algebras equipped with non-tracial states, which can be regarded as non-commutative probability distributions and therefore analyzed with free probability. The principal investigator has shown that when these generators have finite free Fisher information and are well-behaved under the modular automorphism group associated to the state, then the von Neumann algebra they generate is a full factor. In recent work with Charlesworth on free Stein information, the principal investigator has found a weaker regularity condition than having finite free Fisher information that is more easily adapted to the non-tracial case. He will explore the structural consequences of this regularity condition for non-tracial von Neumann algebras, and attempt to adapt other existing regularity conditions to the non-tracial case. The third approach concerns random matrix models for non-tracial von Neumann algebras. In the tracial case, understanding the connection between the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) and the free group factors has benefited random matrix theory by providing a clear picture of the large N limit, and has benefited free probability theory by providing finite dimensional approximations and informing the definition of microstates free entropy. The principal investigator has found a non-tracial version of the Dyson-Schwinger equation, which is a non-commutative PDE that (in the tracial case) makes explicit the connection between the GUE and the free group factors. A non-tracial Dyson-Schwinger equation gives rise to a free Araki-Woods factor, which were defined by Shlyakhtenko as the non-tracial analogue of the free group factors. The principal investigator aims to use non-tracial Dyson-Schwinger equations to develop random matrix models for free Araki-Woods factors, and more generally to develop microstates free entropy for non-tracial von Neumann algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A dynamical system is a function from a space to itself.  Points in the space represent possible states of the phenomenon and the function describes how the states evolve over time.  Even relatively simple dynamical systems can exhibit very complicated long-term behaviors.  Properties of the dynamical systems are often reflected in the shapes of associated mathematical sets.  The principal investigator will investigate the shapes of dynamically defined sets that arise in three different contexts: (1) self-maps of intervals; (2) holomorphic dynamics, and (3) neural networks.  In addition to advances in the theory of dynamical systems and geometry, results could lead to new techniques in computer graphics or machine learning.  <br/><br/>The three main goals of this project are to: (1) establish topological and geometrical properties of Thurston sets for various families of dynamical systems; (2) characterize the shapes of Julia sets of polynomials in one and several complex variables; (3) describe how network architecture constrains the decision regions of neural networks.  The Thurston set for the family of superattracting unimodular self-maps of an interval is the closure of the set of all Galois conjugates of the exponentials of the topological entropies of all such maps.  Plots of this set reveal that it has a rich and mysterious geometric structure.  In previous work, the principal investigator characterized which subsets of the complex plane are approximable (in a strong sense) by Julia sets of polynomials.  No analogous characterization of the possible global shapes of basins of attraction of infinity for polynomials in several complex variables is known, and the principal investigator will work to extend her techniques to this setting.

Solitary waves travel large distances while maintaining their original shape.  This is exceptional and represents a subtle interaction between two phenomena: (1) Dispersion, which results in longer waves traveling faster (e.g. tsunami travel much faster than the wind waves seen at the beach). (2) Nonlinearity, which makes large amplitude waves travel faster than shorter waves (this effect also manifests in waves traveling faster in deeper water).  These two effects are important in many wave systems and controlling their interactions plays an important role also in technology, such as fibre-optic communication.  The Korteweg--de Vries equation and its close relations provide a simple elegant framework both for deepening our understanding of these effects and also for educating future scientists, at all levels of preparation, about these important topics.<br/><br/>The study of both invariant measures for dispersive PDE and stochastic forcing raise challenging questions in the low-regularity theory of dispersive PDE.

A key goal in selecting the progression of problems to be studied is to investigate how robust these methods are against perturbations that destroy this complete integrability.

Parabolic equations are evolution equations?the unknown function, or the solution, depends on one or several spatial variables and one more distinguished variable playing the role of time. Such equations are widely used in models in applied sciences. Given an initial state of the system, the main goal is to describe its future states. Mathematically, this translates to questions about a possible development of singularities in the solutions, and, in the absence of such singularities, about the behavior of the solutions as time increases to infinity. One asks if the solution approaches in some way a time-independent steady state or if it may exhibit a more complicated behavior. Elliptic equations on Euclidean spaces represent steady states (equilibria), solitary waves, traveling fronts, or self-similar solutions of many different types of evolution PDEs.  Naturally, therefore, analysis of elliptic equations is one of the key basic steps toward understanding of the dynamics of these evolution equations.  The project?s problems in elliptic equations concern qualitative properties, such as symmetry, periodicity, and more complex oscillatory behavior of individual solutions, as well as the global structure of the solutions, such as their multiplicity and bifurcations (changes as parameters in the equation vary).   Qualitative analysis of solutions to be carried out in this project is important for the internal development of the mathematical theory of PDEs as well as for improvement of their modeling relevance.  Although the project is mainly theorical, its results concerning fundamental properties of solutions could be of interest in research fields beyond PDEs. For example, even with high computing power currently available for numerical analysis, computations involving nonlinear PDEs are often formidable without a guideline from qualitative analysis. Also, when a specific PDE model from applied science is to be investigated, general qualitative results on possible behavior of solutions of equations of the given type provide a valuable information.   This project contains component projects and activities for graduate students, and the award provides graduate student research assistantship and summer support, and support for student participation at conferences.<br/><br/>The research in this project will develop along several main topics. In certain elliptic equations on the entire space, one of the problems concerns solutions which decay to zero in all but one variable. Employing techniques from the center manifold and KAM theories, the PI wants to examine the existence of solutions which are quasiperiodic in the non-decay variable. Another class of elliptic equations to be considered arises as an equation for self-similar solutions of the semilinear heat equation.  The PI will study the multiplicity of the solutions and their bifurcations from a singular solution as the exponent in the power nonlinearity varies. For parabolic equations on the real line, the PI will continue his research on quasiconvergence properties of solutions with respect to a localized topology. For multidimensional semilinear parabolic equations on the entire space, one of the basic questions to be addressed is whether in high enough spatial dimensions, the solutions may exhibit some sort of oscillatory behavior while staying away from steady states on any sufficiently large bounded region. Two other problems deal with Liouville-type and classification theorems for entire solutions (that is, solutions defined for all times, positive and negative) of nonlinear parabolic equations. In one of them, the goal is to prove the nonexistence of positive entire solutions for an optimal Sobolev-subcritical range of exponents.

They are crucial to other scientific fields, such as engineering, biology and economics. For example, the mathematical modeling of any phenomenon that undergoes change over time (such as the population of bacteria in a body, the stock market, etc.) can be viewed as a dynamical system. Similarly, geometry is the basis for many current industrial applications such as 3D printing. This research project will enhance the tools available in the aforementioned branches of mathematics. The development of geometry goes back to the ancient Greeks, who laid down axioms, or basic assumptions, from which all other reasonable properties could be logically deduced. The main focus of this project is a detailed study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean Axiom, attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer valid. The resulting mathematics turns out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of the usual, Archimedean, kind.<br/><br/>This mathematics research project will employ methods from non-Archimedean analysis and geometry in order to study a range of problems in analysis, dynamics and geometry. The principal investigator will work with Berkovich spaces, non-Archimedean analogues of real and complex manifolds. Among many specific projects, one involves a detailed study of the space of metrics on an ample line bundle on a compact complex manifold. Geodesic rays inside this space can be studied using non-Archimedean means. The principal investigator will also continue his work with Boucksom on the Kontsevich-Soibelman conjecture that originally arose in the study of mirror symmetry. In analysis and dynamics, the principal investigator will try to use non-Archimedean techniques to construct invariant currents for quite general two-dimensional complex dynamical systems and study the growth of arithmetic complexity along orbits of certain arithmetic dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the central notions of  the research is amenability, which relates to an averaging operation that is invariant under translation by group elements. It naturally appears in many fields of mathematics: operator algebras, functional analysis, ergodic theory, probability theory, harmonic analysis. Amenability has many  applications and considerable effort has been given throughout the years to showing that various  groups are amenable.  <br/> <br/>The PI will study a newly developed property of group actions: Liouville property.  The property can be used to prove non-amenability due to the fact that if a group admits a non-Liouville action, then the group is not amenable. The PI have already developed tools for verifying Liouville property for graphs of the actions. These tools brought a connection of Liouville property of actions for strongly transitive groups and additive combinatorics. The project describes several questions on Liouville actions with streamlined approaches, as well as more ambitious problems and conjectures. In particular, the PI outlines an approach to non-amenability of Thompson group F, which is a widely open problem in the group theory. The PI provides an approach to amenability of interval exchange transformation groups.  The actions of these are Liouville, moreover, they are completely Liouville. Thus, amenability of these groups can not be approached using Liouville property. For this reason, the PI will study a property of random walk of action: growth of inverted orbits. Using this property there is a potential to determine amenability of the interval exchange transformation group. On the other hand the study of this property property leads to a more general theory that is planned to be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The questions are often formulated as follows: does there exist a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives?  Attempts to address this type of questions have played a fundamental role in the development of modern mathematics. In 1760 Joseph-Louis Lagrange asked whether there exists a surface with minimal area and prescribed boundary. This problem known as the Plateau problem was named after the physicist Joseph Plateau whose experiments with soap films yield a similar mathematical problem. The existence and regularity of such surfaces are part of Geometric Measure Theory (GMT). More generally, GMT combines methods of mathematical analysis with concepts from differential geometry, to develop the appropriate setting for studying critical phenomena in Partial Differential Equations and in the Calculus of Variations, often arising from optimization questions. Recent developments in the field forecast an imminent boom. It is the PIs' objective to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity they are uniquely positioned to take advantage of. Fulfillment of their scientific goals will yield to developments that will shape the field for years to come. The vertically integrated structure of the PIs' teams ensures that this project will have a considerable impact in human resources. One of the PIs' main goals is to educate the next generation of researchers in Geometric Measure Theory.<br/><br/>Pioneered in the work of Besicovitch in the thirties, the subject boomed in the fifties and sixties with the work on the multidimensional Plateau problem by De Giorgi, Federer, Fleming, Reifenberg and Almgren. The ideas developed in that extremely creative period have deeply influenced the further development of the theory of Partial Differential Equations and of the Calculus of Variations, with noticeable effects in Geometric Analysis and Mathematical General Relativity, and Harmonic Analysis and Potential Theory. The current project focuses on three major challenges in GMT, all of which are poised to have a significant impact in other areas of analysis. The PIs and their associates are expected to lead the efforts to address these problems. The challenges investigated in this project are: <br/>- Understanding singular sets of minimal surfaces and free boundaries;<br/>- Developing regularity and rigidity theorems for degenerate elliptic or non-smooth surface energies;<br/>- Quantifying local-to-global geometric rigidity results.<br/>These problems share common traits of: (i) they exemplify the most interesting open questions in the area; (ii) they have been the subject of striking recent developments, which increase the chances of their successful study; (iii) their resolution promises to have relevant impacts outside of GMT; (iv) requiring a broad approach which is encompassed by the expertise of the three PIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed problems concern the regularity (smoothness properties) of solutions. Key challenges that these problems share are that ellipticity (an agent of regularity) degenerates, and that solutions can be vector-valued.  Overcoming these challenges will not only require significant new mathematical ideas, but could also help us better predict weather patterns and assist in the design of cars. The results will be communicated by publication in peer-reviewed journals, and through the writing of expository notes that the PI intends to make publicly available and will be useful to researchers and students alike.<br/><br/>The first project tackles regularity questions for the real Monge-Ampere equation, motivated by applications to meteorology and differential geometry. The PI will investigate singularity formation for the semi-geostrophic system, which models large scale atmospheric flows. Certain examples of irregular stationary solutions in a half-plane may be useful models for blowup at boundary points. The second project concerns local regularity for the complex Monge-Ampere equation, which arises in complex geometry. Difficulties include the non-convexity of solutions, and invariance under adding certain quadratic polynomials.  The PI has initiated the study of a model equation that captures these difficulties. The third project concerns non-concave uniformly elliptic equations. A challenging problem is to construct singular solutions in low dimensions. An obstruction is that in 3d, linear equations with rough coefficients have no nontrivial one-homogeneous solutions; the PI will instead consider solutions with ""spiraling"" one-homogenous symmetry. The fourth project concerns minimizers of variational integrals with convex integrand. A conjecture is that scalar-valued minimizers have the same regularity as the Legendre transform of the integrand. The PI proposes to confirm this when the degeneracy set of the integrand satisfies certain geometric conditions, and to construct a counterexample when these conditions aren't met. The last project aims to answer classical regularity and stability questions for parabolic systems, especially in low dimensions. The PI recently constructed examples of singular solutions to linear parabolic systems in the plane, answering a long-standing question. This may open the way to tackling related problems, e.g. to identify conditions on coefficients that prevent singularities in the linear case, and to determine regularity vs. singularity for nonlinear structures of porous medium type.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since then it has evolved in many directions, with applications not only in physics (such as the currently very active areas of quantum computing and quantum information theory), but also in electrical and mechanical engineering (where its ideas find application in e.g. the design of control systems, or in signal and image processing). A particularly new and exciting branch of this field is known as ""noncommutative function theory,"" which has its origins in the study of certain kinds of optimization problems in engineering. It has now taken on a life of its own. The area of ""multivariable operator theory"" is multi-faceted but is closely connected with many questions arising in these applications (such as the study of quantum channels, and the theory of ""linear matrix inequalities"" in optimization). This project is aimed at expanding the array of mathematical tools available for the study of these problems. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study the connection between operator theory and function theory in several variables, by analogy with the very successful one-variable theory, particularly in the rapidly developing area of ""noncommutative function theory."" The role of analytic function theory in the one-variable setting is very well established; e.g. a central role is played by the Cauchy transform in the unitary/circle setting or the Borel transform in the selfadjoint/real line setting. Noncommutative functions, or nc-functions for short, are meant to play a role analogous to analytic functions in the classical one-variable theory. They arise, for example, as noncommutative Cauchy transforms of ""noncommutative"" measures, viewed as states on a C*-algebra or related objects (such as an operator system). Problems to be studied include invariant subspaces for noncommutative operator tuples, in particular an nc-function theoretic analysis of ""nc-inner"" functions, and the development of a version of ""noncommutative measure theory"" suitable to the desired applications, in particular a version of the Lebesgue decomposition suited to the analysis, for example, of noncommutative analogs of the Cauchy transform. The project will draw on techniques from several currently active areas of mathematical analysis, with the aim of broadening and deepening understanding of the interplay between function theory, operator theory, and operator algebras.

Recently, these operators have found application in big data analysis. The classical theory was built by Alberto Calderon and Antoni Zygmund in the early 1950s, and was intrinsically designed to work on smooth objects. However, nature often puzzles us with very irregular medium. Thus, the need arose for a very low regularity Calderon-Zygmund theory, which the three PIs have, in fact, constructed. One possible application of such low regularity theory is that by the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a space of a very high dimension, we can conclude that the set itself is nicely structured and can be analyzed. This is a typical big data problem. Our other recent observation is that well-studied problems for such an operator can be dualized to provide new information for analysis on the hypercube - another widely used model of big data.<br/><br/><br/>This project will consider the following problems, presented here in their simplest by formulation: 1) Sharp end-point weak weighted estimates for the square function operator in the homogeneous setting; 2) What goes wrong in the non-homogeneous case; 3) Matrix A_2 problems for Calderon--Zygmund operators, the square function operator, their sparse operators analogies and their sharp estimates; 4) How to get from end-point estimates of the square function to geometric inequalities on the hypercube and in Gaussian space; 5) The David-Semmes problem for co-dimension higher than one; 6) Harmonic measure estimates on sets of co-dimension bigger than one; and 7) Estimates from below of singular Riesz transforms by positive geometric quantities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study was initiated by von-Neumann in the 30s, motivated by mathematics related to quantum mechanics, and originates from single operator theory and complex analysis. These days, operator algebras are successfully used to provide novel perspectives for classical mathematical theories and to lay the foundations for physical theories. The main overarching goal of this project is to create and expand upon existing interaction between the seemingly separate theories of ""irreversible"" and ""reversible"" operator algebras. Such interactions have led to substantial breakthroughs in the field, with impact to the aforementioned areas of mathematics and physics.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project aims to bring together techniques from non-self-adjoint operator algebras, Arveson's non-commutative boundary theory and C*-algebras to bear on semigroup and group theories, dilation theory, non-commutative dynamical systems and classification of representations of C*-algebras up to unitary equivalence. The project has three main goals. The first goal, inspired by work of Kalantar and Kennedy, is to find characterizations of nuclearity, simplicity and other C*-algebraic properties of boundary quotient C*-algebras of semigroups using Hamana's injective envelope theory. The second goal is to import ideas of Exel on graded and coaction C*-algebras to extend work of the PI with Katsoulis on characterizations of the C*-envelope in the context of product systems to the non-abelian case. The third goal is to continue the investigation initiated by Davidson, B. Li and the PI where non-self-adjoint operator algebras are used to distinguish representations of C*-algebras associated to directed graphs. Progress on the above-mentioned goals will enhance the two-way interaction between the reversible and irreversible theories and will lead to new approaches for resolving several open problems in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory of homogenization, whose goal is to describe the macroscopic properties of microscopically inhomogeneous or heterogeneous materials, shows that such strongly inhomogeneous material, whose characteristics change sharply with respect to space variables, may be approximately described via a homogenized or effective homogeneous material. As a result, the theory of homogenization of partial differential equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients has many important applications in physics, mechanics, and materials science. The long-term goal of this project is to establish optimal quantitative results in the homogenization theory for a large class of partial differential equations in various settings, arising in applications. The proposed research focuses on several challenging problems in the area and will develop new approaches and techniques. The results will provide theoretical foundation and guidance for numerical simulations in strongly inhomogeneous materials.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator proposes to continue his ongoing research program on quantitative homogenization of partial differential equations. The main focus of this project will be on large-scale geometric and regularity properties and convergence rates for second-order elliptic and parabolic equations. More specifically, the problems to be investigated include (1) large-scale geometric properties of elliptic equations with periodic coefficients; (2) quantitative homogenization of parabolic systems with time-dependent periodic coefficients; (3) quantitative homogenization of quasi-linear elliptic equations; (4) homogenization of boundary value problems in non-smooth domains; and (5) large-scale regularity estimates in perforated domains.

Murray and J. von Neumann as a mathematical tool to understand particle physics. Subsequently, it became an independent discipline that has stimulated the development of powerful mathematical theories and bringing valuable insight to physics (statistical mechanics), biology (DNA structure), and engineering (cell phone network design). Von Neumann algebras are highly interdisciplinary in nature as they arise canonically from simpler mathematical structures, such as symmetries and actions, often present in many areas of mathematics. Over time their study remained closely connected with various topics in dynamical systems, measured group theory, and more recently geometric group theory. This project investigates several major open problems inspired by the rich interaction between operator algebras and the aforementioned fields.<br/><br/>This research project explores new horizons in the classification of group von Neumann algebras. The first objective of the project is to advance Connes' rigidity conjecture, a major wide-open problem predicting that ICC property (T) groups are completely recognizable from their von Neumann algebras (W*-superrigid). The PIs proposed several natural constructions of W*-superrigid property (T) groups based on new developments in geometric group theory and deformation/rigidity theory. The second objective of the project revolves around the study of prime II1 factors. The main focus is to understand the relationship between various manifestations of negative curvature in group theory and primeness aspects of the corresponding group factor. The results arising from this project are expected to reveal significant cross-pollination between, geometric group theory, ergodic theory, random walks, C*-algebras, and von Neumann algebras. The PIs intend to organize a series of workshops aimed at stimulating collaboration between experts in these fields.

The Analysis of PDE is an area of Mathematics that is central to the development of Natural Sciences. Indeed, PDE are used in the modeling of many phenomena, like the atomic properties of matter, the dynamics of celestial bodies, the mechanics of fluids and gases (used for example in weather forecast), and the study of electromagnetic phenomena (fundamental to modern communications).  This variety of applications is reflected in the complexity of a field rich in open problems and fruitful research directions. The training of graduate and undergraduate students in Analysis is thus crucial to the scientific and economic competitiveness of the US, and so is any effort to attract students to the area. At the same time, leading students to achieve a view of the subject that is not merely technical and overly specialized, but also succeeds in emphasizing the versatility and depth of the field, requires the coordinated work of a group.<br/><br/>The five co-PIs (Israel, Maggi, Patrizi, Pavlovic, Vasseur), together with the larger group of PDE experts at UT Austin (including Beckner, Caffarelli, Chen, Gamba and Ren), are strongly committed to research training, with a combined research activity that covers a vast area of interconnected topics in PDE, and has received international recognition. This project will include 5 postdoctoral fellowships and 20 annual graduate fellowships, thus increasing the number of US citizens trained in the Analysis of PDE at UT Austin; and a comprehensive series of actions aimed at increasing the visibility of our activities among undergraduate students, both internally and externally to UT Austin, and with particular emphasis on students from universities in Central Texas serving large minority populations. The educational activities of the group (seminars, courses, informal lectures, reading courses, etc.) will be carefully revisited and enhanced, to expose trainees to new ideas, and to multiply the opportunities for mentoring, teaching, professional development, and interactions at all levels. An annual Summer Program and a professionally designed and maintained website will increase the national visibility of our program and help dispersing its most successful practices. The ultimate expected outcome is creating positive lasting changes in the research training culture at our department and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, these operators have found application in big data analysis. The classical theory was built by Alberto Calderon and Antoni Zygmund in the early 1950s, and was intrinsically designed to work on smooth objects. However, nature often puzzles us with very irregular medium. Thus, the need arose for a very low regularity Calderon-Zygmund theory, which the three PIs have, in fact, constructed. One possible application of such low regularity theory is that by the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a space of a very high dimension, we can conclude that the set itself is nicely structured and can be analyzed. This is a typical big data problem. Our other recent observation is that well-studied problems for such an operator can be dualized to provide new information for analysis on the hypercube - another widely used model of big data.<br/><br/>This project will consider the following problems, presented here in their simplest by formulation: 1) Sharp end-point weak weighted estimates for the square function operator in the homogeneous setting; 2) What goes wrong in the non-homogeneous case; 3) Matrix A_2 problems for Calderon--Zygmund operators, the square function operator, their sparse operators analogies and their sharp estimates; 4) How to get from end-point estimates of the square function to geometric inequalities on the hypercube and in Gaussian space; 5) The David-Semmes problem for co-dimension higher than one; 6) Harmonic measure estimates on sets of co-dimension bigger than one; and 7) Estimates from below of singular Riesz transforms by positive geometric quantities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The purpose of this project is to improve the mathematical and scientific understanding of those equations via (i) concrete research projects aimed at studying the long-time behavior of solutions to such equations, and (ii) an educational component aimed at introducing such problems to a new and diverse generation of mathematicians. A primary focus of the principal investigator will be the analysis of the two-dimensional water wave equations, which govern the evolution of a free fluid surface, or of the interface between two fluids. The goal is to provide a better description of both the local dynamics (e.g. low regularity solutions and formation of singularities) and of global dynamics in fluid flows. Here, by singularities in free boundary problems, the principal investigator means evolutions where the interface loses smoothness, possibly forming a corner-like singularity followed by ""wave breaking''.  Such a behavior is exhibited in many physically important phenomena, like turbulence in ocean waves, tsunami formation, just to mention a few. While this wave breaking is easy to observe and has very strong manifestations in nature, its scientific understanding is rather poor, and the mathematical justification of the phenomena based on the constitutive equations is rather difficult and is fully open at this time. This project aims to tackle a selection of key open problems related to singularity formation and to long-time properties of solutions to several classes of dispersive and hyperbolic equations that arise from a physical or geometric context, largely motivated by fluid dynamics. The project includes an educational component aimed at raising the interest of a younger generation of researchers in those fundamental problems through workshops, seminars, REU projects, etc.<br/><br/>One of the main goals of the project is to understand the long-time behavior of solutions of the water waves. This includes lifespan estimates as well as global in time dynamics and scattering properties, where possible.  From this perspective there are two key properties that play a role: one is the ""dispersive decay'', and the other is the ``resonance analysis''.  Some of the key tools developed by the PI and collaborators (the ""quasilinear modified energy method'', and the ""testing with wave packets method'') will contribute to a better understanding of the proposed problems, but nevertheless, improvements of the existing methods and the need to develop new and robust techniques remain essential in order to describe, for instance, the singularity formation mechanism. The quasilinear nature of these equations plays a crucial role in the difficulty associated with the analysis of the long- time behavior and properties of the solutions. Water waves and related models are effective equations for the ocean dynamics that are derived in the physics literature from heuristic considerations and have very important implications on the long-time behavior of dispersive partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most famous applications is what nowadays called Newhouse phenomenon - existence of open sets of smooth diffeomorphisms of a two-dimensional surface with persistent homoclinic tangencies.  The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of general questions on sums/intersections of Cantor sets and Newhouse phenomena for conservative and dissipative dynamical systems, and also to go back to the original problems (e.g. from celestial mechanics), as well as to consider some new models (e.g. from spectral theory), where these results can be applied.  Mentoring students is an essential part of the project.  Numerous problems closely related to the proposed project will be suggested to graduate and undergraduate students initiating and increasing their involvement into scientific activities and research.<br/><br/>More specifically, the PI plans to study Newhouse phenomena in the three body problems (such as Sitnikov problem, circular restricted three body problem, and collinear restricted three body problem, as well as in non-restricted versions), and to apply the results on conservative homoclinic bifurcations to the questions on dynamics near infinity.  In particular, he intends to study the set of oscillatory motions in these models, and at the same time to show that the set of stable motions that start in some given bounded domain can be unbounded.  Also, the structure of spectra of Schrodinger operators on two-dimensional lattice with separable potentials (in particular, Square Fibonacci Hamiltonian both in discrete and continuous version) will be studied.

Such representations of signals are heavily used in today's technology for storage, transmission, and noise reduction of signals. Unfortunately, harmonic analytic methods perform poorly in various circumstances, as they are designed based on the assumption that the outcome of a series of actions is unchanged, regardless of the order in which the actions are performed. However, actions are often not interchangeable. For example, the result of performing consecutive rotations in three-dimensional (3D) space is highly sensitive to the order of rotations. Indeed, the real world is a very ""non-commutative"" universe. The space of 3D rotations is a simple example of a Lie group, which arise naturally in physics. This project will use techniques of functional analysis and Lie theory to advance the theory of non-commutative harmonic analysis for Lie groups. <br/><br/>Fourier transforms and its analogues are the cornerstone of classical harmonic analysis. To generalize the concept of a Fourier transform to non-Abelian groups, the modern field of non-commutative harmonic analysis was initiated.  The broad philosophy here is to employ group representations and the theory of operators on Hilbert spaces to capture the non-Abelian nature of a group. A major trend in non-commutative harmonic analysis is to investigate function algebras related to the Fourier analysis (and representation theory) of non-Abelian groups. The Fourier algebra, which is associated with the regular representation of the ambient group, is a fundamental example of such function algebras. This project investigates Banach algebraic behavior, in particular derivation theory and spectral theory, of the Fourier algebra and its weighted versions for various classes of locally compact (Lie) groups. The ultimate goal is to investigate the connections between the Lie structure of a group and the Banach algebraic properties of its Fourier algebra.

In addition to possessing fascinating physical properties, black holes play an essential role in our modern understanding of astrophysics. For example, it is expected that any object undergoing gravitational collapse eventually settles down to a black hole, and also, it is thought that black holes serve to shield us from potentially dangerous gravitational singularities. However, both of these expectations, so fundamental to our view of the universe, lack a definitive mathematical understanding. This project aims to advance our understanding of both the problems of black hole stability and the potential existence of ""naked singularities"", singular solutions which are not hidden away behind a black hole.<br/><br/>In the last decade there has been a tremendous progress in establishing stability results for model equations on general black hole backgrounds.

Each such moduli space can be thought of as a universe of all possible shapes that a surface can take. Just as the laws of gravity prescribe the orbits of the planets and stars of our universe, a different set of laws, called the GL+(2,R) action, prescribe orbits of surfaces in these universes of all possible surfaces. The first part of this project aims to obtain classification results for these orbits. Such classification results would provide a table of possible behaviors, and would give deep information about the surfaces themselves. This information could be used in more concrete mathematical and physical applications involving dynamics and polygonal shapes. The second part of this project aims to give insight into the mapping class group, which encodes all ways of wrapping a surface onto itself, as well as four dimensional shapes called surface bundles. Aspects of this research provide an ideal training ground for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and connect to the principal investigator's ongoing efforts to further popularize Maryam Mirzakhani's inspiring work in this area. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PI proposes to engage in research at the intersection of Teichmueller theory and dynamics, in two related programs. The first program concerns GL+(2,R) orbit closures of quadratic and Abelian differentials, also known as (half) translation surfaces. The principal investigator proposes to classify orbit closures that have large rank, by employing recent theorems concerning cylinder deformations and degenerations developed by the principal investigator and his coauthors, as well as the seminal results of Eskin-Mirzakhani-Mohammadi. In the second program, the principal investigator proposes to investigate convex cocompact surface subgroups of the mapping class group, employing dynamical and geometric results concerning the Teichmueller geodesic flow. The existence of such surface subgroups is known to be equivalent to the existence of surface bundles over surface with Gromov hyperbolic fundamental group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference will bring together many internationally leading researchers in ergodic theory and dynamical systems and will have a special focus on recent developments in the application of thermodynamic formalism to dynamics. Up to 20 US mathematicians will be supported by this grant and will learn of recent progress and novel techniques in modern dynamical systems theory. In addition to the formal lectures there will be plenty of time for discussions to foster new collaborations and maximize interactions between participants.   The interactions with international colleagues will lead to collaborations and new research directions which will benefit US researchers, their PhD students and their home institutions.<br/><br/>Ideas from statistical mechanics in the guise of thermodynamic formalism were introduced into the study of dynamical systems by Sinai and Ruelle in the late 1960s. The notions of pressure, equilibrium states and entropy among others were successfully applied to classify and study the statistical and geometric properties of hyperbolic dynamical systems. This conference will continue this theme and focus on several topics that are very active and fruitful, including: studying statistical properties using transfer operators and anisotropic Banach spaces; the structure and properties of Gibbs measures; moduli spaces, flows and applications to number theory; fractal geometry and dimension theory.

These are anomalies in the behavior of a physical quantity where the mathematical expressions that are used to measure such quantities break down. It may be related to the understanding of black holes or turbulence to the accumulation of cancer cells. These physical phenomena are often described via a differential equation which involves time and space.  Studying the qualitative behavior of the solutions of such equations often results in a better understanding of the related physical problem. To capture a singularity one uses a blow up procedure which allows one to focus near the potential singularity and use the scaling properties of the differential equation involved.  Because of the change in the scaling of space and time, the new solution after the blow up is defined for all space and time -- in other words it is a ""global solution"".  The classification of such solutions, when possible, sheds new insight into the singularity analysis and the related physical problem.<br/><br/>This project addresses the questions of existence, uniqueness and qualitative behavior of global solutions to nonlinear geometric elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. Emphasis is given to the classification of ancient solutions and the study of singularities. The interplay between analytical and geometric techniques will be crucial for the resolution of the proposed research activities. The project links a wide range of active fields of mathematics, in particular nonlinear partial differential equations, geometry and classical analysis. The PI intends to study the applications of the mathematical problems to other disciplines such as quantum field theory and image processing. Results will be disseminated to the research community at various meetings and by publication of research articles.  Special emphasis will be given to the training of PhD students and the encouragement of minorities and women to pursue a successful career in mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The other is to use dynamical systems tools to tackle problems that arise in the biological sciences. There are two specific topics in this research. One concerns the timeliness of the response to epidemic outbreaks; the problem is cast in the framework of infinite dimensional dynamical systems defined by delay differential equations.

Murray and J. von Neumann as a mathematical tool to understand particle physics. Subsequently, it became an independent discipline that has stimulated the development of powerful mathematical theories and bringing valuable insight to physics (statistical mechanics), biology (DNA structure), and engineering (cell phone network design). Von Neumann algebras are highly interdisciplinary in nature as they arise canonically from simpler mathematical structures, such as symmetries and actions, often present in many areas of mathematics. Over time their study remained closely connected with various topics in dynamical systems, measured group theory, and more recently geometric group theory. This project investigates several major open problems inspired by the rich interaction between operator algebras and the aforementioned fields.<br/><br/>This research project explores new horizons in the classification of group von Neumann algebras. The first objective of the project is to advance Connes' rigidity conjecture, a major wide-open problem predicting that ICC property (T) groups are completely recognizable from their von Neumann algebras (W*-superrigid). The PIs proposed several natural constructions of W*-superrigid property (T) groups based on new developments in geometric group theory and deformation/rigidity theory. The second objective of the project revolves around the study of prime II1 factors. The main focus is to understand the relationship between various manifestations of negative curvature in group theory and primeness aspects of the corresponding group factor. The results arising from this project are expected to reveal significant cross-pollination between, geometric group theory, ergodic theory, random walks, C*-algebras, and von Neumann algebras. The PIs intend to organize a series of workshops aimed at stimulating collaboration between experts in these fields. To promote the career development of graduate students the proposal also involves a student exchange program between the participating institutions aimed at exposing students to different expertise and research environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of particular interest are decompositions into sums of the simple sine and cosine functions.  For functions defined over an interval, or in higher dimensions over a cube, such decompositions are a classical area of study. This project considers functions defined over more complicated sets, and studies the existence of similar decompositions in such settings. The ability to approximate or decompose functions in such a way provides a strong tool for research, which can be applied in various settings. Several applications of this theory will be studied throughout this project. As part of this project, the PI will develop, organize and teach in a new program titled ""Honors level Program in Analysis for Students in the Atlanta Area"". This three-year program, for promising undergraduate students, is expected to increase both the motivation and the potential of its participants to be admitted to leading graduate programs. <br/><br/>It is well known that most measurable sets do not admit an orthogonal basis of exponentials, or of trigonometric functions. Therefore, to use harmonic analysis machinery over such sets, the rigid structure of an orthonormal basis needs to be replaced by the more flexible structure of a Riesz basis, or if this is impossible, by relaxed versions of it such as frames and Riesz sequences. In this project, the PI will continue her study (with collaborators) of such problems. For example, she will analyze questions regarding the existence of Riesz bases of exponentials, and problems related to systems with universal properties. Further, the PI will apply this theory to mathematical problems in several different settings, including sampling and interpolation of band limited signals, extensions and refinements of certain uncertainty principles, and the behavior of Gaussian noise over long intervals of time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harmonic analysis plays an important role not only in pure mathematics but also in applied math, engineering, physics, and other sciences. The key idea of harmonic analysis is to represent complicated functions as sums of simple functions. Recently, a few new methods in harmonic analysis were developed and as a result, some long-standing open problems in mathematics were solved. It is desirable to get a deeper understanding of these tools and apply them in other settings.<br/><br/>By combining the polynomial partitioning method of Guth and decoupling theory of Bourgain-Demeter, the principal investigator (together with Guth and Li) proved a sharp Schrodinger maximal estimate, which is a special case of weighted Fourier extension estimates. As an application, this solved the almost everywhere convergence problem of Schrodinger solutions in dimension two, which was raised by Carleson about 40 years ago. The main novelty in this work is the derivation of linear and bilinear refined Strichartz estimates using decoupling and induction on scales. In other recent work together with Zhang, the principal investigator obtained fractal L^2 estimates, which resolved Carleson's problem in higher dimensions and provided new results on Falconer's distance set problem, spherical average Fourier decay rates of fractal measures, bounding the size of divergence set of Schrodinger solutions, etc. The goal of this project is to make progress towards fully understanding fractal L^p estimates by exploiting ideas from the work mentioned above as well as developing new tools in a more general setting.

The main goal of the project is to discover new underlying principles and general methods to understand the properties of solutions of the PDEs under investigation. A key object of the research is a crystal growth model, in which the crystal grows in both horizontal direction by adatoms, and in vertical direction by nucleation in a supersaturated media. To make practical use of the model, it is extremely important to understand deeply the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the growth speed of the crystal. An integral part of the project is the educational component including bringing up the number of graduate PDE students at University of Wisconsin-Madison through various activities. The incoming graduate students interested in PDE are encouraged to participate in the principal investigator's PDE reading seminar, and to interact more with their peers and postdocs in the area. In term of undergraduate training, the principal investigator plans to increase the interest of University of Wisconsin-Madison undergraduate mathematics majors in the study of Analysis and PDE through some individual mentoring plans, and two undergraduate summer schools. Besides, the principal investigator plans to organize two conferences in nonlinear PDE and related topics for early career researchers.<br/><br/>The proposed research involves two themes.

An underlying common thread is supersymmetry, which appeared in physics a while ago.  However, its importance in areas of geometry and analysis such as the theory of super Riemann surfaces, supermoduli space, and the theory of non-linear partial differential equations, has only recently been more fully appreciated, and our understanding is still very incomplete.  Supersymmetry results in certain cohomological constraints.  The partial differential equations which can implement these constraints are of considerable interest in their own right from the point of view of analysis.  They pose many new challenges which should be very valuable for the future development of the theory.  It has not been uncommon in the past for the same partial differential equation, if it is highly constrained by either geometry or physics, to emerge from very different applications of mathematics.  We can expect the same from these new equations, and progress on them to be of wide value.  The research project also brings together ideas and techniques from several areas of mathematics and physics, and it should provide an excellent training ground for students and young postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>More specifically, the cohomological constraints arising from supersymmetry are generalizations of, but may be markedly different from, the Kahler condition of Hermitian metrics. As such, they lead on one side to non-Kahler geometry, and on the other side, to partial differential equations which can be much more complicated than the complex Monge-Ampere equation or the Kahler-Ricci flow.  New difficulties arise from the facts that the equations are systems, or they may involve higher powers of the curvature tensor, or the dependence of their long-time behavior on the initial data may be more delicate.  A major goal of this project is to develop a general theory for such equations, beginning with Anomaly flows.

Another goal is the development of a hybrid cohomology which can help extract holomorphic scattering amplitudes from non-holomorphic projections from supermoduli space to moduli space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The questions are often formulated as follows: does there exist a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives?  Attempts to address this type of questions have played a fundamental role in the development of modern mathematics. In 1760 Joseph-Louis Lagrange asked whether there exists a surface with minimal area and prescribed boundary. This problem known as the Plateau problem was named after the physicist Joseph Plateau whose experiments with soap films yield a similar mathematical problem. The existence and regularity of such surfaces are part of Geometric Measure Theory (GMT). More generally, GMT combines methods of mathematical analysis with concepts from differential geometry, to develop the appropriate setting for studying critical phenomena in Partial Differential Equations and in the Calculus of Variations, often arising from optimization questions. Recent developments in the field forecast an imminent boom. It is the PIs' objective to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity they are uniquely positioned to take advantage of. Fulfillment of their scientific goals will yield to developments that will shape the field for years to come. The vertically integrated structure of the PIs' teams ensures that this project will have a considerable impact in human resources. One of the PIs' main goals is to educate the next generation of researchers in Geometric Measure Theory.<br/><br/>Pioneered in the work of Besicovitch in the thirties, the subject boomed in the fifties and sixties with the work on the multidimensional Plateau problem by De Giorgi, Federer, Fleming, Reifenberg and Almgren. The ideas developed in that extremely creative period have deeply influenced the further development of the theory of Partial Differential Equations and of the Calculus of Variations, with noticeable effects in Geometric Analysis and Mathematical General Relativity, and Harmonic Analysis and Potential Theory. The current project focuses on three major challenges in GMT, all of which are poised to have a significant impact in other areas of analysis. The PIs and their associates are expected to lead the efforts to address these problems. The challenges investigated in this project are: <br/>- Understanding singular sets of minimal surfaces and free boundaries;<br/>- Developing regularity and rigidity theorems for degenerate elliptic or non-smooth surface energies;<br/>- Quantifying local-to-global geometric rigidity results.<br/>These problems share common traits of: (i) they exemplify the most interesting open questions in the area; (ii) they have been the subject of striking recent developments, which increase the chances of their successful study; (iii) their resolution promises to have relevant impacts outside of GMT; (iv) requiring a broad approach which is encompassed by the expertise of the three PIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The transformations in question include several versions of the Hilbert transform on the integers in dimension one and on the lattice in several dimensions. These basic transformations were introduced by David Hilbert at the beginning of the 20th century as simpler models of their continuous counterparts. For many applications, discrete models are much simpler from the point of view of computations. One of the goals of the project is to show that the magnitudes of the discrete transformations, as measured by certain summability properties of the sequences they transform, coincide with those of their continuous counterparts. Related geometric problems concerning the long time behavior of Brownian motion and more general stochastic processes under certain natural constrains, will be studied as well.<br/><br/>The project deals with several problems and conjectures for sharp inequalities which lie at the interface of probability, harmonic analysis and spectral, potential theoretic, and geometric properties of the Laplacian and the fractional Laplacian. A problem of significant interest in the early part of the 20th century was the question of how the size of a periodic function controls the size of its conjugate, where the size is measured by the Lebesgue Lp-norm, where p is strictly between 1 and infinity. In 1925, M. Riesz answered this question in his celebrated paper on the Lp boundedness of the Hilbert transform and showed that this implies the same for the discrete version acting on the space of doubly infinite sequences in little lp. Shortly thereafter, E.C. Titchmarsh gave a direct proof of the boundedness of the discrete Hilbert transform and showed that the norms of these two operators are equal. The following year Titchmarsh pointed out that his argument for equality was incorrect. The question of equality had been a long-standing open problem since 1927. In a recent publication, M. Kwasnicki and the PI solved this problem by identifying the sharp lp bound for the discrete Hilbert transform which turns out to be the same as the sharp Lp bound found for the continuous version found by Pichorides in the early 70's. The first part of this project discusses closely related problems for discrete operators in one and several dimensions. The second part of the project addresses questions of sharp inequalities, known as stability (or deficit) inequalities, for exit times of Brownian motion and symmetric stable processes from subsets of finite volume in Euclidean spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, for a particular instance of data, a Banach space provides a way to rigorously quantify various characteristics of that data. At a second level of abstraction, studying the structure of the whole space consisting of all possible instances of data has been crucial to the solution of certain problems, such as the prediction of the future behavior of the system being modeled. For this project, the spaces under consideration come from both signal processing (which deals with the problem of storing information about an object by considering it as a sum of simpler ones) and Quantum Information Science (which studies a mathematical framework for communications where one can encode information not as a string of 0s and 1s as today's computers do, but rather in the state of a quantum-mechanical system). The PI seeks to advance the knowledge of some spaces coming from the two aforementioned practical settings -- as well as related analytical considerations -- via fundamental research, including research conducted by undergraduate students under the PI's supervision. In addition, through his outreach and mentoring of postdocs, the PI will contribute to growing and diversifying the group of students and researchers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The project is divided into three parts. The first is inspired by an uncertainty principle in time-frequency analysis, which is related to Sobolev-style inequalities and spaces associated to finite graphs endowed with an extra ""magnetic"" structure. The name comes from the fact that the presence of a magnetic potential in some quantum-mechanical models of bonds between atoms is modeled not just with a graph, but also with an additional assignment of a complex number of modulus one to each edge of the graph. The second part of the project seeks to generalize the theory of frames, i.e. overcomplete bases, from the Hilbert space setting to the general Banach space one, where we no longer enjoy the advantages of having a large group of symmetries. Significant work has already been done in this direction, but mostly in the infinite-dimensional setting, and the PI will continue developing the nascent theory of frames on finite-dimensional Banach spaces. The third part is focused on quantum graphs, which are linear spaces of complex-valued matrices that come from Quantum Information Theory and can be considered as generalizations of classical combinatorial graphs. The PI will investigate quantum versions of a variety of classical results in graph theory, particularly those related to the aforementioned Sobolev-style inequalities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simple algebraic transformations already  exhibit many of the features of these natural phenomena, such as phase transitions and tipping points that signal the onset of new regimes. These universal patterns may be revealed through the rigorous study of  moduli spaces, their compactifications and their stratifications  by dynamical invariants.  This project appeals to a broad range of mathematical disciplines to both deepen our understanding of dynamical systems and to sharpen our mathematical and computational methods.  Its methods have already led to the discover of new and unexpected algebraic regimes, through a combination of theoretical tools that narrow the domain of search, and experimental methods such as the simulation of bouncing molecules in idealized chambers.<br/>A central issue in science, from biology to mathematics, is the study and classification of the wide variations that can take place in a single recognized species.   The moduli spaces  constructed by Ahlfors, Bers and Mumford in the 1960s, give this kind of classification for compact Riemann surfaces with a fixed genus g and number of marked points n. Today the study of moduli spaces is the meeting ground for disciplines ranging from arithmetic geometry to string theory. In dimension three, Riemann surfaces are replaced by hyperbolic 3-manifolds. This project aims to expand the frontiers of our understanding of both moduli spaces and hyerbolic 3-manifolds from the perspective of dynamical systems, unified by the action of SL2(R) in both regimes. It draws on methods ranging from complex analysis to low--dimensional topology and renormalization. The concerted study of specific examples, assisted by computer visualization and algebraic manipulation, also plays  a central role of in this research.<br/><br/><br/>The PI and his coworkers have recently discovered new totally geodesic curves and surfaces in the moduli spaces for (g,n) = (4,0), (1,3), (1,4) and (2,1). Their methods also reproduce most previously known examples of these rare and beautiful objects.  A central goal of this project is to put forth a unified construction of all known examples, and investigate the prospects for obtaining a complete classification. The project will also address problems concerning totally geodesic planes in open hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the complexity of closed loops on surfaces, the arithmetic underlying billiards in polygons, moduli spaces of rational maps, and connection between twisted 1-forms and 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. The training of graduate students to become active and independent researchers forms a central part of this project. The field of complex dynamics and moduli spaces is one where concrete  problems and examples abound, and yet some of the deepest insights and methods of modern mathematics can be brought to bear. It invites the participation of experts from a broad range of fields.

The focus is on the existence of eigenvalues or singular continuous spectra embedded into essential spectra of Laplacians on asymptotically flat and on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, as characterized by the radial curvature.

The advantage of a geometric approach, is that first order differential calculus and geometric measure theory can be extended from the classical Euclidean or Riemannian settings to the realm of spaces without a priori smooth structure (such as fractal spaces). Results and techniques in geometric function theory have recently found important applications in geometric group theory, structure of manifolds and analysis on fractals. Furthermore, besides their mathematical importance, physical applications of these theories include reconstruction theory, study of thin films, control theory, graphic imaging and analysis of large data sets.<br/><br/>This project features new approaches to three long-standing problems in the realm of geometric function theory that bring together several fields in analysis and geometry including geometric topology, sub-Riemannian geometry, PL geometry and geometric measure theory.

The principal investigator proposes to relate forms of discrete curvature with global parametrizations in high dimensions. The second problem asks for conditions for which an embedding of a set into a Euclidean space with some desired properties (e.g. quasisymmetric, bi-Lipschitz) can be extended to the whole Euclidean space with the same properties.

Ergodic theory focuses on the statistical behavior of dynamical systems. Applications of ergodic theory are widespread: from traffic modeling to aerospace engineering and population dynamics. It is natural and of practical importance to generalize the role of time in a dynamical system to more complicated groups of symmetries. This generalized notion of dynamics leads to applications in statistical physics, number theory and geometry. However, new tools are needed especially in the particular case when the group of symmetries is non-amenable which means that boundary phenomena are too significant to be safely ignored. Non-amenable groups naturally arise in many parts of mathematics such as geometry and number theory. This project is concerned with developing the tools needed to analyze the statistical behavior of non-amenable group actions by generalizing ergodic theory to this context. <br/><br/>The research goals of this project are: 1) Continue developing sofic entropy theory, which is a vast generalization of Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy to actions of sofic groups, a class of groups that contains all amenable groups and residually finite groups. One ambitious goal is to classify the mixing Markov chains over free groups using asymptotic geometric invariants of associated model spaces. 2) Classify sofic approximations of low-dimensional groups (using geometric techniques), with an eye towards using the results to construct the first known non-sofic groups from amalgams of low-dimensional groups. 3) Explore the limits of pointwise ergodic theorems for geometrically defined groups (e.g. Lie groups, CAT(0) cubulated groups, relatively hyperbolic groups) via the measured-equivalence techniques developed by the principal investigator and Nevo and the ideas behind the recent L^1-counterexample of Tao. Also develop new multiplicative ergodic theorems for cocycles taking values in tracial von Neumann algebras. 4) Import tools from geometric group theory into the study of measured equivalence relations (MERs) through the use of metric bundles in place of actions, graphings in place of Cayley graphs and so on.

Reactive processes (e.g., forest fires) frequently occur in a patchwork of different environments (trees, brush, grass), through which the process propagates at different rates.  The theory of homogenization aims to better understand how the dynamics of the process over large scales (long distances and times) depends on smaller scale variations in the environment.  The main goal of this part of the project is to demonstrate that thanks to averaging over large regions, the long term behavior of the process can be predicted with a large degree of confidence without the need for overly detailed information about the composition of the environment.  Mixing via fluid motion is crucial in the production of materials such as alloys, as well as in enhancement of processes such as chemical reactions.  Quantifying mixing efficiency of flows and identifying those that stand out in this respect is therefore of great importance.  The PI recently constructed universal mixers, flows that are particularly efficient in mixing.  These have a relatively simple structure but may be too irregular for practical applications.  The main goal of this part of the project is to identify more regular universal mixers, as well as to study how such fast mixing affects diffusive processes (e.g., heat transport).  Even without considering its effects on mixing of substances, our understanding of the motion of fluids is still far from satisfactory.  The study of onset of turbulence and the associated creation of small scale structures in fluids is important in mathematics as well as in physics and engineering, and while it has seen great progress in recent years, many fundamental questions remain unresolved.  In this part of the project, the PI proposes to study how fast the development of turbulent structures in fluids can be and how severe this turbulence can become, both in the bulk of the fluid and in the vicinity of regular as well as irregular boundaries (walls of the fluid container).<br/><br/>Physical processes such as combustion, mixing, and fluid turbulence, whose study motivates this project, are modeled by linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, including reaction-diffusion equations, transport equations, drift-diffusion equations, and equations of fluid dynamics.  The primary focus of this project, which consists of three parts, is the study of long term dynamics of the solutions of these equations as well as their possible formation of singularities in finite time.  The aim of the first part of the project is the understanding of large scale behavior of reactive processes spreading through heterogeneous media, including obtaining a satisfactory homogenization theory for these models in multi-dimensional random media.  The aim of the second part of the project is the study of mixing efficiency of flows and the search for sufficiently regular universal mixers, flows that are highly efficient in mixing of substances advected by them regardless of the initial configuration of the latter.  Enhancement of diffusion in drift-diffusion equations via flow-induced mixing will also be studied.  The aim of the third part of the project is the study of turbulence in two-dimensional Euler and related equations of fluid dynamics, including rapid growth of gradients of solutions in the bulk of the fluid and possible formation of finite time singularities in more singular models.  The question of well-posedness of Euler equations in planar domains with irregular boundaries will also be addressed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program includes three workshops and sets of masterclasses (expository lectures given by leaders in the field), and will give junior scientists, at a critical career stage, a chance to participate in a workshop and masterclass in their research area. The workshops are ""The complex analysis toolbox: new techniques and perspectives"", from September 9 to 13, 2019; ""Complex analysis in mathematical physics and applications"", from October 28 to November 1, 2019; and ""Computational complex analysis"", from December 9 to 13, 2019. Complex variable and analytic function theory play an elemental role in a diverse array of applications and areas of mathematics. The classical work carried out over decades in traditional fields is now providing the foundations and inspiration for new and rapid growth in many exciting new directions. The INI program will advance the field by bringing together key researchers working at the frontiers of these new developments and will help steer future endeavors by identifying the most important scientific challenges arising from the new techniques, methodologies and insights. The program will also focus on elucidating the unexpected connections between different branches of complex analysis that have been emerging over the past few years. To this end, the program will encompass mathematicians as well as physicists and engineers working on theoretical aspects, computational methods, mathematical modeling and applications.<br/><br/>The award will be aimed at supporting participation in the workshops and secondarily the broader program. The main impact will be the training and career development of junior researchers.

For instance, the information we seek may be the temperature at the core of a tree (the wood underneath the bark). Or, say, the temperature of soil located deep down underground. In both examples, performing direct measurements would require disrupting the object of study (drilling the tree; drilling the ground) which is expensive and disruptive.  Instead, with the mathematics-based methods developed in this project it is enough to measure temperature on the tree's bark, or on the earth's surface (and neither requires drilling). Then one plots the easily-collected data into an integral (the ""big sister"" of the integrals studied in calculus) and the output of this integral will be the temperature at the core of the tree (or temperature of the soil deep underground). The part of mathematics that deals with these problems is called ""harmonic analysis"" and ""singular integrals""; the methods employed are called ""integral representation formulas."" These methods work even for e.g., trees that have very rough bark (""fractal-like"") as opposed to smooth bark (""integral formulas for non-smooth domains"").<br/><br/>This project brings together techniques and problems from different parts of the general field of analysis, with primary emphasis on complex function theory in one and several complex variables, and on real harmonic analysis on Euclidean space. One of the main goals is to develop a theory of Cauchy-like singular integrals with holomorphic kernel and for non-smooth domains in n-dimensional complex Euclidean space that successfully blends the complex structure of the ambient domain with the Calderon-Zygmund theory for singular integrals on non-smooth domains in 2n-dimensional real space. Stripping away the smoothness assumptions brings to the fore the geometric interplay between the operators and the domains on which they act: recent advances by Lanzani and her collaborators have set the ground for pushing this theory well below the C2-category and for bringing it on par with the real analysis techniques that were developed over the past thirty years in Geometric Measure Theory, Partial Differential Equations and Quasiconformal mapping. A novel component builds upon recent work by the principal investigator and her collaborator M. Pramanik and seeks to investigate the aforementioned holomorphic singular integral operators by exploring suitable symmetrized forms of their Schwartz kernels.

The stability of such inequalities is a property that describes behavior of almost-equilibrium states.  The topic of stability has generated substantial interest in recent years, due in large part to its exciting applications to physical models.  This project analyzes the stability properties of certain functional and geometric inequalities, and applies them as a tool to address problems across various mathematical fields and with diverse applications in physics and materials science.<br/><br/>Given an inequality for which all equality cases are characterized, the question of stability is the following: suppose a function (or set) almost achieves equality in the inequality. Then is it close, in a suitable sense, to an equality case? In this project, stability estimates will be employed in varied contexts, including the study of regularity properties for limit spaces of Riemannian manifolds with lower bounds on scalar curvature, regularity in spectral shape optimization problems, and properties of energy minimizers in the liquid drop model for atomic nuclei.

When coupled with measurements on the interface separating the region where these phenomena take place from the rest of the space, one arrives at what is commonly called a boundary value problem for the phenomenon in question. One of the most powerful techniques employed in the treatment of such boundary value problems is the method of layer potentials. This has had tremendous success both at theoretical and numerical levels for second order operators such as phenomena involving gravitational forces, heat at equilibrium, phenomena involving elastic deformations, acoustic and electromagnetic scattering, and wave propagation.  By way of contrast, considerable less is presently understood for phenomena involving higher-order systems such as beam bending, plate vibrations and elastic plate deflections. The overall goal of this project is to address this issue by developing a systematic treatment of higher-order elliptic boundary value problems using singular integral operators, in a very general class of non-smooth domains. The emphasis on non-smooth structures is crucial for the viability of the theory for practical applications as physical domains exhibit asperities and irregularities of a very intricate nature. In turn, these significantly affect the properties of solutions of the partial differential equation problems. The successful completion of this project is expected to have significant impact in theoretical and applied mathematics, numerical methods, mathematical physics, and engineering, by establishing a theoretical framework which is just as effective as the traditional technologies dealing with simpler models.<br/><br/>The project is for research in the areas of Harmonic Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory and Partial Differential Equations, and its overall aim is to develop a systematic treatment of higher-order elliptic boundary value problems using singular integral operators, in a very general class of non-smooth domains, which is in the nature of best possible from the geometric measure theoretic  point of view. The main objectives of the current project are to identify: (1) the fullest family of multi-layer potential operators associated with a given homogeneous constant coefficient higher-order elliptic system; (2) geometric measure theoretic settings for which boundary multi-layer potential operators of double and single type are bounded on appropriate spaces of Whitney arrays (function spaces on the boundary suitably adapted to the higher-order setting); and (3) algebraic and geometric measure theoretic settings for which boundary multi-layer potential operators are invertible on appropriate spaces of Whitney arrays. The tools are rooted in Harmonic Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory, Partial Differential Equations, and Functional Analysis. A key step is to develop a new generation of Calderon-Zygmund theory for multi-layers acting on Whitney arrays, starting with the case when the domain is merely of locally finite perimeter and then progressively strengthening the hypotheses by ultimately assuming that the domain is uniformly rectifiable. There are inherent difficulties in carrying out this program, such as lack of uniqueness of Green?s formula, algebraic difficulties, the necessity of developing a suitable function space theory (including trace, extension, and interpolation theory) for function spaces of Whitney arrays in uniformly rectifiable domains, the failure in the non-Lipschitz context of a number of key ingredients in the theory of singular integrals on Lipschitz domains such as Rellich-type estimates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Classically symmetries of a physical system are described by algebraic objects known as groups, which act on the observables of the system. In quantum systems, however, the observables are described by noncommutative operator algebras (C* and von Neumann algebras). In this setting a new kind of symmetry emerges. The algebraic objects that naturally arise are called tensor categories, and have proved to be very successful at describing symmetries of low dimensional quantum field theories, topological phases of matter, and quantum statistical mechanics. The goal of this project is to apply the theory of tensor categories to understand the relationship between noncommutative operator algebras, as well as exploring the role of tensor categories in low dimensional quantum systems.<br/><br/>This project focuses on three main problems. The first is to use tensor categories to classify and construct discrete inclusions of von Neumann algebras building on recent progress in this area, furthering the work of the PI with David Penneys and with Shamindra K. Ghosh. The second is the study of Alain Connes' chi invariant for finite von Neumann algebras from the point of view of braided tensor categories. We propose a generalization of this invariant using non-invertible bimodules, along with new methods of computation of this invariant that will allow us to distinguish previously indistinguishable classes of von Neumann algebras. Finally, we investigate the algebraic process of gauging braided tensor categories, which described the interaction between quantum and classical symmetry in topological phases of condensed matter systems. This is an important construction from the physical point of view, but mathematically difficult to understand. The primary problem for this project is to establish the  existence of gauged categories in physically relevant situations such as permutation symmetry, generalizing the results of the PI with Terry Gannon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the most fundamental and widely applicable of these tools are the Fourier transform, which implements the wave-particle duality of quantum physics, and the concept of convolution.  This project brings together five themes.  (i) The quantitative natures of the Fourier transform and of convolution are expressed by various mathematical inequalities. (ii) The Fourier transform is a manifestation of certain symmetries, and in turn is governed by symmetries.  (iii) Nonlinear partial differential equations, which are ubiquitous in mathematical description of self-interacting physical systems, often involve multilinear functionals. (iv) Multilinear functionals are often governed by combinatorial issues, that is, by sophisticated counting problems. (v) Natural laws are often expressed as minimization or maximization principles. (For instance, general relativity posits that light travels along paths that are, in a sense, shortest routes between spacetime points.)  The project focuses on a circle of topics in mathematical analysis in which these themes interact. The goal is to discover and rigorously establish new inequalities, and refinements of existing inequalities.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is insight into linear and multilinear functionals, especially those manifesting Euclidean or other Abelian group structure.  Prototypes include the inequalities of Riesz-Sobolev, Brunn-Minkowski, Young, and Hausdorff-Young.  Both a priori upper bounds with nonexplicit constants, and inequalities with explicit optimal constants, will be investigated.  Special attention will focus on the nature and quantitative properties of functions and sets that maximize such functionals, or that nearly do so. Refined inequalities will be developed, incorporating extra terms measuring structure, rather than size; arithmetic progressions, intervals, ellipsoids, and convex sets are fundamental structural objects.  Extensions involving entropy and related quantities will be investigated.  Monotonicity of functionals under deformations will be exploited, where available.  Among the specific foci of attention are stability of Holder-Brascamp-Lieb (HBL) multilinear inequalities, variants of the Rogers-Brascamp-Lieb-Luttinger functionals under relaxed symmetry hypotheses, Schatten norms and mixed-norm versions of HBL inequalities, and multilinear inequalities for compact and discrete Abelian groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many such chaotic systems have been proposed in both the mathematics and physics literature to model some real-life phenomena. For example, a deterministic system of interacting particles could model the microscopic motion of electrons. This research project studies such systems. The goal is to prove, in a mathematically rigorous way, that these systems on the long run behave as if they were random. Consequently, ideas from the theory of random processes can be applied to derive the emergence of statistical macroscopic order from microscopic disorder, that is when the system size or the time of observation is large and the initial state is typical. For the above-mentioned example, this approach provides a derivation of the heat equation from some microscopic deterministic models, which is a central question in the mathematical theory of statistical physics.<br/><br/>Specifically, three research projects will be studied. In the first one, some large system of deterministic interacting balls is considered. Motivated by the common separation of time scale phenomenon is physics, a so called rare interaction limit will be studied, that is when the system can be approximated by independent Sinai billiard particles between any pair interactions. The second project is about advanced statistical properties of hyperbolic systems in both finite and infinite measure case. For example, the local central limit theorem, as a very useful tool in many applications including project one, as well as its connections to infinite measure mixing will be studied for hyperbolic maps and flows.

The nodal sets or singularities of the solutions of Allen-Cahn equation will receive special attention in the study since they not only play an important role in the theoretic analysis of the equation,  they also  represent  in applications the interfaces or junctions of interfaces of different phases or grain boundaries in materials such as  crystalline alloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, often the available information, as, for example, in weather prediction, is not exact (deterministic) but statistical (random) with large fluctuations. On macroscopic scales that are much larger than the ones of the heterogeneities, the models often show an effective deterministic behavior, which is much simpler than the original one. The process of the averaging is known as homogenization. Mathematically, this means that the original random and inhomogeneous problem is replaced by a deterministic and homogeneous one. When this averaging is not possible, which is typically the case when the fluctuations are too strong (wild), it is necessary to deal with stochastic media (stochastic partial differential equations), which have rather singular behavior in space and time.  The mathematical study of both the stochastic averaging and the stochastic partial differential equations requires original ideas and the development of new methodologies, since both topics fall outside the traditional theories of averaging and partial differential equations.  Another burgeoning area of research is the theory of mean field games. Applications that have been so far looked at range from complex socio-economical topics, regulatory financial issues, crowd movement, meaningful big data and advertising to engineering contexts involving ""decentralized intelligence'"" and machine learning. Mean field games are the ideal mathematical structures to study the quintessential problems in the social-economical sciences, which differ from physical settings because of the forward looking behavior on the part of individual agents. Concrete examples of applications in this direction include the modeling of the macroeconomy and conflicts in the modern era. In both cases, a large number of agents interact strategically in a stochastically evolving environment, all responding to partly common and partly idiosyncratic incentives, and all trying to simultaneously forecast the decision of others. Training of graduate students is an integral part of this research project.<br/><br/>The project is about developing general methodologies to study random homogenization, nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations and applications to front propagation, phase transitions, and mean field games. Random environments are much more general than periodic ones. The latter are basically fixed translations of a certain equation while the former can be thought as all the possible equations. This leads to considerable issues of lack of compactness. It is therefore necessary to develop novel tools that combine both the differential and random structures of the media. In this setting, the equation is the random variable and the special dependence signifies the location in space where the equation is observed. The PI and his collaborators were the first to consider stochastic homogenization in stationary ergodic environments. A large part of the project is about the further development of the theory.  Stochastic partial differential equations have coefficients with very singular (Brownian) behavior. In the linear context, this can be typically handled by known methods like the classical martingale approach. The latter is based on the linear character of the higher order part of the equation and thus cannot be used for nonlinear problems, where it is necessary to find appropriate notions of solutions. In the context of first- and second-order nonlinear equations, these are the stochastic viscosity and pathwise entropy solutions, introduced by the PI and his collaborators.  A part of the project is about the study of the qualitative behavior/properties of these solutions. In the context of mean field games, the PI will concentrate on the role of inhomogeneities at the several level of the game up to the master equation and models with common noise. This will require the development of novel techniques to understand the behavior of the problem past singularities and the role of the averaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analytic number theory is a branch of number theory which uses tools from mathematical analysis to solve problems about the integers. Harmonic analysis has its roots in the work of Fourier, who studied the way general functions may be represented by sums of simpler trigonometric functions. It has applications in various areas including mathematical physics, signal processing, and digital image processing. The project involves a series of problems in harmonic analysis related to Radon transforms and X-ray transforms. A deeper understanding of these transforms will produce a number of applications in areas such as computed tomography (CT) scan, sonar techniques, and radar techniques. On the other hand, the proposed project will stimulate interactions between harmonic analysis and analytic number theory. The principal investigator proposes to study a few famous open problems in analytic number theory, via tools recently developed in harmonic analysis. <br/><br/>The project involves work in three directions, focusing separately on decoupling theory, time-frequency analysis, and certain oscillatory integrals that connect the previous two topics. One problem that is proposed in decoupling theory concerns Parsell-Vinogradov systems in all dimensions. The goal is to establish certain sharp decoupling inequalities that would imply sharp upper bounds on the number of integer solutions of these systems. Progress on this problem will allow a representation of every polynomial of a given degree by fewer linear forms. In the direction of time-frequency analysis, the principal investigator proposes to study an important special case of the famous Zygmund conjecture. This conjecture states that the maximal operator associated with a planar Lipschitz vector field is weakly bounded on the space of square-integrable functions. The principal investigator proposes to study the conjecture by further assuming the vector field to be constant along each vertical line on the plane. One problem that is proposed in the area of oscillatory integrals aims at proving sharp Sobolev regularity estimates for an averaging operator along the moment curve in every dimension. Sharp decoupling inequalities established by the principal investigator and collaborator will provide necessary tools from decoupling theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, there are two physical experiments one can perform with a bounded, smooth planar lamina.  Firstly, one can hit a billiard ball and watch its trajectory over a long time as it bounces off the boundary of the lamina.  Secondly, one can resonate the lamina and observe the modes of vibration as the frequency increases.  One of the oldest works regarding the latter experiment includes Chladni's experiment in the 18th century. The PI and collaborators recently discovered that there is an unexpected connection between the types of trajectories one observes, and the geometry of patterns one obtains as a result of vibration. In modern language, this is a study of the relation between classical dynamics and corresponding quantum dynamics. The project aims to further explore this newly found connection in various setup to expand our knowledge about the impact of the presence of chaos in classical dynamics to the corresponding quantum dynamics.  This research involves training upper class undergraduate students and graduate students, and developing a topic course for them.<br/><br/>To be specific, the PI is interested in the impact of ergodicity of geodesic flow on the geometry of nodal sets of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The PI proposes to investigate the geometry of nodal sets in two contrasting cases: hyperbolic 3 manifolds with a cusp and circle bundles over closed surfaces endowed with a metric that is invariant under the circular action. The geodesic flow is always ergodic in the former examples, and never ergodic in the latter examples.  The complexity of the nodal set will be measured by the zeroth and the first Betti numbers. The PI also proposes to study the long-standing problem regarding the existence of embedded eigenvalues of Hodge Laplacian. This is the first step to be done in order to understand the interplay between ergodicity and eigenforms of Hodge Laplacian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concrete versions of this decomposition/filtering/reconstruction process, sometimes referred to as the ""time-frequency"" method, are performed in a broad range of real-world applications, such as audio or image compression, image pattern or facial recognition, data assimilation, compressed sensing and many others. A similar procedure is employed in tomographic imaging, where the shape of a solid body is reconstructed by means of sampling the body's density along penetrating waves, which can be mathematically described as lines in three dimensional space.  The first main component of this mathematics research project deals with toy mathematical models of sampling three and higher dimensional objects (for instance, solid bodies) along lower dimensional sets such as lines or planes. The second, deeply related component of this project is concerned with extending the time-frequency decomposition method to suitable vector-valued signals. Integral components of the project are the training of graduate and undergraduate students within the active research group in Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equation at University of Virginia, as well as the mentoring and research start-up of undergraduates, graduate students and researchers coming from underrepresented groups in the profession.<br/><br/>This Harmonic Analysis research project deals with singular integral operators exhibiting further invariance properties, such as modulation or rotational symmetries, in addition to those (translation and dilation invariance) characterizing Calderon-Zygmund operators: a fundamental example is the Carleson maximal operator dictating pointwise convergence of the Fourier series of square-integrable functions.The first part of this research project deals with rotation invariant singular integrals: in particular, with the Hilbert transform along Lipschitz vector fields.

The PI also proposes an array of model problems, of independent interest, obtained by constraining the range of the vector field.

The intrinsic multi-parameter nature of directional operators leads naturally to connected outstanding questions on the theory of double Fourier series: the parabolic and the polygonal summation problems. The second, related circle of problems investigated in this project concerns linear and multilinear singular integrals acting on Banach space valued functions: among other questions, the PI will investigate T(1)-type operator valued theorems in the multilinear setting, and fully noncommutative analogues of Carleson's theorem.

The questions are often formulated as follows: does there exist a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives?  Attempts to address this type of questions have played a fundamental role in the development of modern mathematics. In 1760 Joseph-Louis Lagrange asked whether there exists a surface with minimal area and prescribed boundary. This problem known as the Plateau problem was named after the physicist Joseph Plateau whose experiments with soap films yield a similar mathematical problem. The existence and regularity of such surfaces are part of Geometric Measure Theory (GMT). More generally, GMT combines methods of mathematical analysis with concepts from differential geometry, to develop the appropriate setting for studying critical phenomena in Partial Differential Equations and in the Calculus of Variations, often arising from optimization questions. Recent developments in the field forecast an imminent boom. It is the PIs' objective to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity they are uniquely positioned to take advantage of. Fulfillment of their scientific goals will yield to developments that will shape the field for years to come. The vertically integrated structure of the PIs' teams ensures that this project will have a considerable impact in human resources. One of the PIs' main goals is to educate the next generation of researchers in Geometric Measure Theory.<br/><br/>Pioneered in the work of Besicovitch in the thirties, the subject boomed in the fifties and sixties with the work on the multidimensional Plateau problem by De Giorgi, Federer, Fleming, Reifenberg and Almgren. The ideas developed in that extremely creative period have deeply influenced the further development of the theory of Partial Differential Equations and of the Calculus of Variations, with noticeable effects in Geometric Analysis and Mathematical General Relativity, and Harmonic Analysis and Potential Theory. The current project focuses on three major challenges in GMT, all of which are poised to have a significant impact in other areas of analysis.

While much of the theory behind such descriptions are rooted in the physics of the nineteenth century, due to the complexity of the mathematical objects involved in them many aspects are still poorly understood. Two problems are of primary interest in this research project. (1) In theory the mathematical models should determine the future evolution of the fluid when the forces acting on it and its initial status are known; nonetheless a rigorous mathematical proof of this expectation is missing for the simplest and most popular models. In layman terms the reason is that we do not understand ""how and why"" fluid motions which are apparently ""smooth and calm"" evolve into ""chaotic and turbulent"" ones. (2) Even if we expect the complete predictability of the models, nonetheless the computations are often so complex that become practically impossible. For this reason scientists have developed statistical descriptions of the motions, which allow to infer their typical behavior without resorting to heavy computations. The rigorous justification of these statistical descriptions from the primary mathematical models describing the motions is still a big challenge of modern science.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with some of the most popular systems of partial differential equations used in the mathematics of fluid dynamics, the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The three main themes of the project are the following. (A) The convergence of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to the Euler equations when the viscosity of the fluid goes to zero. A primary concern is a tenet of the theory of turbulence that the rate of energy dissipation is, for fluid motions of a fixed macroscopic scale, independent of the viscosity. The recent resolution of a well-known conjecture of Lars Onsager on the energy dissipation for low regularity solutions of Euler could pave the way to a mathematical proof of the existence of such anomalous dissipation.  (B) Regularity and singularity of the solutions. One of the celebrated Millennium prize problems asks whether smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations develop singularities in finite time. The Navier-Stokes equations can be ""embedded"" in a one-parameter family of models where the parameter describes the regularizing strength of the viscous term. While some of the known results concerning the Navier-Stokes equations have been extended to the latter family, there is still quite a few which lack a suitable counterpart. (C) Rigidity and flexibility of the isometric embeddings of Riemannian manifolds. The recent resolution of the Onsager conjecture mentioned at point (A) is based on the discovery of the project leader and Laszlo Szekelyhidi Jr. of unexpected connections with a classical problem in Riemannian geometry, solved by John Nash in the fifties. The counterpart of the Onsager conjecture in the geometric framework is however not yet fully solved.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The STDC is one of the longest standing regular conferences in general topology, having started in 1967 and continuing as an annual conference.  It attracts participants nationally and internationally.  The STDC regularly attracts over 150 participants, and often over 200.  There are 7 plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks in most areas of topology and its applications by established researchers.  Talks bridging two or more research areas are encouraged.  In a highly technological society like the USA, a high level science research, and in particular mathematics research, is crucial for further progress. Conferences are an essential part for developing successful and competitive research programs in mathematics and for the education of young researchers. The STDC has played an essential part in the success and education of many of its participants. The conference will include contributed talks by PhD students, post-doctoral students, as well as junior mathematicians, and will encourage diversity among speakers.  There are six special sessions in subareas of topology including a new session in Topology and Graph Theory. More information and an invitation to participate may be found at the conference website:  http://www.uab.edu/cas/mathematics/mathnews/stdc<br/> <br/>The 53rd Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will run six special sessions: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Topology, Geometric Group Theory, Set<br/>Theoretic Topology, and Topology and Graph Theory that will include most topics of contemporary research in topology as well as highlighting connections between topology and other mathematical subjects. The session on Topology and Graph Theory is being included for the first time this year.  The winner of the Mary Ellen Rudin Award for a beginning mathematician will be announced at this meeting, and will be invited to give a plenary address.  The conference has succeeded in strengthening major connections between areas which normally do not interact. Particularly effective have been interactions between dynamical systems and continuum theory, between geometric topology and continuum theory, between geometric topology and geometric group theory, and between set theoretic topology and continuum theory. The interaction between these areas and graph theory is being encouraged by particularly inviting speakers who can bridge between the former areas and graph theory. The STDC encourages these interactions by providing travel support to students, post-docs, and junior mathematicians, by encouraging the special session organizers to seek diversity in those they invite to speak in a special session, and by welcoming unsolicited submissions for speaking in a special session.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harmonic analysis is a subject about the Fourier transform, which decomposes a function into its constituent frequencies. In other words, by taking the Fourier transform we effectively write a function as a superposition of monochromatic waves (waves with only one frequency). Of particular interest are the following restriction type problems: How large can a function be, in the pointwise sense or in some averaged sense, if its frequency lives in a particular restricted set? People have found that if the restricted frequency set is ""curved"", for example being the unit sphere, very nontrivial estimates about the function can be obtained/expected. This is useful in understanding physics phenomena dictated by certain natural partial differential equations such as the Schrodinger equation or the wave equation. Moreover, restriction type problems also turn out to be the key to the understanding of certain behaviors of natural numbers. It turns out that, for example, once people understand well on properties on waves whose frequencies are perfect 10-th powers, they can consequently answer a variety of questions on representing a natural number as a sum of a few perfect 10-th powers.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI proposes to study restriction type problems: If we have a subset M (usually a curved submanifold or a fractal set) in the frequency space and some measure in the physical space, we want to bound some norm of a function with respect of the given measure whenever the frequency support of that function is in the given M. One proposed direction is Stein's Restriction Conjecture, where the measure is just the Lebesgue measure and the manifold is the unit paraboloid. The PI is also interested in the situations when the measure is a fractal measure, or when M is a moment manifold or a fractal set. For most questions of this type, the optimal estimates are far from being well understood. The goal of this research would be to obtain new estimates (i.e. estimates with improved exponents) in the above setting. In particular, it is anticipated that improvements on Stein's conjecture can be obtained when this project develops. For the proposed approach, the PI anticipates a subset of analytic (induction on scales, decoupling and refined Strichartz type reasoning), algebraic (the polynomial method, differential geometry and real algebraic geometry), combinatorial (Multilinear Kakeya, sum-product theory, etc.) and geometric measure theoretic (radial projection theory, etc.) tools can come into play. He also anticipates emerging new connections between harmonic analysis and nearby areas will arise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It embodies many challenges and new, exciting mathematics. The conjecture was originally made around 2000, and a large body of literature has been accumulated on the subject while many unsolved problems remain. It has connections with and applications to many other parts of mathematics; for example, it is connected to index theory, which attracts the attention of many researchers from various fields.  Another connection is to the holomorphic extension problem in several complex variables, another important branch of mathematical analysis.   The extension problem itself goes back to the 1970s, and recent progress on the Arveson-Douglas Conjecture sheds new light on this old problem.  An important part of any research in mathematics is the search for new tools and methods, and the principal investigator will take concrete steps toward that goal.<br/> <br/>On the technical side, the Arveson-Douglas Conjecture makes strong connections with geometry and several complex variables. The concrete steps in this research include: the study of a recently defined property - the asymptotic stable division property - for submodules; a generalized version of the holomorphic extension problem; identifying index elements and index formulas on modules; extending known results to strongly pseudoconvex domains. The research is aimed at building machinery that allows one to treat global properties of complex analytic sets, especially algebraic sets, through local analysis. New techniques involving tools from operator theory, harmonic analysis, several complex variables and topology will be developed to treat these problems. The principal investigator will also study Toeplitz operators and Toeplitz algebra on strongly pseudoconvex domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to analyze how some fundamental physical objects interact with fractal structures.  For instance, suppose we know that a field associated to a body in space (for instance its gravitational field) is well-behaved (say, has bounded magnitude), then what can we infer about the geometry of the body?  Does the condition upon the field preclude the surface of the body from having a fractal type structure?  A second topic considered concerns understanding signals whose frequencies have a self-similar or fractal behavior.  More precisely, one is interested in the extent to which the signal can be reconstructed uniquely from a ""small"" set of values.  The principal investigator (PI) will incorporate both graduate and undergraduate students into the research program, training them for future careers in STEM fields.  The PI will organize annual undergraduate research symposia that will bring together undergraduate students interested in mathematical research across southeastern states to present their undergraduate research, build a network with others interested in pursuing research in the mathematical sciences, and provide information about research opportunities at the graduate level.<br/><br/>This project concerns the analysis of operators when the geometry underlying the problem is rough or fractal in nature.  The first question considered is: What can be deduced about a measure from the knowledge that a Calderon-Zygmund operator associated to it is bounded?  Under these circumstances, can the measure have a fractal structure, or must its support be contained in (a countable number of) Lipschitz submanifolds of appropriate dimension? This basic question in analysis has found applications in the calculus of variations, the study of free boundaries, and the geometry of harmonic measure.  Despite intense study over the last thirty years, the tools that serve as a bridge from the analytic condition on the field to the geometric structure of the measure are currently underdeveloped, something that this proposal aims to rectify.  The second question is: How sparse must the support of the Fourier transform of a function be to ensure that the function can be uniquely reconstructed by its values on a ""thick"" subset?  Although this question is a classical form of the uncertainty principle, it is not yet well understood, especially in several dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project investigates three major themes: 1) the problem of the pointwise convergence of Fourier series (near the integrability threshold), 2) the role of curvature in several model problems connected with major open problems including Zygmund's differentiation conjecture and the boundedness of the trilinear Hilbert transform, and 3) applications in PDE and fluid mechanics. The first theme of pointwise convergence lies at the very foundation of Fourier analysis and has a history of more than 200 years. Along the way, it has generated new areas within mathematical analysis (e.g. time-frequency analysis) and served as a motivation and inspiration for the development of wavelet theory -- a field that nowadays has numerous real-world applications in engineering (image processing, data recovery), medicine (MRI), and other fields. The second theme aims to understand toy curved models designed to shed new light on longstanding open problems with applications to ergodic theory and number theory.  Finally, the third theme deals with questions such as the global behavior of the maximal Schrodinger operator and the study of singularity formation in two dimensions for water waves -- the latter having direct implications for our understanding of physical reality.<br/><br/>This is a diverse project involving relevant problems in harmonic analysis, with applications in several related fields. The PI has obtained relevant progress on all three of the themes discussed above. Indeed, for the first theme, the PI completely solved the lacunary model of the problem, in particular verifying a conjecture posed by Konyagin at the 2006 International Congress of Mathematicians.  Moreover, in the course of his work on the lacunary model, the PI established deep and surprising connections between time-frequency analysis and additive combinatorics, which he is now using to develop a new methodology for approaching the longstanding full problem. For the second theme -- meant to develop a deeper understanding of the role of curvature in harmonic analysis, by studying the transition from nonflat to flat models of some difficult well-known open problems -- the PI developed a program which recently unified three directions: the Hilbert transform, the bilinear Hilbert transform, and the Carleson operator along non-flat curves (together with their maximal variants).  The third theme has strong connections with dispersive PDE and fluid mechanics. The fluid mechanics component is part of a joint project and aims to understand the asymptotic geometry of the interface between two fluids in a  2D setting as the interface approaches a ""splash"" scenario from the water-wave case.  This project builds on the previous joint work of the PI together with C. Fefferman and A. Ionescu on the lack of splash singularity formation in the 2D case of locally smooth two-fluid interfaces under irrotational assumptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these situations, there are certain fundamental frequencies and vibrational modes associated to the underlying geometry of the space.  These frequencies and modes play an essential role in the understanding of the behavior of wave phenomena. They appear, for example, in the acoustical design of concert halls and the vibration of instruments.  This project develops tools, based on propagation phenomena, to study the delicate relationship between the geometry of the space and behavior of the corresponding modes. <br/><br/>This research will provide new insight into the structure of vibrational modes for general spaces.  Many quantitative regularity results (as measured by L^p norms) are already known for spaces with non-positive curvature.  However, these types of estimates are unavailable under less restrictive geometric assumptions.  The main goals of this project are two fold: (1) to describe the concentration phenomena that result in L^p norm growth for individual modes, and (2) to use this understanding to produce estimates for modes and frequencies based solely on dynamical properties of the underlying manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference focuses on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of operator algebras and its applications in physics. The conference aims to facilitate both the growth of the operator algebras field per se, as well as to inform non-specialists of the power of these methods for addressing questions outside of this field. Several distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of funding an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. <br/><br/>Operator algebras provide a powerful perspective on problems throughout mathematics. This meeting will review some of the many accomplishments in this field, especially as related to the work of Richard V. Kadison, and their relationships to problems of current interest in mathematics and mathematical physics.  Topics include: relations with topological quantum field theory, advances in condensed matter physics, the Kadison-Singer conjecture, and elaboration of the non-commutative geometry paradigm, which places operator algebras at the center of problems in fields from geometry, to mathematical physics, to analytic number theory and beyond.<br/> <br/>More information is available at the conference web site<br/>https://www.math.upenn.edu/~deturck/kadison-conference/index.html<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The involvement of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in any scientific meeting is extremely important; this is one way scientific knowledge gets transmitted from one generation to the next. The award gives early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of support a chance to attend lectures and interact with the invited speakers and with each other. This will expose junior mathematicians to an exciting and dynamical mathematical environment and will motivate and encourage them to continue working on mathematical research. The topics of the conference are closely related to questions that are of interest in physics, such as mathematical resonances, scattering, the long-time behavior of waves, and inverse problems. Participants will be exposed to these possible applications, potentially leading to future developments in medical imaging, geophysics, and other interdisciplinary subjects.<br/><br/>The topics discussed in the meeting belong to the field of mathematical analysis, and include scattering theory, inverse scattering, resolvent estimates, resonances, inverse problems, and generalized Radon and X-ray transforms.  The conference will help disseminate recent results and contribute to future developments in these fields.
