This research project concerns analysis on compact extensions  of nilpotent Lie groups. One says that the action of a compact Lie group K on a nilpotent Lie group N yields a Gelfand pair when the integrable K-invariant functions on N commute under convolution. The investigators will continue their study of such Gelfand pairs, in particular their study of the associated space of spherical functions, especially when N is a Heisenberg group. Specific goals include further development of algorithms for computing spherical functions and their eigenvalues, study of identities for generalized binomial coefficients, a description of the topology of the Gelfand space, and applications to questions concerning hull minimal ideals in Schwartz spaces.<br/><br/>The techniques of Fourier analysis, which traces its roots to the study of problems in heat conduction, are among the most powerful tools in the mathematician's arsenal. An important construction in Fourier analysis is the so-called convolution product. In the classical setting, convolution has the important property of commutativity. That is, one can rearrange the order of the factors in the product without affecting the result of the multiplication. There is, however, a modern and far-reaching generalization of Fourier analysis, like its ancestor linked to important problems in physics, in which convolution often fails to be commutative. In many problems in this type of analysis, which is done in the framework of objects known as ""Lie groups,"" noncommutativity arises quite naturally and cannot be avoided, leading to great technical difficulties. Gelfand pairs provide a device to recover the simplicity of commutativity in certain noncommutative settings. Each Gelfand pair provides an environment with enough symmetry to ensure commutativity of the convolution product. Such pairs are named in honor of the Russian mathematician I. M. Gelfand and have been studied since the 1950s. Their usefulness is now well established in connection with analysis in the noncommutative setting of semi-simple Lie groups. In the past decade, it has been shown that Gelfand pairs also arise in another non-commutative setting, that of  nilpotent Lie groups. The goals of this research concern the systematic study and mathematical analysis of this new class of Gelfand pairs, including the development of algorithms for explicit computations.<br/>"

In<br/>a different direction, the project involves the study of commutators of<br/>elements from ideals of infinite type II von Neumann algebra factors; in<br/>particular, to characterize which elements are commutators in terms of, for<br/>instance, generalized singular numbers.<br/><br/>Non-technical description: In the mid 1980's, Voiculescu discovered (or<br/>created, depending on your perspective), a new sort of probbility theory<br/>which is quite analogous to usual probability theory, except that the<br/>usual notion of independence is replaced by freeness, which is exhibited<br/>by certain noncommuting random variables.  In fact, freeness is related<br/>to and inspired by the combinatorics of free groups, which are groups<br/>with ""maximal noncommutativity.""  In the last decade and a half, free<br/>probability has been shown to be a fundamental new theory, which touches<br/>on diverse areas of mathematics and physics, including random matrices,<br/>combinatorics and operator theory.  For example, freeness provides a<br/>deep and satisfying explanation of the appearance of Wigner's semicircle<br/>law in random matrices, and has proven very useful for the further study<br/>of random matrices.  The natural context for free probability theory is<br/>noncommutative von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras, because the full<br/>power of spectral analysis can be brought to bear.  The project is to<br/>elucidate the structure of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras related<br/>to free probability theory.  Successful completion of this research will<br/>be both and application and an elucidation of free probability theory<br/>and will deepen our understanding of C*-algebras and von Neumann<br/>algebras.  Von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras were first considered by<br/>von Neumann and, respectively, Gel'fand and Naimark, in the 1930s and<br/>1940s. They are natural contexts for noncommutative analogues of<br/>classical analysis, and they thus arise naturally in the mathematical<br/>theory of quantum mechanics.  Moreover, noncommutative methods are<br/>increasingly being used to study classically commutative problems in<br/>mathematics --- witness the Jones polynomial used to distinguish knots,<br/>and Connes' noncommutative geometric methods used to study fractals.<br/><br/>"

We have a new lead on the well-known wavelet connectivity problem, which we perceive to be a basic issue in the subject.  Another wavelet problem of a basic issue nature concerns the question of when a Riesz wavelet which is known to be a linear combination of MRA wavelets is itself an MRA wavelet.  Others problems we propose to work on concern norm-density of the wavelet frames, operator-theoretic interpolation of wavelets,  superframes and superwavelets, and Weyl-Heisenberg frames.  We will also work on two projects in a different direction concerning operator spaces, reflexivity and optimization.  The first concerns an axiomatic description of a ranking-function for an abstract operator space.  There is a natural definition of a concrete ranking-function for a concretely given operator space, but an abstract description of this is elusive and seems to be a basic issue.  The second concerns the question of which matrix completion problems are well-posed in the sense of optimization theory.  <br/><br/>This proposal represents work of an interdisciplinary nature on the mathematics of wavelet and frame theory. Work in this  direction that was previously supported by NSF has settled some open questions and has impacted the work of others in harmonic analysis and applications-oriented wavelet theory. Continuing in this direction is the main thrust of the present proposal.  Numerous papers  have been written in the past dozen years dealing with applications of wavelets to signal and image processing. So far,  most of the published work has dealt directly with applications, and relatively little has been accomplished concerning the basic mathematical underpinnings of the subject.  This proposal is  concerned with  this mathematics.  There have been some surprises that have come up in our work in the past two years, and these discoveries have led to some potential areas of applications of a previously unsuspected nature.  There are several outstanding  problems we emphasize in this proposal and plan to work on.  Under prior NSF support we also accomplished research with several co-authors on some basic problems in operator theory, operator spaces, operator algebras and matrix optimization, and this leads to some further open problems and directions we plan to pursue.

Virtually every branch of mathematics,<br/>from algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry to applied analysis,<br/>Fourier analysis, and computer science, has its corpus of theory arising <br/>from the study of polynomials. This project intends to study polynomial  <br/>inequalities and their applications in classical analysis, approximation <br/>theory, orthogonal polynomials, and number theory. The proposed research <br/>is about polynomials in a general sense, so it includes Chebyshev spaces, <br/>Markov spaces, Descartes systems, Muntz polynomials, rational function <br/>spaces, as well as polynomials with various constraints such as restricted <br/>zeros, integer coefficients, and nonnegative coefficients in various bases.  <br/>The project continues several years of successful work on a variety of <br/>topics and describes various new directions.        <br/><br/>   The polynomial is one of the most basic concepts of mathematics. Throughout<br/>history people have found problems concerning polynomials especially fascinating.  <br/>Each of the ``three famous problems'' in the ``Heroic Age'' dealt with zeros of <br/>polynomials: squaring the circle, duplicating the cube, and trisecting an  <br/>angle. Historically, questions relating to polynomials, for example, the solution<br/>of polynomial equations, gave rise to some of the most important problems of<br/>the day. Besides the natural intellectual interest in them, polynomials, and in<br/>particular extremal problems involving polynomials, arise not only in<br/>almost every field of mathematics, but also in other sciences, especially <br/>in engineering. However, it is often the case that polynomials related to a practical <br/>problem belong to a restricted class. Depending on the nature of the <br/>problem, some additional pieces of information on the polynomial may be known. <br/>For filter design, polynomials with coefficients from {-1,0,1} are very useful, <br/>because, if they are used, then the filter can be implemented without  <br/>the use of multiplications; their implementation requires only additions <br/>and subtractions. This reduces the cost of implementation. The problem is <br/>to find such polynomials which have a ``lowpass'' behavior on the unit <br/>circle of the complex plane. Roughly, that is, they approximate 1 in a <br/>neighborhood of 1 and approximate 0 in a neighborhood of -1. The project plans  <br/>to study extremal properties of polynomials with coefficients from {-1,0,1}<br/>{0,1}, and {-1,1}. Unimodular polynomials (when the coefficients are complex numbers <br/>of modulus 1) are also important in engineering. In some other problems related <br/>to physics, in particular electrostatics, information about the distribution of  <br/>the zeros of the polynomial is known. ``Gaped'' polynomials (polynomials<br/>with a large number of zero coefficients) are used to analyze, for example,<br/>the time-optimal boundary controls for the one-dimensional heat equation. <br/>The proposal intends to explore further applications of polynomial inequalities<br/>as well as to offer a systematic study of naturally arising questions regarding <br/>polynomials subject to various constraints.  <br/><br/>"

He proposes to attempt to generalize this result, by relaxing the differentiability assumptions (many interesting minimal homeomorphisms are not smooth, or not even on manifolds), and by considering more general groups (such as the real numbers or the direct sum of several copies of the integers). He also proposes to apply the direct limit decomposition, by attempting to prove a classification theorem for such direct limits, and by using the results it implies about K-theory to investigate the connections between dynamics and C*-algebras for interesting minimal homeomorphisms. The Principal Investigator further proposes to use methods of free probability to study isomorphism questions for C*-algebras related to the reduced C*-algebras of free groups.<br/><br/>This project concerns the classification of simple C*-algebras.  C*-algebras are a fascinating and beautiful part of mathematics in their own right, and moreover they have surprising applications to<br/>other parts of mathematics (such as geometry and topology) and even to parts of physics (such as quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics).  For these reasons, and others, one wants to identify and describe all C*-algebras. Without some limitations, this task is presently hopeless, and my project focuses on C*-algebras which are ""simple"" (that is, the usual way of taking them apart into smaller pieces doesn't work), and also ""not too large"" in several other technical senses. Under these limitations, some classification theorems have been proved. That is, one can identify, label, and describe the objects in certain classes of C*-algebras, sort of like the periodic table of the elements or like the naming of the species of living things. In one particular case of<br/>interest (the ""stably finite"" case), the classification results have been proved for simple C*-algebras arising from one particular construction (""direct limits""), but the most interesting source of examples is a different construction (""crossed products""). In a sense, the wrong algebras have been classified. The aim of this project is to show that some algebras of the more interesting kind are actually the same as some of the ones already classified, or are at least close enough that the old classification methods from direct limits might still be applied; and to extend those methods far enough to actually classify the algebras of the more interesting type.<br/><br/>"

However it was only<br/>when Federer's book was published that it became clear how all these<br/>results fit naturally together as a cohesive subject. Unfortunately since<br/>its introduction the subject has been perceived as somewhat mysterious and<br/>inaccessible. In this proposal the investigator exploits one of the<br/>outstanding features of the field, its versatility. The PI intends to<br/>apply techniques of GMT to study free boundary regularity problems, to<br/>answer questions regarding the existence of good parameterizations for<br/>certain metric spaces and to classify sets supporting ``Lebesgue-type''<br/>measures.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Free boundary problems arise naturally in physics and engineering.

This merging of sub-areas<br/>makes sense because their methods are showing more overlap than ever.  <br/>The project suggests a variety of goals. The first is the study of<br/>boundaries of connectedness loci for families of polynomials. This<br/>generalizes the study of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. Problems<br/>include the metric structure of the boundary, including the boundary<br/>behavior of the Riemann map of the complement and the distribution of<br/>the harmonic measure. This part of the problem continues the on-going<br/>work by J. Graczyk and the proposer. The second goal is the study of<br/>boundaries of Siegel disks. The main problem in this area is deciding<br/>whether such boundaries are Jordan curves. The proposed approach is<br/>based on gaining information on the Riemann map of the Siegel disk by<br/>means of a cohomological equation.

Systems which appear as models in natural<br/>sciences, such as physics, astronomy, meteorology, economics or<br/>ecology, involve multiple parameters.  However, <br/>frequently one dominant parameter emerges<br/>which controls long time-behavior of the system. In such a way the<br/>logistic family appears in the study of many complicated systems. The<br/>logistic maps are quadratic polynomials. It is useful to study them on<br/>the complex plane, and thus complex quadratic polynomials enter the<br/>picture. This is the first object of our study. <br/>In other situations the system begins to show quasi-periodic<br/>or ``rotational'' behavior.

Wild<br/>attractors, which are our third subject, refer to a very unusual<br/>chaotic regime for a system in which two completely different limiting<br/>modes of long-term behavior co-exist side by side.   The attractor<br/>for an iterated function system which we will also investigate appears<br/>as a projection of a certain fractal set.

Research of the past three decades has<br/>shown that the validity of estimates of a similar character for analytic<br/>functions on algebraic varieties in n-dimensional complex Euclidean space<br/>are in fact equivalent to certain properties of linear constant<br/>coefficient partial differential operators.  Some such properties of the<br/>operators are surjectivity on the space of real analytic functions or<br/>Gevrey classes, the existence of lacuna in fundamental solutions, the<br/>existence of linear solution operators, and continuation properties of<br/>solutions of the homogeneous equation(s).  While there are different sets<br/>of these estimates associated to the different properties of the operator,<br/>they all are similar in spirit.

In the 1950's, Laurent Schwartz formulated such fundamental<br/>problems for general linear partial differential equations.  Are they<br/>always solvable?  If so, can the solution be chosen as smooth as the data<br/>in the problem?  Do fundamental solutions exist?  Can the equations be<br/>solved with a ""formula"", so that the answer depends linearly on the data<br/>of the problem?

However, the question of whether the solution<br/>could be chosen to be real analytic when the data is real analytic was<br/>open until the late 1960's when the first counter examples were given.  In<br/>1973, Hormander gave a characterization of the equations with this<br/>property in terms of the validity of certain inequalities for analytic<br/>functions on the zero set of the polynomial giving the differential<br/>equation.  In 1990, Taylor, Meise, and Vogt answered the question about<br/>the existence of ""formulas"" for the solution and showed they were also<br/>characterized in terms of some similar inequalities.

Moreover, any Lie group acts on<br/>itself (by left translation) preserving any left-invariant Lorentz<br/>metric.

My work over the last few years has focused<br/>on quantifying exactly which connected Lie groups admit a complicated<br/>action by isometries of a connected Lorentz manifold. As the<br/>definition of ``complicated'' varies, the answer varies, and I intend<br/>to look at a few more of these variations over the coming years.

The proposal is to study the G-invariant<br/>distributions on L(G) which are Fourier transforms of invariant distributions with compactly generated support. This class of distributions includes the  Fourier transforms of orbital integrals, which are important for the theory of characters on the group G.  Harish-Chandra proved that these distributions are given by functions which are locally constant on the set of regular elements of L(G), and can be normalized to be locally bounded on L(G).  When G is a real Lie group, the restrictions of these functions to Cartan subalgebras have simple formulas because they satisfy differential equations.  In the p-adic case, there are analogous formulas for the Fourier transforms of orbital integrals restricted to Cartan subalgebras of L(G), but they are only valid for large enough sufficiently regular elements in the Cartan subalgebra.   These formulas can be used to develop a theory of the constant term analogous to that for the real case. One goal of this proposal is to use these formulas at infinity to prove global bounds for the restrictions of Fourier transforms of orbital integrals to Cartan subalgebras. In order to do this it is necessary to control behavior at infinity uniformly as regular elements approach singular hyperplanes. A further goal of this proposal is to suitably generalize this work to the class of distributions obtained as Fourier transforms of invariant distributions with compactly generated support.<br/><br/> Non-technical Description:  The theory of Fourier series and Fourier transforms was developed, starting in the 18th century, to study functions of a real variable.  The idea is to write an arbitrary function as a sum or integral of the well-understood trigonometric functions.  This theory today has many applications in the sciences, in engineering, and in mathematics.  Many of the basic ideas involved in Fourier analysis can be extended to analyze functions on any space with sufficient symmetry.  One class of spaces of special interest in physics and many areas of mathematics is linear algebraic groups and their Lie algebras, the analysis on the Lie algebra being a linearization of the analysis on the group.  These groups and algebras can be realized as  matrices.  Classically, the entries of the matrices are real or complex numbers.   However there is also an interesting theory when the entries come from other fields, in particular the fields of p-adic numbers.  These fields are important in number theory, and the study of p-adic groups has many applications to number theory.  In the classical situation, much of the analysis involves the use of differential equations.  This tool is not available in the p-adic case. The goal of this proposal is to analyze the behavior at infinity of certain important distributions on p-adic Lie algebras.  The classical results are available as motivation, but the techniques of proof are necessarily completely different.<br/>"

Electrical impedance tomography is another kind of non-intrusive medical imaging and also used in the detection of cracks in materials.  The geodesic Radon transform in the hyperbolic plane plays a role in the algorithms.  Another imaging problem lies at the heart of the Pompeiu transform, which models a homogeneous detector of arbitrary geometrical shape.  Earlier work on this problem, done jointly with Gay, has lead both to the consideration of problems of complex analysis in the Heisenberg group, as well as several other questions of non-destructive evaluation of materials.  <br/>"

Although building quantum computers remains a formidable experimental challenge, they have the potential to efficiently handle problems whose computational complexity puts them beyond the scope of classical digital computers.  Some aspects of this proposal, such as error correction and the exploration of multi-bit gates, are directly related to quantum computation.  However, the main emphasis is on problems in the related area of quantum communication, particularly channel capacity, optimal encoding and decoding schemes and classification of entanglement.  The P.I.'s past work on the analysis of multi-particle systems in strong magnetic fields, the properties of quantum-mechanical entropy, and maps on operator algebras provides a strong starting point for developing new mathematical tools needed to deal with these challenging issues. <br/><br/> The possibility of using quantum computers to efficiently factoring large numbers, is a potential threat to the security of existing cryptographic protocols.  Fortunately, using quantum particles for communication, which is more feasible experimentally, offers new mechanisms for distributing cryptographic keys as well as encoding messages and transmitting information.  These include both procedures based on the transmission of quantum particles for encoding and sending information; and innovative new protocols, based on a quantum phenomenon known as entanglement, involving particles at distant sites augmented by some classical communication. As with classical communication, one must be prepared to deal with noisy channels and much of this proposal deals with the mathematics of noisy channels.  Some of this work has direct implications for experimental design, since it is important to know how to best allocate resources and choose coding schemes to minimize the effects of noise.<br/>"

The first problem is Besicovitch's 1/2- conjecture regarding the sharpest bound for the (a.e.) lower spherical density for purely unrectifiable 1-sets in Euclidean space (or more general spaces as well). The second is the Harmonic Lip_1-Capacity problem (Mattila's conjecture and the related David-Semmes problem), regarding the characterization (in terms of rectifiability) of sets of co-dimension one which allow a Lipschitz harmonic function defined off the set to be extended to all of Euclidean space. This is precisely the higher dimensional analogue of the analytic capacity problem. The third problem is regarding the question of regularity of minimizers of the relaxed energy functional (introduced by Bethuel, Brezis, and Coron) which is basically the usual Dirichlet energy plus a cost function on singularities. On all three problems the PI has done a good deal of work (the third problem is joint with R. Hardt) advancing the state of knowledge. Our program on the first problem has met significant progress in the recent months exceeding the PI's expectations and appears close to completion. Our work on the other two appears to also be heading in direction of further progress as well. <br/><br/>The first problem addresses one of the most fundamental questions regarding the geometrical properties of purely unrectifiable sets going back to Besicovitch's two classic papers which established the foundation of the subject (1928, 1938). These sets are fractal-like, appearing in several contexts in the physical world and hence the sciences (e.g. dynamical systems, number theory etc.). Our work on the problem has required finding new algorithms dealing with very general closed sets, and we expect it to have an impact on the understanding of other related geometrical questions of densities and rectifiability not to mention our understanding of  the properties of these natural sets.. Our second problem combines geometry and harmonic analysis in a natural way, having impact on several areas of analysis and also to Physics, where harmonic functions have a special role (e.g. in electrostatics). Our third problem overlaps geometry, topology, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory. It addresses deep questions in its area. It is of special importance in the theory of liquid crystals since the quantities being minimized are similar to the energies of such physical systems<br/>"

These investigations lead to connections of probability to a conjecture of Morrey which asserts that rank--one convexity does not imply quasiconvexity in dimensions larger than 2. Secondly, extremal problems for the hyperbolic metric will be investigated. These problems arise from the conformal invariance of Brownian motion and conditioned Brownian motion in simply connected domains in the plane. These investigations in turn lead to new problems for martingales and Brownian motion. These problems will also be explored.<br/> Morrey's conjecture is important because of its implications in constructing minimizers in several problems in the calculus of variations describing various physical systems. The connection of these problems to probability was discovered by the PI and his collaborator, G. Wang and A.J.

These connections lead to several questions which if false prove Morrey's's conjecture, a long standing open problem, and if true prove a conjecture concerning the norm of certain singular integrals, another long standing open problem. The solution to the proposed problems on the hyperbolic metric will yield a deeper understanding of various isoperimetric (extremal) inequalities for Brownian motion and conditioned Brownian motion.

Such behavior appears<br/>to be  attributed not  to  individual  systems,  but to  manifolds  of<br/>systems.  In  the renormalization group   approach to these phenomena,<br/>one attempts to identify these manifolds as the invariant manifolds of<br/>a transformation acting  on the space of  systems  considered.  Such a<br/>""renormalization group   transformation"", acting on  Hamiltonians, was<br/>introduced in a previous project.  It is expected to have a nontrivial<br/>fixed point,  whose stable manifold describes  the critical breakup of<br/>certain invariant   tori.  One  of  the  main goals  is  to  prove the<br/>existence of such a fixed point.  The proposed method involves the use<br/>of a computer, to carry out the large number of estimates that will be<br/>needed.  Another goal is to use the known or anticipated properties of<br/>the  fixed  point in order to   describe  critical invariant  tori and<br/>nearby periodic orbits.  Extensions  of renormalization group  methods<br/>to  other  (problems in) Hamiltonian systems   will be investigated as<br/>well.   Some interesting formal connections  with quantum field theory<br/>and statistical mechanics  also suggest new   ways of approaching  old<br/>problems in these areas.  One  of the long term  goals in this area is<br/>to gain a better understanding of the critical  behavior of Ising type<br/>models.  The approach here is to  find and study suitable improvements<br/>of the corresponding hierarchical  model.  Other interesting questions<br/>concern  the hierarchical model  itself, and two  fixed point problems<br/>relevant to disordered media. <br/><br/>Much  of this   project  is related  to  the question  of stability in<br/>classical   Hamiltonian systems.    Examples are  coupled oscillators,<br/>certain  plasma beams, and models   from celestial mechanics.  In  the<br/>case  of two degrees  of freedom, quasiperiodic  orbits that trace out<br/>smooth invariant tori divide phase space into regions from which other<br/>trajectories cannot   escape, thus  adding  to   the stability  of the<br/>system.  The breakup of such tori, as system parameter are varied, can<br/>cause the  dynamics to become locally  unstable or chaotic.  Numerical<br/>studies  reveal that this   happens  in a highly  universal  way, with<br/>certain measurable quantities taking exactly the same values, within a<br/>large class of systems.  The standard explanation of these findings is<br/>based  on  the assumption that  there  exists a nontrivial Hamiltonian<br/>system  that is  invariant  under a  suitable  ""renormalization  group<br/>transformation"".  The goal  here is to  prove that this assumption  is<br/>correct.  Part of the proof will  be carried out by  a computer.  This<br/>work  should  yield valuable  insight into   the  mechanism behind the<br/>observed phenomena, and at the same time, advance the state of the art<br/>in computer-assisted proofs -- a  technique that will undoubtedly play<br/>an  important role in  the  future of mathematical research.   Similar<br/>universality  phenomena  are  associated   with  phase transitions  in<br/>condensed matter  physics,  and  models from  several  other  areas in<br/>mathematics and physics.  A more  general form  of universality -- the<br/>fact  that macroscopic   descriptions are possible   without the exact<br/>knowledge  of  microscopic details   -- is in   fact  at the  heart of<br/>physics and other sciences.  The projects under investigation are part<br/>of a long  term effort to understand such  phenomena, and  to describe<br/>them mathematically.  A correct  mathematical  description can also be<br/>expected  to lead to significant improvements in numerical algorithms.<br/><br/>"

Hodge theory of<br/>differential forms has come to play a central role in this rather modern<br/>approach. The Jacobian determinants and the wedge products of the exact<br/>differential forms are subjected to a great deal of investigation, as they<br/>provide the means of achieving continuity, compactness, or normal family<br/>type results. It is important to realize that the higher integrability<br/>properties of the Jacobians can only be observed for mapping in the<br/>Orlicz-Sobolev classes. More recent developments have emphasized the<br/>connection between quasiconformal mappings and the theory of nonlinear<br/>elasticity already formulated by S.S. Antman and J. Ball in 1976-77. This<br/>connection is an important aspect of the proposal. And that is why we<br/>depart from the usual quasiconformal theory quite far towards mappings<br/>(deformations of elastic bodies) with unbounded distortion. However, some<br/>control, such as BMO-bounds, of the distortion tensor will be necessary to<br/>achieve concreate results. The governing equations for mappings of finite<br/>distortion are non-linear first order systems of PDEs. There are also<br/>related second order systems which arrise naturally as the Euler- Lagrange<br/>equations of the associated variational integrals (stored energy of the<br/>deformation). An analogy between the analytic aspects of the holomorphic<br/>functions and mappings of finite distortion is particularly pronounced in<br/>even dimensions. A fruitful idea when studying these mappings is to view<br/>them as conformal with respect to certain measurable metric or conformal<br/>structures. Many of these notions extend to Riemannian manifolds, and<br/>accordingly, while we do not develop this aspect in full all the machinery<br/>we set up is ready and willing for these generalizations.<br/>            The reader interested in developments along these lines and a<br/>comprehensive account of the geometric function theory is warmly referred<br/>to the forthcoming monograph of G.

The basic methods derive from operator algebras and representation theory, and the connection to the applications is threefold:  wavelet theory, operators, and relations between operations in the discrete and continuos domains.  Wavelet theory concerns the mathematical tools involved in digitizing continuous data with view to storage, and the synthesis process, recreating the desired picture (or time signal) from the stored data.  The algorithms involved go under the name of filter banks, and their spectacular efficiency derives in part from the use of (hidden) self-similarity in the data which is analyzed.  Observations or time signals are functions, and classes of functions make up spaces.  Numerical correlations add structure to the spaces at hand, Hilbert spaces.  There are operators in the spaces deriving from the discrete data and others from the spaces of continuous signals.  The first ones are good for computations, while the second reflect the real world.  The operators between the two are the focus of Jorgensen's research.<br/><br/>Relations between operations in the discrete and continuous domains are studied as symbols, because symbols are programmable.  The mathematics involved in assigning operators to the symbolic relations is called representation theory.  The combination of the three areas opens up exciting new opportunities at the interface of mathematics and engineering.  A main point in the proposal is the study of intertwining operators between, on one side, the ""discrete world"" of high-pass/low-pass filters of signal processing , and on the other side, the ""continuous world"" of wavelets.  There are significant operator-algebraic and representation-theoretic issues on both sides of the ""divide"", and the intertwining operators throw light on central issues for wavelets in higher dimensions.  The proposal describes how the tool from diverse areas of analysis, as well as from dynamical systems and operator algebra, merge into the proposed project on wavelet analysis.  The diversity of techniques is also a charm of the subject, which continues to generate new graduate student activity.

Under the first heading are found a number<br/>of problems pertaining to the structure and representation theory of<br/>non-self-adjoint operator algebras.  The theory of these algebras has been<br/>reinvigorated in recent years through advances in what has come to be known<br/>as quantized functional analysis, i.e., the theory of operator spaces.  This<br/>subject coupled with the recent work of Muhly and Solel that identifies the<br/>C*-envelopes of various very general operator algebras allows one to make<br/>good progress on the program proposed more than thirty years ago by Wm.<br/>Arveson as a generalization of the Sz.-Nagy - Foias model theory of<br/>contraction operators on Hilbert space: study the representations of an<br/>operator algebra in terms of the C*-representations of its C*-envelope. In<br/>the area of groupoids, emphasis will be placed on the study of Fell bundles<br/>over groupoids.  The impetus for this study comes from the representation<br/>theory of groupoids and from efforts to understand co-actions of groupoids.<br/>Further, these bundles (more accurately, generalizations of them) occur in<br/>the theory of product systems and the structure of non-self-adjoint operator<br/>algebras just mentioned.  Toeplitz operators have long been a subject of<br/>intense interest in operator algebra/theory.  In recent years Muhly and Xia<br/>have identified the automorphisms of the C*-algebra generated by all<br/>Toeplitz operators.  The identification is described in terms of constructs<br/>that have played important roles in function theory and harmonic analysis on<br/>the disc.  A particular importance is played by commutator singular<br/>integrals.   Muhly proposes to extend these results, to the extent possible,<br/>to multivariable settings.  Again, commutator singular integrals should play<br/>a decisive role, but the jump to dimensions greater than one presents<br/>difficult challenges.<br/><br/>Muhly's work on non-self-adjoint operator algebras, while inspired primarily<br/>by developments in pure mathematics, has connections with problems of an<br/>applied nature, most particularly, mathematical systems theory - the theory<br/>of so-called H-infinity control. This, basically, is a body of knowledge<br/>dedicated to the problem of building machines, such as cars and airplanes,<br/>so that they meet certain performance criteria.  Among these are such things<br/>as the responsiveness of the steering wheel, in the case of cars, or the<br/>rudder, in the case of airplanes.  In short, Muhly's work will contribute to<br/>theoretical underpinnings of design problems ensuring the safety of all<br/>sorts of conveyances.  Much of Muhly's work on tensor algebras over<br/>C*-correspondences, which has been inspired by the operator theory that<br/>underwrites this kind of control theory, seems to be usable in multivariable<br/>control problems.  Indeed, quite serendipitously, it appears to be<br/>ready-made for multivariable problems.  Muhly expects his research to<br/>provide a theoretical underpinning of multivariable control problems that<br/>here-to-fore have been handled by essentially ad hoc methods.  Muhly's work<br/>in non-self-adjoint algebras and the theory of groupoids has made unexpected<br/>connections with quantum Markov processes - the theory of so-called open<br/>systems that arise in a variety of places such as the theory of lasers and<br/>materials science devoted to super conductivity.  They also arise naturally<br/>in quantum field theory through the constructs known as sectors.  It is<br/>anticipated that Muhly's work will help to provide the mathematical<br/>underpinnings of quantum field theory and advances in laser and materials<br/>science.  Finally, Muhly's work on Toeplitz operators has made connections<br/>with perturbation theories that arise in areas of relativistic quantum<br/>theory and in quantum chemistry.  It is anticipated that his projects on<br/>higher dimensional Toeplitz operators will have an increased impact in this<br/>arena.<br/>"

More specifically,<br/>the author proposes to study the following three basic problems:<br/>regularity of averages over surfaces, distribution of lattice points in<br/>convex domains, and the existence of orthogonal exponential bases for<br/>domains in Euclidean space. In the context of averages over surfaces, we<br/>propose to find a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the<br/>Lebesgue space boundedness of these averages in terms of natural and<br/>easily computable geometric criteria. In the context of lattice points<br/>in convex domains, we propose to compute a sharp rate of growth for the<br/>discrepancy between the volume of a dilated convex body and the number<br/>of lattice points trapped inside, again in terms of natural geometric<br/>properties of the boundary. In the context of orthogonal exponential<br/>bases, we propose to make progress towards the proof of the Fuglede<br/>Conjecture, which says that a domain has orthogonal exponential basis if<br/>and only if it is possible to tile Euclidean space with disjoint<br/>translates of this domain. Combinatorial and number theoretic methods<br/>are expected to play an important role.<br/><br/>The study of the maximal averaging operators and other similar operators<br/>in harmonic analysis is partially motivated by the following interesting<br/>question: How close can we come to recovering a set of data from the<br/>various kinds of averages of that data? The question is of potential<br/>practical value since scientists are often called upon to make<br/>predictions based on average information. For example, meteorologists<br/>make predictions about the rainfall in a particular location based on<br/>the average rainfall in years past in nearby towns.<br/>Seismologists make earthquake predictions based on the pattern of shocks<br/>in the surrounding area. The tradeoff involved in the study of these<br/>phenomena is, roughly speaking, the following. If the data is very<br/>precise, then it can, generally speaking, be recovered from any kind of<br/>a reasonable average. If the data is less precise, then we have to make<br/>sure that the averaging process compensates for the deficiencies of the<br/>data. The main thrust of this project is to study the averaging<br/>phenomenon when the data is given by a certain kind of a mathematical<br/>function, and the average is taken over a curved surface. The study of<br/>the distribution of lattice points in convex domains and the associated<br/>discrepancy function is motivated by the desire to approximate discrete<br/>information, for example integer points in the plane, by more easily<br/>computable continuous information, in this case the area. Finally, the<br/>study of orthogonal exponential bases is motivated by an important<br/>practical problem of approximating functions by trigonometric functions.<br/>These types of approximations have numerous applications in physics,<br/>engineering, and many other areas of science and technology.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

In the case of the first set of problems, which will be treated in collaboration with John L. Lewis and Kaj Nystrom, we will attempt to understand the relationship between the geometry of the boundary of a non-cylindrical (i.e. time-varying) domain, the regularity of parabolic measure with respect to a fixed point in the domain, and the boundedness, on Lebesgue spaces, of parabolic singular integrals defined on the ""parabolic boundary."" The second set of problems involves the study of<br/>the square root problem of Kato, its ramifications, and related questions<br/>in the perturbation theory for divergence form elliptic operators including those with complex coefficients.  Interestingly, we have recently made significant progress on the second set of problems, using in part some techniques from the work of Hofmann and Lewis on the first set. Partial differential equations of ""parabolic"" type, which are the subject of study in first set of problems mentioned above, arise in the mathematical theory of heat conduction, and also in<br/>other so-called ""diffusion"" processes, including those which occur in fields<br/>as diverse as economics, population biology, and the flow of ground water.<br/>For example, in previous work, Hofmann and Lewis have solved a classical problem of heat conduction under new circumstances (which circumstances are really the crux of the matter in the problems under consideration in the present project). The problem is that of determing the temperature at any point inside an object, given that one can measure the temperature everywhere on the<br/>surface of the object. The ""new circumstance"" which we consider,<br/>is to take the realistic point of view that the shape of the object may change over<br/>time.  Certainly, this is often the case when objects are heated<br/>or cooled. The second set of problems alluded to in the first paragraph,<br/>namely, the so-called ""Kato problem"" (or ""square root"" problem) and related questions, has its origins in two papers written by Tosio Kato in 1953 and 1961.<br/>Kato's work concerned the ""regularity"" of solutions of certain hyperbolic (i.e., wave-like) partial differential equations. Roughly speaking, he was trying to<br/>show that the smoothness (or regularity) of these generalized waves has a mathematical correlation with the smoothness of the initial disturbance which causes the wave. Kato observed, in his 1961 paper, that the<br/>regularity which he sought, for solutions of these hyperbolic equations, could be deduced from a certain technical property of the ``square root"" of a partial differential operator related to the original equation. This technical property, if true, would enable one to reduce matters to results which he had already obtained in his earlier paper. To prove that this technical property actually did hold turned out to be extremely difficult, and the quest to do so (for a somewhat more general class of operators than Kato's original wave problem actually required) has become known as the ``Kato Problem"".<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

For many problems of Convex Geometry, like finding sections of a convex body with certain nice properties or approximating a convex body by another body, having a better structure, the explicit constructions are unknown. In these cases random constructions were proved to be very effective. It is often possible to define a random section or approximation and to show that it has the desired property with high probability. This approach combined with advanced probabilistic tools, like measure concentration, led to major discoveries in Convex geometry and Functional Analysis, including Dvoretzky's Theorem and inverse Santalo Inequality. The PI intends to apply the probabilistic method to study embeddings of different metric spaces, such as groups, graphs etc., into Banach spaces. These metric spaces are often equipped with a probability measure, which has strong concentration properties. Then it is possible to obtain significant information about the embedding of such metric space into a Banach space by studying the distribution of the image of a random point. Another direction of the proposed research is related to the study of convex bodies, which are not necessary symmetric. The results obtained in the last 3 years by several researchers, including the PI, show that many properties, previously known only for convex symmetric bodies, hold without the assumption of symmetry. The PI plans to continue his work in this area with the aim of constructing a theory of general convex bodies, which would be parallel to the existing theory of convex symmetric bodies.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research will provide new connections between Functional Analysis, Convex Geometry and Probability. The results on embedding graphs into Banach spaces will be useful for finding small separators of graphs. This can lead to construction of more effective algorithms in several Computer Science problems, in particular in numerical solution of partial differential equations. The non-symmetric convex sets, which are one of the main objects of the proposed research, arise naturally in a broad class of optimization problems. So, better understanding of the structure of such bodies will result in constructing more effective optimization algorithms. The stochastic processes related to a convex body are also of considerable interest for the Control Theory.<br/><br/>"

The dynamics of polynomial mappings of<br/>two-dimensional complex space  C^2  should produce a theory with equal<br/>beauty and utility.   The work of this project includes three parts:<br/><br/>1.  The first objective is to study mappings which are quasi-hyperbolic, a<br/>condition which is more general and will be more easily verified than the<br/>more traditional condition of (uniform) hyperbolicity.  At the same time,<br/>the quasi-hyperbolic mappings have expansion/contraction properties which<br/>makes them<br/>understandable in a way similar to hyperbolic mappings.

Anderson, however, showed <br/>that this is not the case: Arbitrarily small random impurities occurring<br/>independently at each lattice site turn a conductor into an insulator. Since<br/>his work, which was not mathematically rigorous, the development of a precise<br/>theory of ""Anderson localization"" has been pursued by many mathematicians. <br/>It turned out that there were connections with deep results from several <br/>areas of mathematics. For example, Fuerstenberg's theorem on products of <br/>random matrices was a crucial tool in the development of the theory. <br/>These works attracted the attention of physicists, particularly experts in <br/>statistical mechanics. To this day, there is an active and fruitful exchange <br/>of ideas between mathematicians and physicists in this subject. In fact, the <br/>interest in random phenomena and methods has intensified quite notably in <br/>physics in recent years, as many important problems posed by statistical <br/>mechanics have proved to be rather deep mathematical challenges whose <br/>solution has lead to significant advances of probabilistic techniques.<br/>It is our hope that the projects set forth in this proposal will further<br/>advance our insight into the models of statistical mechanics as well as <br/>providing useful tools for mathematicians working in ergodic theory, analysis, <br/>and mathematical physics.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Although these semi-classical models are valid approximations for large distance behavior, they neglect crucial quantum effects in small scales.  The aim of this project is to study the transport behavior starting from the first principle---the Schrodinger equations.  In particular, the validity of the Euler and Boltzmann equations will be established from the Schrodinger equations.

The central problem can be sketched as follows: Given a distribution of iron mines throughout the countryside,  and a <br/>distribution of factories which require iron ore,  decide which mines should supply ore to each factory in order to minimize the total  transportation costs.  Here the cost per ton of ore transported from the mine at x to factory at y is specified by a function c(x,y) --- so the problem<br/>can be formulated as a linear program.  However, when the mines and factories are distributed continuously throughout Euclidean space or a curved landscape with obstacles --- and the cost is related to the distance on this landscape, then the problem has a rich structure and <br/>deep connections to geometry and non-linear PDE which have only begun to be <br/>explored.  Incarnations of this problem embed in current models for surprisingly diverse phenomena.  Along with basic questions concerning the structure and qualitative features of optimal mappings, the proposed research addresses models for  front formation in the atmosphere, dissipative equilibration in kinetic theory, fluid flow, elastic crystals, <br/>and granular materials,  geometric and dynamical inequalities, and microeconomic decision problems formulated in the principal-agent framework which involve designing price systems, tax structures, or contracts in the face of informational asymmetry.<br/><br/>After half a century of mathematical neglect, the past decade witnessed a revival of interest in optimal transportation,  and watched as it blossomed into a fertile field of investigation as well as a vibrant tool for exploring diverse applications within and beyond mathematics.The transformation occurred partly because long-standing issues could finally be resolved,  but also because unexpected connections  were discovered which linked these questions to problems in physics, geometry, computer vision, partial differential equations, earth science and economics. The time is ripe for a collaborative effort on an international scale to explore existing connections and unearth new ones, while simultaneously developing the basic theory of optimal<br/>maps and introducing students and colleagues to the challenges and promise of the field --- thus for the formation of a focused research group with these goals.  The core of our plan is to arrange sustained interactions between and around members of the group,  who in addition to collaborating scientifically, will work together over the next several years to create the research environment and manpower necessary for transportation research to flourish. To achieve this goal, we plan to organize a series of three semester long periods of emphasis and two workshops on different aspects of the subject in several of our home institutions.

He has proposed to work on five projects requiring diverse and extensive mathematical tools from Algebraic Geometry, Classical and Quantum Representation Theory, and Topology. Briefly described, these projects are as follows: In an attempt to understand the Kostka-Macdonald coefficients, Garsia and Haiman proposed a remarkable conjecture, known as the n! conjecture. This asserts that the dimension of a certain space of polynomials in 2n variables is exactly n!. The validity of the conjecture will imply that the coefficients of the Kostka-Macdonald polynomials are non-negative integers which remains an open challenging problem. The first project aims at proving this conjecture (jointly with Prof. J. Thomsen from Aarhus) by using the geometry of Hilbert schemes.  The second project involves proving the non-existence of non-constant holomorphic maps between certain homogeneous compact complex manifolds.  Kumar already has a precise conjecture in this direction.  Lusztig has defined a certain Frobenius morphism for quantized enveloping algebras at roots of unity and also a certain 'splitting' of this morphism defined on the positive parts of the algebras involved. On the other hand, any algebraic variety defined over a field of positive characteristic admits a Frobenius morphism.  Mehta-Ramanathan introduced the concept of Frobenius splitting of such a variety and showed that the flag varieties associated to any semisimple algebraic group do admit Frobenius splitting.  This leads to some important results on the geometry of flag varieties. Now Kumar-Littelmann have obtained a very precise connection between these two (quantum and geometric) notions of Frobenius morphisms and Frobenius splittings and the third project involves completing this ongoing work.  The fourth project involves proving a conjecture given by Kumar himself on the cohomology of 'thick' flag varieties associated to affine Kac-Moody groups with coefficients in homogeneous vector bundles. A 'direct' proof of this conjecture will lead to uniform proofs of several important results related to the Moduli of Vector Bundles and Verlinde Formula. The fifth is a long continuing project which is due for completion by the end of this summer. It involves writing the book ""Kac-Moody Groups, their Flag Varieties and Representation Theory,"" to be submitted to the Graduate Texts in Mathematics series of Springer-Verlag.<br/>To explain these to a general scientific community, the main underlying theme behind Kumar's projects is to exploit 'symmetry' or in more technical terms 'invariance' in problems arising in mathematics and mathematical physics. Several natural phenomena exhibit symmetry, from crystals to the surface of the earth we live on (where the latter of course is invariant under any rotation). Now consider a mathematical or a physical problem, say studying the geometric properties of an object (from a cell to the universe), or solving some complex equations arising in diverse situations in mathematics and other sciences. An effective method has been to study the collection of all the symmetries of the problem under consideration (called a Group) and use the properties of the Group to shed light on the original problem. This method has been very successfully employed in a wide variety of problems leading to some pioneering works since the nineteenth century.<br/><br/>"

The PI and Heinonen<br/>are analyzing the exact conditions under which this result extends<br/>to the more general case of covering maps from the unit disk onto<br/>multiply connected domains. To this end, we explore the uniform<br/>thickness of boundaries of domains in the complex plane, a<br/>condition that is measurably stronger than uniform perfectness.<br/>Part II is a project that consists of generalizing Jorgensen's<br/>inequality to discrete quasiconformal groups acting on the<br/>n-dimensional unit sphere. Such a generalized Jorgensen inequality<br/>would make it possible to extend fundamental aspects of the rich<br/>theory known in the Kleinian case to the setting of quasiconformal<br/>groups. A natural question (with Gaven Martin) for example is:<br/>Under what assumptions is a discrete quasiconformal group<br/>isomorphic to a Kleinian group? In part III, the PI is working on<br/>questions concerning the dynamical action of a discrete<br/>quasiconformal group acting on the n-dimensional unit ball. A<br/>portion of this project is joint with Edward Taylor. We are<br/>exploring local properties of the Hausdorff dimension of limit<br/>sets of discrete quasiconformal groups. One of our questions is,<br/>for example, to find the relation between the local Hausdorff<br/>dimension of the limit set and the local Poincare exponent of the<br/>group.

The study of Kleinian groups (discrete groups of Mobius<br/>transformations) goes back to the 18th century, when it was<br/>developed by such mathematicians as Gauss, Lobachevsky, Klein, and<br/>Poincare. One of our goals is to analyze the thickness of the set<br/>of chaotic behavior of a Kleinian group (and more general sets)<br/>and to investigate under what assumptions such sets are uniformly<br/>thick. Another goal is to explore how certain analytically and<br/>geometrically defined properties change as one enlarges the class<br/>of Kleinian groups.

One objective is to analyze how one can quantify the<br/>concept of discreteness in the class of quasiconformal groups.<br/>Another goal is to relate the conformal action of a quasiconformal<br/>group on the boundary of hyperbolic space to its action on<br/>hyperbolic space.

Our first goal is to<br/>study square uniqueness for double trigonometric series. By this we mean that if<br/>the sequence of square partial sums of a double trigonometric series converges to<br/>zero everywhere, then the series is necessarily the trivial series. If this is true, we<br/>will then try to generalize this result to higher dimensions. The corresponding<br/>statements for circular/spherical convergence have been shown by Shapiro in<br/>dimension 2 and by Bourgain in higher dimensions; and by Ash-Freiling-Rinne<br/>and, independently, Tetunashvili for the unrestrictedly rectangular convergence<br/>case in any dimension. There is some evidence that square uniqueness may<br/>actually be false. For example, there is an everywhere square convergent double<br/>trigonometric series with coefficients having faster than polynomial growth rate.<br/>Our second goal is to study a related question: uniqueness for multiple Walsh<br/>series under different types of summation modes. The new approach we will<br/>take is to use classical harmonic analysis methods. By combining the traditional<br/>martingale approach with the new techniques developed from recent progress<br/>made in the area of multiple trigonometric series, we expect much progress<br/>can be made here. This in turn may give insights into the square uniqueness<br/>question for trigonometric series. The third goal is to study the long standing<br/>open question about the pointwise circular convergence for Fourier series of<br/>square integrable functions. We will try to shed some light on this by studying<br/>the corresponding question for double Walsh series, which are special form of<br/>tree-index and two parameter martingales.<br/><br/>Almost any surface is composed of simpler ones by a process called multiple<br/>Fourier analysis. A major long standing problem in pure mathematics is to<br/>show that this construction can be accomplished in only one way. This is called<br/>the problem of uniqueness. There are about a half dozen main varieties of this<br/>problem depending on just how the simpler surfaces are combined to make the<br/>general surface. Gathering the simple surfaces in different orders may lead to<br/>different resultant surfaces. For certain gathering procedures, uniqueness has<br/>been proved. That is, for such gathering, there is only one way to produce<br/>the resultant surface. The most important gathering procedure for which the<br/>uniqueness remains an open question is called square convergence. We will try<br/>to determine if uniqueness holds for this procedure. Another way to construct a<br/>surface is to build it up as a combination of two dimensional oscillating square<br/>waves. Such a process is called a multiple Walsh series. We will consider the<br/>uniqueness question in this context also. We hope that understanding one of<br/>the two methods of construction may lead to insights about the other.<br/><br/>"

First, we will investigate the correspondence between (positive) asymptotic morphisms (which form the basic cycles in E-theory) and ""asymptotic"" projection-valued measures. This will help to understand the fundamental use of E-theory groups as receptacles for invariants of strict (physical) quantization schemes. This should also give novel formulas for writing asymptotic morphisms as operator-valued integrals, and for computing the pairing between K-homology and K-theory, e.g., in computing the index of a Dirac type operator coupled to a gauge connection. The second part deals with extending the work of Erik Guentner in using E-theory groups to understand the relationship between elliptic differential operators and strict quantization schemes, e.g., the relationship between the (E-theory elements of) the Dolbeault operator on a Kahler manifold and the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization on the associated Bergmann-Fock space.  The third part is a long-term project to develop an E-theoretic classification method for strict quantization schemes that parallels the cohomological classification in the formally algebraic (nonphysical) deformation quantization of star products.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to more thoroughly investigate the relationship between quantum physics and the operator algebraic E-theory of the Fields medalist Alain Connes and Nigel Higson. This mathematical theory associates classifying groups to pairs of operator algebras. Group elements are determined by objects called asymptotic morphisms between the two operator algebras. The relationship to quantum theory is as follows. Different types of structures are used in quantum theory to model subatomic and atomic systems, for example, Dirac operators coupled to a gauge field in quantum field theory, and operator-valued measures in operational quantum physics and quantum computing, etc. Under appropriate conditions, these structures have asymptotic morphisms associated to them (between the algebras of the classical observables and quantum observables, respectively). Hence, they define elements in an E-theory group. By fully understanding this correspondence, we want to show that computing these E-theory invariants provides a natural procedure for classifying, and defining obstructions for, diverse types of quantum-mechanical systems.<br/><br/>"

We are interested in the non-commutative version <br/>of the  Rosenthal/Burkholder inequality and Doob's maximal inequality. <br/>Maximal inequalities are also known as a useful tool in (stochastical) <br/>analysis. The more recent theory of operator spaces delivers the <br/>right framework for these investigations and reveals surprising <br/>properties of the non-commutative space of p-integrable functions <br/>associated to free groups. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Non-commutative probability provides  one possible framework <br/>for the probabilistic viewpoint in quantum mechanics. This theory<br/>combines fundamental concepts of algebraic nature with analytic<br/>insight and methods with roots in calculus.

It is most challenging to reveal or overcome <br/>substantial differences between the commutative and non-<br/>commutative theory.

Some of the problems of interest are inverse<br/>problems in anisotropic media. Mathematically, they lead to problems of<br/>recovering a Riemannian metric from boundary data or scattering data.

This work gave rise to a new paradigm in its <br/>field, and contributed to the birth of many modern branches of mathematics. An <br/>important question was and remains the n-body problem; the problem of stability<br/>of the motion of n planets in their mutual gravitational attraction. Indeed in <br/>the 1960's, 50 years after the death of Poincar'e, the development of a theory <br/>by three mathematicians, A.N. Kolmogorov, V.I. Arnold and J.

The study  of such operators has a long history and has led to much progress  in operator theory and complex analysis. For instance the  unilateral shift, which is modelled by multiplication by z on the  Hardy space of the unit disc, has been used to enhance our  knowledge of contraction operators. Other classes of operators  characterized by operator inequalities may be studied using  operators modelled by multiplication by z on other Hilbert spaces  of analytic functions. Such spaces have associated with them  evaluation functionals called reproducing kernels, and there is an  intimate connection between properties of such a kernel and  properties of the multiplication operators on the corresponding  space. An important classical example where this correspondence  has been exploited is Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation. Recent work of  several researchers has extended the applicability of the ideas  behind Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation and introduced other types of  inequalities on operators and reproducing kernels that seem to be  very fruitful. Richter and Sundberg will investigate the connection  between operator inequalities, reproducing kernels, and the  structure of the lattice of invariant subspaces of multiplication  operators.   <br/><br/>The proposed work involves ideas and problems from several areas  of pure and applied mathematics. Operator Theory, which may be  thought of as an infinite dimensional version of linear algebra, grew  out of ideas used to study certain partial differential equations  arising in physics in the 1800's, and became increasingly important  with the advent of Quantum Mechanics in the twentieth century.  Complex Analysis is a subject with a long and distinguished  history, and remains a very active and broad area of research.  These two areas have had a very fruitful interaction throughout this  century, owing to the fact that some interesting and useful  operators can be modelled by natural operations on spaces of  analytic functions. At least since the 1960's it has been realized  that a series of related results concerning certain of these  operators are of importance in the study of Control Theory, an area  of importance in electrical engineering and other practical  applications. Among these results are the Beurling-Lax Theorem   on invariant subspaces, the Nevanlinna-Pick Interpolation Theorem,  and its close relative the Commutant Lifting Theorem. Work by a  number of researchers since the 1980's has shown that the circle  of ideas concerned with these results are applicable to a much  wider class of objects than had previously been realized.

Wolf, U. C. Berkeley <br/><br/>The investigator proposes six intertwined research projects, all on the <br/>interface between group theory and geometry.  For the most part these <br/>proposals are geometrically motivated approaches to specific problems in <br/>modern harmonic analysis connected to the representation theory of <br/>semisimple Lie groups.  The first is an approach to construction and <br/>analysis of singular unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups,<br/>in two steps: (i) geometric construction of those representations, as Frechet <br/>space representations on cohomology of homogeneous vector bundles over <br/>flag domains, and (ii) transforming the representation space to a space of<br/>functions on a Stein manifold defined by a system of differential equations,<br/>by means of a double fibration transform (the complex Penrose <br/>transform is a particular case) from the flag domain to its linear cycle <br/>space.  The second project is an approach to construction and analysis of <br/>unitary and other representations for a class of infinite dimensional Lie <br/>groups, the direct limits of finite dimensional Lie groups, especially strict<br/>direct limits of finite dimensional real and complex reductive Lie groups,<br/>both in the analytic category and in the algebraic category.  The third<br/>project is to complete the investigator's work on the Harish-Chandra <br/>Schwartz space of a general semisimple Lie group, by synthesizing structural <br/>analyses of the relative Schwartz spaces.  The investigator's fourth project <br/>is to complete his development of a direct reading of the character and <br/>growth properties (asymptotics) of admissible representations of finite <br/>dimensional real reductive Lie groups from the basic data that specify their <br/>construction on cohomology spaces of homogeneous vector bundles<br/>over flag domains.  One goal here is to do this in such a way that is<br/>directly applicable to the first and second projects.  The fifth project<br/>is to continue some earlier work on control theory and numerical analysis, <br/>especially observation point placement problems and numerical quadrature <br/>schemes, based on structural results and a priori estimates that come out of<br/>the representation theory of real reductive Lie groups.  The sixth <br/>project, not directly analytic in nature, is to follow up on the investigator's<br/>recent discovery of a strange relation between isoclinic spheres in<br/>Grassmann manifolds, composition of quadratic forms, normal forms for <br/>spaces of antisymmetric bilinear forms, and the construction of flat<br/>homogeneous pseudo-riemannian manifolds.<br/><br/>These six research projects all depend on the use of symmetry to clarify<br/>analytic (and in one case geometric) problems.  Traditionally symmetry<br/>considerations are used to simplify matters by decreasing the number of<br/>variables, but here they are used to enable the use of insight, tools and<br/>results from geometry and analysis.  The symmetries are embodied in group <br/>theory, which in fact is the algebraic abstraction of the notion<br/>of symmetry.  But modern Lie group theory incorporates classical analysis<br/>(calculus, differential equations...) and is closely tied to the geometry<br/>(riemannian, symplectic, kaehler, ...)  of the spaces on which the groups<br/>act as symmetries.  An important aspect of this synthesis of <br/>geometry and analysis is a geometric form of quantization that is <br/>particularly well suited to the sorts of finite dimensional groups <br/>considered in several of the projects.  This geometric quantization, <br/>originally inspired by physics and developed in some detail by mathematicians, <br/>has in turn been very useful in a variety of settings in mathematics and <br/>physics.  This is very much the case in five of the six projects, where the <br/>geometric quantization is combined with modern differential geometry to<br/>understand various analytic problems.  This is especially evident in the first <br/>project, whose objective can be viewed as a sort of dequantization.<br/><br/>"

The main tool in the subject is <br/>Littlewood Paley theory, whose main message is that functions on <br/>Euclidean space should be decomposed into pieces whose frequency <br/>content lie in concentric shells around the origin. Passing to <br/>multilinear singular integrals one encounters the new phenomenon <br/>that these multilinear singular integrals have translation symmetries <br/>in frequency space. Therefore it doesnt suffice to study concentric <br/>shells around the origin, but one has to study shells around any <br/>point in frequency space. <br/><br/>Techniques have been develloped recently<br/>to control the interaction of shells around different points in<br/>frequency space, and the purpose of this project is to exploit and<br/>further devellope these techniques and therefore better understand <br/>multilinear singular integrals. Multilinear singular integrals appear<br/>for example in formal Taylor series of nonlinear operators, or as<br/>explicit correction terms in an iterative scheme.

The International Conferences on Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations have been during their five-year history an excellent platform for worldwide communication and interchange of ideas in the fields of Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations. This year, ten well-known mathematicians from six countries will give plenary lectures.  Fifteen top mathematicians have organized thirteen special sessions with more than 120 speakers. It is anticipated that more than two hundred mathematicians from more than thirty countries will participate in this conference, which also includes many contributed talks. The lectures will highlight current areas of research, and the participants will identify important problems for future investigation.<br/><br/>The subject of this conference is an area that has seen rapid expansion in the last two decades, partly due to the advancement of computational technology.  Differential equations provide the fundamental paradigm for mathematical models of motion, from weather phenomena and ariplane flight to the flow of blood through the human heart.  The theory of dynamical systems provides means to formulate and to understand the implications of models of such systems.  Together, the theories of dynamical systems and differential equations form the language of mathematics that is used to describe changes in the world around us.  This meeting will bring together leading established workers, junior researchers, and advanced graduate students to discuss the state of the art and to assess approaches to open problems.<br/>"

The <br/>fundamental assumption motivating this proposal is that complex <br/>methods have an important role to play in dynamics when the number of <br/>dimensions is greater than one as well.  The subject of this proposal <br/>is a particular ""model family"" of dynamical systems, the polynomial <br/>diffeomorphisms in two complex dimensions. The complex Henon <br/>diffeomorphisms which are a notable special case. These are perhaps <br/>the simplest invertible holomorphic dynamical system with interesting <br/>dynamics. One of the lessons of dynamics in one variable is that <br/>there is a range of dynamical behaviors starting with expanding maps <br/>and continuing with Misurewicz maps, semi-hyperbolic and <br/>Collet-Eckmann maps.  The two variable analog of the expanding <br/>property is hyperbolicity. This proposal is focused on understanding <br/>the two variable analog of the semi-hyperbolic condition which we <br/>call quasi-hyperbolicity. In one variable these conditions are <br/>related to the recurrence properties of critical points.  In two <br/>variables the notion of critical point needs to be replaced by other <br/>concepts such as regularity of stable and unstable manifolds. An <br/>interesting example of quasi-hyperbolic diffeomorphisms are real <br/>polynomial diffeomorphisms of maximal entropy such as limits of <br/>horseshoes in the real Henon case. Though several questions about the <br/>behavior of such diffeomorphisms have been answered in previous work <br/>a number of open questions remain.<br/><br/><br/>The introduction of the computer has increased the usefulness of <br/>simple deterministic mathematical models in a number of sciences. An <br/>illustrative example is the logistic map which can be used to <br/>describe the behavior of a single insect population in successive <br/>years.

When the model is non-linear there are <br/>important theoretical questions which we have not yet been able to <br/>address. Recently mathematicians have made important breakthroughs in <br/>understanding the logistic map. One technique which proved essential <br/>was the consideration of an associated complex dynamical system.

As an example I mention interplay between topology and analysis in the computation of  topological properties of a manifold. Another example involving number theory and topology and analysis can be found in the explanation of the leading analytic behavior of L-functions from number theory in terms of topological information from periods of topological cycles computed using harmonic analysis.<br/>Similar interdisciplinary research has been the main focus of recent research of the PI. Several projects have been concerned with the evaluation or determination of topological/geometrical properties of locally symmetric manifolds either with harmonic analysis techniques or through leading behaviour of geometric zeta functions. This theme continues in the present proposal. Joint projects have been begun to extend from Hermitian locally symmetric spaces to their ""real forms"" the construction of geometric zeta functions, and the identification of their leading behaviour in geometric terms. Part of this work involves developing refined information concerning various compatifications of symmetric spaces and then encapsulating it in a generating function of geometric origins. It is expected that torsion-like invariants will appear in this investigation but it is hoped that a better understanding of subtle characteristic classes like the R-class may result.   <br/>A new direction taken by the PI is toward nilpotent orbits in semisimple Lie algebras. An approach to an algebraic proof of the existence of hyperKahler metrics on these orbits is underway. Also a realization of the quantization of the minimal orbit by means of Dirac operators has been started. The use of techniques from twistor theory play an important role in these investigations. <br/><br/>"

The goal is to develop a general approach that will enable us to obtain results on the distribution of normalised return times in a wide variety of settings including non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. This extends to the return time distributions for the canonical invariant measure interval maps with parabolic points or for equilibrium states for rational maps which have critical points in the Julia set. We expect to obtain explicit error terms for the distribution of higher order returns of any order. Ultimately we hope to extend our approach to L-S Young's `tower construction' which originally was introduced to obtain rates on the decay of correlations.<br/><br/>This area of research is of interest to a wide variety of scientist. For instance experimentalists who want to do numerical simulations will benefit from the proposed problems which will assist them in developing more reliable ways to numerically analyse time series of chaotic dynamical systems. The proposed research can also serve to develop more efficient data compression algorithms since it quantifies the error in the number of times with which a newly coded sequence of symbols occurs from its predicted average value."

The Toda lattice can be solved explicitly as an integrable hamiltonian system, but the geometrical feature of the solutions has not been clarified. In Lie-theoretic terms, these toric varieties consist of closures of generic orbits of a split Cartan Subgroup acting on a real flag manifold of a semisimple Lie algebra. An interesting problem is then to describe, in detail, their structure, which has some similarities with the structure of real flag manifolds. The topology of these varieties is well-known in the complex case; however the real case poses new difficulties which have not been tackled before. Extensions of this main problem are also considered which include some Kac-Moody versions of the original problem, the full Kostant-Toda lattice and, in general, the structure of real flag manifolds.<br/><br/> The study of these toric varieties is physically motivated by the appearance of the indefinite (signed) Toda lattices in the context of symmetry reduction of the Wess-Zumino-Novikow-Witten (WZNW) model which is one of the most important model equation for conformal field theory. The toric varieties under Study can then be seen to give a concrete description of (an expected) regularization of the integral manifolds of these indefinite Toda lattices, where infinities (i.e. blow up points) of the solutions of these Toda systems glue everything into a smooth compact manifold. Also the study of isospectral manifolds of the Toda lattices is useful to understand the geometry of matrix eigenvalue algorithm based on QR or LU factorization. The present project will clarify a global aspect of the integrable systems"
